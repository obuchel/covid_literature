49,49,49,Epicatechins Purified from Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) Differentially Suppress Growth of Gender-Dependent Human Cancer Cell Lines,14.0077305,9.398813,2006-04-25,"The anticancer potential of catechins derived from green tea is not well understood, in part because catechin-related growth suppression and/or apoptosis appears to vary with the type and stage of malignancy as well as with the type of catechin. This in vitro study examined the biological effects of epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), EC 3-gallate (ECG) and EGC 3-gallate (EGCG) in cell lines from human gender-specific cancers. Cell lines developed from organ-confined (HH870) and metastatic (DU145) prostate cancer, and from moderately (HH450) and poorly differentiated (HH639) epithelial ovarian cancer were grown with or without EC, EGC, ECG or EGCG. When untreated cells reached confluency, viability and doubling time were measured for treated and untreated cells. Whereas EC treatment reduced proliferation of HH639 cells by 50%, EGCG suppressed proliferation of all cell lines by 50%. ECG was even more potent: it inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations of 24, 27, 29 and 30 µM, whereas EGCG inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations 89, 45, 62 and 42 µM. When compared with EGCG, ECG more effectively suppresses the growth of prostate cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines derived from tumors of patients with different stages of disease.","Ravindranath, Mepur H.; Saravanan, Thiruverkadu S.; Monteclaro, Clarence C.; Presser, Naftali; Ye, Xing; Selvan, Senthamil R.; Brosman, Stanley",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,40,8

The intrapulmonary administration of activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) in DAH was recently published in six patients by Heslet et al with an efficient hemostatic effect. We describe two cases of DAH treated with intrapulmonary rFVIIa. METHODS: Two cases of DAH were admitted to the ICU after presenting abrupt desaturation, tachypnea, cough and haemoptysis, requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis was achieved by the bloody return during the bronchoalveolar lavage, during the procedure rFVIIa (50 μg/Kg in 50 ml of isotonic saline) was administered via the bronchoscope. RESULTS: Immediate cessation of bleeding was observed. Prior to intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa, the FiO(2 )was 1, which was reduced to 0.4 24 hours later. Following the procedure, the haemostatic effect made blood transfusion superfluous. No thrombotic complications associated with administration of the drug were observed. After the intervention both cases progressed fast and was discharged from the ICU with no further episodes of bleeding. CONCLUSION: 1. Local intrabronchial deposition of DAH with rFVIIa has been shown to be effective in controlling life-threatening DAH. 2. In the case described above, no thrombotic complications were observed following the intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa.","Estella, Ángel; Jareño, Antonio; Perez-Bello Fontaiña, Luis",Cases J,40,0
586,586,586,Ceacam1 Separates Graft-versus-Host-Disease from Graft-versus-Tumor Activity after Experimental Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation,14.153939,9.771746,2011-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) is a potentially curative therapy for a variety of hematologic diseases, but benefits, including graft-versus-tumor (GVT) activity are limited by graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (Ceacam1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on epithelium, T cells, and many tumors. It regulates a variety of physiologic and pathological processes such as tumor biology, leukocyte activation, and energy homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that Ceacam1 negatively regulates inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease models. METHODS: We studied Ceacam1 as a regulator of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) in mouse models. In vivo, Ceacam1(−/−) T cells caused increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and greater numbers of donor T cells were positive for activation markers (CD25(hi), CD62L(lo)). Additionally, Ceacam1(−/−) CD8 T cells had greater expression of the gut-trafficking integrin α(4)β(7), though both CD4 and CD8 T cells were found increased numbers in the gut post-transplant. Ceacam1(−/−) recipients also experienced increased GVHD mortality and GVHD of the colon, and alloreactive T cells displayed increased activation. Additionally, Ceacam1(−/−) mice had increased mortality and decreased numbers of regenerating small intestinal crypts upon radiation exposure. Conversely, Ceacam1-overexpressing T cells caused attenuated target-organ and systemic GVHD, which correlated with decreased donor T cell numbers in target tissues, and mortality. Finally, graft-versus-tumor survival in a Ceacam1(+) lymphoma model was improved in animals receiving Ceacam1(−/−) vs. control T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Ceacam1 regulates T cell activation, GVHD target organ damage, and numbers of donor T cells in lymphoid organs and GVHD target tissues. In recipients of allo-BMT, Ceacam1 may also regulate tissue radiosensitivity. Because of its expression on both the donor graft and host tissues, this suggests that targeting Ceacam1 may represent a potent strategy for the regulation of GVHD and GVT after allogeneic transplantation.","Lu, Sydney X.; Kappel, Lucy W.; Charbonneau-Allard, Anne-Marie; Atallah, Renée; Holland, Amanda M.; Turbide, Claire; Hubbard, Vanessa M.; Rotolo, Jimmy A.; Smith, Marsinay; Suh, David; King, Christopher; Rao, Uttam K.; Yim, Nury; Bautista, Johanne L.; Jenq, Robert R.; Penack, Olaf; Na, Il-Kang; Liu, Chen; Murphy, George; Alpdogan, Onder; Blumberg, Richard S.; Macian, Fernando; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Beauchemin, Nicole; van den Brink, Marcel R.

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of Xiaoyaosan for depression. Search Strategy. Electronic databases were searched until December 2009. Inclusion Criteria. We included randomized clinical trials testing Xiaoyaosan against placebo, antidepressants, or combined with antidepressants against antidepressants alone. Data Extraction and Analyses. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results. 26 randomized trials (involving 1837 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that Xiaoyaosan combined with antidepressants was more effective in comprehensive effect, the score of HAMD and the score of SDS compared with antidepressants alone. Xiaoyaosan was superior to antidepressants for the score of HAMD. However, Xiaoyaosan was not different from placebo for the score of SDS. There was no adverse effects reported in the trials from Xiaoyaosan. Conclusions. Xiaoyaosan appears to be effective on improving symptoms in patients with depression. However, due to poor methodological quality in the majority of included trials, the potential benefit from Xiaoyaosan need to be confirmed in rigorous trials and the design and reporting of trials should follow international standards.","Zhang, Yuqing; Han, Mei; Liu, Zhijun; Wang, Jie; He, Qingyong; Liu, Jianping",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,40,22
911,911,911,Non-HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia: do conventional community-acquired pneumonia guidelines under estimate its severity?,14.320811,9.524903,2012-06-11,"BACKGROUND: Non-HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) can occur in immunosuppressed patients having malignancy or on immunosuppressive agents. To classify severity, the A-DROP scale proposed by the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), the CURB-65 score of the British Respiratory Society (BTS) and the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are widely used in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. To evaluate how correctly these conventional prognostic guidelines for CAP reflect the severity of non-HIV PCP, we retrospectively analyzed 21 patients with non-HIV PCP. METHODS: A total of 21 patients were diagnosed by conventional staining and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory samples with chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) findings. We compared the severity of 21 patients with PCP classified by A-DROP, CURB-65, and PSI. Also, patients’ characteristics, clinical pictures, laboratory results at first visit or admission and intervals from diagnosis to start of specific-PCP therapy were evaluated in both survivor and non-survivor groups. RESULTS: Based on A-DROP, 18 patients were classified as mild or moderate; respiratory failure developed in 15 of these 18 (83.3%), and 7/15 (46.7%) died. Based on CURB-65, 19 patients were classified as mild or moderate; respiratory failure developed in 16/19 (84.2%), and 8 of the 16 (50%) died. In contrast, PSI classified 14 as severe or extremely severe; all of the 14 (100%) developed respiratory failure and 8/14 (57.1%) died. There were no significant differences in laboratory results in these groups. The time between the initial visit and diagnosis, and the time between the initial visit and starting of specific-PCP therapy were statistically shorter in the survivor group than in the non-survivor group. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional prognostic guidelines for CAP could underestimate the severity of non-HIV PCP, resulting in a therapeutic delay resulting in high mortality. The most important factor to improve the mortality of non-HIV PCP is early diagnosis and starting of specific-PCP therapy as soon as possible.","Asai, Nobuhiro; Motojima, Shinji; Ohkuni, Yoshihiro; Matsunuma, Ryo; Nakasima, Kei; Iwasaki, Takuya; Nakashita, Tamao; Otsuka, Yoshihito; Kaneko, Norihiro",Multidiscip Respir Med,40,22

2373,2373,2373,IFN‐λ3 polymorphism indirectly influences NK cell phenotype and function during acute HCV infection,14.280038,9.706517,2016-08-16,INTRODUCTION: Polymorphisms in the type III interferon IFN‐λ3 and the killer cell immunoglobulin‐like receptor (KIR) genes controlling the activity of natural killer (NK) cells can predict spontaneous resolution of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We hypothesized that IFN‐λ3 polymorphism may modulate NK cell function during acute HCV. METHODS: We monitored the plasma levels of type III IFNs in relation to the phenotype and the function of NK cells in a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) during acute HCV infection with different outcomes. RESULTS: Early acute HCV was associated with high variability in type III IFNs plasma levels and the favorable IFN‐λ3 CC genotype was associated with higher viral loads. Reduced expression of Natural Killer Group Protein 2A (NKG2A) was associated with lower IFN‐λ3 plasma levels and the CC genotype. IFN‐γ production by NK cells was higher in individuals with the CC genotype during acute infection but this did not prevent viral persistence. IFN‐λ3 plasma levels did not correlate with function of NK cells and IFN‐λ3 prestimulation did not affect NK cell activation and function. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IFN‐λ3 polymorphism indirectly influences NK cell phenotype and function during acute HCV but other factors may act in concert to determine the outcome of the infection.,"Depla, Marion; Pelletier, Sandy; Bédard, Nathalie; Brunaud, Camille; Bruneau, Julie; Shoukry, Naglaa H.",Immun Inflamm Dis,40,8

Ischemia is a state of oxygen deprivation in tissues, whereas reperfusion is restoration of blood flow in ischemic tissues. Myocardial damage of tissue during reperfusion after ischemic insult is known as myocardial ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. It induces damage to cardiac muscle via increasing expression of oxygen, sodium and calcium ions which are responsible in the activation of proteases and cell death. Heart renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. Angiotensin (1–7) is responsible for vasodilation and angiotensin II for vasoconstriction. Here-in we reviewed how myocardial I/R injury sets in by up-regulation of angiotensin II that leads to increased infarct size, which can be reduced by the use of ACE inhibitors, ACE2 activators and angiotensin II antagonist.","Agrawal, Vimal; Gupta, Jeetendra Kumar; Qureshi, Shaiba Sana; Vishwakarma, Vishal Kumar",Indian Heart J,40,1

However, behaviors with/without risk perception on the control of influenza transmission among age groups have not been well quantified. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess to what extent, under scenarios of with/without control and preventive/protective behaviors, the age-specific network-driven risk perception influences influenza infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A behavior-influenza model was used to estimate the spread rate of age-specific risk perception in response to an influenza outbreak. A network-based information model was used to assess the effect of network-driven risk perception information transmission on influenza infection. A probabilistic risk model was used to assess the infection risk effect of risk perception with a health behavior change. RESULTS: The age-specific overlapping percentage was estimated to be 40%–43%, 55%–60%, and 19%–35% for child, teenage and adult, and elderly age groups, respectively. Individuals perceive the preventive behavior to improve risk perception information transmission among teenage and adult and elderly age groups, but not in the child age group. The population with perceived health behaviors could not effectively decrease the percentage of infection risk in the child age group, whereas for the elderly age group, the percentage of decrease in infection risk was more significant, with a 97.5th percentile estimate of 97%. CONCLUSION: The present integrated behavior-infection model can help health authorities in communicating health messages for an intertwined belief network in which health-seeking behavior plays a key role in controlling influenza infection.","You, Shu-Han; Chen, Szu-Chieh; Liao, Chung-Min",Infect Drug Resist,40,5

Viruses — such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus — are now recognised as important causes of respiratory disease in older children and adults in the developed world following the emergence of sensitive molecular diagnostic tests, recent severe viral epidemics, and the discovery of novel viruses. Few studies have comprehensively evaluated the viral aetiology of adult pneumonia in Africa, but it is likely to differ from Western settings due to varying seasonality and the high proportion of patients with immunosuppression and co-morbidities. Emerging data suggest a high prevalence of viral pathogens, as well as multiple viral and viral/bacterial infections in African adults with pneumonia. However, the interpretation of positive results from highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction tests can be challenging. Therapeutic and preventative options against viral respiratory infections are currently limited in the African setting.

The study aimed to report epidemiological data on respiratory viruses in a university-affiliated children's hospital. The study was a retrospective study conducted in a university affiliated children's hospital from 2016 May to 2017 April. The results of all nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples sent for the test for respiratory viruses (adenovirus, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus) were extracted from the electronic healthcare records. Clinical characteristics were compared between groups with positive versus negative results for respiratory viruses. Multivariable regression models were employed by including age, gender, type of sample (swab vs sputum), source (emergency department vs others), and season to explore the independent factors associated with positive results for respiratory viruses. A total of 34,961 samples were identified during the study period. A total of 3102 (8.9%) samples were positive for adenovirus, 2811 (8.0%) were positive for influenza A, 3460 (9.9%) were positive for influenza B, and 4527 (13.0%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. The positive rate of adenovirus was highest in April (50.8%), and lowest in November (3%). The absolute number of positive samples for adenovirus was highest in June (n = 587) and April (n = 544). For the test of influenza A, age was independently associated with positive result. With 1 year increase in age, the odds of positive result increased by 12% (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11–1.13; P < .001). As compared with the autumn, the summer showed significantly lower rate of positive for RSV (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.38–0.62; P < .001), whereas the winter had higher risk of positive result (OR: 3.88; 95% CI: 3.37–4.50; P < .001).

With international groups volunteering to join, the “APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC)” was formed in 2012, which continued to collect prospective ACLF patient data. Based on the prospective data analysis of nearly 1400 patients, the AARC consensus was published in 2014. In the past nearly four-and-a-half years, the AARC database has been enriched to about 5200 cases by major hepatology centers across Asia. The data published during the interim period were carefully analyzed and areas of contention and new developments in the field of ACLF were prioritized in a systematic manner. The AARC database was also approached for answering some of the issues where published data were limited, such as liver failure grading, its impact on the ‘Golden Therapeutic Window’, extrahepatic organ dysfunction and failure, development of sepsis, distinctive features of acute decompensation from ACLF and pediatric ACLF and the issues were analyzed. These initiatives concluded in a two-day meeting in October 2018 at New Delhi with finalization of the new AARC consensus. Only those statements, which were based on evidence using the Grade System and were unanimously recommended, were accepted. Finalized statements were again circulated to all the experts and subsequently presented at the AARC investigators meeting at the AASLD in November 2018. The suggestions from the experts were used to revise and finalize the consensus. After detailed deliberations and data analysis, the original definition of ACLF was found to withstand the test of time and be able to identify a homogenous group of patients presenting with liver failure. New management options including the algorithms for the management of coagulation disorders, renal replacement therapy, sepsis, variceal bleed, antivirals and criteria for liver transplantation for ACLF patients were proposed.

Neutrophils, along macrophages, are pivotal in the innate immune-driven liver IRI, whereas the effective neutrophil-targeting therapies remain to be established. In this review, we summarize progress in our appreciation of the neutrophil biology and discuss neutrophil-based therapeutic perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: New technological advances enable to accurately track neutrophil movements and help to understand molecular mechanisms in neutrophil function, such as selective recruitment to IR-stressed tissue, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, or reverse migration into circulation. In addition to pro-inflammatory and tissue-destructive functions, immune regulatory and tissue-repairing phenotype associated with distinct neutrophil subsets have been identified. SUMMARY: Newly recognized and therapeutically attractive neutrophil characteristics warrant comprehensive preclinical and clinical attention to target IRI in transplant recipients.","Nakamura, Kojiro; Kageyama, Shoichi; Kupiec-Weglinski, Jerzy W.",Curr Transplant Rep,40,1

This study reviewed literature pertaining to the evaluation/usage of POCTs in primary care, to investigate whether outcomes being reported reflect aspects previously demonstrated to be important for general practitioners (GPs) in the decision to implement a POCT in practice. METHODS: Scopus and Medline were searched to identify studies that evaluated a POCT in primary care. We identified abstracts and full‐texts consisting of applied studies (eg trials, simulations, observational studies) and qualitative studies (eg interviews, surveys). Data were extracted from the included studies, such as the type of study, the extent to which manufacturers were involved in the study, and the biomarker/assay measured by the test(s). Studies were evaluated to summarise the extent to which they reported on, amongst others, clinical utility, user‐friendliness, turnaround‐time and technical performance (aspects previously identified as important). RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 1398 publications, of which 125 met the inclusion criteria. From these studies, 83 POCTs across several disease areas (including cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism and respiratory‐tract‐infections) were identified. There was an inconsistency between what is reported in the studies and what GPs consider important. GPs perceive clinical utility as the most important aspect, yet this was rarely included explicitly in test evaluations in the literature, with only 8% of evaluations incorporating it in their analysis/discussion. CONCLUSIONS: This review showed that, despite the growing market and development of new POCTs, studies evaluating such tests fail to report on aspects that GPs find important. To ensure that an evaluation of a POCT is useful to primary care clinicians, future evaluations should not only focus on the technical performance aspects of a test, but also report on the aspects relating to the clinical utility and risks.","Lingervelder, Deon; Koffijberg, Hendrik; Kusters, Ron; IJzerman, Maarten J.",Int J Clin Pract,40,12

5249,5249,5249,Comparative gastroenterology,14.145028,9.325067,1978,"The pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection was studied in miniature swine piglets. The animals were inoculated orally with 2×10(7) plaque-forming units of porcine rotavirus (OSU strain). During the height of diarrhea, intestinal function was investigated byin vivo perfusion of a 30-cm segment of proximal jejunum and a 30-cm segment of distal ileum. Absorption of Na(+) and water decreased and 3-O-methylglucose transport was markedly reduced,P<0.01 compared to control animals. Mucosal lactase and sucrase levels were depressed in both the jejunum and ileum,P<0.001. Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity was significantly depressed only in the ileum,P<0.001. These changes were associated with a marked reduction in villous height, suggesting that the diarrhea could be an osmotic diarrhea due to nutrient (carbohydrate) malabsorption. Fresh stool samples were obtained and analyzed immediately for NA(+),K(+), osmolarity, glucose, and lactose; the osmotic gap was also determined. Stool osmolarity continually increased from 248±20 mosm/liter prior to inoculation to 348±20 mosm/liter at 75±1 hr postinoculation (P<0.005); the majority of the fecal osmotic gap could be accounted for by the amount of lactose present in the stools. Stool sodium increased from 34±6 mM prior to inoculation to a maximum of 65±4 mM at 53±1 hr postinoculation,P<0.001. There was no significant change in potassium concentration. The present investigation suggests that rotavirus-induced diarrhea is due to virus destruction of enterocytes lining the intestinal villi, thus reducing the mucosal surface area and important digestive enzymes. This destruction leads to an osmotic diarrhea due to nutrient (primarily carbohydrate) malabsorption. A possible contributing role of unopposed secretion from the crypt cannot be excluded from this study.","Graham, David Y.; Sackman, Jeffrey W.; Estes, Mary K.",Dig Dis Sci,40,1

No comprehensive report of encephalopathy exists for children, and the literature contains only a few for adults. We analyzed a large cohort of 405 pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT during a 10-year period and identified 26 patients (6.4%) who experienced encephalopathy. Identifiable causes of encephalopathy included infection (n=5), single or multiorgan failure (n=4), medication-related complications (n=3), nonconvulsive seizures (n=4), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n=2), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (n=2), and stroke (n=1). We were unable to identify the etiology of encephalopathy in five (19%) patients. The prognosis for pediatric patients with encephalopathy was poor: only four (15%) experienced complete neurologic recovery, and 10 (38%) patients experienced partial recovery with residual neurologic deficits. Nine (35%) patients with complete or partial recovery survive long term. A total of 17 patients died; one died of progressive encephalopathy, and 16 died of either relapse of primary disease or toxicity.

HFRS has become a serious public health problem in China. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of HFRS has not been completely clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and to further explore its potential roles in HFRS. The levels of serum DcR3 were measured by sandwich ELISA. We found serum DcR3 levels increased significantly, which reached peak value during the oliguric phase and in the critical group. Moreover, serum DcR3 levels were closely related to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and parameters reflecting kidney injury including BUN, creatinine (Cr) and proteinuria. This study indicates that high levels of serum DcR3 have associations with the disease stages, severity and degree of kidney damage. Meanwhile, our results suggest that DcR3 may play a dual role in HFRS pathogenesis. First, DcR3 is involved in the inflammatory cascade response resulting in capillary permeability and kidney injury in the early stage. Secondly, HTNV infection induced DcR3 expression at the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in anti-inflammatory response. Thus, a study of DcR3 is essential for a better understanding of HFRS pathogenesis.","Dong, Yanying; Shi, Dongsha; Li, Man; Dai, Pengfei; Wang, Xiangling; Xie, Ming",Intern Emerg Med,40,1

Methods: From May 1997 to May 2001, 65 patients underwent surgical debulking and PDT as part of an ongoing phase II trial for disseminated IP cancer. Perioperative data were reviewed retrospectively, and statistical analyses were performed to determine whether any identifiable factors were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation for longer than 1 day and with the occurrence of postoperative complications. Results: Forty-three women and 22 men (mean age, 49 years) were treated. Operative time averaged 9.8 hours, and mean estimated blood loss was 1450 mL. The mean crystalloid requirement for the first 48 hours after surgery was 29.3 L, and 49 patients required blood products. Twenty-four patients were intubated for longer than 24 hours, with a mean of 8.3 days for those intubated longer than 1 day. The median ICU stay was 4 days. Overall, 110 complications developed in 45 (69%) of the 65 patients. Significant complications included 6 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 28 patients with infectious complications, and 4 patients with anastomotic complications. Statistical analyses revealed that surgery-related factors were significantly associated with these complication outcomes. Conclusions: Patients who undergo surgical debulking and IP PDT develop a significant capillary-leak syndrome after surgery that necessitates massive volume resuscitation, careful ICU monitoring, and, frequently, prolonged ventilatory support.","Canter, Robert J.; Mick, Rosemarie; Kesmodel, Susan B.; Raz, Dan J.; Spitz, Francis R.; Metz, James M.; Glatstein, Eli J.; Hahn, Stephen M.; Fraker, Douglas L.",Ann Surg Oncol,40,17

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) has approved the drug Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) produced by carrot cells for treatment of type 1 Gaucher’s disease in 2012. The commercial potential of biomedicines produced by molecular farming has dramatically improved due to the success of an experimental drug called ZMapp, which has immunological activity in Ebola patients. A cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies was produced in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants (Chen and Davis 2016). At present, very few drugs made by this technology have been approved by worldwide authorities such as the U.S. FDA. However, plants have been proposed as a novel paradigm for commercial production of proteins over the next decade. In recent years, leading researchers on molecular farming have given more priority to the area of animal-free therapeutic proteins such as parenteral and oral vaccines. Although plant-based platforms have considerable advantages over traditional systems such as bacterial and animal systems, there are several obstacles to commercial-scale production, especially with regards to improving the quality and quantity of plant-produced biologics and industrial materials. One of the biggest barriers to commercialization of this technology is the intense scrutiny of these new plant varieties by regulatory agencies and the public as well as the high costs associated with their regulatory approval.","Park, Ky Young; Wi, Soo Jin",J Plant Biol,40,1

Influenza A virus infection evolves into a severe respiratory failure in some young adult patients, related to an exaggerated inflammatory response. Mortality rates remain high despite antiviral treatment and aggressive respiratory support. The influenza A virus (IAV) infection will induce a proinflammatory innate immune response through recognition of viral RNA by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) molecules by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB route). Anti-inflammatory therapies focused on modulating this inflammatory response to “all patients” have not been satisfactory. Steroids should be avoided because they do not improve survival and promote superinfections. Since clinical judgment has often been proven inadequate, interest in the use of biomarkers to monitor host response and to assess severity and complications is growing. It is well known that, if used appropriately, these can be helpful tools to predict not only severity but also mortality. We need more biomarkers that predict host response: it is time to change lactate measurement to proteomics and transcriptomics. Theranostics describes an approach covering both diagnosis and coupled therapy. Death is usually a fatal complication of a dysregulated immune response more than the acute virulence of the infectious agent. Future research demonstrating the usefulness of adjunctive therapy in a subset of critically ill patients with IAV pneumonia is an unmet clinical need.","Valenzuela-Sánchez, F.; Valenzuela-Méndez, B.; Rodríguez-Gutiérrez, J.

The present work addressed the effects of IDPN on tasks requiring the use of spatial information. Separate groups of male rats were dosed with IDPN (IP, in 1 ml/kg saline) for 3 consecutive days and tested in the following procedures: (a) step-through passive avoidance conditioning (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day); (b) Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition and retention (0, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg/kg/day); (c) radial arm maze (RAM) acquisition (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (d) RAM steady-state performance (0, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (e) repeated acquisition in the RAM (0, and 200 mg/kg/day). The vestibular toxicity of IDPN resulted in alterations in spontaneous behavior or swimming deficits in 5 of 8 rats treated with 175 mg/kg/day and in all the animals dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. IDPN increased step-through PA latencies at 200 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses. In the MWM, no performance deficits were observed at the dose levels preserving the swimming ability of the animals. In both the acquisition and the steady-state RAM tasks, IDPN (400 mg/kg/day) induced an increase in both choice errors and perseverative errors. In the RAM repeated acquisition paradigm, IDPN (200 mg/kg/day) induced performance deficits that included a decreased rate of within-session reduction in errors. The present data show that IDPN disrupts performance of tasks requiring spatial learning and memory and indicate that these deficits can be in part caused by an acquisition deficit.","Llorens, Jordi; Crofton, Kevin M.; Peele, David B.",Neurotoxicol Teratol,40,1

Since the 1970s, PED outbreaks have become a source of problems in pig producing countries all over the world, causing large economic losses for pig producers. Although the infection in adults is not fatal, in naïve suckling piglets mortality is close to 100%. In this study, we investigated genome‐wide differences between dead and recovered suckling piglets from commercial farms after PED outbreaks. Samples from 262 animals (156 dead and 106 recovered) belonging to several commercial lines were collected from five different farms in three different countries (USA, Canada and Germany) and genotyped with the porcine 80K SNP chip. Mean F (st) value was calculated in 1‐Mb non‐overlapping windows between dead and recovered individuals, and the results were normalized to find differences within the comparison. Seven windows with high divergence between dead and recovered were detected—five on chromosome 2, one on chromosome 4 and one on chromosome 15—in total encompassing 152 genes. Several of these genes are either under‐ or overexpressed in many virus infections, including Coronaviridae (such as SARS‐CoV). A total of 32 genes are included in one or more Gene Ontology terms that can be related to PED development, such as Golgi apparatus, as well as mechanisms generally linked to resilience or diarrhea development (cell proliferation, ion transport, ATPase activity). Taken together this information provides a first genomic picture of PEDV resilience in suckling piglets.","Bertolini, F.; Harding, J. C. S.; Mote, B.; Ladinig, A.; Plastow, G. S.; Rothschild, M.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross‐sectional study of non‐smoking, asthmatic adults in Scotland was to determine the correlation between the results from a standard spirometry test, forced expiratory volume in one‐second percent (FEV (1)%), and quantitative estimates of some biological exposures. METHODS: A population (n = 55) of non‐smoking, adult asthmatics in Scotland was included in this study and each completed a questionnaire that allowed the determination of the Asthma Control Questionnaire scores (ACQ) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores (SGRQ), as well as corticosteroid use. Spirometry testing was completed and the pre‐bronchodilator FEV (1)% value calculated. At about the same time, floor dust samples were collected in the living room and in the bedroom. These dust samples were analysed for mould contamination, as described by the Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values and by (1, 3)‐β‐D‐glucan concentrations, for endotoxin, and for dust mite, cat, and dog allergen concentrations. The asthmatics' FEV (1)% values were tested for correlation (Pearson) to questionnaire‐based estimates of health. Also, each biological exposure was tested for correlation (Pearson) to the FEV (1)% values. RESULTS: FEV (1)% results were correlated with ACQ scores (ρ −0.586, P < 0.001), SGRQ scores (ρ −0.313, P = 0.020), and weakly with corticosteroid use (ρ −0.221, P = 0.105). The ERMI values in the homes (average 5.3) were significantly correlated with FEV (1)% values (ρ −0.378, P = 0.004). There was no correlation between FEV (1)% and concentrations of endotoxin, (1, 3)‐β‐D‐glucan, or any of the allergens. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although these results do not prove that mould exposures caused the deficit in lung function observed in this study, it might be advisable for asthmatics to avoid high ERMI environments.","McSharry, C.; Vesper, S.; Wymer, L.; Howieson, S.; Chaudhuri, R.; Wright, G.

We included 44 consecutive, adult, patients, who were scheduled for weaning after at least 48 h of invasive mechanical ventilation in this prospective observational study. Weaning failure was defined as failed SBT or reintubation within 48 h of extubation. PPI readings were obtained before initiation of the SBT, and every 5 min till the end of the SBT. PPI ratio was calculated at every time point as: PPI value/ baseline PPI. The primary outcome was the accuracy of PPI ratio at the end of the SBT in detecting failed weaning. Forty-three patients were available for the final analysis. Eighteen patients (42%) were considered failed weaning. PPI ratio was higher in patients with successful weaning compared to patients with failed weaning during the last 15 min of the SBT. PPI ratio at the end of SBT was higher in patients with successful weaning compared to patients with failed weaning. PPI ratio at the end of SBT had good predictive ability for weaning failure {area under receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval): 0.833(0.688–0.929), cutoff value ≤ 1.41}. The change in PPI during SBT is an independent predictor for re-intubation. PPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the patient response to SBT. Patients with successful weaning showed higher augmentation of PPI during the SBT compared to re-intubated patients.

METHODS: Ninety-two patients and 92 age- and gender-matched healthy controls received adjuvant-free influenza A/California/7/2009 (pH1N1) vaccine. Blood samples were collected immediately before and 3 weeks after vaccination to evaluate antibody responses to the H1N1 virus. Efficacy was assessed by seroprotection (SP) and seroconversion (SC) rates and the factor increase in geometric mean antibody titre. Participants received a 21-day symptom diary card and were instructed to report local and systemic adverse events. RESULTS: SSc patients were predominantly females (91%) and 61% had limited SSc, 12% had severe skin involvement and 57.6% were on immunosuppressive (IS) therapy. SSc patients and controls presented comparable overall SP (P = 0.20) and SC (P = 0.61) rates. Further evaluation of the possible effect of disease and therapy revealed similar rates of SP and SC in patients with dcSSc vs lcSSc (SP P = 0.62 and SC P = 0.66), severe vs mild/moderate skin involvement (SP P = 1 and SC P = 0.45) and with vs without IS (SP P = 0.26 and SC P = 0.10). The frequency of mild local and minor systemic reactions was similar in patients with dcSSC vs lcSSc (P = 0.70 vs 0.32) and in those with and without severe skin involvement (P = 0.59 vs 0.28). CONCLUSION: The non-adjuvanted influenza H1N1 virus vaccine proved to be safe and effective, independent of SSc clinical subtype, disease severity or therapy. These latter factors do not seem to contribute to mild adverse events observed in SSc. Our data support the annual influenza vaccination recommendation for these patients.

METHODS: We developed a spreadsheet-based, decision tree model to assess outcomes averted and cost-effectiveness of antiviral treatment for outpatient use from the perspective of the healthcare payer in the UK. We defined five pandemic scenarios—one based on the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic and four hypothetical scenarios varying in measures of transmissibility and severity. RESULTS: Community-based antiviral treatment was estimated to avert 14–23% of hospitalizations in an overall population of 62.28 million. Higher proportions of averted outcomes were seen in patients with high-risk conditions, when compared to non-high-risk patients. We found that antiviral treatment was cost-saving across pandemic scenarios for high-risk population groups, and cost-saving for the overall population in higher severity influenza pandemics. Antiviral effectiveness had the greatest influence on both the number of hospitalizations averted and on cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that across pandemic scenarios, antiviral treatment can be cost-saving for population groups at high risk of influenza-related complications.","Venkatesan, Sudhir; Carias, Cristina; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Campbell, Angela P; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S; Kahn, Emily; Myles, Puja R; Meltzer, Martin I",J Public Health (Oxf),40,22

We investigated the effect of dual sensory impairment (difficulty seeing and hearing) in a large representative sample of Spanish adults. METHODS: Data from a total of 23,089 adults (age range: 15–103 years, 45.9% men) from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 were analyzed. Self-reported difficulty of seeing and hearing (exposures), and depression and chronic anxiety (outcomes) were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was assessed for difficulty with vision alone, hearing alone and with difficulty with both, adjusting for gender, age, marital status, living as a couple, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, use of glasses/contact lenses, and hearing aid. RESULTS: Visual difficulty, hearing difficulty, and dual difficulties were all associated with significantly higher odds for depression (ORs 2.367, 2.098, and 3.852, respectively) and for chronic anxiety (ORs 1.983, 1.942, and 3.385, respectively). Dual sensory difficulty was associated with higher odds ratios for depression and anxiety when compared to either impairment alone. CONCLUSION: Dual sensory difficulty is associated with significantly higher odds of anxiety and depression when compared to either vision or hearing difficulty alone.

Herein, it is shown that when blood‐pressure‐ratio (BPR) reaches the lower‐critical‐hemorrhage‐index (LCHI) internal‐flow‐choking and shock wave generation can occur in the cardiovascular‐system, with sudden expansion/divergence/vasospasm or bifurcation regions, without prejudice to the percutaneous‐coronary‐intervention (PCI). Analytical findings reveal that the relatively high and the low blood‐viscosity are cardiovascular‐risk factors. In vitro studies have shown that nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide gases are dominant in fresh blood samples of humans/guinea pigs at a temperature range of 98.6–104 F. An in silico study demonstrated the Sanal flow choking phenomenon leading to shock‐wave generation and pressure‐overshoot in the cardiovascular‐system. It has been established that disproportionate blood‐thinning treatment increases the risk of the internal‐flow‐choking due to the enhanced boundary‐layer‐blockage‐factor, resulting from an increase in flow‐turbulence level in the cardiovascular‐system, caused by an increase in Reynolds number as a consequence of low blood‐viscosity. The cardiovascular‐risk can be diminished by concurrently lessening the viscosity of biofluid/blood and flow‐turbulence by raising the thermal‐tolerance‐level in terms of blood‐heat‐capacity‐ratio (BHCR) and/or by decreasing the systolic‐to‐diastolic blood‐pressure‐ratio.","Kumar, Valsalayam Raghavapanicker Sanal; Choudhary, Shiv Kumar; Radhakrishnan, Pradeep Kumar; Bharath, Rajaghatta Sundararam; Chandrasekaran, Nichith; Sankar, Vigneshwaran; Sukumaran, Ajith; Oommen, Charlie",Glob Chall,40,8

Approximately 75–85% of primary liver cancers are caused by HCC. Uncovering novel genes with prognostic significance would shed light on improving the HCC patient’s outcome. OBJECTIVE: In this research, we aim to identify novel prognostic biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: Integrated proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were performed to investigate the expression landscape of prognostic biomarkers in 24 paired HCC patients. RESULTS: As a result, eight key genes related to prognosis, including ACADS, HSD17B13, PON3, AMDHD1, CYP2C8, CYP4A11, SLC27A5, CYP2E1, were identified by comparing the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), proteomic differentially expressed genes (DEGs), proteomic turquoise module, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort DEGs of HCC. Furthermore, we trained and validated eight pivotal genes integrating these independent clinical variables into a nomogram with superior accuracy in predicting progression events, and their lower expression was associated with a higher stage/risk score. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further revealed that these key genes showed enrichment in the HCC regulatory pathway. CONCLUSION: All in all, we found that these eight genes might be the novel potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC and also provide promising insights into the pathogenesis of HCC at the molecular level.","Zhang, Qifan; Xiao, Zhen; Sun, Shibo; Wang, Kai; Qian, Jianping; Cui, Zhonglin; Tao, Tao; Zhou, Jie",Cancer Manag Res,40,1

Malaria diagnosis is routinely performed by microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in the field settings; however, their performance may vary across regions, age and asymptomatic status. Owing to this, we assessed the diagnostic performance of conventional and advanced molecular tools for malaria detection in low and high malaria-endemic settings. We performed mass blood surveys in low and high endemic regions of two North-Eastern districts from the states of Assam and Meghalaya. A total of 3322 individuals were screened for malaria using RDT, microscopy and PCR and measures of diagnostic accuracy were estimated. Out of 3322 individuals, 649 (19.5%) were detected with malaria parasite. Asymptomatic were 86.4% (2872/3322), of which 19.4% (557/2872) had Plasmodium infection. The sensitivity and specificity of microscopy were 42.7% and 99.3%, and RDT showed 49.9% and 90.4%, respectively, considering PCR as standard. RDT (AUC: 0.65 vs 0.74; p = 0.001) and microscopy (AUC: 0.64 vs 0.76; p < 0.0001) performances were significantly lower in low compared to high endemic areas. True positive rate was lower in asymptomatics but true negative rate was found similar to symptomatic individuals. The conventional diagnostic tools (RDT and microscopy) had detected malaria in children with nearly twofold greater sensitivity than in the adults (p < 0.05). To conclude, asymptomatics, adults and low malaria-endemic regions require major attention due to mediocre performance of conventional diagnostic tools in malaria detection.","Shankar, Hari; Singh, Mrigendra Pal; Phookan, Sobhan; Singh, Kuldeep; Mishra, Neelima",Parasitol Res,40,3

Despite the oncological benefit, cancer survivors are exposed to short- and long-term adverse cardiovascular toxicities associated with anticancer therapies. Systemic hypertension, the most common comorbidity among cancer patients, is a major contributor to the increased risk for developing these adverse cardiovascular events. Cancer and hypertension have common risk factors, have overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms and hypertension may also be a risk factor for some tumor types. Many cancer therapies have prohypertensive effects. Although some of the mechanisms by which these antineoplastic agents lead to hypertension have been characterized, further preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate the exact pathophysiology and the optimal management of hypertension associated with anticancer therapy. In this way, monitoring and management of hypertension before, during, and after cancer treatment can be improved to minimize cardiovascular risks. This is vital to optimize cardiovascular health in patients with cancer and survivors, and to ensure that advances in terms of cancer survivorship do not come at the expense of increased cardiovascular toxicities.","van Dorst, Daan C.H.; Dobbin, Stephen J.H.; Neves, Karla B.; Herrmann, Joerg; Herrmann, Sandra M.; Versmissen, Jorie; Mathijssen, Ron H.J.; Danser, A.H.

The purpose of this study is to extensively figure out the influence of immune-related genes of tumors on the prognosis of patients with ccRCC. METHODS: Files containing 2498 immune-related genes were obtained from the Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort), and the transcriptome data and clinical information relevant to patients with ccRCC were identified and downloaded from the TCGA data-base. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen out prognostic immune genes. The immune risk score model was established in light of the regression coefficient between survival and hub immune-related genes. We eventually set up a nomogram for the prediction of the overall survival for ccRCC. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and ROC curve was used in evaluating the value of the predictive risk model. A P value of < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences throughout data analysis. RESULTS: Via differential analysis, we found that 556 immune-related genes were expressed differentially between tumor and normal tissues (p < 0. 05). The analysis of univariate Cox regression exhibited that there was a statistical correlation between 43 immune genes and survival risk in patients with ccRCC (p < 0.05). Through Lasso-Cox regression analysis, we established an immune genetic risk scoring model based on 18 immune-related genes. The high-risk group showed a bad prognosis in K-M analysis. (p < 0.001). ROC curve showed that it was reliable of the immune risk score model to predict survival risk (5 year over survival, AUC = 0.802). The model indicated satisfactory AUC and survival correlation in the validation data set (5 year OS, Area Under Curve = 0.705, p < 0.05). From Multivariate regression analysis, the immune-risk score model plays an isolated role in the prediction of the prognosis of ccRCC. Under multivariate-Cox regression analysis, we set up a nomogram for comprehensive prediction of ccRCC patients’ survival rate. At last, it was identified that 18 immune-related genes and risk scores were not only tremendously related to clinical prognosis but also contained in a variety of carcinogenic pathways. CONCLUSION: In general, tumor immune-related genes play essential roles in ccRCC development and progression. Our research established an unequal 18-immune gene risk index to predict the prognosis of ccRCC visually. This index was found to be an independent predictive factor for ccRCC.

This paper presents a systematic review of the existing literature and reports on a large case series comparing implant fractures between the Exeter V40 series; 125 mm and conventional length stem systems. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. In parallel, we performed a retrospective single centre study of Exeter V40 femoral stem prosthetic fractures between April 2003 and June 2020. RESULTS: There are 25 reported cases of such prosthetic fractures confined to small case series and case reports within the literature. We report an additional 19 cases to the literature (mean age 66.3 years (SD 11.7); 12 (63%) females; BMI 32.9 kg/m(2) (SD 5.9)). The mean time from index procedure to fracture was 7.8 years (SD 3.6; 2.5 to 16.3). Exeter V40 stem fracture incidence was 0.15% and 1.21% for primary and revision arthroplasty, respectively. Incidence was significantly higher in revision arthroplasty (p < 0.001) and 125 mm length stems compared to ≥ 150 mm length stems (1.25% vs 0.13%, respectively; p < 0.001). When comparing different stem length cohorts, 125 mm short-stems were associated with stem-body fractures (92% vs 29%; p = 0.0095), earlier time to fracture (6.2 years vs 11.0 years; p = 0.0018), younger patient age at time of fracture (62.7 years vs 72.6 years; p = 0.037), and female sex (75% vs 43%; p = 0.326). CONCLUSION: This complication remains rare, although we report a significantly higher incidence at up to 17 years follow-up than in the literature. Short 125 mm length Exeter V40 stems undoubtedly have a role in restoring anatomy and biomechanics in smaller femoral geometries, although the surgeon has to appreciate the higher risk of stem fracture and the associated predisposing factors which may necessitate particular attention to surgical technique and planning.

ETS-domain containing protein (Elk1) and Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 are involved in VILI, but the roles have not been fully elucidated. This study examined the mechanisms of the activation of MMP-9 and Elk1 regulating barrier function in VILI in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: For the in vitro study, Mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) were pre-treated with Elk1 siRNA or MMP-9 siRNA for 48 h prior to cyclic stretch at 20% for 4 h. For the in vivo study, C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated with Elk1 siRNA or MMP-9 siRNA for 72 h prior to 4 h of mechanical ventilation. The expressions of Elk1, MMP-9, Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), E-cadherin, and occludin were measured by Western blotting. The intracellular distribution of E-cadherin and occludin was shown by immunofluorescence. The degree of pulmonary edema and lung injury were evaluated by Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining, lung injury scores, Wet/Dry (W/D) weight ratio, total cell counts, and Evans blue dye. RESULTS: 20% cyclic stretch and high tidal volume increases the expressions of Elk1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1, increases the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1, decreases the E-cadherin and occludin level. Elk1 siRNA or MMP-9 siRNA reverses the degradations of E-cadherin, occludin, and the ratio of MMP-9/TIMP-1 caused by cyclic stretch. Elk1 siRNA decreases the MMP-9 level with or not 20% cyclic stretch and high tidal volume. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate mechanical stretch damages the tight junctions and aggravates the permeability in VILI, Elk1 plays an important role in affecting the tight junctions and permeability by regulating the balance of MMP-9 and TIMP-1, thus indicating the therapeutic potential of Elk1 to treat VILI.","Tao, Zhao; Jie, Yan; Mingru, Zhang; Changping, Gu; Fan, Yang; Haifeng, Wu; Yuelan, Wang",Respir Res,40,13

These domains are able to recognize a wide variety of natural targets and, among the PDZ partners, viruses have been discovered to interact with their host via a PDZ domain. With such an array of relevant and diverse interactions, PDZ binding specificity has been thoroughly studied and a traditional classification has grouped PDZ domains in three major specificity classes. In this work, we have selected four human PDZ domains covering the three canonical specificity-class binding mode and a set of their corresponding binders, including host/natural, viral and designed PDZ motifs. Through calorimetric techniques, we have covered the entire cross interactions between the selected PDZ domains and partners. The results indicate a rather basic specificity in each PDZ domain, with two of the domains that bind their cognate and some non-cognate ligands and the two other domains that basically bind their cognate partners. On the other hand, the host partners mostly bind their corresponding PDZ domain and, interestingly, the viral ligands are able to bind most of the studied PDZ domains, even those not previously described. Some viruses may have evolved to use of the ability of the PDZ fold to bind multiple targets, with resulting affinities for the virus–host interactions that are, in some cases, higher than for host–host interactions.","Cobos, Eva S.; Sánchez, Ignacio E.; Chemes, Lucía B.; Martinez, Jose C.; Murciano-Calles, Javier",Biomolecules,40,1

Of these, 45 related to coronary disease or percutaneous coronary intervention, 28 related to devices, arrhythmia, and electrophysiology, 24 related to heart failure, transplant, and mechanical support, 21 related to structural heart disease, 21 related to congenital heart disease, and 16 related to cardiac surgery. Enrollment was procedure-based in 60% and disease-based in 40%. A total of 73.10 million patients were estimated to have been enrolled in cardiac registries. Quality scoring was performed using a validated registry grading system, with registries performing best in the use of explicit variable definitions and worst in assessment of data reliability. Higher quality scores were associated with government funding, mandated enrollment, linkage to other registries, and outcome risk adjustment. Quality scores and number of registries within a country were positively correlated with each other and with measures of national economic output, health expenditure, and urbanization. CONCLUSIONS: There has been remarkable growth in the uptake of national cardiac registries across the last few decades. However, the quality of processes used to ensure data completeness and accuracy remain variable and few countries have integrated registries covering multiple subspecialty domains. Clinicians, funders, and health policymakers should be encouraged to focus on the range, quality, and integration of these registries.

Calcitriol, vitamin D(3)’s most active metabolite, has been involved in blood pressure regulation and prevention of UTIs, partially through modulating vasoactive peptides and antimicrobial peptides, like cathelicidin. However, nothing is known regarding the interplay between placental calcitriol, cathelicidin, and maternal blood pressure in UTI-complicated pregnancies. Here, we analyzed the correlation between these parameters in pregnant women with UTI and with normal pregnancy (NP). Umbilical venous serum calcitriol and its precursor calcidiol were significantly elevated in UTI. Regardless of newborn’s sex, we found strong negative correlations between calcitriol and maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the UTI cohort (p < 0.002). In NP, this relationship was observed only in female-carrying mothers. UTI-female placentas showed higher expression of cathelicidin and CYP27B1, the calcitriol activating-enzyme, compared to male and NP samples. Accordingly, cord-serum calcitriol from UTI-female neonates negatively correlated with maternal bacteriuria. Cathelicidin gene expression positively correlated with gestational age in UTI and with newborn anthropometric parameters. Our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency might predispose to maternal cardiovascular risk and perinatal infections especially in male-carrying pregnancies, probably due to lower placental CYP27B1 and cathelicidin expression.","Olmos-Ortiz, Andrea; Olivares-Huerta, Alberto; García-Quiroz, Janice; Avila, Euclides; Halhali, Ali; Quesada-Reyna, Braulio; Larrea, Fernando; Zaga-Clavellina, Verónica; Díaz, Lorenza",Nutrients,40,22

Coaching, broadly accepted as a training modality in medical education, has been proven a successful tool for teaching communication skills. Little research is available thus far to investigate virtual coaching on communication skills for telemedicine encounters. The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that virtually coaching residents on communication skills is feasible and acceptable. We surveyed 21 resident-faculty pairs participating in a “fully virtual” coaching session (patient, coach, and resident were virtual). METHODS: We asked 50 neurology resident-faculty coach pairs to complete one “fully virtual” coaching session between May 20 and August 31, 2020. After each session, the resident and coach completed a 15-item survey, including Likert-style scale and open-ended questions, assessing feasibility and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content and thematic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Forty-two percent (21/50) of all eligible residents completed “fully virtual” coaching sessions. The overall survey response rate was 91 % (38/42). The majority of respondents agreed that the direct observation and debriefing conversation were easy to schedule and occurred without technical difficulties and that debriefing elements (self-reflection, feedback, takeaways) were useful for residents. Ninety-five percent of respondents rated the coach’s virtual presence to be not at all disruptive to the resident-patient interaction. Virtual coaching alleviated resident stress associated with observation and was perceived as an opportunity for immediate feedback and a unique approach for resident education that will persist into the future. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, residents and faculty coaches found virtual coaching on communication skills feasible and acceptable for telemedicine encounters. Many elements of our intervention may be adoptable by other residency programs. For example, residents may share their communication goals with clinic faculty supervisors and then invite them to directly observe virtual encounters what could facilitate targeted feedback related to the resident’s goals. Moreover, virtual coaching on communication skills in both the in-person and telemedicine settings may particularly benefit residents in challenging encounters such as those with cognitively impaired patients or with surrogate decision-makers.

This study investigated the preferences of Chinese medical students regarding the teaching strategies used by instructors and their relationship with course difficulty level, student’s academic performance, and perceived effectiveness. Survey data (n = 375) were collected from the medical students from one of the largest medical schools in Southern China during the spring semester of 2020. First, exploratory factor analysis demonstrated that there were three latent factors behind online teaching strategies, including teacher-led instructional strategies, supervised and monitored learning strategies, and self-directed learning strategies. Instructional activities under teacher supervision and monitoring received the highest rating while teacher-led strategies received the lowest ratings. Second, the popularity of the three online instructional strategies we have identified was positively associated with students’ perceived effectiveness of online teaching and their self-reported academic performance. Third, analysis of the quantified answers to the open-ended question reported a positive association between the perceived difficulty level of the courses and students’ preference of teacher-led strategies. It also manifested a positive correlation between perceived effectiveness level of the online teaching and the use of self-directed learning strategies before their online lectures. Further implications of the findings are fully discussed.","Cheng, Xin; Ma, Xin-Yue; Luo, Chaohua; Chen, Jian; Wei, Wei; Yang, Xuesong",Adv Physiol Educ,40,1

A vaccination campaign was implemented. Numerous vaccine-associated rash illnesses (VARI) were detected. VARI is non-contagious, but difficult to distinguish from measles clinically. Often, public health control measures need to be implemented before wild-type measles can be differentiated from VARI by viral genotyping. We compared clinical characteristics of VARI and confirmed measles cases to inform testing practices. METHODS: We defined measles cases per the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. VARI was defined as a rash occurring in a person within 21 days after receipt of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and in whom a measles vaccine strain (genotype A) was detected in naso/oro- pharyngeal swab or urine samples. Minnesota’s immunization information system monitored MMR doses administered. We collected clinical information through routine case investigation. RESULTS: Over 42,000 MMR doses above expected were administered during the outbreak. We identified 71 measles cases and 30 VARI. The median age of VARI patients was 1.2 years (range 10 months–48 years) and for measles cases 2.8 years (range 3 months–57 years). VARI diagnosis increased with rising MMR administration (figure); rash onset occurred a median of 11 (range 7–18) days after MMR receipt. Most VARI (97%) occurred following first MMR dose. The presence of fever was similar among VARI and measles cases (97% of VARI vs. 100% of measles cases; P = 0.12), but differences were seen in the proportion with cough (30% vs. 96%; P < 0.001), coryza (47% vs. 85%; P < 0.001), conjunctivitis (23% vs. 68%; P < 0.001), and exposure to infectious measles cases (0% vs. 96%). CONCLUSIONS: Surges in MMR administration and heightened community awareness during a measles outbreak can result in a large number of VARI, consuming considerable public health resources. When evaluating the need to suspect measles among patients with febrile rash, clinicians should consider time since MMR administration, clinical presentation, and history of measles exposure. Collecting appropriate specimens for timely virus genotyping could inform appropriate public health action.

Significant knowledge gaps exist for even the most studied emerging infectious diseases. Coupled with failures in the response to the resurgence of infectious diseases, this lack of information is embedded in a simplistic view of pathogens and disconnected from a social and ecological context, and assumes a linear response of pathogens to environmental change. In fact, the natural reservoirs and transmission rates of most emerging infectious diseases primarily are affected by environmental factors, such as seasonality or meteorological events, typically producing nonlinear responses that are inherently unpredictable. A more realistic view of emerging infectious diseases requires a holistic perspective that incorporates social as well as physical, chemical, and biological dimensions of our planet’s systems. The notion of biocomplexity captures this depth and richness, and most importantly, the interactions of human and natural systems. This article provides a brief review and a synthesis of interdisciplinary approaches and insights employing the biocomplexity paradigm and offers a social–ecological approach for addressing and garnering an improved understanding of emerging infectious diseases. Drawing on findings from studies of cholera and other examples of emerging waterborne, zoonotic, and vectorborne diseases, a “blueprint” for the proposed interdisciplinary research framework is offered which integrates biological processes from the molecular level to that of communities and regional systems, incorporating public health infrastructure and climate aspects.","Wilcox, Bruce A.; Colwell, Rita R.",Ecohealth,40,31

However, the number of complications directly attributed to the procedure and leading to inadequate or poor hepatic functional status in the postoperative period remains a matter of concern. There has always been a problem of arriving at a consensus in the definition of the term: postoperative liver failure (PLF). The burgeoning rate of living donor liver transplants, with lives of perfectly healthy donors involved, has mandated a consensual definition, uniform diagnosis and protocol for management of PLF. The absence of a uniform definition has led to poor comparison among various trials. PLF remains a dreaded complication in resection of the liver, with a reported incidence of up to 8 % [1], and mortality rates of up to 30–70 % have been quoted [2]. Several studies have quoted a lower incidence of PLF in eastern countries, but when it occurs the mortality is as high as in the West [3].","Naidu, C. Sudeep; Sarin, Arti",GI Surgery Annual,40,1

While much work has been done, we have merely scratched the surface of the diversity that is estimated to exist. In this chapter we discuss the state of our knowledge of virus diversity, both in agricultural systems as well as in native wild systems, the border between these two systems and how viruses adapt and move across this border into an artificial, domesticated environment. We look at how this diversity has affected our outlook on viruses as a whole, shifting our past view of viruses as purely antagonistic entities of destruction to one where viruses are in a mutually beneficial relationship with their hosts.

Other lines of evidence, including the existence of ‘one-helix’ miniproteins, gene-fusion experiments, helix-driven oligomerization of bitopic proteins, and sequence rearrangements in the course of evolution support this view.

The desired traits of the solid phase are (1) high capacity for binding immunoreactants (high surface/volume ratio), (2) the possibility of immobilization of many different immunoreactants, (3) minimal dissociation, (4) negligible denaturation of immobilized molecule, and (5) the orientation of immobilized antibody with binding sites toward the solution and the crystalline orientation function (Fc) to the solid phase. Thus, the chapter discusses the immobilization of immunoreactants on solid phases. It also describes the use of plastics as solid phases. The covalent attachment of antibodies or antigens to plastic is also highlighted. While covalent coupling is obligatory for the coating of solid phases other than plastics, it may also be advantageous for plastics. Some of the methods for the covalent linkage of proteins are quite undemanding and convenient for the large-scale preparation of immunoreactant-coated solid phases.

With RT‐PCR technique, KB‐cell line was found to express IL‐18 receptors (IL‐18Rα and IL‐18Rβ), indicating that this oral carcinoma line is a target for IL‐18 study. We showed that recombinant human IL‐18 inhibited KB‐cell proliferation by 17% at concentration of 100 ng/ml (P < 0.05), whereas LDH release by these cells in treatment group and control groups was comparable, indicating that IL‐18 suppression of cell proliferation was not mediated by the induction of cell death. To further address this hypothesis, we found that IL‐18 treatment did not induce apoptotic cell death, as studied by DNA laddering and TUNEL assays. In addition, expression pattern of cell death‐controlling genes (bcl‐2 and bax) was not altered by this cytokine. Findings in these studies indicated that suppression of KB‐cell proliferation may be attributed to control of cell cycle, growth arrest or induction of cell differentiation. The data presented in this project could provide an insight of how cancer cell directly responds to IL‐18, as this cytokine is an important regulator of anticancer mechanisms.","Nilkaeo, A.; Bhuvanath, S.",Scand J Immunol,40,1

The development of ultraprecise position sensing started three decades ago with a novel imaging technique called atomic force microscopy, which provides ultrahigh topography resolution on the atomic scale by raster-scanning the surface with a microfabricated cantilever beam that has a tiny tip at its free end. The high force sensitivity can not only be used for imaging, but also allows the measurement of surface forces during molecule adsorption processes on the cantilever surface, thus enabling cantilevers to act as chemical sensors. Because of their small size, cantilevers allow fast and reliable detection of small concentrations of molecules in air and solution. In addition to artificial nose and label-free biosensing applications, they have also been employed to measure physical properties of tiny amounts of materials in miniaturized versions of conventional standard techniques such as calorimetry, thermogravimetry, weighing, photothermal spectroscopy and monitoring of chemical reactions. In the past few years, the cantilever-sensor concept has been extended to medical applications and has entered clinics for pilot studies on patients. The small size and scalability of cantilever array sensors might turn out to be advantageous for diagnostic screening applications and disease monitoring, as well as for genomics or proteomics. Using microcantilever arrays allows simultaneous detection of several analytes and solves the inherent problem of thermal drifts often present when using single microcantilever sensors, as some of the cantilevers can be used as sensor cantilevers for detection, and others as passivated reference cantilevers that do not show affinity to the molecules to be detected.","Lang, Hans Peter; Hegner, Martin; Gerber, Christoph",Springer Handbook of Nanotechnology,40,1

In about 5 months, this disease has led to ~ 4 million cases and claimed more than 200 k deaths as a result of its highly contagious nature. The present understanding is that SARS-CoV-2 is a type of influenza virus that can be transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols; Lewis (Nature 580:175, 2020). The primary methodology to prevent the spreading of this disease has been “social distancing” and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the front lines of healthcare and other critical operations. The scale of the disease has led to unprecedented demand for PPEs and increased functionality of the same. This paper focuses on improving PPE functionality in a scalable manner by surface treatment and coating with appropriate materials and other functional enhancements, such as exposure to UV rays or other sterilizing agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide).","Mahapatra, Pallab Sinha; Chatterjee, Souvick; Tiwari, Manish K.; Ganguly, Ranjan; Megaridis, Constantine M.",Trans Indian Natl,40,1

Glucocorticoid therapy may cause hypernatremia in refractory septic shock patients, but the association between glucocorticoid and intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired hypernatremia (IAH) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify whether glucocorticoid administration was associated with IAH. METHODS: This was a nested case–control study using data from an established cohort including 121 IAH cases identified from 1756 patients who were admitted to ICU in a tertiary care facility in Japan. We included patients who were admitted with a normal range of serum sodium concentrations (130–149 mEq/L) from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015 and remained in ICU for ≥ 2 days. Hypernatremia was defined as serum sodium concentration ≥ 150 mEq/L. Each case was matched to one control. RESULTS: Multivariable conditional logistic regression revealed high-dose glucocorticoid {odds ratio (OR), 4.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–13.4]}, acute kidney injury (AKI) [OR, 2.72 (95% CI 1.31–5.62)], and osmotic diuretics [OR, 3.44 (95% CI 1.41–8.39)] to be significantly associated with IAH. The contents and amounts of fluid infusion were not significantly associated with IAH. There were also significant duration–response effects between duration of glucocorticoid use and IAH; however, pulse glucocorticoid administration was not associated with IAH. CONCLUSION: In this nested case–control study, we demonstrated a significant association between IAH and high-dose glucocorticoid with significant duration–response effects. Serum sodium concentrations should be monitored carefully in critically ill patients administered prolonged high-dose glucocorticoid.

SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) plays a vital role in the replication of coronavirus and thus an attractive target for the screening of inhibitors for the therapy of COVID-19. The preclinical drugs ebselen and PX-12 are potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and covalently modifies the active site Cys-145 residue of M(pro) through selenosulfide/disulfide. In the current report, using virtual screening methods, reactive sulfur species allicin is subjecting for covalent docking at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) using PX-12 as a benchmark reference compound. The results indicate that allicin induces dual S-thioallylation of Cys-145 and Cys-85/ Cys-156 residues of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Using density functional theory (DFT), Gibbs free energy change (DG) is calculated for the putative reactions between N-acetylcysteine amide thiol and allicin/allyl sulfenic acid. The overall reaction is exergonic and allyl disulfide of Cys-145 residue of M(pro) is involved in a sulfur mediated hydrogen bond. The results indicate that allicin causes dual S-thioallylation of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) which may be of interest for treatment and attenuation of ongoing coronavirus infection.","Shekh, Shamasoddin; Reddy, K.

We explored the subcellular localizations of four representative NSD2 transcripts with immunofluorescence microscopy. Next, we used label-free quantification to perform immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analyses of the transcripts. Using the interaction partners for each transcript detected in the IP-MS results, we identified 890 isoform-specific PPI partners (83% are novel). These PPI networks were further divided into four categories of the exon-specific interactome. In these exon-specific PPI partners, two genes, RPL10 and HSPA8, were successfully confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. RPL10 primarily interacted with Isoforms 1, 3, and 5, and HSPA8 interacted with all four isoforms, respectively. Using our extended NSD2 protein interactions, we constructed an isoform-level PPI landscape for NSD2 to serve as reference interactome data for NSD2 spliceosome-level studies. Furthermore, the RNA splicing processes supported by these isoform partners shed light on the diverse roles NSD2 plays in WHS and myeloma development. We also validated the interactions using Western blotting, RPL10, and the three NSD2 (Isoform 1, 3, and 5). Our results expand gene-level NSD2 PPI networks and provide a basis for the treatment of NSD2-related developmental diseases.","Wang, Weidi; Chen, Yucan; Zhao, Jingjing; Chen, Liang; Song, Weichen; Li, Li; Lin, Guan Ning",Front Cell Dev Biol,40,13

It remains to be seen, how well this technology can be integrated during the transition from hospital discharge to outpatient settings. Here, we aim to assess the feasibility of introducing the FreeStyle Libre during the transition of care from inpatient to the outpatient environment in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). We will assess CGM use as measured by the numbers of days used and frequency of daily scans. Methods: During the time period April and September 2020, 20 patients with T2D being discharged on multiple daily injections admitted to North Shore University Hospital were enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria were those with adhesive allergy, CKD 4/5 or on dialysis and pregnant women. Participants were trained on how to use the FreeStyle Libre with the LibreLink mobile application. All patients received 2 Libre sensors at the time of discharge, one that was placed in the hospital and the other to be placed after 14 days. 1 participant died prior to discharge. Analyses included descriptive statistics, specifically categorical variables using frequencies and percentages while continuous variables using mean and standard deviation. Results: Among who used the mobile application, 10 were men and 9 were women. Majority of patients were Black (n=11, 57.9%) with a mean age of 52 years (range 31–76). The mean duration of diabetes was 9.7 years (range: 0 to 22) and mean Hemoglobin A1c of 11.2% (range: 5.5–15.5). 10 out of 19 persons used CGM for more than 2 weeks, while the remaining 9 utilized the CGM for less than 2 weeks. Mean average daily scans were 5 times per day (range: 1–12) with majority of the persons (n=15, 78.9%) scanning more frequently (3 or more times per day). The average glucose ranged from 62 to 268 mg/dl and the mean active CGM time was 52.05% (range 0–98). Mean glycemic variability was 29.17% (range: 14.5–56.7). Technical issues with the CGM included poor adhesion or issues connecting to the mobile application. Conclusion: Our study found that the initiation of CGM during the transition from hospital discharge to the outpatient setting is feasible and a useful tool. A limitation of this study was the inability for all people to use the mobile application due to incompatible phones or operating systems. References: 1. Beck RW, Riddlesworth TD, Ruedy K, et al.

Main funding source(s): Abdul Hameed Showman Foundation ONBEHALF: The Jordan COVID-19 AtheRosclerotic Cardiovascular Events (JoCORE) Study Investigators Background. The vicarious stresses associated with the covid-19 pandemic have been reported to cause psychosocial behavioral changes in individuals not infected with the virus. No reports have evaluated the effect of these stresses on triggering acute ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI, respectively) in such individuals. Purpose. We sought to study the nature of MI triggers and clinical profiles in non covid-19 individuals during the pandemic. Methods: Patients not infected with the covid-19 virus admitted to 9 hospitals with STEMI and NSTEMI during the pandemic crisis in Jordan from February through December 2020 were evaluated for pre-MI exposure to psychosocial and economic triggers related to the pandemic, lockdown and shutdown. Results: Of 144 patients enrolled, 58 (40.3%) had STEMI and 86 (59.7%) had NSTEMI. Compared with the NSTEMI group, the STEMI group tended to be younger (59.0 + 13.8 vs. 62.3 + 12.7 years, p = 0.14), had significantly more men than women (94.9% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.005), were more likely to be smokers (75.9% vs. 55.8, p = 0.02) and had lower prevalence of prior coronary revascularization (17.2% vs. 45.3%, p = 0.001). In-hospital mortality among the 133 patients who were alive upon hospital arrival was 1.5%. All patients reported exposure to at least one psychosocial stressful trigger, including lockdown and loneliness stress (65.3%), fear of contacting covid-19 infection or of uncertainty (26.4%), anger (18.8%), and death of a significant person during the pandemic (4.2%) Financial hardship and volatile income were reported by 42.4% of patients. STEMI and NSTEMI patients did not have significant differences in the frequency of psychosocial (100% vs. 99.9%, respectively, p = NS) or economic triggers (34.5% vs. 47.7%, respectively, p = NS). Conclusions. Exposure to psychosocial and financial stresses related to the covid-19 pandemic and its related lockdown can trigger acute MI. An increase in the number of these events may become a potentially serious health issue with longer duration of the unremitting pandemic.","Hammoudeh, A; Mdanat, E; Tabbalat, R; Jarrah, M; Alhaddad, IA",Eur J Prev Cardiol,40,21

Based on the COVID-19-triggered, on-campus evictions across Canada and the United States, this cross-national partnership examined the out-of-province/state and international female university students’ leadership during the entire eviction process. Through in-depth interviews, this study revealed the female university students’ leadership behaviors during three stages: (1) pre-eviction: their self-preparedness formed an emotional foundation to support others; (2) peri-eviction: their attitude and leadership behavior enabled them to facilitate (psychologically and physically) their peers’ eviction process; and (3) post-eviction: they continued to support their peers virtually and raised the general public’s awareness regarding the plight of vulnerable and marginalized populations. This article argues that the female university students’ leadership that emerged during the eviction process became complementary to and even augmented the universities’ official efforts and beyond. This leadership represents empirical evidence that contributes to the existing literature on gender and leadership by demonstrating female youth as empowered stakeholders rather than as merely passive victims. Future studies could develop detailed stratification of gender and age dimensions in order to portray a more comprehensive picture of the younger generation’s leadership in hazards and disaster research and practice.","Wu, Haorui; Perez-Lugo, Marla; Garcia, Cecilio Ortiz; Crespo, Frances Gonzalez; Castillo, Adriana",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,40,20

Prices and utilization were compared in value, number of defined daily dose (DDD), and DDD/1000 inh/day. Almost all types of insulins possessed biosimilars, and even more than one on the European market, but only two were found to be available and reimbursed on the national market. The total number of reimbursed INNs was 11, and for seven of them, changes in reference price per DDD were found. The highest price decrease was observed for insulin (price per DDD decline from 2.77 to 2.22 Bulgarian Leva (BGN)). The total expenditure for insulin increased from 68 to approximately 72.8 mil BGN (34 to approximately 37 mil Euro). The utilization in DDD/1000/inh/day decreased from 16.12 to 15.31.

Since lockdown, several alternative formats have been utilised to adapt to social distancing requirements, but evaluation of these is needed1. PURPOSE: This study uses Experience Based Co-Design to identify novel approaches to delivering CR in a post COVID-19 era. METHODS: Using a co-design approach 58 participants were recruited, these included staff, patients who attended, dropped out or did not attend CR. Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using template analysis. The results will be depicted through video at a co-design workshop where innovative approaches will be discussed and prioritised by the study participants. RESULTS: The main themes developed from interview and focus group include 1. Staff & hospital treatment, 2. Patient characteristics, 3. Emotional state, 4. What Cardiac Rehabilitation is, 5. Time, location and delivery, 6. Self-Care and finally, 7. Technology. These themes are conveyed through a 15-minute trigger video along with quotations to stimulate discussion.

The disease is associated with diarrhea and nutritional deficiencies, leading to severe morbidity and mortality among immune-compromised patients. This study aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection among immune-compromised humans in southern Africa over the past 20 years. Reports of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in humans published between 2000 and 2020 using Google Scholar, PubMed, Ovid Medline, African Journal Online (AJOL), and Web of Science literature databases were obtained. Inclusion criteria of sorted articles for Cryptosporidium spp. infection were standardized using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. A total of 22 eligible studies were sorted for meta-analysis. Overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in southern African countries with reports was 16.8% (95% CI 9.7–25.3). Sub-group analysis showed a pooled prevalence of 25.2, 20.5, and 17.9% among HIV/AIDS patients, children, and diarrhoeic individuals, respectively. Pooled prevalence was highest in South Africa and lowest in Zimbabwe across examined individuals. The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infections in diarrhoeic patients was highest in individuals from Botswana (17.6%) which is significantly different (Χ(2) = 9.337; P = 0.002) from South Africans (12.7%). South African individuals with HIV/AIDS showed the highest pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections than other countries. The high prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. infections among immune-compromised patients in southern Africa showed that the pathogen is of significant importance in this region. Continuous studies on the genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. isolates and associated risk factors are needed across southern Africa to identify the predominant subtypes in humans.

The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of stress and its associated factors among primary healthcare nurses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 Saudi nurses in the government primary health care centers in Medina city, Saudi Arabia. Stress was measured by the stress subscale of the 21-Item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Sources of stress were assessed by 15 items. RESULTS: The majority were females (68.0%) and aged less than 40 years (72.5%). Thirty percent had severe or very severe stress. Stress was associated significantly with the presence of chronic diseases (P = 0.037) and with working in night shifts (P = 0.042). All sources of stress in the workplace were associated significantly and positively with stress (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: About one-third of the participants had stress. Improving work conditions and minimizing stress in the workplace should be a priority in the primary health care setting.","Abdoh, Duoaa Seddiq; Shahin, Mohammed Adeeb; Ali, Ahmed Khalid; Alhejaili, Shumukh Mohammed; Kiram, Osama Madani; Al-Dubai, Sami Abdo Radman",J Family Med Prim Care,40,17

Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a technically feasible and reproducible operation that doesn't require complex digestive reconstruction. It requires advanced laparoscopic skill for vascular dissection and control. Due to the absence of trials proving its oncological results it is mainly indicated for benign or borderline tumours of the pancreatic body and tail. Since for these tumours there is no indication for a lymph node dissection, there are benefits for the patient if the spleen is preserved. There is some evidence that robotic assistance facilitates the procedure and makes it accessible to surgeons diminishing the necessity of advanced laparoscopic skills. In this technical multimedia article, we present our method for a robotic mini-invasive spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy with preservation of the splenic vessels. The technique is presented in a stepwise approach with an accompanying video. We believe that the use of the Da Vinci robotic platform facilitates this demanding procedure.","Ntourakis, Dimitrios; Marescaux, Jacques; Pessaux, Patrick",World journal of surgery,40,28

HAP powders were synthesized by using a hydrothermal method, and after calcination, dominant phases in the powders, undoped and doped with Mg2+ were HAP and β-tricalcium phosphate, respectively. Upon mixing with Na-alginate, followed by gelation and freeze-dying, highly macroporous composite scaffolds were obtained with open and connected pores and uniformly dispersed mineral phase as determined by scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties of the scaffolds were influenced by the composition of calcium phosphate fillers being improved as Ca2+ concentration increased while Mg2+ concentration decreased. HAP formation within all scaffolds was investigated in simulated body fluid (SBF) during 28 days under static conditions while the best candidate (Mg substituted HAP filler, precursor solution with [Ca + Mg]/P molar ratio of 1.52) was investigated under more physiological conditions in a biomimetic perfusion bioreactor. The continuous SBF flow (superficial velocity of 400 μm/s) induced the formation of abundant HAP crystals throughout the scaffolds leading to improved mechanical properties to some extent as compared to the initial scaffolds. These findings indicated potentials of novel biomimetic scaffolds for use in bone tissue engineering.","Stojkovska, Jasmina; Zvicer, Jovana; Andrejevic, Milica; Janackovic, Djordje; Obradovic, Bojana; Veljovic, Djordje N","Journal of biomedical materials research.

To better understand the events responsible for this clinical outcome, a rodent model of virus-induced chronic airway disease has been characterized. Upon infection with Sendai virus (parainfluenza virus type-1), Brown Norway (BN) rats develop an asthma-like clinical syndrome, while Fischer 344 (F344) rats fully recover. Our previous studies demonstrated that after infection, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression is substantially higher in BN rats compared to F344 rats, and this may at least partially mediate the virus-induced airway abnormalities. To investigate the underlying mechanism(s) for the increased TNF-alpha expression, the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), an important regulator of TNF-alpha gene transcription, was examined. Supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) indicate that normal F344 rats predominantly express the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in the lungs, and virus infection temporarily increases expression of the p50 subunit. In contrast, normal BN rats have higher expression of the p50 subunit in the pulmonary tract. Upon infection, p50-subunit expression in BN rats increases to levels higher than those observed in virus-infected F344 rats. Interestingly, treatment of infected BN rats with dexamethasone at doses known to prevent virus-induced airway abnormalities increases pulmonary expression of the p65 subunit, and decreases TNF-alpha mRNA levels in the lungs. Furthermore, direct inhibition of TNF-alpha also increases pulmonary expression of p65 in virus-infected BN, but not F344, rats. Taken together, these results suggest that differential expression of NF-kappaB subunits may play an important role in the development of post-viral chronic airway abnormalities.","Uhl, Elizabeth W; Clarke, Tracy J; Hogan, Robert J",Viral immunology,40,31

However, certain clinical scenarios warrant biventricular mechanical support. One strategy for some patients is the excision of both ventricles and the implantation of two VAD pumps as a total artificial heart (TAH). This has recently been made possible by the improvements in device design and the small profile of centrifugal devices. This TAH approach remains experimental with many important challenges such as the device settings to balance the right and left circulation, the orientation of the devices and the outflow graft with their influence on hemolysis and stability, and the outcome of chronic support using such an orientation. This protocol aims to provide a reproducible approach for total artificial heart replacement with two intracorporeal centrifugal VADs in a cow model.","Bishawi, Muath; Roan, Jun-Neng; Richards, Jordan; Brown, Zachary; Blue, Laura; Daneshmand, Mani A; Schroder, Jacob N; Bowles, Dawn E; Milano, Carmelo A",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,40,1

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has been imposed by the curfew program in Jordan. AIM To evaluate the effects of social distancing on the social relationships of the Jordanian population. METHODS A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between the 6th and the 30th of May, 2020. Our questionnaire was constructed to explore the population's perception of the quarantine period, how it is affecting their relationship with others, and the characteristics of their social relationships and communication with various population categories, including family members and work colleagues. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of better social relationships and communication. RESULTS A total of 4,301 participants were involved in this study. The average score of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on social relationships among the whole study population was 5.68 (SD: 2.33) out of 10 (equal to 56.8%), which indicates the marginal strength of the social relationships. Around 31.6% of the participants reported that their social relationships were affected to a high degree by the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who were aged 36-45 were positively affected in terms of their social relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting social relationships, which could ultimately lead to negative health implications.

However, the synthesis of highly porous carbon superstructures with macropores and carbon defects from a simple crystalline solid remains challenging. In this work, superstructured macroporous carbon rods composed of defective graphitic nanosheets are synthesized by direct carbonization of crystalline poly tannic acid (PTA) rods as precursors. During carbonization, PTA rods with a highly ordered lamellar structure induce a spatially confined two-step localized contraction that takes place in different dimensions and directions in each step. The unexpected contraction behavior results in the sponge-like macroporous carbon superstructure with large surface area, high porosity, and abundant defects, thus showing a superior electrocatalytic performance with high activity and selectivity for oxygen reduction reaction. The study provides new understandings in the design of functional carbon materials with distinctive structures and applications.","Wang, Jing; Yao, Yining; Zhang, Chaoqi; Sun, Qiang; Cheng, Dan; Huang, Xiaodan; Feng, Jiayou; Wan, Jingjing; Zou, Jin; Liu, Chao; Yu, Chengzhong",Advanced science,40,1

However, the relevance of these investigations with respect to understanding MCAs' chemistry appears often vague. Here, we discuss how insights into the electronic structure obtained from negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) combined with theoretical calculations and collision-induced dissociation can provide a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic chemical reactivity of MCAs and their fragments. This is exemplified in our studies on polyhedral closo-borate dianions [BnXn]2- (n = 6, 10, 11, 12; X = H, F-I, CN) and their fragment ions. For example, the rational design of closo-borate dianions with specific electronic properties is described, which leads to generating highly reactive fragments. Depending on the dianionic precursor, these fragments are tuned to either bind noble gases effectively or activate small molecules like CO and N2. The intrinsic electronic properties of closo-borate dianions are further compared to their electrochemistry in solutions, revealing solvent effects on the redox potentials. Neutral host molecules such as cyclodextrins are found to bind strongly to [BnXn]2-, and gas phase NIPES provides insights into the intrinsic host-guest interactions. Finally, outlooks including the direct NIPES of molecular fragment ions that cannot be generated in the condensed phase and their utilization in preparative mass spectrometry are discussed.","Warneke, Jonas; Wang, Xue-Bin",The journal of physical chemistry.

METHODS A randomized, double-blind, active-comparator study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled (HbA1c 6.5-8.5%) by metformin monotherapy. Patients received vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or glimepiride (up to 6 mg/day) added to metformin. RESULTS In all, 3118 patients were randomized (vildagliptin, n = 1562; glimepiride, n = 1556). From similar baseline values (7.3%), after 2 years adjusted mean (s.e.) change in HbA1c was comparable between vildagliptin and glimepiride treatment: -0.1% (0.0%) and -0.1% (0.0%), respectively. The primary objective of non-inferiority was met. A similar proportion of patients reached HbA1c <7% (36.9 and 38.3%, respectively), but with vildagliptin more patients reached this target without hypoglycaemia (36.0% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.004). The initial response (IR) was sustained for a mean (s.d.) of 309 (244) days with vildagliptin versus 270 (223) days for glimepiride (p < 0.001) (IR = nadir HbA1c where change from baseline > or =0.5% or HbA1c < or =6.5% within the first six months of treatment. After IR was detected, sustained response = time between nadir and an increase of >0.3% above IR). Independent of disease duration, age was a predictor of effect sustainability. Fewer patients experienced hypoglycaemia with vildagliptin (2.3% vs. 18.2% with glimepiride) with a 14-fold difference in the number of hypoglycaemic events (59 vs. 838). Vildagliptin had a beneficial effect on body weight [mean (s.e.) change from baseline -0.3 (0.1) kg; between-group difference -1.5 kg; p < 0.001]. Overall, both treatments were well tolerated and displayed similar safety profiles. CONCLUSIONS Vildagliptin add-on has similar efficacy to glimepiride after 2 years' treatment, with markedly reduced hypoglycaemia risk and no weight gain.","Matthews, D R; Dejager, S; Ahren, B; Fonseca, V; Ferrannini, E; Couturier, A; Foley, J E; Zinman, B","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",40,19

SOURCES We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to November 2019. We included studies that reported on the incidence of new-onset perioperative AF during hospitalization for non-cardiac surgery and/or AF recurrence in such patients following discharge. Reviewers screened articles and abstracted data independently and in duplicate. We assessed study quality by appraising methodology for collecting AF history, incident AF during hospitalization, and AF recurrence after discharge. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS From 39,233 citations screened, 346 studies that enrolled a total of 5,829,758 patients met eligibility criteria. Only 27 studies used prospective, continuous inpatient electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring to detect incident AF. Overall, the incidence of postoperative AF during hospitalization ranged from 0.004 to 50.3%, with a median [interquartile range] of 8.7 [3.8-15.0]%. Atrial fibrillation incidence varied with type of surgery. Prospective studies using continuous ECG monitoring reported significantly higher incidences of AF than those that did not (13.9% vs 1.9%, respectively; P < 0.001). A total of 13 studies (25,726 patients) with follow-up up to 5.4 years reported on AF recurrence following hospital discharge; only one study used a prospective systematic monitoring protocol. Recurrence rates ranged from 0 to 37.3%. CONCLUSIONS Rates of AF incidence first detected following non-cardiac surgery and long-term AF recurrence vary markedly. Differences in the intensity of ECG monitoring and type of surgery may account for this variation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, huge amount of information is increasingly available in digital information sources and overwhelms the average person. The purpose of this research was to investigate public's information seeking behavior on COVID-19 in Greece. METHOD The study was conducted through a web-based survey, facilitated by the use of questionnaire posted on the Google Forms platform. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended, 7-point Likert scale questions and multiple choice questions and was distributed to all over Greek Regions to almost 3.000 recipients, during the implementation of restrictive measures against the COVID-19 outbreak in Spring 2020. The data collected were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis. The median was used to present the results. In order to perform analysis between genders, as well as age groups, the non-parametric criteria Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis were applied to determine the existence of differences in participants' beliefs. RESULTS Responses by 776 individuals were obtained. Individuals dedicated up to 2 h per day to be informed on COVID-19. Television, electronic press and news websites were reported by the participants as more reliable than social media, in obtaining information on COVID-19. Respondents paid attention to official sources of information (Ministry of Health, Civil Protection etc.). Family and friends played an additional role in the participants' information on COVID-19, while the personal doctor, other health workers and pharmacists did not appear to be most preferred sources of information on COVID-19. Participants' most common information seeking strategy in digital environment was keyword searching. Unreliable information, fake news and information overload were the most common difficulties that the participants encountered seeking information on COVID-19. The respondents' views seemed to differ significantly among age groups. The older the participants, the more often they were informed by television (p < 0.001) and the less often by the internet (p < 0.001). Females appear to use more frequently internet (p < 0.001) and social media (p = 0.001) out of habit and visit more often the Ministry of Health (p < 0.001) and the Civil Protection (p=0.005) websites, compared to males. Most of the participants seemed to worry about the fake news phenomenon and agreed that fake news on COVID-19 is being spread in the media and especially social networks. CONCLUSION The study revealed that, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece, participants obtained information about the disease mainly by television, electronic press and news websites. On the contrary, the limited use of social media demonstrates the participants awareness of the spread of fake news on social media. This observed information seeking behavior might has contributed to individuals' acceptance of the necessary behavioral changes that had led to the Greek success story in preventing spread of the disease.","Skarpa, Paraskevi El; Garoufallou, Emmanouel",International journal of medical informatics,40,8

Major bleeding occurred in 12 patients (2.5%/year) and 17 patients (3.5%/year), respectively (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.34-1.52). In contrast, in the non-Japanese cohort, recurrent stroke occurred in 4.1%/year and 4.3%/year, respectively, showing no apparent difference in recurrent stroke for dabigatran vs. aspirin (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74-1.14). The P-interaction for treatment and region did not reach statistical significance (P=0.09). CONCLUSIONS Dabigatran was putatively associated with a lower relative risk of recurrent stroke compared with aspirin in Japanese ESUS patients.","Toyoda, Kazunori; Uchiyama, Shinichiro; Hagihara, Yasushi; Kuwashiro, Takahiro; Mori, Takahisa; Kamiyama, Kenji; Urano, Yasuhisa; Taniguchi, Atsushi; Nozaki, Kenma; Cronin, Lisa; Grauer, Claudia; Brueckmann, Martina; Diener, Hans-Christoph",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,40,1

However, OFC are time-consuming and risky procedures. OBJECTIVE to assess the utility of the basophil activation test (BAT) to predict the allergic status and reduce the need for OFC in children with one or more nut or seed allergies. METHODS Participants in the Pronuts study recruited at the Geneva and the London centers were tested on the BAT to hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame, almond and peanut, Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 6, using FlowCAST, a commercially available BAT kit, and flow cytometry. RESULTS The BAT to hazelnut, cashew nut, sesame, almond and peanut discriminated between allergic and non-allergic children, to the respective nut or seed. The optimal allergen concentration and their optimal, positive and negative cut-offs were identified for BAT and the other tests, for each nut and seed. Using BAT as a second step in the diagnostic process, following equivocal skin prick test and IgE to extracts and components, reduced the number of total OFCs by 5-15% and of positive OFC by 33-75% (except for hazelnut) with 0% false-negatives and a diagnostic accuracy of 96-100%. CONCLUSION The BAT proved to be a useful diagnostic tool, used in a stepwise approach, to predict the allergic status and reduce the number of OFC in the Pronuts study patients with at least one nut allergy willing to consume selected nuts.","Santos, Alexandra F; Bergmann, Marcel; Brough, Helen A; Couto-Francisco, Natália; Kwok, Matthew; Panetta, Valentina; Haddad, Diab; Lack, Gideon; Eigenmann, Philippe; Caubet, Jean-Christoph",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

These responses can be mediated by resident microglia and astrocytes, which are innate immune cells without direct counterparts in the periphery. Furthermore, CNS immune reactions often take place in virtual isolation from the innate/adaptive immune interplay that characterizes peripheral immunity. However, microglia and astrocytes also engage in significant cross-talk with CNS-infiltrating T cells and other components of the innate immune system. Here we review the cellular and molecular basis of innate immunity in the CNS and discuss what is known about how outcomes of these interactions can lead to resolution of infection, neurodegeneration, or neural repair depending on the context.","Ransohoff, Richard M; Brown, Melissa A",The Journal of clinical investigation,40,8

Previous studies demonstrated that Y. pestis-containing vacuoles (YCVs) acquire markers of late endosomes or lysosomes in naïve macrophages and that this bacterium can survive in macrophages activated with the cytokine gamma interferon. An autophagic process known as xenophagy, which destroys pathogens in acidic autophagolysosomes, can occur in naïve macrophages and is upregulated in activated macrophages. Studies were undertaken here to investigate the mechanism of Y. pestis survival in phagosomes of naïve and activated macrophages and to determine if the pathogen avoids or co-opts autophagy. Colocalization of the YCV with markers of autophagosomes or acidic lysosomes and the pH of the YCV were determined by microscopic imaging of infected macrophages. Some YCVs contained double membranes characteristic of autophagosomes, as determined by electron microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy showed that approximately 40% of YCVs colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3, a marker of autophagic membranes, and that YCVs failed to acidify below pH 7 in naïve macrophages. Replication of Y. pestis in naïve macrophages caused accumulation of LC3-II, as determined by immunoblotting. While activation of infected macrophages increased LC3-II accumulation, it decreased the percentage of GFP-LC3-positive YCVs (approximately 30%). A viable count assay showed that Y. pestis survived equally well in macrophages proficient for autophagy and macrophages rendered deficient for this process by Cre-mediated deletion of ATG5, revealing that this pathogen does not require autophagy for intracellular replication. We conclude that although YCVs can acquire an autophagic membrane and accumulate LC3-II, the pathogen avoids xenophagy by preventing vacuole acidification.","Pujol, Céline; Klein, Kathryn A; Romanov, Galina A; Palmer, Lance E; Cirota, Carol; Zhao, Zijiang; Bliska, James B",Infection and immunity,40,1

However, predicting tenable pathways of animal-to-human movement has been hindered by challenges in identifying reservoir species, cultivating zoonotic organisms in culture, and isolating full-length genomes for cloning and genetic studies. The ability to design and recover pathogens reconstituted from synthesized cDNAs has the potential to overcome these obstacles by allowing studies of replication and pathogenesis without identification of reservoir species or cultivation of primary isolates. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and recovery of the largest synthetic replicating life form, a 29.7-kb bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (Bat-SCoV), a likely progenitor to the SARS-CoV epidemic. To test a possible route of emergence from the noncultivable Bat-SCoV to human SARS-CoV, we designed a consensus Bat-SCoV genome and replaced the Bat-SCoV Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the SARS-CoV RBD (Bat-SRBD). Bat-SRBD was infectious in cell culture and in mice and was efficiently neutralized by antibodies specific for both bat and human CoV Spike proteins. Rational design, synthesis, and recovery of hypothetical recombinant viruses can be used to investigate mechanisms of transspecies movement of zoonoses and has great potential to aid in rapid public health responses to known or predicted emerging microbial threats.","Becker, Michelle M; Graham, Rachel L; Donaldson, Eric F; Rockx, Barry; Sims, Amy C; Sheahan, Timothy; Pickles, Raymond J; Corti, Davide; Johnston, Robert E; Baric, Ralph S; Denison, Mark R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,40,1

The compounds 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-2,3-dioxabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene (cis-ascaridole), 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl) benzene (р-cymene), and 1-isopropyl-4-methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene (p-mentha-1,3-diene also known as α-terpinene) were identified as the major components. The EO and the major fractions showed remarkable mosquitocidal activity against third instar larvae and adults of Culex quinquefasciatus Say. The oil and fractions were assayed at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μl/l. Mortality was time- and dose-dependent. At 24 h post-exposure at an assayed concentration of 50 μl/l, the larval and adult mortalities ranged between 80.11-100% and 91.22-100%, respectively. Strong larvicidal and adulticidal activities were recorded in the cases of the crude oil and cis-ascaridole. The LC50 values after 24 h of treatment ranged between 6.2-20.1 μl/l and 5.1-13.9 μl/l against larvae and adults, respectively. The corrected percentage mortalities increased over time with the tested plant oil and the major fractions relative to the control. The time required to achieve 50% mortality (LT50) decreased remarkably with all treatments. The tested EO and major fractions effectively inhibited larval acetylcholinesterase activity with IC50 values ranging from 8.44 to 64.80 mM compared with 2.08 × 10-3 mM for the reference standard, methomy.

The aim of this controlled, prospective observational study was to assess the possible relationship between the grade of IR, defined by procalcitonin (PCT) changes, and development of POCD related to cardiac surgery. METHODS Forty-two patients, who were ≥ 60 years of age and scheduled for elective cardiac surgery, were separated into the low inflammatory (LIR) and high inflammatory (HIR) response groups based on their PCT levels measured on the first postoperative day. A matched normative control group of 32 subjects was recruited from primary care practice. The PCT and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were monitored daily during the first five postoperative days. The cognitive function and mood state were preoperatively tested with a set of five neurocognitive tests and two mood inventories and at the seventh postoperative day. The Reliable Change Index modified for practice (RCIp) using data from normative controls was applied to determine the significant decline in test performance. RESULTS The LIR (n = 20) and HIR (n = 22) groups differed significantly in the PCT (p < 0.001) but not in the CRP time courses. The incidence of POCD at the first postoperative week was 35.7% in the cohort. The LIR and HIR groups did not vary in the RCIp Z scores of neurocognitive tests and frequencies of POCD (7 vs 8 cases, respectively, p > 0.05). Additionally, there was no difference in the mood states, anxiety levels and perioperative parameters known to influence the development of POCD. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the magnitude of the non-infective inflammatory response generated by on-pump cardiac surgery did not influence the development of POCD in the early postoperative period in elderly patients.","Nemeth, Endre; Vig, Katalin; Racz, Kristof; Koritsanszky, Kinga B; Ronkay, Klara I; Hamvas, Fumiko P; Borbély, Csaba; Eory, Ajandek; Merkely, Bela; Gal, Janos",BMC anesthesiology,40,13

Alternatives to in-office outpatient medical evaluations are necessary. We aimed to analyze how quickly orthopedic surgery providers at a large academic institution adopted telemedicine, and identify any factors that were associated with earlier or ""faster"" telemedicine adoption. Methods: We analyzed the telemedicine activity of 39 providers within the Department of Orthopedic Surgery between March 16, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and constructed logistic regression models to identify characteristics with significant association to earlier or faster telemedicine adoption. Results: No significant predictors of percentage of visits conducted via telemedicine were found. However, increased experience and practice at multiple locations was associated with slower telemedicine adoption time, while Professor level academic rank was associated with a faster time to achieving 10% of pre-COVID visit volumes via telemedicine. Higher pre-COVID visit volumes were also significantly associated with faster telemedicine adoption. Demographic factors, including, age, gender, practice locations, academic degrees, pediatric specialty, and use of physician assistants/nurse practitioners, were not found to have significant associations with telemedicine use. Conclusions: These results indicate that telemedicine has an important role to play within academic orthopedic surgery practices, with a wide and diverse range of orthopedic surgery providers choosing to utilize it during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the rapid expansion and urgency driving the adoption of telemedicine, these results illustrate the importance of considering provider-side characteristics in ensuring that providers are well equipped to utilize telemedicine.","Annapragada, Akshaya V; Jenkins, Sabrina G; Chang, Annika L; Jain, Amit; Srikumaran, Divya; Srikumaran, Uma",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,40,17

All species exhibited sperm that is not usually observed in insects in general. The most highlighted features are the displacement of the nucleus running parallel to the flagellar components, hitherto observed only in coccinellid and carabid beetles, and the presence of thin and dense structures along the nucleus, probably derived from the centriole adjunct, a feature that is so far exclusive to these insects. The other structures are a typical axoneme for insects with 9 + 9 + 2 microtubules, in a position diametrically opposite relative to the nucleus, two slender, symmetrical mitochondrial derivatives and a pair of discrete accessory bodies. This arrangement provides a bilaterally symmetrical flagellum, which favourably influences sperm hydrodynamics, as will be discussed. The occurrence of this unusual structural arrangement in the sperm of species from superfamilies that are phylogenetically as distant as Elateroidea and Buprestoidea support the monophyly of the infraorder Elateriformia, as proposed by some previous molecular studies.","Dias, Glenda; Lino-Neto, José; Dallai, Romano; Mercati, David; Lupetti, Pietro",Arthropod structure & development,40,1

Although numerous approaches for PEEP titration have been proposed, there is no accepted strategy for titrating optimal PEEP. By analyzing intratidal compliance profiles, PEEP may be individually titrated for patients. METHODS After obtaining informed consent, 60 consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia were randomly allocated to mechanical ventilation with PEEP 5 cmH2O (control group) or PEEP individually titrated, guided by an analysis of the intratidal compliance profile (intervention group). The primary endpoint was the frequency of each nonlinear intratidal compliance (CRS) profile of the respiratory system (horizontal, increasing, decreasing, and mixed). The secondary endpoints measured were respiratory mechanics, hemodynamic variables, and regional ventilation, which was assessed via electrical impedance tomography. RESULTS The frequencies of the CRS profiles were comparable between the groups. Besides PEEP [control: 5.0 (0.0), intervention: 5.8 (1.1) cmH2O, p < 0.001], the respiratory and hemodynamic variables were comparable between the two groups. The compliance profile analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups. The loss of ventral and dorsal regional ventilation was higher in the control [ventral: 41.0 (16.3)%; dorsal: 25.9 (13.8)%] than in the intervention group [ventral: 29.3 (17.6)%; dorsal: 16.4 (12.7)%; p (ventral) = 0.039, p (dorsal) = 0.028]. CONCLUSIONS Unfavorable compliance profiles indicating tidal derecruitment were found less often than in earlier studies. Individualized PEEP titration resulted in slightly higher PEEP. A slight global increase in aeration associated with this was indicated by regional gain and loss analysis. Differences in dorsal to ventral ventilation distribution were not found.

The virus evades the mitochondrial production of interferons through its N protein and, from that moment on, it hijacks the functions of these organelles. The aim of this study was to show how the virus kidnaps the mitochondrial machinery for its benefit and survival, leading to alterations of serum parameters and to nitrosative stress (NSS). In a prospective cohort of 15 postmortem patients who died from COVID-19, six markers of mitochondrial function (COX II, COX IV, MnSOD, nitrotyrosine, Bcl-2 and caspase-9) were analyzed by the immune colloidal gold technique in samples from the lung, heart, and liver. Biometric laboratory results from these patients showed alterations in hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, urea nitrogen, glucose, C-reactive protein, albumin, D-dimer, ferritin, fibrinogen, Ca²⁺, K⁺, lactate and troponin. These changes were associated with alterations in the mitochondrial structure and function. The multi-organ dysfunction present in COVID-19 patients may be caused, in part, by damage to the mitochondria that results in an inflammatory state that contributes to NSS, which activates the sepsis cascade and results in increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Soria-Castro, Elizabeth; Soto, María Elena; Guarner-Lans, Verónica; Rojas, Gustavo; Perezpeña-Diazconti, Mario; Críales-Vera, Sergio A; Manzano Pech, Linaloe; Pérez-Torres, Israel",Histology and histopathology,40,10

INTERVENTION End-tidal partial pressure of CO2 was measured in distal position using the separate lumen of a double-lumen endotracheal tube connected to an external side-stream capnometer. Three consecutive detCO2 and tcCO2 values were recorded simultaneously and compared with simultaneous arterialised partial pressure of CO2 (paCO2) measurements in each patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Reliability, accuracy and precision of detCO2 and tcCO2 measurements compared with paCO2 in neonates. RESULTS Twenty-five neonates were included with a median (range) weight at enrolment of 1410 (1010-2980) g, from which 81 simultaneous measurements of detCO2, tcCO2 and paCO2 were obtained.

These manifestations have been called in the course of these months in various ways, from ""acro-ischemia acuta"", ""erythema pernio"", ""chilblains"", up to characterize them more recently as ""CoViD Toes"". Clinical manifestations do not usually associate with other typical symptoms of Covid-19 and do not find a classical and defined serological antibody response (IgG and IgM). From a clinical point of view it is a localized and self-resolving problem of an interesting and relatively new pathogenetic model of disease in relation to a viral agent. Future studies must make us understand if there is in this specific condition a low viral load is not detectable by current methods and if this explains the inability to produce an adequate immune response for CoViD-19. It is important to determine whether the interferon immune response in some subjects can be the cause of both the low viremia and the endothelial damage so localized in the acral-site, as happens in other models of diseases (chilblain-lupus like). On the contrary, some authors believe that the acral lesions are attributable to chilblains caused by a series of favourable environmental conditions due to forced enclosure.

74508,74508,74508,Viruses and lower respiratory tract infections: does more mean worse?,14.195118,9.844556,2010,"BACKGROUND Percutaneous tracheostomy, almost associated with cough reflex and hemodynamic fluctuations, is a common procedure for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, especially those in neurosurgery intensive care units (NICUs). However, there are currently a lack of effective preventive measures to reduce the risk of secondary brain injury. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) vs sufentanil during percutaneous tracheostomy in TBI patients. METHODS The 196 TBI patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy were randomized divided into 3 groups: group D1 (n = 62, DEX infusion at 0.5 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour), group D2 (n = 68, DEX infusion at 1 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour), and group S (n = 66, sufentanil infusion 0.3 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.4 μg·kg·hour). The bispectral index (BIS) of all patients was maintained at 50 to 70 during surgery. Anesthesia onset time, hemodynamic variables, total cumulative dose of DEX/sufentanil, total doses of rescue propofol and fentanyl, time to first dose of rescue propofol and fentanyl, number of intraoperative patient movements and cough reflexes, adverse events, and surgeon satisfaction score were recorded. RESULTS Anesthesia onset time was significantly lower in group D2 than in both other groups (14.35 ± 3.23 vs 12.42 ± 2.12 vs 13.88 ± 3.51 minutes in groups D1, D2, and S, respectively; P < .001). Both heart rate and mean arterial pressure during percutaneous tracheostomy were more stable in group D2. Total doses of rescue propofol and fentanyl were significantly lower in group D2 than in group D1 (P < .001). The time to first dose of rescue propofol and fentanyl were significantly longer in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .001). The number of patient movements and cough reflexes during percutaneous tracheostomy were lower in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .001). The overall incidences of tachycardia and hypertension (which required higher doses of esmolol and urapidil, respectively) were also lower in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .05). Three patients in group S had respiratory depression compared to X in the D1 group and X in the D2 group. The surgeon satisfaction score was significantly higher in group D2 than in both other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS During percutaneous tracheostomy, compared with sufentanil, DEX (1 μg·kg for 10 minutes, then adjusted to 0.2-0.7 μg·kg·hour) can provide the desired attenuation of the hemodynamic response without increased adverse events. Consequently, DEX could be used safely and effectively during percutaneous tracheostomy in TBI patients.","Gao, Jian; Wei, Limin; Xu, Guangjun; Ren, Chunguang; Zhang, Zongwang; Liu, Yanchao",Medicine,40,1

The aim of this study was to assess the association between healthcare workers' characteristics and knowledge, attitudes and practices toward Zika virus. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study that collected data from healthcare workers at 3 medical facilities using a validated self-administered questionnaire between July 2017 - September 2017. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between sociodemographic and knowledge, attitudes, and practices. RESULTS A total of 190 healthcare workers were analyzed. Of these, 60, 72.6 and 64.7% had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices toward Zika virus, respectively. Healthcare workers without a formal degree were less likely to have good knowledge of Zika virus (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0:49; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.24-0.99) compared to those with a formal degree. Reduced odds for positive attitude towards Zika virus were observed in healthcare workers with low income as compared to those with high income (AOR = 0.31; 95% CI =0.13-0.75). Being younger than 40 years old was associated with poor Zika virus practices (AOR = 0:34; 95% CI = 0.15-0.79). CONCLUSIONS Significant association between healthcare workers' sociodemographic characteristics and Zika virus knowledge, attitudes and practices were observed. Public health interventions that seek to increase Zika virus awareness should aim to train healthcare workers who are younger, without formal degree and those earning low income.","Francis, Donya L; Wongsin, Utoomporn; Chien, Shuo-Chen; Hsu, Yi-Hsin Elsa; Lohmeyer, Franziska Michaela; Jian, Wen-Shan; Lin, Li-Fong; Iqbal, Usman",BMC infectious diseases,40,1

Our primary goal was to determine whether fibrin glue adds to the tensile strength of conduit-assisted primary digital nerve repairs. Our secondary goal was to evaluate the impact of varying suture number and location on the tensile strength. METHODS Ninety cadaveric digital nerves were harvested and divided equally into the following repair groups: A (4/4), B (2/2), C (0/2), D (0/1), and E (0/0) with the first number referring to the number of sutures at the coaptation and the second number referring to the number of sutures at each proximal and distal end of the nerve-conduit junction. When fibrin glue was added, the group was labeled prime. The nerve specimens were transected and then repaired with 8-0 nylon suture and conduit. The tensile strength of the repairs was tested, and maximum failure load was determined. The results were analyzed with a 2-way analysis of variance. The Tukey post hoc test compared repair groups if the 2-way analysis of variance showed significance. RESULTS Both suture group and glue presence significantly affected the maximum failure load. Increasing the number of sutures increased the maximum failure load, and the presence of fibrin glue also increased the failure load. CONCLUSIONS Fibrin glue was found to increase the strength of conduit-assisted primary digital nerve repairs. Furthermore, the number of sutures correlated to the strength of the repair. Fibrin glue may be added to a conduit-assisted primary digital nerve repair to maintain strength and allow fewer sutures at the primary coaptation site.","Childe, Jessica R; Regal, Steven; Schimoler, Patrick; Kharlamov, Alexander; Miller, Mark C; Tang, Peter",Hand,40,1

To reduce hospitalizations, regular follow-up appointments with gastroenterologists are essential. However, the mean wait time for gastroenterology clinic appointments significantly exceeded the target goal of 14 days in North America. Based on literature review, we developed and implemented a new appointment scheduling protocol. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were recently hospitalized or newly referred to a gastroenterology clinic. At weeks 0 and 12, wait times were extrapolated from chart review, and patient satisfaction rates were collected via surveys. Patient demographics and outcome data were examined using descriptive statistics. A total of 16 patients were included. Following the intervention, the mean wait time decreased from 40.4 (SD = 31.9) to 21.9 days (SD = 11.4), but the change was statistically insignificant (p = .408). Poor response rates (47%) limited the interpretation of the patient satisfaction data. Despite the small sample size, our project was the first quality improvement initiative that implemented an evidence-based appointment scheduling protocol among adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Further studies are warranted with a larger sample size to better evaluate its efficacy in achieving timely outpatient gastroenterology care.","Choe, Monica Y; VanGraafeiland, Brigit; Parian, Alyssa",Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates,40,1

Nurse executives were recruited via personal invitations to participate in the study. Participants were asked about their current challenges of COVID-19 on health care delivery, their leadership style, and what innovative processes their teams deployed. Using a thematic analysis approach, 3 themes emerged and resonated from the interviews: the importance of communication; the need for leadership presence; and mental toughness. With any health care crisis, leadership is essential to guide followers. As demonstrated by these findings, communication, leadership presence, and mental toughness are 3 key components to promoting and providing quality care in an austere, complex, and changing health care environment.

This article provides a biopsychosocial perspective on the COVID pandemic and an editorial comment on the articles in this Special Issue of Psychosomatic Medicine. Based on analysis of the PubMed database, it is shown that the attention to psychological and social factors is 74% higher in COVID-19-related articles compared to all other health-related scientific articles published during the same time-period (between 1/1/2020 and 4/18/2021). Specifically, 18.6% of the ≈123,500 articles addressing COVID-19-related topics also included psychological or social factors in their content vs. 10.7% of articles that did not address COVID-19. The biopsychosocial model is relevant to understanding the interrelationships among risk factors and the multidimensional clinical and psychosocial COVID-19 outcomes. Clinical outcomes directly related to COVID-19 range from severe but rare events (mortality and intensive care treatment) to less severe common outcomes such as positive screening tests for COVID-19 with or without symptoms. In addition, psychosocial outcomes range in severity from frequently observed reduced psychological wellbeing to less common clinical mood and anxiety disorders and, in rare cases, suicidality. The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by an unusually strong and short-term link between social factors and biological aspects of the disease, without mediating psychological factors. After a review of the articles presented in this Special Issue, this editorial concludes with suggestions for biopsychosocial models in research on COVID-19 and other large-scale health threats.","Kop, Willem J",Psychosomatic medicine,40,31

Survival, post epidemic-quality of life, and consumption of medical resources required to achieve the set goal are crucial for making triage decisions. The pandemic triage decisions should be based on a protocol, considering the need for medical measures and therapy benefits. The first step is to consider the exclusion criteria and the risk of death. The next step is sequential clinical assessment, repeatable at defined intervals. It seems that the preferable solution is to triage all the patients and give priority to those who would benefit more.

80071,80071,80071,Laparoscopic Ovariectomy in a Domestic Yak.,14.311834,9.763785,2020,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nonstructural protein 2 (ns2) is a 2',5'-phosphodiesterase that inhibits activation of the interferon-induced oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. Enzymatically active ns2 is required for efficient MHV replication in macrophages, as well as for the induction of hepatitis in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, following intranasal or intracranial inoculation, efficient replication of MHV in the brain is not dependent on an enzymatically active ns2. The replication of wild-type MHV strain A59 (A59) and a mutant with an inactive phosphodiesterase (ns2-H126R) was assessed in primary hepatocytes and primary central nervous system (CNS) cell types-neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. A59 and ns2-H126R replicated with similar kinetics in all cell types tested, except macrophages and microglia. RNase L activity, as assessed by rRNA cleavage, was induced by ns2-H126R, but not by A59, and only in macrophages and microglia. Activation of RNase L correlated with the induction of type I interferon and the consequent high levels of OAS mRNA induced in these cell types. Pretreatment of nonmyeloid cells with interferon restricted A59 and ns2-H126R to the same extent and failed to activate RNase L following infection, despite induction of OAS expression. However, rRNA degradation was induced by treatment of astrocytes or oligodendrocytes with poly(I·C). Thus, RNase L activation during MHV infection is cell type specific and correlates with relatively high levels of expression of OAS genes, which are necessary but not sufficient for induction of an effective RNase L antiviral response.","Zhao, Ling; Birdwell, L Dillon; Wu, Ashley; Elliott, Ruth; Rose, Kristine M; Phillips, Judith M; Li, Yize; Grinspan, Judith; Silverman, Robert H; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,40,1

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) portends a poorer prognosis and often precludes patients from potential liver resection.4-6 We herein report a case of laparoscopic hepatectomy and thrombectomy in a patient with HCC and BDTT. METHODS CT, ERCP, and POCS showed a 40-mm tumor located in the right lobe with BDTT. A five 12-mm trocar was inserted at the umbilicus for laparoscope, the epigastrium, both sides of the hypochondrium, and right lateral region. Moreover, a 5-mm trocar was inserted at left hypochondrium. After cholecystectomy, hepatoduodenal ligament was encircled using the tourniquet through 5-mm trocar site. The right portal vein was transected by stapler following transection of the right hepatic artery. After ICG staining (0.5 mg/body i.v.),7 hepatic parenchymal transection was performed using clamp-crashing technique. Moreover, CUSA also was used near Glissonian sheath. BDTT was removed from the right BD. Moreover, the cholangioscopy confirmed no BDTT remnants. The resection stump was then sutured. Finally, the right hepatic vein was divided with a stapler. A drainage tube was placed in the right subphrenic space. Operation time was 496 min, and blood loss was 91 ml. The patient was discharged without complications on postoperative day 11. Pathological diagnosis showed moderately differentiated HCC, tumor size 40 × 45 mm with negative surgical margins.

Despite this, limited evidence exists to substantiate claims that digital alerting can improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to appraise the evidence on the clinical outcomes of digital alerting systems in remote monitoring through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature search, with no language restrictions, was performed to identify studies evaluating healthcare outcomes of digital sensor alerting systems used in remote monitoring across all (medical and surgical) cohorts. The primary outcome was hospitalisation; secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, emergency department and outpatient visits. Standard, pooled hazard ratio and proportion of means meta-analyses were performed. A total of 33 studies met the eligibility criteria; of which, 23 allowed for a meta-analysis. A 9.6% mean decrease in hospitalisation favouring digital alerting systems from a pooled random effects analysis was noted. However, pooled weighted mean differences and hazard ratios did not reproduce this finding. Digital alerting reduced hospital LOS by a mean difference of 1.043 days. A 3% mean decrease in all-cause mortality from digital alerting systems was noted. There was no benefit of digital alerting with respect to emergency department or outpatient visits. Digital alerts can considerably reduce hospitalisation and length of stay for certain cohorts in remote monitoring. Further research is required to confirm these findings and trial different alerting protocols to understand optimal alerting to guide future widespread implementation.","Iqbal, Fahad M; Lam, Kyle; Joshi, Meera; Khan, Sadia; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",NPJ digital medicine,40,7

Self-management is fundamental to good diabetes care, and self-management interventions have been found to improve outcomes in older adults. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of self-management interventions in young adults (aged 15-39 years) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. METHODS We searched five databases and two clinical trial registries from 2003 to February 2019, without language restrictions. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of self-management interventions with usual care or enhanced usual care in young adults. Outcomes of interest included clinical outcomes, psychological health, self-care behaviours, diabetes knowledge and self-efficacy. Pairwise meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model and quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria. We followed Cochrane gold standard systematic review methodology and reported this systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was registered with PROSEPRO (CRD42018110868). RESULTS In total, 13 studies (1002 participants) were included. Meta-analysis showed no difference between self-management interventions and controls in post-intervention HbA1c levels, BMI, depression, diabetes-related distress, overall self-care, diabetes knowledge and self-efficacy. Quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS Current self-management interventions did not improve outcomes in young adults with diabetes. Our findings, which contrast with those from systematic reviews in older adults, highlight the need for the development of more effective interventions for young adults with diabetes.","Wong, S K W; Smith, H E; Chua, J J S; Griva, K; Cartwright, E J; Soong, A J; Dalan, R; Tudor Car, L",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,40,1

Recent phylogenomic studies indicate that the freshwater 'microturbellarian' Bothrioplana semperi may be the closest ancestor to the Neodermata, but this hypothesis receives little morphological support. Therefore, additional morphological and ultrastructural characters that might help understand interrelations within the Neodermata are needed. METHODS Ultrastructure of the excretory ducts of representatives of the most basal parasitic flatworms (Neodermata), namely monocotylid (Monopisthocotylea) and chimaericolid (Polyopisthocotylea) monogeneans, aspidogastreans (Trematoda), as well as gyrocotylidean and amphilinidean tapeworms (Cestoda), were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS The present study revealed the same pattern of the cytoarchitecture of excretory ducts in all studied species of the basal neodermatans. This pattern is characterised by the presence of septate junctions between the adjacent epithelial cells and lateral ciliary flames along different levels of the excretory ducts. Additionally, a new character was observed in the protonephridial terminal cell of Gyrocotyle urna, namely a septate junction between terminal and adjacent duct cells at the level of the distal extremity of the flame tuft. In Amphilina foliacea, a new type of protonephridial cell with multiple flame bulbs and unique character of its weir, which consists of a single row of the ribs, is described. A remarkable difference has been observed between the structure of the luminal surface of the excretory ducts of the studied basal neodermatan groups and B. semperi. CONCLUSIONS The present study does not provide ultrastructural support for a close relationship between the Neodermata and B. semperi.","Poddubnaya, Larisa G; Kuchta, Roman; Scholz, Tomáš",Parasites & vectors,40,19

This is based on an implicit assumption that medical domain knowledge represented by uncommon words or jargon form the sole barriers to health information access among the public. Our study challenged this by showing that, for readers from non-English speaking backgrounds with higher education attainment, semantic features of English health texts that underpin the knowledge structure of English health texts, rather than medical jargon, can explain the cognitive accessibility of health materials among readers with better understanding of English health terms yet limited exposure to English-based health education environments and traditions. OBJECTIVE Our study explores multidimensional semantic features for developing machine learning algorithms to predict the perceived level of cognitive accessibility of English health materials on health risks and diseases for young adults enrolled in Australian tertiary institutes. We compared algorithms to evaluate the cognitive accessibility of health information for nonnative English speakers with advanced education levels yet limited exposure to English health education environments. METHODS We used 113 semantic features to measure the content complexity and accessibility of original English resources. Using 1000 English health texts collected from Australian and international health organization websites rated by overseas tertiary students, we compared machine learning (decision tree, support vector machine [SVM], ensemble tree, and logistic regression) after hyperparameter optimization (grid search for the best hyperparameter combination of minimal classification errors). We applied 10-fold cross-validation on the whole data set for the model training and testing, and calculated the area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy as the measurement of the model performance. RESULTS We developed and compared 4 machine learning algorithms using multidimensional semantic features as predictors. The results showed that ensemble tree (LogitBoost) outperformed in terms of AUC (0.97), sensitivity (0.966), specificity (0.972), and accuracy (0.969). Decision tree (AUC 0.924, sensitivity 0.912, specificity 0.9358, and accuracy 0.924) and SVM (AUC 0.8946, sensitivity 0.8952, specificity 0.894, and accuracy 0.8946) followed closely. Decision tree, ensemble tree, and SVM achieved statistically significant improvement over logistic regression in AUC, specificity, and accuracy. As the best performing algorithm, ensemble tree reached statistically significant improvement over SVM in AUC, specificity, and accuracy, and statistically significant improvement over decision tree in sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that cognitive accessibility of English health texts is not limited to word length and sentence length as had been conventionally measured by medical readability formulas. We compared machine learning algorithms based on semantic features to explore the cognitive accessibility of health information for nonnative English speakers. The results showed the new models reached statistically increased AUC, sensitivity, and accuracy to predict health resource accessibility for the target readership. Our study illustrated that semantic features such as cognitive ability-related semantic features, communicative actions and processes, power relationships in health care settings, and lexical familiarity and diversity of health texts are large contributors to the comprehension of health information; for readers such as international students, semantic features of health texts outweigh syntax and domain knowledge.","Ji, Meng; Liu, Yanmeng; Hao, Tianyong",JMIR medical informatics,40,17

Despite best current therapies, patients with recurrent MB experience have an alarmingly high mortality rate and often have limited therapeutic options beyond inadequate chemotherapy or experimental clinical trials. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature regarding treatment strategies employed in recurrent pediatric MB will evaluate previous salvage therapies in order to guide future clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review will be to investigate the efficacy and safety of salvage therapies for the management of children with progressive, treatment-refractory, or recurrent MB. METHODS We will conduct literature searches (from 1995 onwards) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies examining the survival and toxicity of therapies administered to treatment-refractory pediatric MB patients will be included. Two reviewers will independently assess the search results based on predefined selection criteria, complete data abstraction, and quality assessment. The primary outcomes of this review will be overall and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes will include safety and toxicity of each therapy administered. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. Due to the nature of the research question and published literature, we expect large inter-study heterogeneity and therefore will use random effects regression analysis to extract the combined effect. In additional analyses, we will investigate the role of re-irradiation and mono- vs. poly-therapy in recurrent disease, and whether molecular subgrouping of MB influences salvage therapy. DISCUSSION This systematic review will provide an overview of the current literature regarding salvage therapies for relapsed MB patients. Investigation of clinically tested therapies for children with recurrent MB has significant implications for clinical practice. By reviewing the efficacy and toxicity of MB salvage therapies, this study will identify effective therapeutic strategies administered to recurrent MB patients and can inform future clinical trials aimed to improve patient survivorship and quality of life.

Data on the rates of pituitary dysfunction and recovery in a large cohort of NFPA patients undergoing ETSS and the predictors of endocrine function before and after ETSS are scarce. This study is purposed to analyze the comprehensive changes in hormonal function and identify factors that predict recovery or worsening of hormonal axes following ETSS for NFPA. METHODS A retrospective review of 601 consecutive patients who underwent ETSS between 2010 and 2018 at one institution was performed. Recovery or development of new hypopituitarism was analyzed in 209 NFPA patients who underwent ETSS. RESULTS Patients with preoperative endocrine deficits (59.8%) in one or more pituitary axes had larger tumor volumes (P = 0.001) than those without preoperative deficits. Recovery of preoperative pituitary deficit occurred in all four axes, with overall mean recovery of 29.7%. The cortisol axis showed the highest recovery whereas the thyroid axis showed the lowest, with 1-year cumulative recovery rates of 44.3% and 6.1%, respectively. Postoperative hypopituitarism occurred overall in 17.2%, most frequently in the thyroid axis (24.3%, 27/111) and least frequently in the cortisol axis (9.7%, 16/165). Axis-specific predictors of post-operative recovery and deficiency were identified. CONCLUSIONS Dynamic alterations in pituitary hormones were observed in a proportion of patients following ETSS in NFPA patients. Postoperative endocrine vulnerability, recovery, and factors that predicted recovery or loss of endocrine function depended on the hormonal system, necessitating an axis-specific surveillance strategy postoperatively.","Hwang, Jenie Y; Aum, Diane J; Chicoine, Michael R; Dacey, Ralph G; Osbun, Joshua W; Rich, Keith M; Zipfel, Gregory J; Klatt-Cromwell, Cristine N; McJunkin, Jonathan L; Pipkorn, Patrik; Schneider, John S; Silverstein, Julie M; Kim, Albert H",Pituitary,40,1

Staging allows surgeons to do the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) first with the conversion only happening when a failure or technical challenge is identified. PURPOSE We present the mid-term outcomes of SADI bypass surgery after SG. METHOD A retrospective analysis was performed on a prospective database from four institutions. Ninety-six patients were identified from 2013 to 2018. Patients were divided into two groups: one had two-stage SADI because of insufficient weight loss, the second had planned two-stage SADI because of super obesity (BMI > 50 kg/m2). Incidence of complications was divided into < 30 days and > 30 days. RESULT Of 96 patients, 3 patients were completely lost to follow-up. The mean age was 44.8 ± 11.3 years. There were no deaths or conversion to open surgery. The postoperative early complication and late complication rate was 5.3% and 6.4% respectively. At 24 months, group 2 had higher %weight loss (WL) and change in BMI units compared to group 1 with statistically significant difference. The average WL and change in BMI for entire patient's population at 24 months after 2nd stage SADI was 20.5% and 9.4 units respectively. The remission rate for DM was 93.7% with or without the use of medication. CONCLUSION The two-stage approach to SADI-S appears technically simpler than a single compromised operation. However, this approach needs more patients to understand its limitations.","Zaveri, Hinali; Surve, Amit; Cottam, Daniel; Ng, Peter C; Enochs, Paul; Billy, Helmuth; Medlin, Walter; Richards, Christina; Belnap, LeGrand; Sharp, Lindsey S; Bermudez, Dustin M; Fairley, Ryan; Burns, Tricia A; Herrell, Krista; Bull, Jaime; Menozzi, Sophia E; Student, John Ambrose",Obesity surgery,40,16

Sociocultural ideas shape the perception of parents on the effect of tobacco smoke thus influence their behaviour on reducing the smoke exposure on their child. The present study aimed to explore the perceptions of parents of under-5-year-old children with pneumonia about the effects of exposure to tobacco smoke. DESIGN AND METHODS This qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach. The study participants were 11 parents of under-5-year-old children with pneumonia in Manggarai, Eastern Indonesia. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and then analyzed using the Colaizzi method. RESULTS The themes identified in the present study were i) ""I know the risk of smoke, I can't help it"" various perceptions on tobacco smoke effect; ii) tobacco causes shortness of breath on under-5-year-old children; and iii) tobacco smoke taking tolls on family's health and economy. CONCLUSIONS The findings revealed that parent view tobacco smoke endanger children's health and hamper the socio-economic well-being of the family. It is necessary to improve parent's awareness about the effects of tobacco smoke through effective nursing communication that suits the family's needs and conditions.","Danal, Paskaliana Hilpriska; Nurhaeni, Nani; Agustini, Nur",Journal of public health research,40,1

The aim of this case report was to identify whether this variant is a double plantaris or a third head of the gastrocnemius according to its morphological characteristics and innervation. METHODS The muscles were displayed by careful dissection and delineation of surrounding structures. The size of each of the muscle bellies and tendons of those extra muscles were measured manually by the vernier caliper. RESULTS The origin of each extra muscle was lateral to the tibial nerve and superior to the plantaris, and each extra muscle which transitioned to a descending tendon parallel to the plantaris had a cone-shaped belly. However, the tendon of the extra muscles was fused into the investing fascia of the gastrocnemius with a tendon length of 4.5 cm on the left and 4.6 cm on the right. The extra muscles were innervated by the branch of the tibial nerve to the medial head of the gastrocnemius on both sides. CONCLUSION Although they had an origin and shape similar to that of the plantaris, we identified the extra muscles in this case as a third head of the gastrocnemius, because of innervation to the plantaris arises directly from the tibial nerve. This case highlighted that the innervation is essential to understanding the myogenesis of extra muscles, especially in cases which are difficult to categorize based on the morphological features of the muscle.","Ishii, Takaya; Kawagishi, Kyutaro; Hayashi, Shogo; Yamada, Shinnosuke; Yoshioka, Hirotaka; Matsuno, Yoshiharu; Mori, Yasutake; Kosaka, Jun",Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,40,16

However, compared to open liver resection (OLR), the feasibility of laparoscopic anatomical liver resection for centrally located tumor (CLT) has not been clearly established. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic anatomical major liver resection for CLT. METHODS From April 2011 to March 2016, 20 cases of anatomical LLR and 86 cases of OLR for CLTs such as central hepatectomy (CH) and right anterior sectionectomy (RAS) were performed at a single institution. We performed one-to-one propensity score matching and analyzed short-term outcomes between the LLR (n = 20) and OLR (n = 20) groups. RESULTS Among 20 cases in the LLR group, two cases underwent open conversion due to common bile duct injury and anatomical distortion, respectively. There were no statistically significant difference between the LLR and OLR groups regarding clamping time of the Pringle maneuver (p = 0.502), blood loss (p = 0.746), surgical margin (p = 0.198), or length of hospital stay (p = 0.110). However, surgical time was significantly longer in the LLR group than in the OLR group (388 vs 268 min; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to morbidity rate or mean comprehensive complication index (p = 0.716 and p = 0.819, respectively). CONCLUSION Total anatomical LLR can be performed safely in selected CLT patients by experienced surgeons. Laparoscopic CH or RAS appears feasible with non-inferior perioperative outcomes compared to OLR.","Cho, Chan Woo; Rhu, Jinsoo; Kwon, Choon Hyuck David; Choi, Gyu-Seong; Kim, Jong Man; Joh, Jae-Won; Koh, Kwang-Cheol; Kim, Gaab Soo",World journal of surgery,40,30

However, doubts still persist regarding long-term weight loss, and the 5-year results are awaited. Whether the aetiology of failed excess weight loss is the result of an inadequate sleeve or attributable to dilatation of the sleeve is not clear. In an effort to prevent gastric dilatation and increase gastric restriction to promote further weight loss in the long term, we performed a combined procedure of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with sleeve gastrectomy. The patient was a 39-year-old woman with a life-long history of obesity and a body mass index of 79.8 kg/m(2). The surgical technique of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded sleeve gastrectomy is described. There were no immediate complications, and the patient was discharged home on the third postoperative day. She is doing extremely well on clinic follow-up at 6 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded sleeve gastrectomy, as a primary operation, has not been described in the literature. It is hoped that this combined procedure will be most useful in the super-super obese (body mass index > 60) patients.

SARS-CoV-2 previously accumulated mutations at a much slower rate, of 1-2 per month; the sudden appearance of a large cluster of mutations was thought to be unusual. We now suspect that VOC may have arisen from immunosuppressed individuals who shed virus for longer periods. Epidemiological analyses estimate VOC to be more infectious; this is of most concern because these estimates were calculated during periods where many regions of the UK were in high social distancing restrictions. Therefore, the previous 'tiered' system implemented in the UK was ineffective at containing VOC. The most likely reason for this is that previous restrictions, no matter how strict, still allowed for gatherings in certain places. VOC also has implications for the national vaccination programme - a higher proportion of people will need to be vaccinated with a more infectious virus. Prolongation of the second dose of vaccines to increase vaccine uptake has understandably caused concern, but is based on sound immunological principles. There is now an urgent need to monitor the effect of new variants on vaccine efficacy - marking a new chapter in the global fight against COVID-19.","Pan, Daniel; Mudalige, Nadeesha Lakmal; Sze, Shirley; Koeckerling, David; Oyefeso, Oluwatobiloba; Barker, Joseph; Williams, Caroline Ml; Tang, Julian W; Pareek, Manish",Clinical medicine,40,24

Data show that the measurement of cardiac output (CO) is strongly influenced by changes in factors that affect arterial blood pressure (ABP) - for example, vascular tone and compliance and the arterial site - independently of true changes in CO. Although in theory the autocalibration algorithm of FloTrac-Vigileo should adjust for those changes, the model undercompensates (or overcompensates) for prominent increases (or decreases) in vascular tone and compliance, making the system largely dependent on changes in ABP. These limitations make FloTrac-Vigileo accurate in stable haemodynamic conditions only, and until more robust algorithms and further validation studies become available, we should be aware that during haemodynamic instability or in extreme conditions of vasodilation or vasoconstriction, the measured CO may diverge from an independent bolus indicator dilution measurement, particularly if a peripheral artery is used. In these conditions, we advocate the use of transpulmonary indicator dilution via a femoral artery.","Camporota, Luigi; Beale, Richard",Critical care,40,6

It is one of the most commonly used approaches for laparoscopic hernia repair in children. However, most percutaneous techniques have utilized extracorporeal knotting of the suture and burying the knot subcutaneously. This approach has several drawbacks. The aim of this study is to present a modified technique for single cannula needlescopic assisted hernia repair in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS Three-hundred and fifty-seven patients with 397 indirect inguinal hernias underwent a one port needlescopic assisted inguinal hernia repair. The open internal inguinal ring [IIR] was closed using an 18-gauge epidural needle [EN], a 14-gauge venous access cannula [VAC], and a homemade suture device. Saline was injected extraperitoneally around the IIR for hydrodissection. The main outcome measurements were: feasibility, safety of the technique, operative time, recurrence rate, and cosmetic results. RESULTS This prospective study was conducted on 357 patients at Al-Azhar, Alexandria, and Mansoura University Hospitals during the period from June 2012 to October 2015. There were 286 males and 71 females. The mean age was 2.6±1.3years (range=4months to 6years). One-hundred and ninety-eight patients presented with a right-sided inguinal hernia, 119 patients with a left-sided hernia, and 40 patients with bilateral inguinal hernia. The mean operative time was 12.6±1.7min (range=8-15min) for unilateral cases and 18.6±1.7min (range=14-20min) for the bilateral repairs. No wound complications or umbilical hernias developed. The mean follow-up period was 18.6±1.2months (range=11-36months). During the follow-up period, no recurrence was detected, and the scars were nearly invisible. CONCLUSION This preliminary study shows that a single port needlescopic assisted hernia repair in infants and children is a very promising technique to achieve nearly scarless surgery. The procedure is very safe, rapid, easy to learn, and reproducible.","Shalaby, Rafik; Elsayaad, Ibrahim; Alsamahy, Omar; Ibrahem, Refaat; El-Saied, Adham; Ismail, Maged; Shamseldin, Abdelmoniem; Shehata, Sameh; Magid, Mohamad",Journal of pediatric surgery,40,1

We sought to explore what clinical information is readily available to patients who have been offered innovative surgical procedures, using two examples drawn from our recent experience: one a surgical technique, and the other a prosthetic material. We wanted to determine from our review the extent to which information available on the Internet might augment the medical literature and help satisfy the ethical requirements for patients to be adequately informed before they proceed with innovative surgery. METHODS A scoping review of the medical literature was performed to look for studies addressing the review aims; targeted searches on Google, YouTube, and patient websites were carried out to find readily available patient information on two chosen innovative surgical procedures. We conducted a content analysis of the selected references to determine the availability, relevance, and the utility of the published information to a layperson. RESULTS Medical database searches identified 614 records, 91 were screened and only six were relevant. The Internet searches returned thousands of results; however, we limited our screening to the first five pages of results for those sources. From both types of searches, 348 references were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria and 51 were included in the analysis. The findings are presented in four themes: safety and feasibility of the technique, availability and accessibility to a layperson, relevance and utility to a layperson, and commercial information. CONCLUSION The review has shown that lay people seeking to find out more about the two innovations would get very little useful information from Google, YouTube, or patient websites. Practitioners offering SI should provide sufficient information to allow their patients to make an autonomous decision about whether to proceed. For major SI, we encourage innovators to develop a plain language statement that would be made available on the Internet to the mutual advantage of both innovators and patients.","Eyers, Tony; Krastev, Yordanka",Yearbook of medical informatics,40,1

In some of these cancer types, such as medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a sensitive diagnostic modality is still unavailable and therapeutic options for inoperable lesions are needed. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) may be a viable therapeutic strategy in the management of these patients. Several CCK2R-targeted radiopharmaceuticals have been described in recent years. As part of the European Union COST Action BM0607 we studied the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of 12 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated CCK2R binding peptides. In the present study, we analysed binding and internalization characteristics. Stability, biodistribution and imaging studies have been performed in parallel by other centres involved in the project. METHODS Determination of IC(50) values was performed using autoradiography, with DOTA-peptides displacing (125)I-CCK from receptors on tissue sections from human tumours. Saturation binding and internalization experiments were performed using (111)In-labelled peptides. The rat AR42J cell line and the human A431-CCK2R transfected cell line were utilized for in vitro experiments; dissociation constants (K(d)) and apparent number of binding sites (B(max)) were determined. Internalization was determined in receptor-expressing cells by incubating with tracer amounts of peptide at 37 and 4°C for different times up to 120 min. Surface-bound peptide was then stripped either by acid wash or subsequent incubation with 1 μM unlabelled peptide at 4°C. RESULTS All peptides showed high receptor affinity with IC(50) values ranging from 0.2 to 3.4 nM. Saturation experiments also showed high affinity with K(d) values in the 10(-9)-10(-8) M range. B(max) values estimated in A431-CCK2R cells ranged from 0.6 to 2.2 × 10(6) per cell. All peptides showed high levels of internalization when incubated at 37°C. CONCLUSION All DOTA-conjugated peptides showed high receptor binding and internalization properties and appear suitable for further characterization, as described in other articles of this issue.","Aloj, Luigi; Aurilio, Michela; Rinaldi, Valentina; D'ambrosio, Laura; Tesauro, Diego; Peitl, Petra Kolenc; Maina, Theodosia; Mansi, Rosalba; von Guggenberg, Elisabeth; Joosten, Lieke; Sosabowski, Jane K; Breeman, Wouter A P; De Blois, Erik; Koelewijn, Stuart; Melis, Marleen; Waser, Beatrice; Beetschen, Karin; Reubi, Jean Claude; de Jong, Marion",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,40,9

There appears to be an emerging type of health professional migrants 'education tourists' who travel to other countries to obtain medical education creating new routes of migration and this presents new challenges to source and destination countries. The global shortage of doctors and other health professionals further exacerbates health inequalities as seen in the present pandemic and therefore the increased need for research into health professionals' migration and their integration.","Davda, Latha S; Radford, David R; Gallagher, Jennifer E",International journal of health policy and management,40,12

Identifying athletes at risk of injury is the key to target injury-prevention programmes. Functional performance tests (FPT) assess an athlete's ability to produce and accept forces during movement tasks reflective of those experienced in sport, and are used to identify deficits in physical qualities or neuromuscular control. This review aims to identify FPT which have potential to predict LEI and assess their measurement properties associated with reliability, validity, responsiveness and practicability (interpretability and feasibility). METHODS/ANALYSIS This protocol will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments Methodology. The search strategy has two stages: stage 1 will identify lower limb FPT used in athletic populations; and stage 2 will assess the measurement properties of the identified FPT. A sensitive search strategy will use MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and SPORTdiscus databases; from inception to June 2020. Hand searching reference lists, key journals and grey literature will be completed. One reviewer will complete search 1 and data extraction. Two reviewers will complete the search, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment for search 2. Evidence will be pooled or summarised by individual measurement property by each individual study and grouped by FPT. Meta-analysis using a random effects model with subgroup analysis will be performed where possible. Pooled or summarised results for each FPT in relation to each measurement property will be rated against the criteria for good measurement properties. Two reviewers will assess the overall body of evidence per measurement property per FPT using the modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidelines. This review will enable clinicians to make an informed choice when selecting FPT. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is required for this review and the results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and submitted for conference presentation.

The effort-dependent lung injury has been termed 'patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI)' in 2017. As one of the potential strategies to render spontaneous effort less injurious in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the role of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is now discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Experimental and clinical data indicate that vigorous spontaneous effort may worsen lung injury, whereas, at the same time, the intensity of spontaneous effort seems difficult to control when lung injury is severe. Experimental studies found that higher PEEP strategy can be effective to reduce lung injury from spontaneous effort while maintaining some muscle activity. The recent clinical trial to reevaluate systemic early neuromuscular blockade in moderate-severe ARDS (i.e., reevaluation of systemic early neuromuscular blockade (ROSE) trial) support that a higher PEEP strategy can facilitate 'safe' spontaneous breathing under the light sedation targets (i.e., no increase in barotrauma nor 90 days mortality versus early muscle paralysis). SUMMARY To prevent P-SILI in ARDS, it seems feasible to facilitate 'safe' spontaneous breathing in patients using a higher PEEP strategy in severe ARDS.","Yoshida, Takeshi; Grieco, Domenico L; Brochard, Laurent; Fujino, Yuji",Current opinion in critical care,40,1

The exact mechanisms underlying the protective effects of FO remain elusive. Here we applied the metabolomic technique to investigate the potential involvement of FO metabolites in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors in LPS-injected mice. It revealed that LPS-injection stimulated systemic inflammation, exhausted the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) level in the brain, decreased energy metabolism and impaired neuronal function, which collectively contributed to depressive-like behaviors in mice. FO treatment enhanced the production of neuroprotective metabolites including taurine, hypotaurine and tyramine, decreased the generation of neurotoxic agents such as ADPR, glutamate accumulation and oxidized glutathione, and prevented the NAD exhaustion in the brain, which might underlie the beneficial effects of FO against LPS-induced inflammation and depressive-like behaviors.","Peng, Yu; Shi, Zhe; Kumaran Satyanarayanan, Senthil; He, Chengwei; Li, Peng; Wan, Jian-Bo; Su, Huanxing","Brain, behavior, and immunity",40,23

In the D-dimer blood concentrations to exclude LA thrombus in patients with AF study, two D-dimer cut-offs were compared to exclude LA thrombus prior to cardioversion. One was fixed to 500 ng/mL (DD500), based on clinical practice where such values are commonly accepted to exclude a thrombus. The other cut-off was adjusted to 10 times the patient's age (DDAge), based on the cut-off used to exclude pulmonary embolism. METHODS 142 consecutive patients with non-valvular AF aged 69.7±11.4 years (52% with paroxysmal AF) referred for precardioversion TOE to exclude LA thrombus were prospectively enrolled. D-dimers were measured at the time of TOE by an ELISA test. RESULTS LA thrombus was excluded with TOE in 129 (91%) and confirmed in 13 (9%) patients. D-dimers were significantly lower in patients without LA thrombus (729±611 vs 2376±1081 ng/L; p<0.05). DDAge indicated absence of LA thrombus with higher specificity than DD500 (66.4% vs 50.4%; p<0.05). Both cut-offs were able to identify all 13 patients with LA thrombus (false negative 0%). Patients with D-dimers <DDAge and without LA thrombus (true negative) represented 60.6% of the population and could have safely avoided TOE (flow chart). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the efficacy of D-dimer cut-offs to exclude LA thrombus in patients with AF. Age adjustment greatly increases the proportion of patients in whom LA thrombus can be safely excluded and consequently avoid precardioversion TOE.","Almorad, Alexandre; Ohanyan, Anush; Pintea Bentea, Georgiana; Wielandts, Jean-Yves; El Haddad, Milad; Lycke, Michelle; O'Neill, Louisa; Morissens, Marielle; De Keyzer, Eva; Nguyen, Thomas; Anghel, Laura; Samyn, Sophie; Berdaoui, Brahim; Tavernier, Rene; Vandekerckhove, Yves; Duytschaever, Mattias; Verbeet, Thierry; Knecht, Sebastien; Castro Rodriguez, José",Heart,40,19

Currently, there is no standardized laparoscopic training program available for gynecology residents. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a comprehensive ex vivo training curriculum for gynecologic laparoscopy. STUDY DESIGN In a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force Classification I) postgraduate year 1 and 2 gynecology residents were allocated randomly to receive either conventional residency training or an evidence-based laparoscopy curriculum. The 7-week curriculum consisted of cognitive didactic and interactive sessions, low-fidelity box trainer and high-fidelity virtual reality simulator technical skills, and high-fidelity team simulation. The primary outcome measure was the technical procedure score at laparoscopic salpingectomy with the use of the objective structured assessment of laparoscopic salpingectomy tool. Secondary outcome measures related to performance in multiple-choice questions and technical performance at box trainer and virtual reality simulator tasks. A sample size of 10 residents per group was planned (n = 20). Results are reported as medians (interquartile ranges), and data were compared between groups with the Mann-Whitney U, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests (P ≤ .05). RESULTS In July 2013, 27 residents were assigned randomly (14 curriculum, 13 conventional). Both groups were similar at baseline. Twenty-one residents (10 curriculum, 11 conventional) completed the surgical procedure-based assessment in the operating room (September to December 2013). Our primary outcome indicated that curriculum-trained residents displayed superior performance at laparoscopic salpingectomy (P = .043). Secondary outcomes demonstrated that curriculum-trained residents had higher performance scores on the cognitive multiple-choice questions (P < .001), the nontechnical skills multiple-choice questions (P = .016), box trainer task time (P < .001), and all virtual reality simulator parameters. CONCLUSION Participation in a comprehensive simulation-based training curriculum for gynecologic laparoscopy leads to a superior improvement in knowledge and technical performance in the operating room compared with conventional residency training.","Shore, Eliane M; Grantcharov, Teodor P; Husslein, Heinrich; Shirreff, Lindsay; Dedy, Nicolas J; McDermott, Colleen D; Lefebvre, Guylaine G",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,40,5

Apparently, what matters is not the existence of guidelines, but their implementation. The aim of the present study was to explore nurses' implicit safety theories concerning when to comply with safety rules. Using a multimethod approach, including semistructured interviews (perceptions), observations (real-time behavior), and documentary evidence from 15 nursing units (90 nurses), we found that nurses developed implicit rules for when and how to protect themselves. These included: (a) continue providing care for the patient even at the price of protecting yourself, (b) do not disturb other nurses' work, (c) it cannot happen to me!, (d) be aware of recently occurring accidents, and (e) protect yourself when significant others are present. These implicit rules seemed to be reinforced by personal, social, and contextual factors at the unit, limiting the likelihood that the decision makers (nurses) would discover their fallacy.","Drach-Zahavy, Anat; Somech, Anit",Qualitative health research,40,27

The widespread morbidity it causes worldwide is related to its ubiquitousness rather than its severity. The development of vaccines for the common cold has been difficult because of antigenic variability of the common cold virus and the indistinguishable multiple other viruses and even bacteria acting as infective agents. There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people. OBJECTIVES To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1948 to January week 1, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to January 2013), CINAHL (1981 to January 2013) and LILACS (1982 to January 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus vaccines to prevent the common cold in healthy people. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author. MAIN RESULTS This review included one RCT with 2307 healthy participants; all of them were analysed. This trial compared the effect of an adenovirus vaccine against a placebo. No statistically significant difference in common cold incidence was found: there were 13 events in 1139 participants in the vaccines group and 14 events in 1168 participants in the placebo group; risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 2.02, P = 0.90). No adverse events related to the live vaccine were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This Cochrane review has found a lack of evidence on the effects of vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Only one RCT was found and this did not show differences between comparison groups; it also had a high risk of bias. There are no conclusive data to support the use of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people. We identified the need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Unless RCTs provide evidence of a treatment effect and the trade-off between potential benefits and harms is established, policy-makers, clinicians and academics should not recommend the use of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people. Any future trials on medical treatments for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus vaccines for this condition. Outcome measures should include common cold incidence, vaccine safety and mortality related to the vaccine.","Simancas-Racines, Daniel; Guerra, Claudia V; Hidalgo, Ricardo",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,40,31

Recently, deep learning methods have carried out state-of-the-art performances on medical imaging tasks. However, conventional deep learning has two major drawbacks: 1) insufficient training data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our method to a recent issue (Coronavirus Diagnose). Several studies indicate that lung Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. However, well-labeled training data sets cannot be easily accessed due to the novelty of the disease and the privacy policies. The proposed method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. This study is related to a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Caltech-256, and chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of labeled COVID-19 lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study are: 1) the proposed method benefits from unlabeled data in distant domains which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96% classification accuracy, which is 13% higher classification accuracy than ""non-transfer"" algorithms, and 8% higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms.","Niu, Shuteng; Liu, Meryl; Liu, Yongxin; Wang, Jian; Song, Houbing",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,40,16

This study was designed to clarify the impact of cancer cachexia in patients with AGC who received nivolumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited AGC patients who were treated with nivolumab from October 2017 to December 2019. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without cancer cachexia at the start of nivolumab. Cancer cachexia was defined as weight loss >5%; weight loss >2% and body mass index (BMI) <20; or sarcopenia and BMI <20. Primary endpoints were median overall survival (OS) and median time to treatment failure (TTF), while secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS The study enrolled 44 patients. Median OS and TTF were significantly shorter in patients with cancer cachexia than in those without cancer cachexia (OS: 6.6 vs. 2.3 months; HR=2.65; 95%CI=1.28-5.49; p=0.008, TTF: 2.6 vs. 1.9 months; HR=2.17; 95%CI=1.09-4.32, p=0.027). On Cox proportional hazards analysis, cancer cachexia was significantly associated with shorter OS. The incidence of adverse events did not differ between the two groups. Nivolumab was associated with better OS and TTF outcomes in AGC patients without cachexia than in those with cachexia, albeit there was no difference in the incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSION Cancer cachexia may be associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with AGC treated with nivolumab.","Fujii, Hironori; Makiyama, Akitaka; Iihara, Hirotoshi; Okumura, Naoki; Yamamoto, Senri; Imai, Takeharu; Arakawa, Shinichiro; Kobayashi, Ryo; Tanaka, Yoshihiro; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Suzuki, Akio",Anticancer research,40,9

This was a retrospective cohort study of 93 patients who underwent RATLH in a teaching hospital from July 2008 to June 2012. In the first 44 patients, the vaginal cuff was closed by interrupted polyglactin (Vicryl) 2-0 suture. In the following 49 patients, unidirectional barbed suture (V-loc) in a running fashion was used for cuff closure. Patients were seen 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively to evaluate cuff healing. Age, tobacco use, hemoglobin, deliveries, uterine weight, menopause, steroid use, underlying health problems, and concomitant procedures were found not to be significantly different between the two groups. There was one cuff dehiscence in the unidirectional barbed suture group and none in the interrupted polyglactin group (P > 0.05). The mean cuff healing time (8.5 vs. 7.7 weeks), incidence of cuff cellulitis (4.6 vs. 4.1 %), and postoperative bleeding (22.7 vs. 14.3 %) were not statistically significantly different between polyglactin and barbed suture closures, respectively (P > 0.05). However, polyglactin suture was associated with greater presence of granulation tissue than barbed suture (27.3 vs. 8.2 %, odds ratio = 3.34, P < 0.05). Unidirectional barbed suture cases were associated with shorter total operative times (220.2 vs. 272.8 min) and less estimated blood loss (164.8 vs. 274.9 ml); however, cuff closure times were not specifically measured. In our study, unidirectional barbed suture was identified as possibly superior to polyglactin cuff closure because of less observed granulation tissue, shorter operative duration, and lower estimated blood loss. However, there was no statistical difference in cuff healing time, cuff dehiscence, cellulitis, or postoperative bleeding between the two groups. A prospective randomized trial would be necessary to confirm these findings.","Zhou, Yiwen; Guthrie, Greer; Chuang, Alice; Faro, Jonathan P; Ali, Vaseem",Journal of robotic surgery,40,19

METHODS This is a cross-sectional study of Brazilian civil servants participating in the fourth wave (2012-2013) of the longitudinal Pró-Saúde Study. Associations were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), estimated by multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS Among 2,828 participants, 15.9% would not be willing to vaccinate in the future if the Brazilian Ministry of Health promoted a new vaccination campaign against pandemic influenza. Not willing to vaccinate in the future was strongly associated with not taking the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2010 (OR = 9.0, 95%CI 6.9 - 11.6). Among the unvaccinated, females, those aged > 60 years, and non-health care workers were less willing to vaccinate in the future. Again, in the vaccinated group, females were less willing to vaccinate. CONCLUSION Multidisciplinary efforts should be encouraged in order to identify reasons for refusing vaccination, focusing on the individual and group perceptions of susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers to vaccination.

Given the risks involved with suctioning, it is important to ensure the clinical competence of health care professionals who perform it. A scoping review was conducted to identify the nature and extent of research related to the assessment of airway-suctioning competence for health care professionals working with adults. This included an examination of the assessment context, the type of suctioning and health care professionals being assessed, and the methods used to assess competence. Four scientific electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from inception to March 9, 2018. A gray literature search was also performed. Two reviewers independently screened articles and resources for inclusion, and data were extracted using a form created by the authors. Seventy full text articles and resources were screened for eligibility, with 36 included in the review. Endotracheal suctioning was the most common type, and intensive or critical care units were the primary setting of interest (28 of 36, 78%). Competence or a component of competence for nurses, nursing students, nursing assistants, or nurse technicians was specifically addressed in 97% (35 of 36) of the included articles and resources; 4 of 36 (11%) also included physical therapists, 1 of 36 (3%) included respiratory therapists, and 1 of 36 (3%) was aimed toward all clinicians who perform suctioning. Nine (25%) used questionnaire-based assessments, 11 (31%) used checklists, audit forms, or other observational tools, and 16 (44%) used both. Directed content analysis revealed 3 major themes: consistency across overarching evaluation frameworks, inconsistency across detailed components, and inconsistency in the evaluation or reporting of assessment tool measurement properties. Additional gaps in the literature included limited consideration of health care professionals beyond nursing, limited consideration of settings beyond intensive and critical care, a lack of tools to assess nasotracheal and orotracheal suctioning, and limited detail regarding assessment tool development.","Miller, Erin K; Beavers, Lindsay G; Mori, Brenda; Colquhoun, Heather; Colella, Tracey Jf; Brooks, Dina",Respiratory care,40,1

Its excessive concentrations in the aqueous environments may result in severe and irreversible damage. To fight this hazard, a raw biochar was prepared from Citrullus lanatus L. seeds, then characterized and compared with a MnFe2O4 modified biochar, both tested for U(VI) adsorption from wastewater, which was assayed for the first time in this study. The characterization of the adsorbent materials was performed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) with elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The effects of solution pH, concentration of sorbate and sorbents, temperature, time and ionic strength were assessed as regards their influence on U(VI) adsorption. The experimental adsorption data showed good fit to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model (reaching a value of qe = 15.12 mg g-1, R2 = 0.96 at equilibrium), and to the Langmuir isotherm (achieving a maximum score of qmax = 27.61 mg g-1, R2 = 0.96). The maximum adsorption capacity was found at 318 K. The results of the study indicate that the binding of negatively charged functional groups (carbonyls, hydroxyls, and some carboxylic groups) with MnFe2O4 significantly enhanced U(VI) adsorption. In view of the overall results, it can be concluded that the MnFe2O4 modification of the Citrullus lanatus L. seeds biochar could give an efficient alternative adsorbent for U(VI) removal in a variety of environmental conditions, simultaneously promoting resource utilization and good sustainable management of the materials studied, aiding to protect the environment and human health.","Ahmed, Waqas; Mehmood, Sajid; Núñez-Delgado, Avelino; Ali, Sehrish; Qaswar, Muhammad; Khan, Zulqarnain Haider; Ying, Huang; Chen, Di-Yun",The Science of the total environment,40,5

In comparison to the salubrious role, the deleterious role has received less scrutiny and needs a focused review and conceptual integration. This article selectively reviews the post-2000 studies that demonstrate the harmful physical and mental health consequences of social relationships (intimate relationships and parenthood) and social networks.

Methods Twenty-four patients followed up with vestibular rehabilitation were recruited. Enrolled patients were divided into two groups according to the preservation of high6 frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) based on the video head impulse test (vHIT). The results on the computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) and dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) survey collected at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up with vestibular rehabilitation therapy were analysed. Results Both groups showed significantly increased composite and DHI scores after follow up with vestibular rehabilitation. The high-frequency VOR preserved group showed a better composite score (p = 0.064) and vestibular score (p = 0.008) than the high-frequency VOR loss group at the 6-month follow up. The DHI score was significantly decreased only in the high-frequency VOR loss group (p = 0.047). Among the three vestibular function tests (caloric test, rotary chair test, vHIT) used to diagnose BVP, only vHIT showed a significant correlation (p = 0.015) with favourable prognosis (composite score ≥ 70). Conclusion Better treatment outcomes are likely in patients with BVP with preserved vestibular function in response to the high-frequency stimulation measured by the vHIT.","Bae, Seong Hoon; Nam, Gi Sung; Kwak, Sang Hyun; Kim, Sung Huhn",Clinical and experimental otorhinolaryngology,40,7

OBJECTIVE To report the histopathological description of a series of chilblain-like lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. DESIGN The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection with available skin biopsy. RESULTS Two main histopathological patterns were observed: a chilblain-like histopathological pattern (10 cases out of 13, 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 cases out of 13, 23% of cases). The chilblain-like histopathological pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction possibly due to the fact that these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response. CONCLUSION The relationship of chilblain-like lesions to SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigations. Histopathological features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus and less frequently a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the two histopathological patterns described.","Sohier, Pierre; Matar, Stéphanie; Meritet, Jean-François; Laurent-Roussel, Sara; Dupin, Nicolas; Aractingi, Selim",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,40,16

The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing. OBJECTIVE To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China. To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19. METHODS Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020. Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed. The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results. RESULTS Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 ± 11.32, 5 males). No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P > 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P < 0.05). Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc. CONCLUSION The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas. Etiological testing should be performed as early as possible for clinically suspected patients.","Peng, Ling; Liu, Kang-Yong; Xue, Fei; Miao, Ya-Fang; Tu, Ping-An; Zhou, Chao",Archives of Iranian medicine,40,30

DESIGN The study was a retrospective case-controlled study. PARTICIPANTS There were 163 patients with COVID-19 deemed candidates for CPAP on admission, including 58 who subsequently required CPAP. OUTCOME MEASURES On admission, we measured the proportion of patients meeting a composite 'negative' outcome of requiring CPAP, intubation or dying versus successful ward-based care. For those escalated to CPAP, 'negative' outcomes were intubation or death versus successful de-escalation of respiratory support. RESULTS Our results were stratified into tertiles, those with 'moderate' or 'severe' X-rays on admission had significantly higher odds of negative outcome versus 'mild' (odds ratio (OR) 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.121-4.803; p=0.023; and OR 3.600; 95% CI 1.681-7.708; p=0.001, respectively). This could not be demonstrated in those commencing CPAP (OR 0.976; 95% CI 0.754-1.264; p=0.856). CONCLUSIONS We outline a scoring system to stratify X-rays by severity and directly link this to prognosis.

Then, we evaluated their properties as hypoxia imaging probes for positron emission tomography (PET) compared with conventional compounds ([68Ga]DN-2 and [68Ga]NN-2). METHODS The precursors of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were synthesized through a two-step reaction, and then reacted with 68GaCl3 to be 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds. FaDu cells were treated with 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds and then incubated under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. The radioactivity of these cells was measured 2 h after incubation. The biodistribution and PET/CT imaging of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds in FaDu-bearing Balb/c nude mice were evaluated 2 h after intravenous injection. RESULTS The 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were synthesized with radiochemical purities over 95%. In the in vitro study, the levels of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were significantly higher in hypoxic cells than in normoxic cells. In hypoxic cells, the compounds we designed in this study demonstrated higher accumulation than the conventional compounds. In the in vivo biodistribution study, [68Ga]DN-3 exhibited the highest accumulation in tumor. In the in vivo PET/CT imaging study, the tumor tissues of the FaDu-xenografted mice were visualized at 2 h after intravenous administration of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggested that the length of the linkers connecting nitroimidazole to a bifunctional chelate affect PET imaging of hypoxic tumors with 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds.","Shimizu, Yoichi; Nakai, Yukihiro; Iikuni, Shimpei; Watanabe, Hiroyuki; Nakamoto, Yuji; Ono, Masahiro",Annals of nuclear medicine,40,24

Definition of the hilar structures is crucial to safe VATS lobectomy. Several VATS approaches have been described. We report the effect of three surgeons in our institution undertaking standardized anterior approach (SAA) training on the proportion of isolated lobectomies subsequently completed by VATS. Predictors of successful VATS lobectomy were analysed. METHODS Three consultant surgeons undertook SAA training at two different time points. Two were performing VATS lobectomy prior to SAA training. Training involved a 2-day visit to an established SAA unit. Lobectomies performed by these surgeons between April 2011 and December 2012 (20 months), before and after training, were recorded prospectively. Bilobectomies, sleeve resections, pneumonectomies and chest wall resections were excluded. VATS lobectomy proportions before and after training were compared. Independent predictors of completion by VATS rather than thoracotomy were identified by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS One hundred and sixty-three isolated lobectomies were performed, 97 of these by VATS (59.5%). The mean age was 68.8 (± 10.5) years. Pathology was lung cancer in 137 (84.0%), other primary malignancy in 10 (6.1%), pulmonary metastases in 8 (4.9%) and benign in 8 (4.9%). The VATS lobectomy rate rose from 22.2% before SAA training to 77.3% after, P < 0.001. The effect was significant for both existing and adopting VATS lobectomy surgeons, P = 0.002 to <0.001. The median hospital stay was 4 days after VATS and 5 after thoracotomy, P < 0.001. There were 5 in-hospital deaths after thoracotomy and none after VATS lobectomy, unadjusted P = 0.01. In the final logistic regression model, SAA training was the strongest predictor of successful VATS lobectomy (odds ratio 15.16; 95% confidence interval 6.39, 35.96). CONCLUSIONS Formal training and adoption of the SAA approach were associated with a more than 3-fold increase in our VATS lobectomy rate. The effect was immediate and sustained. This may reflect easier identification of the major structures from the anterior view. In addition, standardization of surgical techniques and perioperative protocols may facilitate efficient team working. VATS lobectomy was associated with a shorter median hospital stay. Units seeking to increase their VATS lobectomy rate should consider group adoption of the SAA approach.","McElnay, Philip; Casali, Gianluca; Batchelor, Tim; West, Douglas",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,40,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Heidelberg (reference no. S-324/2014). Owing to the retrospective character of the study, the ethical committee did not require any written informed consent. Two groups of 50 patients who underwent at least six consecutive MR imaging examinations with the exclusive use of either a linear GBCA (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or a macrocyclic GBCA (gadoterate meglumine) were analyzed retrospectively. The difference in mean SI ratios of DN to pons and GP to thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted images from the last and first examinations was calculated. One-sample and independent-sample t tests were used to assess the difference in SI ratios for both groups, and regression analysis was performed to account for potential confounders. RESULTS The SI ratio difference in the linear group was greater than 0 (mean DN difference ± standard deviation, 0.0407 ± 0.0398 [P < .001]; GP, 0.0287 ± 0.0275 [P < .001]) and significantly larger (DN, P < .001 and standardized difference of 1.16; GP, P < .001 and standardized difference of 0.81) than that in the macrocyclic group, which did not differ from 0 (DN, 0.0016 ± 0.0266 [P = .680]; GP, 0.0031 ± 0.0354 [P = .538]). The SI ratio difference between the last and first examinations for the DN remained significantly different between the two groups in the regression analysis (P < .001). CONCLUSION This study indicates that an SI increase in the DN and GP on T1-weighted images is caused by serial application of the linear GBCA gadopentetate dimeglumine but not by the macrocyclic GBCA gadoterate meglumine. Clinical implications of this observation remain unclear.","Radbruch, Alexander; Weberling, Lukas D; Kieslich, Pascal J; Eidel, Oliver; Burth, Sina; Kickingereder, Philipp; Heiland, Sabine; Wick, Wolfgang; Schlemmer, Heinz-Peter; Bendszus, Martin",Radiology,40,20

However, it is well known that pregnancy leads to significant physiological changes in most organ systems. The aim of this study was to determine normal values for maternal arterial blood gases during vaginal deliveries as compared to control values from planned cesarean sections. We also wanted to elucidate the effect of various maternal characteristics, mode of delivery and obstetric interventions on blood gas values. MATERIAL AND METHODS We carried out a randomly selected, prospective-observational cohort study of 250 women undergoing vaginal delivery and 58 women undergoing planned cesarean section at Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden. RESULTS We found significant differences for gestational age, parity, umbilical venous blood pH, pCO2 and lactate values between the two study groups (P < 0.005). Significantly lower pH, pCO2 , pO2 , and sO2 were found in mothers delivering vaginally. Higher base deficit, hemoglobin, bilirubin, potassium, glucose and lactate were found in vaginal deliveries as compared to planned cesarean sections (P < 0.02). Maternal BMI, smoking and hypertension were not significantly correlated to acid base parameters in women with vaginal deliveries. On the other hand, multiple regression showed significant associations for the use of epidural anesthesia on maternal pH (P < 0.05) and pO2 (P < 0.01); and synthetic oxytocin on pCO2 (P = 0.08), glucose (P < 0.00) and lactate (P < 0.02) levels in maternal arterial blood. Maternal arterial pH, pCO2 and lactate values correlated significantly to values in venous umbilical cord blood (P < 0.000). CONCLUSIONS Maternal arterial blood gas parameters varied significantly according to mode of delivery, the use of epidural anesthesia and synthetic oxytocin.","Zaigham, Mehreen; Helfer, Sara; Heby Kristensen, Karl; Isberg, Per-Erik; Wiberg, Nana",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,40,1

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies. Six meta-analyses pooled effects on lesson-time PA, overall PA, in-class educational and overall educational outcomes, cognition and health outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using the metafor package in R. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for risk of bias. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC and Web of Science, grey literature and reference lists were searched in December 2017 and April 2019. STUDIES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Physically active lessons compared with a control group in a randomised or non-randomised design, within single component interventions in general school populations. RESULTS 42 studies (39 in preschool or elementary school settings, 27 randomised controlled trials) were eligible to be included in the systematic review and 37 of them were included across the six meta-analyses (n=12 663). Physically active lessons were found to produce large, significant increases in lesson-time PA (d=2.33; 95% CI 1.42 to 3.25: k=16) and small, increases on overall PA (d=0.32; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.46: k=8), large, improvement in lesson-time educational outcomes (d=0.81; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.14: k=7) and a small improvement in overall educational outcomes (d=0.36; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63: k=25). No effects were seen on cognitive (k=3) or health outcomes (k=3). 25/42 studies had high risk of bias in at least two domains. CONCLUSION In elementary and preschool settings, when physically active lessons were added into the curriculum they had positive impact on both physical activity and educational outcomes. These findings support policy initiatives encouraging the incorporation of physically active lessons into teaching in elementary and preschool setting.

The reasons behind that difference are not fully understood, but underreporting is typically presumed as one of the main factors. This study aimed to assess FL epidemiology in Poland based on 2000-2014 data from the Polish National Cancer Registry, which has 100% population coverage and over 90% completeness of the registration. All cases were coded according to ICD-10 and ICD-O-3 recommendations. The total number of registered FL cases was 3,928 with crude (CR) and standardized (SR) incidence rates of 0.72/105 and 0.87/105, respectively. The median age of FL diagnosis was 61 years, with the male to female incidence ratio of 1.06. The distribution of morphological types of FL: not otherwise specified (NOS), grades 1, 2, or 3 were 72.58, 4.81, 12.88, and 9.73%, respectively. Among all reported mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, FL was ranked the fourth in incidence, just after chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CR 3.62/105, SR 4.99/105), plasma cell neoplasms (CR 3.78/105, SR 4.97/105) and diffuse B-cell lymphoma, NOS (CR 2.13/105, SR 2.65/105). The systematic increase in FL incidence among females was observed. Our study confirms a lower FL incidence rate in Poland as compared to other European countries.

METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing fat grafting were retrospectively reviewed and grouped by technique. Patients with less than 180 days of follow-up were excluded. Demographics, operative details, and complications were compared using univariate analysis with significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS Between January of 2013 and September of 2017, 186 women underwent a total of 319 fat grafting procedures. There was no difference in demographics, number of procedures performed, volume of fat grafted, and number of days after reconstruction that fat grafting was performed between groups (p > 0.05). Telfa rolling patients had longer operative times for second fat grafting procedures (implant exchange often completed prior) [100.0 minutes (range, 60.0 to 150.0 minutes) versus 79.0 minutes (range, 64.0 to 94.0 minutes); p = 0.03]. Telfa rolling breasts had more palpable masses requiring imaging (26.0 percent versus 14.4 percent; p = 0.01) and an increased incidence of fat necrosis (20.6 percent versus 8.0 percent; p < 0.01). The closed washing system was found to be an independent predictor of decreased rates of imaging-confirmed fat necrosis (OR, 0.29; p = 0.048). There was no difference in fat necrosis excision or cancer recurrence between the groups. CONCLUSION The closed washing system was independently associated with decreased rates of imaging-confirmed fat necrosis compared to Telfa rolling without an increase in other complications.

Cohort studies investigating local tumor ablation with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have reported a promising overall survival of 26-34 months when given in a multimodal setting. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of RFA in combination with chemotherapy in patients with LAPC are lacking. METHODS The ""Pancreatic Locally Advanced Unresectable Cancer Ablation"" (PELICAN) trial is an international multicenter superiority RCT, initiated by the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group (DPCG). All patients with LAPC according to DPCG criteria, who start with FOLFIRINOX or (nab-paclitaxel/)gemcitabine, are screened for eligibility. Restaging is performed after completion of four cycles of FOLFIRINOX or two cycles of (nab-paclitaxel/)gemcitabine (i.e., 2 months of treatment), and the results are assessed within a nationwide online expert panel. Eligible patients with RECIST stable disease or objective response, in whom resection is not feasible, are randomized to RFA followed by chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. In total, 228 patients will be included in 16 centers in The Netherlands and four other European centers. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, RECIST response, CA 19.9 and CEA response, toxicity, quality of life, pain, costs, and immunomodulatory effects of RFA. DISCUSSION The PELICAN RCT aims to assess whether the combination of chemotherapy and RFA improves the overall survival when compared to chemotherapy alone, in patients with LAPC with no progression of disease following 2 months of systemic treatment.

The alcohol industry employs marketing strategies to establish their brands in the lives of young people at a time when addictive behaviors are initiated and reinforced. We conducted a survey among adolescent boys and young men (ABYM) to estimate the prevalence of alcohol use and associated factors using the Health Belief Model as the guiding framework. METHODS The study was conducted among ABYM in- or out-of-school aged 10-24 years in Kampala, Uganda. We used questions adopted from the Global School-based Student Health Survey and the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance questionnaire to collect data. The outcome of interest was alcohol use within 30 days before the interview. We also asked about characteristics such as alcohol use by siblings, parents/ guardians, school status among others. We used odds ratios obtained via a logistic regression model as the measure of association. RESULTS A total of 2500 ABYM participated, of which 262 (10.5 %, 95 %CI 9.3-11.7) had consumed alcohol within 30 days before the interview. Out-of-school ABYM had higher odds of consuming alcohol compared with their in-school counterparts AOR 1.55 (95 %CI 1.09-2.20). Compared with ABYM whose parents/ guardians did not drink alcohol, ABYM whose both parents consumed alcohol had higher odds of consuming alcohol AOR 2.24 (95 %CI 1.38-3.64) as were those with only a mother or female guardian who consumed alcohol AOR 1.95 (95 %CI 1.11-3.41). ABYM with siblings that drink alcohol had higher odds of consuming alcohol AOR 2.25 (95 %CI 1.80-3.52). ABYM who possessed items with an alcohol brand logo had higher odds of consuming alcohol AOR 2.00 (95 %CI 1.33-3.01). CONCLUSIONS There are significant levels of alcohol consumption among ABYM which calls for evidence-based measures targeting this age group to reduce consumption and recognizing the role of the family, school and community in prevention and promotion of use. There is need to regulate alcohol marketing and ensuring availability of alcohol dependence treatment services that build confidence among youth.","Kabwama, Steven Ndugwa; Matovu, Joseph Kb; Ssenkusu, John M; Ssekamatte, Tonny; Wanyenze, Rhoda K","Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy",40,16

We investigated the effects of an estimated 24 h urinary Na/K (e24hUNa/K) on a 6-year renal function decline among 927 urban Japanese community dwellers with no history of cardiovascular diseases and medication for hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. We partitioned the subjects into quartiles according to the e24hUNa/K. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD/EPI) formula and renal function decline was defined as an absolute value at or above the third quartile of the eGFR decline rate. A multivariable logistic regression model was used for estimation. Compared with the first quartile of the e24hUNa/K, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for eGFR decline in the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.51), 1.06 (0.67-1.66), and 1.65 (1.06-2.57), respectively. These results were similar when the simple spot urine Na/K ratio was used in place of the e24hUNa/K. Apparently healthy urban residents with an almost within normal range mean baseline eGFR and high e24hUNa/K ratios had an increased risk for a future decline in renal function. Reducing the Na/K ratio may be important in the prevention of chronic kidney disease in its early stage.","Hattori, Hiroko; Hirata, Aya; Kubo, Sachimi; Nishida, Yoko; Nozawa, Miki; Kawamura, Kuniko; Hirata, Takumi; Kubota, Yoshimi; Sata, Mizuki; Kuwabara, Kazuyo; Higashiyama, Aya; Kadota, Aya; Sugiyama, Daisuke; Miyamatsu, Naomi; Miyamoto, Yoshihiro; Okamura, Tomonori",International journal of environmental research and public health,40,1

The official websites of anatomy departments may contribute to achieving this goal. Nevertheless, previous studies reported institutional or individual reluctance of departments or anatomists, respectively, due to an expectation of adverse publicity. This study aimed to investigate whether the official websites of Turkish anatomy departments provided information on body donation and analyzed the content of these websites. Websites of anatomy departments at 100 medical faculties were evaluated. Only 12 departments (12%) provided information on body donation with varying content. A thematic analysis of the information provided revealed five main themes. These were (1) legal aspects, (2) significance, (3) acceptance/rejection criteria, (4) availability, and (5) redirection. All departments (n = 12, 100%) outlined the legal aspects of body donation, 7 departments (58%) highlighted the significance of body donation, 7 departments (58%) provided contact information for potential donors, 5 departments (41%) covered acceptance/rejection criteria, and 3 departments (25%) provided a link to the official website of the Turkish Society of Anatomy and Clinical Anatomy. Thus Turkish anatomy departments were reluctant to provide information on body donation, and the content of provided information varied greatly among departments. This lack information coordination and participation in existing awareness activities for body donation in anatomy department websites may be contributing to low numbers of body donations and donor registrations seen nationally.","Ok, Fatma; Gürses, İlke Ali",Anatomical sciences education,40,33

We performed a meta-analysis examining risk factors for intracranial aneurysm growth in longitudinal studies and examined the association between aneurysm growth and rupture. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched the literature for longitudinal studies of patients with unruptured aneurysms. We examined the associations of demographics, multiple aneurysms, prior subarachnoid hemorrhage, family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, smoking, and hypertension; and aneurysm shape, size, and location with aneurysm growth. We studied the association between aneurysm growth and rupture. A meta-analysis was performed by using a random-effects model by using summary statistics from included studies. RESULTS Twenty-one studies including 3954 patients with 4990 aneurysms with 13,294 aneurysm-years of follow-up were included. The overall proportion of growing aneurysms was 3.0% per aneurysm-year (95% CI, 2.0%-4.0%). Patient risk factors for growth included age older than 50 years (3.8% per year versus 0.9% per year, P < .01), female sex (3.2% per year versus 1.3% per year, P < .01), and smoking history (5.5% per year versus 3.5% per year, P < .01). Characteristics associated with higher growth rates included cavernous carotid artery location (14.4% per year), nonsaccular shape (14.7% per year versus 5.2% per year for saccular, P < .01), and aneurysm size (P < .01). Aneurysm growth was associated with a rupture rate of 3.1% per year compared with 0.1% per year for stable aneurysms (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Observational evidence provided multiple clinical and anatomic risk factors for aneurysm growth, including age older than 50 years, female sex, smoking history, and nonsaccular shape. These findings should be considered when counseling patients regarding the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.","Brinjikji, W; Zhu, Y-Q; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J; Murad, M H; Wang, Z; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

We examined the impact of cachexia on the prognosis of patients with advanced NSCLC receiving pembrolizumab and evaluated whether the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia affects the clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and appetite-related hormones, which are related to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia, were analyzed. Cancer cachexia was defined as (1) a body weight loss > 5% over the past 6 months, or (2) a body weight loss > 2% in patients with a body mass index < 20 kg/m2. RESULTS A total of 133 patients were enrolled. Patients with cachexia accounted for 35.3%. No significant difference in the objective response rate was seen between the cachexia and non-cachexia group (29.8% vs. 34.9%, P = 0.550), but the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) periods were significantly shorter in the cachexia group than in the non-cachexia group (PFS: 4.2 months vs. 7.1 months, P = 0.04, and OS: 10.0 months vs. 26.6 months, P = 0.03). The serum TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-8, IL-10, and leptin levels were significantly associated with the presence of cachexia, but not with the PFS or OS. CONCLUSION The presence of cachexia was significantly associated with poor prognosis in advanced NSCLC patients receiving pembrolizumab, not with the response to pembrolizumab.","Jo, Hitomi; Yoshida, Tatsuya; Horinouchi, Hidehito; Yagishita, Shigehiro; Matsumoto, Yuji; Shinno, Yuki; Okuma, Yusuke; Goto, Yasushi; Yamamoto, Noboru; Takahashi, Kazuhisa; Motoi, Noriko; Ohe, Yuichiro","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",40,20

Thereby, we aim at fulfilling three main goals: offering thorough coordinated management for all, and improving physical activity and quality of life of the patients. AIM With rare diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), patients and their family often suffer from inadequate recognition of their disease, poor care coordination and incomplete information. A coordinated interdisciplinary approach is one possible solution for providing both comprehensive and cost-effective care, with benefits for patient satisfaction. Poor physical activity and impaired quality of life represent a considerable burden for these patients. To better address these issues, in 2012 we created an interdisciplinary team for the management of OI patients in our University Hospital Centre (CHUV, Lausanne University Hospital,). In this article we describe the implementation of this interdisciplinary care strategy for patients suffering from OI, and its impact on their physical activity and quality of life. METHODS All patients from the French part of Switzerland were invited to join us. We proposed two complementary evaluations: the initial interdisciplinary evaluation and a yearly follow-up during a special day – the “OI day”. This day features specialised medical appointments adapted to each patient’s needs, as well as lectures and/or workshops dedicated to patients’ and families’ education. Our first aim was to propose for each patient the same management, from diagnosis to the bone health evaluation and physical therapy advice. Our second aim was to evaluate the evolution of physical activity, quality of life (measured by EQ-5D, SF-36 and a dedicated questionnaire) and satisfaction of patients and their families. Here we report both the initial and the long-term results. RESULTS Since 2012, 50 patients from the French part of Switzerland received the personalised medical evaluation. All of the patients included in this study had the same initial evaluation and at least one participation in an OI Day. All patients had an adaptation of their bone acting drugs. Over a 7-year period, 62% of inactive patients started some physical activity, and 44% of patients who were not involved in any athletic activity started participating in sports. The mean EQ-5D increased from 0.73 to 0.75 (p = 0.59). The mean physical SF36 (musculoskeletal function) score was 59.09 ± 22.72 and improved to 65.79 ± 21.51 (p = 0.08), whereas it was 68.06 ± 20.05 for the mental SF36 without alteration during follow-up. The OI day was revealed to be useful, it contributed to improvement in continuity of care and helped families to better understand the OI patients’ health. CONCLUSIONS Our interdisciplinary approach aimed at offering the same thorough management for all patients from the French part of Switzerland, and at improving both the physical activity and the satisfaction of the patients and their family. This report is a basis for future work focusing on the effect of bone fragility and the impact of OI on patients’ social relations.","Aubry-Rozier, Bérengère; Richard, Céline; Unger, Sheila; Hans, Didier; Campos-Xavier, Belinda; Schneider, Patrick; Paquier, Célia; Pasche, Jennifer; Bonafé, Luisa; Bregou, Aline",Swiss medical weekly,40,1

The three most important events of the end of the 19th century, i.e., the introduction of anesthesia, the use of artery forceps and ligation of blood vessels, as well as prophylactic management of perioperative infections decidedly affected the improvement of therapeutic results of thyroid surgery. Surgical treatment of thyroid diseases is associated with the possibility of complications developing, of which bleeding is among the most serious ones, starting from the need for an immediate reoperation and ending at a considerable damage to functionally important structures: the laryngeal nerves and parathyroid glands. The consensus reached between the development of science and progress in modern technologies has provided the basis for introducing and popularizing minimally invasive procedures, including operations using the approach through natural body openings. Such an unprecedented development of surgical techniques would not be possible without devices for closing blood vessels. Given the mechanism of hemostasis, current vascular sealing devices can generally be divided into three groups: ultrasonic, bipolar-radiofrequency and hybrid systems combining both energy modalities. While analyzing the innovative, advanced technology of all the energy-based devices, it should be stated that only if they are used in a safe manner, quality of life of patients with various thyroid conditions is improved. The employment of such devices fully confirms their usefulness; nevertheless, all the advantages should never release the surgeon from the obligation to appropriately and safely identify the surrounding structures and let him uncritically use the new device.","Konturek, Aleksander; Szpyra, Bartłomiej; Stopa-Barczyńska, Małgorzata; Barczyński, Marcin",Gland surgery,40,16

Polarized 3D total body photography is a novel technique that enables fast image acquisition of almost the entire skin surface. We aimed to determine the added value of 3D total body photography alongside dermoscopy for monitoring cutaneous lesions. METHODS Lesion images from high-risk individuals were assessed for long-term substantial changes via dermoscopy and 3D total body photography. Three case studies are presented demonstrating how 3D total body photography may enhance lesion analysis alongside traditional dermoscopy. RESULTS 3D total body photography can assist clinicians by presenting cutaneous lesions in their skin ecosystem, thereby providing additional clinical context and enabling a more holistic assessment to aid dermoscopy interpretation. For lesion cases where previous dermoscopy is unavailable, corresponding 3D images can substitute for baseline dermoscopy. Additionally, 3D total body photography is not susceptible to artificial stretch artefacts. CONCLUSION 3D total body photography is valuable alongside dermoscopy for monitoring cutaneous lesions. Furthermore, it is capable of surveilling almost the entire skin surface, including areas not traditionally monitored by sequential imaging.","Grochulska, Katarzyna; Betz-Stablein, Brigid; Rutjes, Chantal; Chiu, Frank Po-Chao; Menzies, Scott W; Soyer, H Peter; Janda, Monika",Dermatology,40,7

METHODS Ten healthy males (24 ± 5 years) completed a neuromuscular assessment protocol before and after a fatiguing isometric exercise: two sets of five contractions (50%, 62.5%, 75%, 87.5%, 100% Maximal Voluntary Contraction; MVC) with superimposed TMS-evoked twitches for calculation of VATMS using either the first 5 stimulations (1x5C) or all 10 (2x5C). This was performed on two separate occasions (between-day reliability). Accuracy and validity were compared with a routinely used protocol [i.e. 50%, 75%, and 100% of MVC (1x3C) performed three times (3x3C)]. RESULTS 95% confidence interval for estimated resting twitch, a key determinant of VATMS, was similar between 1x5C, 2x5C, and 3x3C but improved by six-fold when compared to 1x3C (P<0.05). In a fresh state, potentiated twitch force was unchanged following 1x5C but decreased following 2x5C (P<0.05). A recovery was found post-exercise but was smaller for 1x5C compared to 2x5C (P<0.05), with no difference between the latter two (P>0.05). Absolute reliability was strong enough for both 1x5C and 2x5C to depict a true detectable change in the sample's VATMS following the fatiguing exercise (TEM < 3% at rest, <9% post-exercise) but 2x5C was marginally more sensitive to individual's changes from baseline. CONCLUSION Both 1x5C and 2x5C provide reliable measures of VATMS. However, 1x5C may hold stronger internal validity. Both protocols allow detection of 'true' changes in sample's means but not individual scores following a fatiguing isometric exercise.","Dekerle, Jeanne; Greenhouse-Tucknott, Aaron; Wrightson, James G; Schäfer, Lisa; Ansdell, Paul",PloS one,40,12

There was no operative mortality. LRHP can be performed safely by an experienced surgeon. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming.","Park, Joong-Min; Chi, Kyong-Choun",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,40,1

We established that the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27 is elevated in neonatal mice. Similarly, human cord blood-derived macrophages express IL-27 genes and secrete more cytokine than macrophages from adults. In the present work, we hypothesized that increased levels of IL-27 predispose neonatal mice to more severe infection during Gram-negative sepsis. Serum IL-27 levels continued to rise during infection. Peripheral tissue analysis revealed systemic IL-27 expression, while myeloid cell profiling identified Gr-1 and F4/80-expressing cells as the most abundant producers of IL-27 during infection. Increased IL-27 levels were consistent with increased mortality that was improved in IL-27-receptor α (Rα)-/- mice that lack a functional IL-27 receptor. Infected IL-27Rα-/- pups also exhibited improved weight gain and reduced morbidity. This was consistent with reduced bacterial burdens and more efficient bacterial killing by Ly6B.2+ myeloid cells and macrophages compared to WT neonates. Live animal imaging further supported a more severe and disseminated infection in WT neonates. This is the first report to describe the impact of elevated early life IL-27 on the host response in a neonatal infection model while also defining the cell and tissue sources of cytokine. IL-27 is frequently associated with suppressed inflammation. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that IL-27 indirectly promotes an inflammatory cytokine response during neonatal sepsis by directly compromising control of bacteria that drive the inflammatory response. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-27 represents a therapeutic target to limit susceptibility and improve infectious outcomes in neonatal sepsis.","Seman, Brittany G; Vance, Jordan K; Rawson, Travis W; Witt, Michelle R; Huckaby, Annalisa B; Povroznik, Jessica M; Bradford, Shelby D; Barbier, Mariette; Robinson, Cory M",Infection and immunity,40,4

As a result, the patients were unable to communicate with their families other than through virtual communication channels. A still significant number of patients, which do not have access to modern videoconference tools, were completely isolated. As a result, the University Hospitals of Geneva decided to implement a Visio conference system inside their patient app ecosystem to allow every patient to remain connected. This article presents the iterative development of the solution in order to respond to the specific timely constraint of the situations as well as its evaluation by the patients and caregivers. Two iterations of the tool have been developed. The first relied on an existing commercial platform whereas the second is a fully integrated solution in our patient app ecosystem. The very positive evaluation at the first stage by more than 300 patients, relatives and caregivers convinced us to invest additional effort to provide a fully integrated solution. The second version, evaluated by 16 patients, confirmed that the Visio reaches its objective of reducing isolation during hospitalization.

Screening and early identification of pre-cancerous lesions are a cornerstone of the cervical cancer prevention strategy. Yet, there is limited literature on barriers to screening among Peruvian women. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to examine Peruvian women's knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding cervical cancer screening and identify possible reasons for the gap between knowledge and screening. METHODS The study was conducted in metropolitan Lima from June-August 2019. We purposefully recruited 12 women who had previously been screened, and 12 who had never been screened for cervical cancer. The women completed a 40-question knowledge and attitude survey and an in-depth interview about barriers to screening. Descriptive analysis was used to calculate a knowledge and attitude score and qualitative analysis was guided by the Health Belief Model constructs. RESULTS Previously screened participants had greater knowledge of cervical cancer symptoms, risk factors, and prevention (mean score = 28.08, S.D. = 4.18) compared to participants who had never been screened (mean score = 21.25, S.D. = 6.35). Both groups described lack of priority and embarrassment as barriers to cervical cancer screening. For participants who had never been screened before, major barriers included the fear of a cancer diagnosis and lack of information about screening services. Pregnancy, unusual gynecological symptoms and encouragement from friends and family were cues to action for participants seeking screening. Most participants in both groups recognized the benefits of getting screened for cervical cancer. Being previously screened increased participants' self-efficacy for engaging in screening behaviors again. Misconceptions regarding screening procedures and cervical cancer were also noted as barriers for participants accessing screening services. CONCLUSIONS Improving knowledge and awareness about cervical cancer and screening programs may improve screening behaviors among women. Targeting women who have never been screened before and addressing their fears and concerns around embarrassment may be other areas for intervention. Misconceptions that deter women from screening services are an important issue that should be addressed in order to increase the number of women who get timely screenings.","Pieters, Michelle M; Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean; Coffey, Emily; Huchko, Megan J; Vasudevan, Lavanya",BMC women's health,40,16

METHOD Data were analyzed from intake information obtained from 1584 adult patients presenting at a community-based private sleep medical center. The sample was parsed into a Suicidal Ideation (SI) group (N=211) and No Suicidal Ideation (NSI) group (N=1373). Comparisons of these groups were made on measures of self-reported sleep complaints, habits, and behaviors, suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and associated psychopathology. RESULTS Approximately 13% of participants reported suicidal ideation. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was present in 4.5% of the sample. Compared to the NSI group, the SI group showed a pervasive pattern of significantly greater frequency or severity of sleep problems in areas of insomnia, nightmares and other parasomnia behaviors, poor sleep quality, and sleep-related psychophysiologic conditioning as well as worse sleep-related impairment and quality of life. Several relationships were significant after controlling for depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION Suicidal ideation was consistently associated with a broad array of sleep complaints, even when controlling for level of depressive symptoms. As these self-reported sleep disturbances are treatable sleep disorders, future research should examine the efficacy of sleep and behavioral medicine for reducing the risk of suicidal ideation.","Krakow, Barry; Ribeiro, Jessica D; Ulibarri, Victor A; Krakow, Jessica; Joiner, Thomas E",Journal of affective disorders,40,1

The shape of a staple that is formed by a stapling device is one industry-accepted indicator of device performance; typically a B-shaped staple is considered the gold standard for staple formation. This B shape allows blood flow through the tissue, which is one important factor in the healing events that take place clinically after stapling. With the use of an animal model, this ex vivo study investigated staple formation when thick tissue endoscopic staplers were used on challenging and variable tissue. The setting was a corporate institution in the United States. METHODS Two 60-mm linear endoscopic thick tissue reloads, a varied-height stapler (VHS), and a single-height stapler (SHS) were fired on 7 different regions of porcine stomach. Resultant staple formation was assessed per region of the stomach and evaluated for proper B-shaped staple formation and staple malformation. RESULTS The VHS reload had significantly better B-shaped formation (P<.001) for all regions of the stomach and reduced occurrence of malformed staples in 5 of the 7 regions compared with the SHS reload, wherein the remaining 2 regions exhibited comparable malform occurrence. CONCLUSIONS This study compared 2 thick tissue reloads and found that the VHS reload had superior outcomes, with respect to staple formation, compared with the SHS reload.","Contini, Elizabeth; Whiffen, Jennifer; Bronson, Dwight",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,40,19

AREAS COVERED This critical review discusses abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant formulations, which may help to overcome concerns of misuse in using opioids for pain management. The role and utility of these novel formulations in clinical practice are outlined, as well as the risks and benefits associated with formulations that are currently available or under development. EXPERT OPINION Numerous concerns with the integration of these formulations into clinical practice remain, as no product is intended or capable of addressing all types of misuse or abuse. As a result, these formulations should not necessarily be considered preferred agents once available in clinical practice. Moreover, before initiating therapy with abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant formulations, proper patient assessment to identify risk factors for misuse and abuse should be implemented and optimized. With screening and monitoring in place, it would then be sensible to consider these formulations in patients who appear to be at high risk of misuse, abuse and/or diversion.","Lourenço, Laura M; Matthews, Michele; Jamison, Robert N",Expert opinion on drug delivery,40,1

One of the most important technical points for the final result is the stabilization of the bar, usually obtained by one or more stabilizers and few stitches fixing the bar to some ribs. Our aim is to show how to get the bar more stable by passing bilaterally some stitches around the bar and the ribs close to it. By a right thoracoscopy and a 30-degree optic, we are able to pass the stitches bilaterally by using an Endoclose needle (Covidien Ltd., Hamilton HM, Bermuda). The left hemithorax is visualized from the right side, pushing the optic through the mediastinum following the bar and staying just below it. MATERIALS AND METHODS We have operated on 230 patients in two centers. We have used only one stabilizer in more than 90% of the patients. In all patients, we have passed four absorbable stitches on the right side, using an Endoclose needle. In the last 45 cases, we have adopted bilateral fixation of the bar by the Endoclose needle. RESULTS The maneuver takes only around 10 minutes. We did not have complications related to that maneuver. We did not observe destabilization of the bar in those cases. The overall destabilization rate was 1.3%. CONCLUSIONS We suggest this technique to give the bar more stability on both sides. We think the use of a bilateral stabilizer can be avoided.","Torre, Michele; Varela, Patricio; Asquasciati, Caterina; Romanini, Maria Victoria; Jasonni, Vincenzo",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Demographic and perioperative physiologic factors have both been associated with developmental outcome. The acute physiologic effect of a surgical procedure, anesthesia, and hospitalization may offset any potential advantage gained from anatomic correction and circulatory palliation. The specific risk/benefit balance on ND outcome of the insult of the operation, offset by the benefit of improved anatomy and physiology, has not been addressed. We therefore sought to identify interval procedural and physiologic factors assessed at outpatient ND evaluation visits that were associated with outcome. METHODS The study included children with congenital heart disease at high risk for impaired ND performance with at least three ND assessments using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III during the first 3 years of life. The number of cardiac procedures, duration of hospitalization, feeding status, height, weight, and arterial, cerebral, and somatic oxygen saturations by near-infrared spectroscopy were recorded at each visit and used as predictors of language, motor, and cognitive composite scores and slopes (change over time) in general linear models. RESULTS Data on 178 children derived from 632 visits (median, 4 visits/child) were analyzed, with ages at first and last assessment of 7.7 and 30.2 months. Fifty-one had 1 ventricle (1V), 88 had 2 ventricles, and 39 had genetic syndrome conditions. Motor performance increased with age in all diagnostic categories. Cognitive and language performance increased with age in 1V patients but exhibited no significant change in 2-ventricle and genetic syndrome groups. At the first visit, 1V patients performed less well than 2-ventricle patients in the motor domain, but the rate of improvement was higher for 1V patients; by 24 months, there were no differences, and both groups were normal in all domains. Performance in genetic syndrome patients was below normal in all domains at the first visit and did not improve. Higher arterial saturation and narrower arterial-cerebral and arterial-somatic near-infrared spectroscopy saturation differences were associated with better or improving motor performance. Incremental cardiopulmonary bypass time, cumulative hospital length of stay, and tube feedings were risk factors in all domains. Total and incremental times for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, total open and total surgical procedures, and birth weight were not risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Patient physiologic status assessed by cerebral and somatic near-infrared spectroscopy is associated with ND performance. Incremental surgical procedures are not associated with ND performance when adjusted for cardiopulmonary bypass time and physiologic status. Treatment strategies that target improved physiologic status may also improve ND outcome.","Hoffman, George M; Brosig, Cheryl L; Bear, Laurel M; Tweddell, James S; Mussatto, Kathleen A",The Annals of thoracic surgery,40,1

Among them, gastric duplication cysts are very rare. CASE REPORT Here we report A 23-year-old Japanese man who visited our hospital to evaluate an abdominal tumor. Abdominal computed tomography showed a well-circumscribed homogenous low-density mass measuring 6.2 × 6.0 cm between the pancreatic tail and the upper posterior wall on the gastric greater curvature, and the mass seemed to originate from the pancreatic tail. We found intraoperatively that the mass adhered to the stomach and pancreatic tail strongly, so we performed laparoscopic partial gastrectomy and spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Pathological findings showed that the lining epithelium of the cystic mass consisted of the gastric foveolar epithelium with fundic glands. Furthermore, the pancreatic tissue of the pancreatic tail and the muscular layer of the cystic mass were intermingled. DISCUSSION GDCs are usually diagnosed at a younger age and in adults, they are very rare. Therefore, surgical resection is considered to be the best treatment due to the difficulty of diagnosis, and also that it mimics a pancreatic cystic tumor, and malignant transformation. Complete resection of the cyst is the ideal technique and laparoscopic surgery should be selected whenever possible. CONCLUSION We experienced a case of GDC continuous to both stomach and pancreatic tail. Laparoscopic surgery is safety and useful even if GDC is continuous with both the stomach and the pancreas.","Kawaida, Hiromichi; Kimura, Ayako; Watanabe, Mitsuaki; Akaike, Hidenori; Hosomura, Naohiro; Kawaguchi, Yoshihiko; Amemiya, Hidetake; Sudo, Makoto; Kono, Hiroshi; Matsuda, Masanori; Fujii, Hideki; Ichikawa, Daisuke; Fukasawa, Mitsuharu; Takahashi, Ei; Sano, Katsuhiro; Inoue, Tomohiro",International journal of surgery case reports,40,5

Other than patient characteristics, time to recanalization is the most important factor linked to outcome. MT is usually performed in a dedicated angiography suite using a floor- and/or ceiling-mounted biplane angiographic system. Here we report our first experience of MT with a new combined CT and mobile C-arm X-ray device setup. METHODS Patients with AIS underwent stroke imaging (non-contrast enhanced CT, CT perfusion, and CT angiography) using a commercially available 64-slice CT scanner which was modified for combined use with a C-arm system. In patients with large vessel occlusion, MT was conducted without further patient transfer within the CT imaging suite using a mobile C-arm X-ray device equipped with a 30×30 cm (12×12 inch), 1.5×1.5 k full-view flat detector which was positioned between the gantry and patient table. The safety and feasibility of this new system was assessed in preliminary patients. RESULTS Angiographic imaging quality of the mobile C-arm was feasible and satisfactory for diagnostic angiography and MT. Using this setup, time between stroke imaging and groin puncture (picture-to-puncture time) was reduced by up to 35 min (including time for preparation of the patient such as intubation). CONCLUSIONS MT using a combined CT/C-arm system is safe and feasible. The potential advantages, particularly time saving and ensuing improvement in patient outcome, need to be assessed in a larger study.","Pfaff, Johannes; Herweh, Christian; Pham, Mirko; Schönenberger, Silvia; Bösel, Julian; Ringleb, Peter A; Heiland, Sabine; Bendszus, Martin; Möhlenbruch, Markus",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,40,5

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services previously announced that all non-essential planned surgeries and procedures should be postponed until further notice and only urgent procedures should proceed. METHODS We share our experiences with safely performing neurosurgical procedures on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, to aide other neurosurgical teams in preparing for these high-risk cases, especially for neurosurgical interventions which are essential at saving a life or preserving functioning of the central nervous system that cannot be delayed. Perioperative and intraoperative strategies, considerations, as well as challenges arisen under the specific circumstance have been discussed: the hospital should be equipped with negative pressure areas and multiple areas to quarantine positive patients; the operating rooms should be negative pressure or have HEPA-filtration systems in place; all healthcare personnel who immediately participate in neurosurgical interventions for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients should take airborne precautions and wear enhanced personal protective equipment. RESULTS Successful management of neurosurgical emergencies without healthcare personnel infection has been achieved during this pandemic crisis.

METHODS Systematic review. DATA SOURCES The MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus via EBSCO databases were searched from database inception to 9th March 2018. Specific criteria were used to define inclusion and exclusion. Data was extracted independently by a pair of reviewers. RESULTS In total 32 cross sectional studies were identified for inclusion (1 with a longitudinal component). The median prevalence of wrist pain in the general population and non-manual workers within the short term (within last week) was 6 and 4.2% within the medium term (> 1 week and within a year). The median prevalence of wrist pain in physically demanding occupations and sports people was 10% within the short term and 24% within the medium term. Non-modifiable factors associated with wrist pain included increased age (1 study in adults and 3 studies in children/adolescents) and female sex (2 studies). Modifiable risk factors included high job physical strain (2 studies), high job psychological strain (1 study), abnormal physeal morphology in children/adolescents (2 studies), high frequency impact tool use (1 study) and effort reward imbalance (1 study). CONCLUSIONS Wrist pain is highly prevalent in groups who partake in physically demanding activities from day to day such as manual labourers and sportspeople.

PURPOSE To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for predicting the fatal outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study consisted of a training dataset (n = 66) and a validation dataset (n = 30) with COVID-19 from January 2020 to March 2020. A radiomics signature was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. A radiomics score (Rad-score) was developed from the training cohort. The radiomics model, clinical model, and integrated model were built to assess the association between radiomics signature/clinical characteristics and the mortality of COVID-19 cases. The radiomics signature combined with the Rad-score and the independent clinical factors and radiomics nomogram were constructed. RESULTS Seven stable radiomics features associated with the mortality of COVID-19 were finally selected. A radiomics nomogram was based on a combined model consisting of the radiomics signature and the clinical risk factors indicating optimal predictive performance for the fatal outcome of patients with COVID-19 with a C-index of 0.912 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.867-0.957) in the training dataset and 0.907 (95% CI 0.849-0.966) in the validation dataset. The calibration curves indicated optimal consistency between the prediction and the observation in both training and validation cohorts. CONCLUSION The CT-based radiomics nomogram indicated favorable predictive efficacy for the overall survival risk of patients with COVID-19, which could help clinicians intensively follow up high-risk patients and make timely diagnoses.","Ke, Zan; Li, Liang; Wang, Li; Liu, Huan; Lu, Xuefang; Zeng, Feifei; Zha, Yunfei",Acta radiologica,40,24

Here, we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) characterised by eight lineage-defining mutations in the spike protein, including three at important residues in the receptor-binding domain (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may have functional significance3-5. This lineage was identified in South Africa after the first epidemic wave in a severely affected metropolitan area, Nelson Mandela Bay, located on the coast of the Eastern Cape Province. This lineage spread rapidly, becoming dominant in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces within weeks. Whilst the full significance of the mutations is yet to be determined, the genomic data, showing the rapid expansion and displacement of other lineages in multiple regions, suggest that this lineage is associated with a selection advantage, most plausibly as a result of increased transmissibility or immune escape6-8.","Tegally, Houriiyah; Wilkinson, Eduan; Giovanetti, Marta; Iranzadeh, Arash; Fonseca, Vagner; Giandhari, Jennifer; Doolabh, Deelan; Pillay, Sureshnee; San, Emmanuel James; Msomi, Nokukhanya; Mlisana, Koleka; von Gottberg, Anne; Walaza, Sibongile; Allam, Mushal; Ismail, Arshad; Mohale, Thabo; Glass, Allison J; Engelbrecht, Susan; Van Zyl, Gert; Preiser, Wolfgang; Petruccione, Francesco; Sigal, Alex; Hardie, Diana; Marais, Gert; Hsiao, Marvin; Korsman, Stephen; Davies, Mary-Ann; Tyers, Lynn; Mudau, Innocent; York, Denis; Maslo, Caroline; Goedhals, Dominique; Abrahams, Shareef; Laguda-Akingba, Oluwakemi; Alisoltani-Dehkordi, Arghavan; Godzik, Adam; Wibmer, Constantinos Kurt; Sewell, Bryan Trevor; Lourenço, José; Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Junior; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L; Weaver, Steven; Martin, Darren; Lessells, Richard J; Bhiman, Jinal N; Williamson, Carolyn; de Oliveira, Tulio",Nature,40,16

Given that an inability to complete all intended cancer therapies might negate the oncologic benefits of surgical therapy, strategies to improve return to intended oncologic treatment (RIOT), including minimally invasive surgery (MIS), are being investigated. METHODS This project was designed to evaluate liver tumor patients to determine the RIOT rate, risk factors for inability to RIOT, and its impact on survivals. Outcomes for a homogenous cohort of 223 patients who underwent open-approach surgery for metachronous colorectal liver metastases and a group of 27 liver tumor patients treated with MIS hepatectomy were examined. RESULTS Of the 223 open-approach patients, 167 were offered postoperative therapy, yielding a RIOT rate of 75%. The remaining 56 (25%) patients were unable to receive further treatment due to surgical complications (n = 29 pts) or poor performance status (n = 27 pts). Risk factors associated with inability to RIOT were hypertension (OR 2.2, P = 0.025), multiple preoperative chemotherapy regimens (OR 5.9, P = 0.039), and postoperative complications (OR 2.0, P = 0.039). Inability to RIOT correlated with shorter disease-free and overall survivals (P < 0.001, HR = 2.16; and P = 0.005, HR = 2.07, respectively). In contrast to the open surgery group, 100% of MIS patients who were intended to initiate postoperative therapy did so (P = 0.038) within a shorter median time interval (MIS: 15 days vs. open: 42 days; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The relationship between RIOT and long-term oncologic outcomes suggests that RIOT rates for both open- and MIS-approach cancer surgery should routinely be reported as a quality indicator.","Aloia, Thomas A; Zimmitti, Giuseppe; Conrad, Claudius; Gottumukalla, Vijaya; Kopetz, Scott; Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas",Journal of surgical oncology,40,1

Evaluation of public involvement has typically focused on the process and experiences for participants. Less is known about outcomes for health services. The aim of this systematic review was to a) identify and synthesise what is known about health service outcomes of public involvement and b) document how outcomes were evaluated. METHODS Searches were undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL for studies that reported health service outcomes from public involvement in health service design. The review was limited to high-income countries and studies in English. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and critical appraisal guidelines for assessing the quality and impact of user involvement in health research. Content analysis was used to determine the outcomes of public involvement in health service design and how outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 93 articles were included. The majority were published in the last 5 years, were qualitative, and were located in the United Kingdom. A range of health service outcomes (discrete products, improvements to health services and system/policy level changes) were reported at various levels (service level, across services, and across organisations). However, evaluations of outcomes were reported in less than half of studies. In studies where outcomes were evaluated, a range of methods were used; most frequent were mixed methods. The quality of study design and reporting was inconsistent. CONCLUSION When reporting public involvement in health service design authors outline a range of outcomes for health services, but it is challenging to determine the extent of outcomes due to inadequate descriptions of study design and poor reporting. There is an urgent need for evaluations, including longitudinal study designs and cost-benefit analyses, to fully understand outcomes from public involvement in health service design.","Lloyd, Nicola; Kenny, Amanda; Hyett, Nerida",BMC health services research,40,14

Pilot tube dysfunction was highly suspected. The bite block was slightly pulled out, and 8 mL of air was aspirated from the pilot tube. The patient was successfully extubated without stridor and respiratory distress.Our case highlighted that a malpositioned bite block may obstruct the pilot tube, causing unfavorable consequences. While fixing the bite block on an endotracheal tube, it is crucial to ensure that the takeoff point of the pilot tube is located within the C-notch of the bite block.","Chou, Hui-Ling; Ruan, Sheng-Yuan; Wu, Huey-Dong",Medicine,40,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The atypical imaging data of ten patients in our hospital who tested positive for COVID-19 were analyzed retrospectively, and the distribution, morphology, and image evolution of the lesions were analyzed. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in all cases, and the imaging features were analyzed and summarized by two senior radiologists. RESULTS Of these ten patients, three were male, and seven were female. The age of these patients ranged from 21-53 years, with an average age of 36.3 ± 3.6. The first symptom was fever in nine cases and dry cough in one case. A total of 17 lesions were detected in these ten patients. Five patients had a single lesion, and five patients had multiple lesions, for a total of 12 lesions. Ten lesions (58.82%) were located in the inferior lobe of the right lung, four lesions (23.53%) in the left inferior lobe, two lesions (11.76%) in the left upper lobe, and one lesion (5.88%) in the right middle lobe. Among the five single lesions, two were solid lesions, two were mixed ground-glass lesions, and one was a pure ground-glass lesion. Among the 12 multiple lesions, eight were solid lesions, two were mixed ground-glass lesions, and two were pure ground-glass lesions. Atypical manifestations in image signs: five lesions (29.41%) had single solid and sub-solid nodules, and four lesions (23.53%) had cavitary nodules. Typical manifestation (the presence of ""white lung""): three lesions (17.65%) had an air bronchogram, two lesions (11.76%) had crazy-paving signs, two lesions (11.76%) had vascular thickening, and one lesion (5.88%) had halo signs. At reexamination 2-6 days later, 15 lesions (88.24%) had enlarged or increased, and two lesions (11.76%) had decreased or absorbed. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 may have atypical imaging findings.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of varicocele correction on detailed morphologic microscopic semen parameters in a large homogeneous cohort of patients and to evaluate which factors could predict semen improvement after the surgical treatment. DESIGN An observational, retrospective cohort study was carried out including all patients undergoing surgical treatment for varicocele from September 2011 to March 2020 in the same clinical centre. Enrolled males performed at least one semen analysis before and one after surgical varicocele correction. Primary outcome was the detailed morphologic microscopic sperm evaluation. Secondary outcomes were conventional semen analyses. RESULTS 121 males (mean age 24.6±6.1 years) were enrolled. Using detailed morphologic microscopic sperm evaluation, a significant morphological improvement was recorded, with a reduction in head and tail abnormalities. Moreover, a significant increase in sperm concentration (p=0.015) and percentage of progressive and total motility (p=0.022 and p=0.039) were observed after surgery. The multivariate logistic analysis identified the ultrasonography varicocele degree before surgery as a main predictor of the sperm concentration improvement (p=0.016), with the highest improvement for varicocele of I and II degree.

Its amidase domain (GspA), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of Gsp into glutathione and spermidine, plays an important role in redox sensing and protein S-thiolation. To gain insight of the regulation and catalytic mechanism of and further understand the recycling of the Gsp dimer and Gsp-S-protein adducts, we solved two crystal structures of GspA and GspSA both with the C59A mutation and bound with the substrate, Gsp. In both structures, Cys59, His131, and Glu147 form the catalytic triad, which is similar to other cysteine proteases. Comparison of the GspA_Gsp complex and apo GspSA structures indicates that on binding with Gsp, the side chains of Asn149 and Gln58 of the amidase domain are induced to move closer to the carbonyl oxygen of the cleaved amide bond of Gsp, thereby participating in catalysis. In addition, the helix-loop region of GspA, corresponding to the sequence (30)YSSLDPQEYEDDA(42), involves in regulating the substrate binding. Our previous study indicated that the thiol of Cys59 of GspA is only oxidized to sulfenic acid by H(2)O(2). When comparing the active site of GspA with those of other cysteine proteases, we found that limited space and hydrophobicity of the environment around Cys59 play an important role to inhibit its further oxidation. The structural results presented here not only elucidate the catalytic mechanism and regulation of GspA but also help us to design small molecules to inhibit or probe for the activity of GspA.","Pai, Chien-Hua; Wu, Hsing-Ju; Lin, Chun-Hung; Wang, Andrew H-J",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,40,31

METHODS A systematic review of the literature was conducted by a subcommittee of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee to develop recommendations to identify second primary lung cancers. The process entailed review of knowledge relating to the mechanism of metastasis, determination of clonality, and outcomes of patients with resected tumors. RESULTS It is easier to determine that two tumors are different than that they are the same; finding similarities does not establish that they are the same. For example, most second primary lung cancers are of the same histotype. Few criteria are reliable by themselves; these include different histologic cancer types or matching DNA breakpoints by sequencing and a comprehensive histologic assessment of resected specimens. Characteristics that are suggestive but associated with potential misclassification include the presence or absence of biomarkers, imaging characteristics, and the presence or absence of nodal involvement. CONCLUSIONS Clinical and pathologic (i.e., after resection) criteria are presented to identify two foci as separate primary lung cancers versus a metastasis. Few features are definitive; many commonly used characteristics are suggestive but associated with a substantial rate of misclassification.

In the present study, 13 TE (Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, As, Se, Zn, Cr, V, Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn) were analyzed in the muscle tissue of three shark species (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinus falciformis, and Alopias pelagicus) using high-resolution mass spectrometry inductively coupled to a plasma generator (HR-ICP-MS); 30 shark specimens of each specie were obtained during commercial fish landings in the port of Manzanillo, Mexico. The morphometric characteristics and sex of the sharks were recorded. Shark A. pelagicus accumulated higher concentrations of TE, especially for Hg and Cd, than the other species. Significant differences in the TE levels were detected between sexes in P. glauca and A. pelagicus; in all cases, the highest concentrations were found in female muscle tissue. The ability of sharks to bioaccumulate ETs depends of the metals (essentials higher than non-essential) but is explained mainly by feeding habits associated to sexes (population segregation) and size (ontogeny). The association between TE in shark specimens was related to the essentiality, their antagonistic action, and origin. The Se/Hg ratio was significantly higher than 1, evidence of the protective role of dietary Se against Hg uptake and toxicity in all specimens of the three shark species. Also, the elevate inverse correlation of As and Cd versus Se could indicate a protective action of Se against these toxic metals, but the mechanism must be investigated.","Álvaro-Berlanga, Sara; Calatayud-Pavía, Clara E; Cruz-Ramírez, Angelica; Soto-Jiménez, Martin F; Liñán-Cabello, Marco A",Environmental science and pollution research international,40,16

OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) level and COVID-19 infection, its severity, and its clinical case characteristics. METHODS This case-control study compared serum 25(OH)D levels and rates of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) between 80 healthy controls and 62 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Guangxi People's Hospital, China, 2/16/2020-3/16/2020. Cases were categorized into asymptomatic, mild/moderate, and severe/critical disease. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between 25(OH)D level, or VDD, and case status/severity of COVID-19 while controlling for demographics and comorbidities. A threshold level of vitamin D for conveying COVID-19 risk was estimated. RESULTS Severe/critical COVID-19 cases were significantly older and had higher percentages of comorbidity (renal failure) compared to mild cases. The serum 25(OH)D concentration in COVID-19 patient was much lower than that in healthy control. And 25(OH)D level was the lowest in severe/critical cases, compared with mild cases. In further, significantly higher rates of VDD were found in COVID-19 cases (41.9%) compared to healthy controls (11.1%). And VDD was the greatest in severe/critical cases (80%), compared with mild cases (36%). These statistically significant associations remained even after controlling for demographics and comorbidities. A potential threshold of 25(OH)D (41.19 nmol/L) to protect against COVID-19 was identified. CONCLUSION Elderly and people with comorbidities were susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection. VDD was a risk factor for COVID-19, especially for severe/critical cases. While further confirmation is needed, vitamin D supplementation may have prevention or treatment potential for COVID-19 disease.","Ye, Kun; Tang, Fen; Liao, Xin; Shaw, Benjamin A; Deng, Meiqiu; Huang, Guangyi; Qin, Zhiqiang; Peng, Xiaomei; Xiao, Hewei; Chen, Chunxia; Liu, Xiaochun; Ning, Leping; Wang, Bangqin; Tang, Ningning; Li, Min; Xu, Fan; Lin, Shao; Yang, Jianrong",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,40,1

However, testing these mechanical hypotheses on proteins in their natural environment remains inaccesible to conventional tools. To address this limitation, here we demonstrate a mouse model carrying a HaloTag-TEV insertion in the protein titin, the main determinant of myocyte stiffness. Using our system, we specifically sever titin by digestion with TEV protease, and find that the response of muscle fibers to length changes requires mechanical transduction through titin's intact polypeptide chain. In addition, HaloTag-based covalent tethering enables examination of titin dynamics under force using magnetic tweezers. At pulling forces < 10 pN, titin domains are recruited to the unfolded state, and produce 41.5 zJ mechanical work during refolding. Insertion of the HaloTag-TEV cassette in mechanical proteins opens opportunities to explore the molecular basis of cellular force generation, mechanosensing and mechanotransduction.","Rivas-Pardo, Jaime Andrés; Li, Yong; Mártonfalvi, Zsolt; Tapia-Rojo, Rafael; Unger, Andreas; Fernández-Trasancos, Ángel; Herrero-Galán, Elías; Velázquez-Carreras, Diana; Fernández, Julio M; Linke, Wolfgang A; Alegre-Cebollada, Jorge",Nature communications,40,8

The risk/benefit assessment and the main infection control policies in the clinical practices are also looked at. EXPERT OPINION Regulatory agencies have amended their medical devices directives to address the pandemic, but each in a different way. In this exceptional situation scientist and technology experts in collaboration with medical specialists should work together to re-assess the risk analysis on medical equipment management and their use and re-use in this context with the aim to improve global healthcare. Every effort must be made to provide the necessary devices at least with the minimum acceptable performances for Covid-19 patients while maintaining a high standard of safety for users.

Its suspicion begins with a meticulous physical examination and anamnesis. Diagnosis should be made on the basis of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. Serum and synovial biomarkers are very useful tools when major criteria are absent.Although sometimes not possible due to medical conditions, surgery is usually the first line of treatment. Although its outcome is highly correlated with the isolated microorganism, irrigation and debridement with implant retention (DAIR) is the gold standard for treatment. Ideally, the prior approach should be proximally and distally extended to augment the field of view and remove all of the prosthetic modular components, that is, femoral head and acetabular insert.Given DAIR's unclear control of infection, with successful outcomes in the range of 30% to 95%, one- or two-stage revision protocols may play a role in certain cases of acute infections; nonetheless, further prospective, randomized studies are necessary to compare long-term outcomes between DAIR and revision surgeries.Following surgical treatment, length of antibiotherapy is in the range of six weeks to six months, without any difference in outcomes between short and long protocols.

However, the underlying neural mechanisms of persistence and the methods that enhance the neuroplasticity underlying persistence, remain unclear. We here demonstrate that the structural properties of the frontal pole cortex (FPC) before tasks contain information that can classify Achievers and Non-achievers (goal-directed persistence) participating in three tasks that differ in time scale (hours to months) and task domains (cognitive, language, and motor learning). We also found that most Achievers exhibit experience-dependent neuroplastic changes in the FPC after completing language and motor learning tasks. Moreover, we confirmed that a coaching strategy that used subgoals modified goal-directed persistence and increased the likelihood of becoming an Achiever. Notably, we discovered that neuroplastic changes in the FPC were facilitated by the subgoal strategy, suggesting that goal-striving, using effective coaching, optimizes the FPC for goal persistence.","Hosoda, Chihiro; Tsujimoto, Satoshi; Tatekawa, Masaru; Honda, Manabu; Osu, Rieko; Hanakawa, Takashi",Communications biology,40,1

This pandemic highlights the importance of antiviral drug discovery, which targets emerging viral pathogens, as well as existing pathogenic viruses that undergo continuous evolution. Drug discovery and development is a long and resource intensive process; however, the use of biomarkers can accelerate clinical development of antivirals by providing information regarding diagnosis of specific viral infections, status of infection, potential safety parameters, and antiviral responses. In clinical practice, many of the biomarkers initially utilized to support clinical development are also used for patient care. While viral load is a standard and essential biomarker used to detect the desired viral suppression induced by an antiviral agent, it has become apparent that additional biomarkers, whether related to the virus, the host or as a consequence of the drug's mechanistic effects, are also important for monitoring clinical outcomes associated with an antiviral therapy. This review summarizes the biomarkers used in the clinical development (as well as in clinical practice, where appropriate) of antiviral therapies for hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Ng, Teresa I; Dorr, Patrick K; Krishnan, Preethi; Cohen, Daniel E; Rhee, Susan; Wang, Stanley X; Ruzek, Melanie C; Mensa, Federico J; Kati, Warren M","Cytometry.

The association between moderate-severe liver injury and more severe clinical course of COVID-19 has suggested that liver injury is prevalent in severe than in mild cases of COVID-19, while no difference in liver involvement has been reported between survivors and non-survivors. The spectrum of liver involvement during COVID-19 ranges from an asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to severe hepatitis. Only rarely, cases with acute hepatitis have been reported in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Both epithelial and biliary cells possess the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 uses to be internalized. However, to our knowledge, no ultrastructural identification of the virus in liver cells has been reported to date. Here we provide evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the liver of two patients, a 34-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS We investigated two patients with COVID-19 showing several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. In both patients, we performed histological and ultrastructural examinations by liver biopsy. After two months, both patients were free of symptoms, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection had resolved. RESULTS Liver biopsy histological and ultrastructural examination showed liver injury and several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. CONCLUSIONS Although most studies in COVID-19 have been focused on the lungs, recently, cholestatic liver pathology has been introduced in the spectrum of pathological changes related to COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, those presented in this paper are the first images of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infected liver cells. Our findings suggest a role for cholangiocytes and biliary structures in the COVID-19.","Pirisi, M; Rigamonti, C; D'Alfonso, S; Nebuloni, M; Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Orrù, G; Venanzi Rullo, E; Pavone, P; Faa, G; Saba, L; Boldorini, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,40,25

Despite the improvement of laparoscopic techniques within the past several decades, minimally invasive PS has remained a marginal technique that has not been well evaluated. Our objective was to provide an update on the indications and the feasibility of this procedure. METHODS The MEDLINE database (PubMed) was searched, and all relevant articles that involved a true minimally invasive PS (i.e., segmental or lobar devascularization of the spleen with parenchymal transection) were included. The search was conducted until the 31st of March 2014. Demographic data, operative indications, estimated blood losses, operative times, conversion rates and complications were extracted from the included articles and were summarized for discussion. RESULTS Out of the 195 publications that were retrieved, 33 were included, which were mainly case reports and case series that represented a total of 187 patients. There were 37 men, 33 women and 117 patients of unknown gender. The mean age of the patients was ranged from 6 to 58 years. The mean total operative time was between 70 and 216 min for conventional laparoscopy and between 108 and 120 min for the robotic approach. For most studies, the mean estimated blood loss was minimal. The complication rate was 5.36% for conventional laparoscopy and 5.56% for the robotic approach. CONCLUSION The outcomes of minimally invasive PS were favorable and comparable to those of the open technique according to the literature. This procedure may constitute an attractive alternative to the open technique for selected cases. Moreover, a robotic approach might be an interesting technical option, but additional research is needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.","Balaphas, Alexandre; Buchs, Nicolas C; Meyer, Jeremy; Hagen, Monika E; Morel, Philippe",Surgical endoscopy,40,1

As the majority of these cells are directed to conserved viral proteins, they may afford protection against IAVs of various subtypes. The present study assessed the cross-reactivity of human CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, induced by infection with seasonal A (H1N1) or A (H3N2) influenza virus, with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus [A(H1N1)pdm09] and swine-origin triple-reassortant A (H3N2) [A(H3N2)v] viruses that are currently causing an increasing number of human cases in the USA. It was demonstrated that CD8(+) T-cells induced after seasonal IAV infections exerted lytic activity and produced gamma interferon upon in vitro restimulation with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2)v influenza A viruses. Furthermore, CD8(+) T-cells directed to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus displayed a high degree of cross-reactivity with A(H3N2)v viruses.

Yet, tumors at the gastroesophageal junction, on the posterior wall, or in the distal antrum are difficult to approach. Such tumors often must be exposed via gastrotomy or using a rendezvous maneuver. Our method of total intragastric laparoscopic resection using 'pneumogastrum', rigid laparoscope, and conventional laparoscopic instruments is described in an intuitive video. METHODS Two cases of total inverse transgastric resection involved resection of a submucosal GIST, one at the front wall of the cardia and the other on the posterior wall of the antrum. The third case required excision of a large prepyloric cystic lesion leading to a gastric outlet stenosis. After insertion of three trocars under laparoscopic control, a further trocar was introduced into the stomach and 'pneumogastrum' was established. Two additional 5-mm trocars were intragastrally placed. Intragastric endoscopy with a rigid optic provided an excellent view. The tumor was exposed resected with a linear stapler. The specimen was inserted into an Endo Pouch™ which was sutured to an orally inserted gastric tube. The Endo Pouch™ was gently pulled transorally. After removal of the intragastric trocars, the entrance points were laparoscopically closed. RESULTS From the first and second cases, we retrieved GIST tumors. In the third case, we retrieved a gastritis cystica profunda. Postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS Gastric GIST should be resected laparoscopically if negative margins are safely achieved regardless of its size. Tumors at the frontwall and exophytic backwall GIST are addressed by laparoscopic wedge resection. Tumors at the gastrojejunal junction, in the prepyloric region, and fundus as well as submucous GIST of the gastric backwall are best approached by intragastric laparoscopic resection. Transoral specimen retrieval is an interesting option in smaller tumors.","Lamm, Sebastian H; Steinemann, Daniel C; Linke, Georg R; Eucker, Dietmar; Simon, Thomas; Zerz, Andreas; Stoll, Reinhard",Surgical endoscopy,40,1

The aim of this study was to explore the function and mechanism of MAPK signaling pathway in enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection of human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. METHODS Apoptosis of RD cells was observed using annexin V-FITC/PI binding assay under a fluorescence microscope. Cellular RNA was extracted and transcribed to cDNA. The expressions of 56 genes of MAPK signaling pathway in EV71-infected RD cells at 8h and 20h after infection were analyzed by PCR array. The levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α in the supernatant of RD cells infected with EV71 at different time points were measured by ELISA. RESULTS The viability of RD cells decreased obviously within 48h after EV71 infection. Compared with the control group, EV71 infection resulted in the significantly enhanced releases of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and TNF-α from infected RD cells (p<0.05). At 8h after infection, the expressions of c-Jun, c-Fos, IFN-β, MEKK1, MLK3 and NIK genes in EV71-infected RD cells were up-regulated by 2.08-6.12-fold, whereas other 19 genes (e.g. AKT1, AKT2, E2F1, IKK and NF-κB1) exhibited down-regulation. However, at 20h after infection, those MAPK signaling molecules including MEKK1, ASK1, MLK2, MLK3, NIK, MEK1, MEK2, MEK4, MEK7, ERK1, JNK1 and JNK2 were up-regulated. In addition, the expressions of AKT2, ELK1, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB p65, PI3K and STAT1 were also increased. CONCLUSION EV71 infection induces the differential gene expressions of MAPK signaling pathway such as ERK, JNK and PI3K/AKT in RD cells, which may be associated with the secretions of inflammatory cytokines and host cell apoptosis.","Shi, Weifeng; Hou, Xueling; Li, Xiang; Peng, Hongjun; Shi, Mei; Jiang, Qingbo; Liu, Xiping; Ji, Yun; Yao, Yuhua; He, Caizhen; Lei, Xiangdong",The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,40,11

We performed a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis of the incidence of BNS after transurethral procedures for BPH. METHODS We performed a systemic literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Controlled Register of Trials. We accepted only randomized trials comparing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) vs. other transurethral surgery for BPH that were grouped in Ablation vs. Enucleation modalities. The incidences of BNS were pooled using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Method with the random effect model and expressed as Risk Ratios, 95% Confidence Intervals, and p values. Study heterogeneity was assessed utilizing the I2 value. RESULTS 72 studies were identified for meta-analysis, 46 comparing TURP vs. Ablation and 26 TURP vs. Enucleation. The pooled incidence of BNS was 1.3% after TURP, 0.66% after enucleation and 1.2% after Ablation. The incidence of BNS was higher after TURP than after Enucleation but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.75 95% CI 0.81-3.79, p = 0.16). There was no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 0%, Chi2 4.11, p = 0.90).

We investigated the displacement range of surgical clips in the breast during postoperative radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery. METHODS A total of 178 patients who received breast-conserving surgery and postoperative radiation of 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions to the involved breast for 6.5 weeks were included. Surgical clips were used to mark the lumpectomy cavity during breast-conserving surgery. Patients undertook planning computed tomography (CT) scan for whole breast irradiation. Five weeks after beginning radiation, when the irradiation dose was 45 Gy, planning CT scan was performed again for a boost radiotherapy plan in all patients. The surgical clips were defined in both CT images and compared in lateromedial (X), anteroposterior (Y), superoinferior (Z), and three-dimensional directions. RESULTS The 90th percentile of displacement of surgical clips was 5.31 mm (range, 0.0-22.2 mm) in the lateromedial direction, 7.1 mm (range, 0.0-14.2 mm) in the anteroposterior direction, and 6.0 mm (range, 0.0-10.0 mm) in the superoinferior direction. The 90th percentile of three-dimensional displacement distance was 9.8 mm (range, 0.0-28.2 mm). On the multivariate analysis, seroma ≥15 mL was the only independent factor associated with the displacement of surgical clips. In patients with seroma ≥15 mL, the 90th percentile of displacement of surgical clips was 15.1 mm in the lateromedial direction, 12.7 mm in the anteroposterior direction, 10.0 mm in the superoinferior direction, and 21.8 mm in the three-dimensional distance. CONCLUSION A target volume expansion of 10 mm from surgical clips may be sufficient to compensate for the displacement of clips during postoperative radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. For patients who had a seroma, a replanning CT scan for a boost radiation should be considered to ensure exact postoperative radiotherapy in breast cancer.","Sung, SooYoon; Lee, Joo Hwan; Lee, Jong Hoon; Kim, Sung Hwan; Kwak, Yoo-Kang; Lee, Sea-Won; Jeon, Ye Won; Suh, Young Jin",Journal of breast cancer,40,30

Critically ill patients have some special characteristics that increase the risk for VTE and complicate risk stratification and diagnosis. Given the positive effect of thromboprophylaxis on main outcomes, its use is mandatory in these patients, which is documented by various studies and recommended by all published guidelines. However, anticoagulation management is not an easy issue in clinical practice, as the critical patient may be at high risk for thrombosis or, conversely, at increased risk of bleeding or may balance between thrombotic and bleeding risk. Thrombotic and bleeding risk scoring should be evaluated daily in order to select the appropriate form of thromboprophylaxis. The selection depends on the degree of bleeding risk and the subgroup of ICU patients involved, such as patients with sepsis, acute brain injury, major trauma or coronavirus disease-2019. If there is no bleeding risk or other contraindication, the patient should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins, weighing the advantages of each agent. If the patient is at high risk of bleeding or there is a contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis, he should receive mechanical thromboprophylaxis mainly with intermittent pneumatic compression or graduated compression stockings. Thromboprophylaxis compliance with the guidelines is a prerequisite for moving from theory to practice. Direct oral anticoagulants have been studied in ICU patients and have no place at present in VTE prophylaxis requiring further research.","Schizodimos, Theodoros; Soulountsi, Vasiliki; Iasonidou, Christina; Kapravelos, Nikos",Minerva anestesiologica,40,16

Obviously, some drugs approved for other than epilepsy indications can modify the anticonvulsant activity of antiepileptics. Areas covered: This review highlights the drug-drug interactions between antiepileptics and aminophylline, some antidepressant, antiarrhythmic (class I - IV), selected antihypertensive drugs and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics (ketamine, propofol, etomidate, and alphaxalone). The data were reviewed mainly from experimental models of seizures. Whenever possible, clinical data were provided. PUBMED data base was the main search source. Expert opinion: Aminophylline generally reduced the protective activity of antiepileptics, which, to a certain degree, was consistent with scarce clinical data on methylxanthine derivatives and worse seizure control. The only antiarrhythmic with this profile of action was mexiletine when co-administered with VPA. Among antidepressants and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics, trazodone, mianserin and etomidate or alphaxalone, respectively, negatively affected the anticonvulsant action of some antiepileptic drugs. Clinical data indicate that only amoxapine, bupropion, clomipramine and maprotiline should be used with caution. Possibly, drugs reducing the anticonvulsant potential of antiepileptics should be avoided in epilepsy patients.","Borowicz-Reutt, Kinga K; Czuczwar, Stanisław J; Rusek, Marta",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,40,19

Interestingly, lymphopenia [41% (0.30-0.53)] and leucopenia[22%(0.16-0.29)] were more common than lymphocytosis [33%(0.02-0.64)] and leucocytosis [12%(0.09-0.16)]. Fever(69% vs, 44%), cough(53% vs. 33%) and dyspnea(20% vs 4%) were more common in adults as compared to paediatric population. Diarrhoea was more common among the paediatric cases [12%)] vs. [9%)]. The pooled estimate of fatality was 4%. CONCLUSIONS The most commonly experienced ENT symptom was cough followed by anosmia and dysguesia. Raised ESR and CRP with leukopenia and lymphopenia are common laboratory findings. Majority of the infected patients had abnormal computed tomography findings.

The pathogenesis may involve hemodynamic alterations secondary to increased poststenting venous sinus pressure, which may cause new arterial ingrowth into the fistulous sinus wall without capillary interposition. Despite administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, there may also be subclinical cortical vein thrombosis that contributed to DAVF formation. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, increased inflammation induced by VSS may upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor expression and also promote DAVF pathogenesis. Since VSS has been used to obliterate DAVFs, DAVF formation after VSS may seem counterintuitive. Previous stents have generally been closed cell, stainless steel designs used to maximize radial compression of the fistulous sinus wall. In contrast, our patient's stent was an open cell, self-expandable nitinol design (Protégé Everflex). Neurointerventionalists should be aware of this potential, although rare complication of DAVF formation after VSS.","Buell, Thomas J; Raper, Daniel M; Ding, Dale; Chen, Ching-Jen; Liu, Kenneth C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,40,1

Eighty-seven patients with lung cancer undergoing lung cancer resection in Weifang People's Hospital from January 2014 to June 2018 were enrolled in this study. Patients conventionally anesthetized by propofol, midazolam, sufentanil, or cisatracurium besilate (41 cases) were assigned to the control group and those anesthetized by conventional anesthetic and dexmedetomidine (46 cases) were assigned to the research group. The hemodynamic parameters, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and astrocyte S-100p protein (S-100β) were compared between the two groups before induction (T0), 5 min after induction (T1), at the end of surgery (T2), time of extubation (T3), and 5 min after extubation (T4). The cognitive function of patients was graded by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) after patients recovered from anesthesia. In both the control group and the research group, the levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP). were statistically higher at T2 and T3 than those at T0 (all P<0.05). The levels of MAP, HR, and CVP were statistically lower in the research group than those in the control group at T2 and T3 (P<0.05). The levels of serum NSE and S100β protein in the research group and the control group increased at T2, T3, and T4, the control group was higher than the research group at each time point, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Comparison of the MMSE score and the total case number of adverse reactions between the two groups showed no statistical difference (both P>0.05). The MMSE score was positively correlated with the serum levels of NSE and S100β in the two groups (r-values were 0.661 and 0.585, P<0.05). Dexmedetomidine can effectively protect patients' perioperative brain function with small impacts on perioperative hemodynamics, so it is worthy of clinical application.","Li, Yunfeng; Wang, Chunyu; Bi, Mingzhuang; Gao, Jie; Zhang, Xue; Tian, Haitao",Oncology letters,40,19

AI and ML algorithms have extended its major role in tracking the disease patterns, and in identifying possible treatment of disease. OBJECTIVE To identify potential COVID-19 protease inhibitor through shape-based Machine Learning assisted by Molecular docking and Molecular Dynamics simulation. METHODS 31 repurposed compounds have been selected targeting coronavirus protease (6LU7) and a machine learning approach was employed to generate shape-based molecules starting from 3D shape to pharmacophoric features of its seed compound. Ligand-Receptor docking was performed with Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS3) algorithms to identify high-affinity compounds from the list of selected candidates for 6LU7. This compound was subjected to Molecular Dynamic Simulations followed by ADMET studies and other analysis. RESULTS Shape-based Machine learning reported Remdesivir, Valrubicin, Aprepitant, and Fulvestrant and a novel therapeutic compound as the best therapeutic agents with the highest affinity for its target protein. Among the best shape-based compounds, the novel theoretical compound was not indexed in any chemical databases (PubChem, Zinc, or ChEMBL). Hence, the novel compound was named 'nCorvEMBS'. Further, toxicity analysis showed nCorv-EMBS to be efficacious that can be qualified as a 6LU7 inhibitor in COVID-19. CONCLUSION An effective ACE-II, GAK, AAK1, and protease 3C blockers that can serve a novel therapeutic approach to block the binding and attachment of COVID-19 protein (PDB ID: 6LU7) to the host cell and thus inhibit the infection at AT2 Lung cells. The novel theoretical compound nCorv-EMBS herein proposed stands as a promising inhibitor that can be extended for entering phases of clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment.","Khandelwal, Ravina; Nayarisseri, Anuraj; Madhavi, Maddala; Selvaraj, Chandrabose; Panwar, Umesh; Sharma, Khushboo; Hussain, Tajamul; Singh, Sanjeev Kumar",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,40,27

We tested a new oxygen delivery device designed to address these problems by simulating 108 patients with sepsis and respiratory failure. The device being tested consisted of an airtight mask, a bacterial and viral filter, a T-shaped reservoir (50 and 100 ml) and oxygen delivery tubing connected directly to the mask. When tested with a 50-ml reservoir, a high fractional oxygen concentration was achieved: mean (SD) 0.83 (0.11) at a flow of 15 l.min(-1) oxygen. The 50-ml reservoir, when compared with the 100-ml reservoir, was associated with reduced carbon dioxide rebreathing (mean (SD) inspired fractional carbon dioxide concentration 2.5 (1.0) vs 3.0 (1.1), respectively, p = 0.009) and reduced inspiratory resistive work of breathing (mean (SD) 1.0 (0.6) J.l(-1) vs 1.2 (0.5) J.l(-1), respectively, p = 0.028). However, rebreathing and work of breathing were relatively high if a high respiratory rate was simulated. We conclude that the novel oxygen device we describe, equipped with the 50-ml T-shaped reservoir, is suitable for potentially infectious patients with type-1 respiratory failure but without marked tachypnoea.","Yip, Y Y; Kwok, W H; Gomersall, C D",Anaesthesia,40,9

However, there is limited evidence of the potential harms and benefits of this practice. Our objective was to conduct a scoping review to map the literature describing maternal and newborn outcomes of aBME. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, British Library E-Theses Online Services (EThOS) database, OpenGrey, and Clinical trials.gov from inception to January 2020. Studies in English that reported on the effect of aBME on maternal and newborn outcomes, and the experiences of women who have engaged in the practice were included for screening. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened by two independent reviewers. A critical appraisal and clinical consultation were conducted. Key findings were extracted and summarized. RESULTS We screened 659 studies and 20 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of included studies (n = 11, 55.0%) were published after 2015, and seven (35.0%) originated from Australia. Ten (50.0%) studies provided data on high-risk obstetrical populations, including those with diabetes (n = 8), overweight or obesity (n = 1), and preeclampsia (n = 1). Commonly reported outcomes included breastfeeding status at discharge or follow-up, mode of delivery, newborn blood glucose, and time to establishing full lactation. Maternal experiences were related to challenges with aBME, confidence and mastery, perceived impact, security and altruism, learning and resources, and physical symptoms as a result of aBME. The critical appraisal demonstrated limited high-quality evidence surrounding aBME. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate increasing interest in the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of aBME. Existing studies are heterogenous with variable research questions, outcomes, study designs, and methodology. The recommendations made in this review can be used to help inform future studies evaluating aBME.","Foudil-Bey, Imane; Murphy, Malia S Q; Dunn, Sandra; Keely, Erin J; El-Chaâr, Darine",International breastfeeding journal,40,1

The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive tool to enable HCPs in timely recognising and directing PC needs in CHF. METHODS A four-stage mixed-method study was performed. Stage 1: identification of needs and questions of patients and families; stage 2: prioritisation and refinement of the needs and questions; stage 3a: testing and online feedback on V.1; stage 3b: selecting and refining care recommendations; stage 4: testing and review of V.2. Iterative reviews followed each step in the development process to ensure a wide range of stakeholder input. In total, 16 patients, 12 family members and 54 HCPs participated. RESULTS A comprehensive set of 13 PC needs was identified, redefined and tested. The resulting tool, called Identification of patients with HeARt failure with PC needs (I-HARP), contains an introduction prompt with open questions to start the conversation, 13 closed screening questions with additional in-depth questions, and recommendations on actions for identified needs. CONCLUSION I-HARP contains an evidence-based set of questions and palliative CHF care suggestions for HCPs in the Netherlands. The resulting tool, approved by HCPs, patients and family members, is a promising guidance for HCP to timely recognise and direct PC needs in CHF.","Ament, Stephanie M C; van den Beuken-Everdingen, Marieke; Maessen, José M C; Boyne, Josiane; Schols, Jos M G A; Stoffers, Henri E J H; Bellersen, Louise; Brunner-La Rocca, Hans-Peter; Engels, Yvonne; Janssen, Daisy J A",BMJ supportive & palliative care,40,16

We have determined the mode of resistance to a series of arylamide compounds in M. tuberculosis We isolated M. tuberculosis resistant mutants to two arylamide compounds which are inhibitory to growth under host-relevant conditions (butyrate as a sole carbon source). Thirteen mutants were characterized, and all had mutations in Rv2571c; mutations included a premature stop codon and frameshifts as well as non-synonymous polymorphisms. We isolated a further ten strains with mutations in Rv2571c with resistance. Complementation with a wild-type copy of Rv2571c restored arylamide sensitivity. Over-expression of Rv2571c was toxic in both wild-type and mutant backgrounds. We constructed M. tuberculosis strains with an unmarked deletion of the entire Rv2571c gene by homologous recombination and confirmed that these were resistant to the arylamide series. Rv2571c is a member of the aromatic amino acid transport family and has a fusaric acid resistance domain which is associated with compound transport. Since loss or inactivation of Rv2571c leads to resistance, we propose that Rv2571c is involved in the import of arylamide compounds.","Shelton, Catherine D; McNeil, Matthew B; Early, Julie V; Ioerger, Thomas R; Parish, Tanya",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,40,1

One major challenge in achieving these goals is the paucity of suitable preclinical animal models. Mice constitute ~70% of all the laboratory animal species used in biomedical research. Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 infects mice only if they have been genetically modified to express human ACE2. The inherent resistance of wild-type mice to SARS-CoV-2, combined with a wealth of genetic tools that are available only for modifying mice, offers a unique opportunity to create a versatile set of genetically engineered mouse models useful for COVID-19 research.

Using ultra-high-field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), APOE-ε3-ε3 carriers predominantly recruited cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) during a spatial mnemonic discrimination task, whereas APOE-ε3-ε4 and APOE-ε3-ε2 carriers engaged CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) to the same degree. Specifically, APOE-ε3-ε4 carriers showed reduced pattern separation in CA3, whereas APOE-ε3-ε2 carriers exhibited increased effects in DG and pattern separation-related functional connectivity between DG and CA3.

The aim of this study was to determine whether these receptors are also suitable targets for metastatic BC. METHODS mRNA expression of human BC samples were studied by in vitro autoradiography and associated with radioligand binding. Next, GRPR and SSTR2 mRNA levels of 60 paired primary BCs and metastases from different sites were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receptor mRNA expression levels were associated with clinico-pathological factors and expression levels of primary tumors and corresponding metastases were compared. RESULTS Binding of GRPR and SSTR radioligands to tumor tissue correlated significantly with receptor mRNA expression. High GRPR and SSTR2 mRNA levels were associated with estrogen receptor (ESR1)-positive tumors (p<0.001 for both receptors). There was no significant difference in GRPR mRNA expression of primary tumors versus paired metastases. Regarding SSTR2 mRNA expression, there was also no significant difference in the majority of cases, apart from liver and ovarian metastases which showed a significantly lower expression compared to the corresponding primary tumors (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION Targeting the GRPR and SSTR2 for nuclear imaging and/or treatment has the potential to improve BC care in primary as well as metastatic disease.","Dalm, Simone U; Schrijver, Willemijne A M E; Sieuwerts, Anieta M; Look, Maxime P; Ziel-van der Made, Angelique C J; de Weerd, Vanja; Martens, John W; van Diest, Paul J; de Jong, Marion; van Deurzen, Carolien H M",PloS one,40,31

We present our experience using a new large-bore 0.058 inch or 0.072 inch inner diameter (ID) hyperflexible access catheter placed deep within the intracranial circulation during the neurointervention. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all neurointerventions performed by the senior author during an 18-month period to identify patients in whom the Navien intracranial catheter was placed in an ultra-distal position, defined as beyond the clinoidal internal carotid artery (ICA) or V3 segment of the vertebral artery. Procedural data collected included parent artery tortuosity, technique for Navien advancement, intraprocedural Navien position and periprocedural complications. RESULTS The Navien, either 6 F 0.072 inch ID or 5 F 0.058 inch ID, provided ultra-distal large-bore access in the following 11 intracranial interventions: anterior circulation aneurysm treatment with Pipeline embolization device (PED) (n=3); posterior circulation aneurysm single-stage stent coiling (n=5); liquid embolization of arteriovenous malformations (n=2); PED coiling of posterior circulation aneurysm (n=1). The Navien was tracked into position over a Marksman microcatheter in 10/11 cases and a Headway 27 microcatheter in one case. Intraprocedural Navien positions were as follows: supraclinoid ICA (n=2); mid M1 (n=1); V3-V4 junction (n=2) (both using 6 F Navien); distal V4 (n=3); proximal basilar (n=1); proximal-mid basilar (n=1); mid basilar (n=1). No significant catheter-related complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS The Navien is the newest hyperflexible access catheter that is highly trackable into ultra-distal intracranial positions. It maneuvers atraumatically, providing improved distal intracranial support for a variety of complex cerebrovascular interventions and preserves necessary ID for quality intraprocedural roadmaps and angiography.","Lin, Li-Mei; Colby, Geoffrey P; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,40,17

The modified Delphi method was used to refine expert opinion and facilitate a consensus position. Panel members were asked to complete 2 scale-based surveys addressing different aspects of pediatric and adult tracheostomy care. Each survey was followed by a conference call during which results were presented and statements discussed. RESULTS The panel achieved consensus on 77 statements; another 39 were dropped because of lack of consensus. Consensus was reached on statements that address initial tracheostomy tube change, management of emergencies and complications, prerequisites for decannulation, management of tube cuffs and communication devices, and specific patient and caregiver education needs. CONCLUSION The consensus panel agreed on statements that address the continuum of care, from initial tube management to complications in children and adults with a tracheostomy. The panel also highlighted areas where consensus could not be reached and where more research is needed.

We collected samples of serum, plasma and whole blood from each patient between February, 12 and 18, 2020, and with a double- blind design, the samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min. In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay. We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples. RESULTS With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%. For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively. For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%. Pearson correlation analysis of the semi-quantitative results of IgM and IgG detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 (95%CI: 0.9998-1.000, P < 0.001) between the results before and after sample inactivation. CONCLUSIONS Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56 ℃ for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators. Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.","Xue, Xiongyan; Zhu, Changlin; Huang, Shaozhen; Pan, Lianhua; Xu, Jianhua; Li, Weixuan",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,40,27

Overweight and obesity are related to a later, increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Increasing weight between pregnancies has a negative impact on the development of the fetus in a subsequent pregnancy. It is also related to long-term obesity and overweight for the woman. Accordingly, weight control in women of the childbearing age is important for both women and their offspring. Information and communication technology (ICT) has become an integrated part of many peoples' lives, and it has the potential to prevent disease. In this systematic review, we summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials to compare effects of different ICT-based interventions to support postpartum women to achieve weight loss. METHODS A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane, searching on terms, such as postpartum, weight loss, telemedicine, and randomized controlled trials. Two independent researchers undertook study selection and data extraction. Results were reported narratively. The systematic review only included studies that were randomized controlled trials. RESULTS Eight studies were included in the systematic review. All of them were characterized by applying one or more ICT components to assist postpartum women in weight control, and had weight loss as an outcome measure. A significant difference was found in weight loss between control group and intervention group in the majority of the studies. However, five of the studies had a relatively short follow-up period (40 days to 16 weeks), six of the studies had a relatively small sample size (18 to 66 women), and half of the studies indicated challenges with adherence to the interventions over time. CONCLUSION ICT-based interventions can support postpartum women to achieve a healthy lifestyle and weight control. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and adherence to the interventions.

Sensitive molecular assays have increased the detection of common respiratory viruses and expanded the panel of detectable viruses. Both a rapid viral culture with direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) staining and a PCR-based assay (MultiCode-PLx Respiratory Virus Panel) were performed on patients with hematologic malignancies, who underwent collection of a nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage from October 2006 to April 2007. Eighty-two samples from 70 patients were obtained; all patients had upper respiratory tract symptoms. Respiratory viruses were detected in 10 samples (12%) by conventional virological methods and in 31 samples (38%) by the MultiCode-PLx assay. This increased diagnostic yield resulted from better sensitivity for those viruses detectable by both methods and detection of viruses not covered by the antigen detection/rapid culture method (human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses and rhinoviruses). The MultiCode-PLx assay frequently identified respiratory viral infections which are not detected by rapid viral culture/DFA; 40% of these patients had pneumonia in addition to the upper respiratory tract symptoms. Improved diagnostics for respiratory viruses may lead to more effective management and better outcomes in this patient population.","Murali, Sujatha; Langston, Amelia A; Nolte, Frederick S; Banks, Grier; Martin, Reid; Caliendo, Angela M",Leukemia & lymphoma,40,16

A systematic review.,14.181857,9.741854,2021-07-20,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This article reviews the current literature dealing with pathophysiology, diagnostics, bleeding management, and thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute and chronic liver dysfunction. RECENT FINDINGS Routine coagulation tests such as prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) are not able to define whether a patient with critical liver dysfunction is hypocoagulable or hypercoagulable and are not able to predict the risk of bleeding in patients with liver dysfunction. Therefore, prophylactic transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in order to correct laboratory values is not appropriate. Notably, patients with liver dysfunction and increased INR are not 'autoanticoagulated'. In contrast, thrombin generation assays in the presence and absence of thrombomodulin or Protac, a snake venom that activates protein C in a manner similar to thrombomodulin, as well as viscoelastic tests (thrombelastography/thromboelastometry) indicate that patients with liver dysfunction are rather hypercoagulable with the inherent risk of thrombosis. SUMMARY Coagulopathy in patients with critical liver dysfunction is complex and can quickly decompensate to bleeding as well as to thrombosis. Both are associated with worse outcome. Hemostatic interventions should only be performed in case of clinically relevant bleeding and thromboprophylaxis should strongly be considered.","Schaden, Eva; Saner, Fuat H; Goerlinger, Klaus",Current opinion in critical care,40,16

Depending on the processes used in producing the crude phosphoric acid, it usually contains organic and inorganic contaminants. To make environmentally friendly phosphate fertilizers, these contaminants must be removed from the crude phosphoric acid stock used in making fertilizers. In this paper, commercially available strong cation exchange resin, Marathon C, was used to study the adsorptive removal of U(IV), Mn(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II) from synthetic multi-component phosphoric acid solutions and commercial crude phosphoric acid. Important parameters on the adsorption process such as the effects of contact time, initial metal ion concentration, sorbent dose, and concentration of phosphoric acid were investigated. The results suggested that the adsorption process reached equilibrium within 240 min for the five metal ions studied and the resin had adsorptive affinity for the metal ions in the order of U(IV) > Zn(II) > Cu(II) > Mn(II) > Cd(II). The results from the kinetics and isotherm models from the studies are very consistent with pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Simultaneous adsorptive removal of metal ions from the crude phosphoric acid strongly suggests that the Marathon C resin could be used in removing toxic metal ions from crude phosphoric acids used in making phosphate fertilizer.","Taha, Mohamed H",Environmental science and pollution research international,40,5

We compared postoperative pain and cosmetic results after TLA with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) by a 3-port device. METHODS Patients undergoing TLA were matched with patients undergoing CLA between February 2015 and November 2015 at the same institution. Thirty-two patients underwent TLA with a needle grasper. The appendix was secured by a percutaneous organ-holding device (needle grasper), then removed through a puncture at McBurney's point. Another 38 patients underwent CLA. Patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. RESULTS One patient in the TLA group developed a wound infection and 1 patient in the CLA group developed a postoperative intra-abdominal abscess and 3 wound infections. There was no significant difference between the groups when comparing the length of hospital stay, time until oral intake, and other complications. The pain score in the first 12 hours after surgery was significanly higher in CLA group than the TLA group (P < 0.001). Operative time was significantly shorter in the CLA group compared to the TLA group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION TLA using a needle grasper was associated with a significantly lower pain score 12 hours after surgery, better cosmetic results, and lower cost, than the CLA 3-port procedure because of the fewer number of ports.","Donmez, Turgut; Hut, Adnan; Avaroglu, Huseyin; Uzman, Sinan; Yildirim, Dogan; Ferahman, Sina; Cekic, Erdinc",Annals of surgical treatment and research,40,1

From February 2009 to March 2013 28 patients (22 females, 6 males) were treated with FD; mean age was 57 years. Data, including aneurysm features, clinical presentation, history of previous bleeding, treatment, and follow-up results, are presented. Early postinterventional neurological deficits (transient: n = 3/enduring: n = 1) appeared in 4/28 patients (14%), and early improvement of neurological symptoms was observed in 7 patients with previous restriction of cranial nerve function. The overall occlusion rate was 20/26 (77%; 59% after 3 months). 77% achieved best results according to O'Kelly-Marotta score grade D with no contrast material filling (70% of those after 3 months). In 4/6 patients who did not achieve grade D, proximal and/or distal stent overlapping ≥5 mm was not guaranteed sufficiently. During follow-up we did not detect any aneurysm recurrence or haemorrhage. In-stent stenosis emerged as the most frequent complication (4/27; 15%) followed by 2 cases of vascular obliteration (AICA/VA). In conclusion endovascular reconstruction using a FD represents a modern and effective treatment in those aneurysms that are not suitable for conventional interventional or surgical treatment. The appearance of severe complications was rare.","Breu, Anna-Katharina; Hauser, Till-Karsten; Ebner, Florian H; Bischof, Felix; Ernemann, Ulrike; Seeger, Achim",Radiology research and practice,40,31

The health, social, and economic consequences of the pandemic are difficult to evaluate, since there are many scientific uncertainties and unknowns. OBJECTIVES the main focus of this paper is on statistical methods for profiling municipalities by excess mortality, directly or indirectly caused by COVID-19. METHODS the use of excess mortality for all causes has been advocated as a measure of impact less vulnerable to biases. In this paper, observed mortality for all causes at municipality level in Italy in the period January-April 2020 was compared to the mortality observed in the corresponding period in the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Mortality data were made available by the Ministry of Internal Affairs Italian National Resident Population Demographic Archive and the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat). For each municipality, the posterior predictive distribution under a hierarchical null model was obtained. From the posterior predictive distribution, we obtained excess death counts, attributable community rates and q-values. Full Bayesian models implemented via MCMC simulations were used. RESULTS absolute number of excess deaths highlights the burden paid by major cities to the pandemic. The Attributable Community Rate provides a detailed picture of the spread of the pandemic among the municipalities of Lombardy, Piedmont, and Emilia-Romagna Regions. Using Q-values, it is clearly recognizable evidence of an excess of mortality from late February to April 2020 in a very geographically scattered number of municipalities. A trade-off between false discoveries and false non-discoveries shows the different values of public health actions. CONCLUSIONS despite the variety of approaches to calculate excess mortality, this study provides an original methodological approach to profile municipalities with excess deaths accounting for spatial and temporal uncertainty.","Biggeri, Annibale; Lagazio, Corrado; Catelan, Dolores; Barbone, Fabio; Braga, Mario",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,40,23

We performed single-incision plus one additional port laparoscopy-assisted anterior resection (SILS + 1-AR) starting in August 2010. This study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of SILS + 1-AR and comparing it with that of conventional laparoscopy-assisted anterior resection (C-AR). METHODS Patients with preoperative clinical stage 0 to stage III rectal cancer were included. Demographic, intraoperative, and pathological examination data, as well as short-term outcome data, of 20 patients who underwent SILS + 1-AR were retrospectively compared with that of 20 patients who underwent C-AR. Invasiveness of the two procedures was also evaluated through a vital signs diary and hematological examination on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS Operating time, mean estimated blood loss, the number of lymph nodes dissected, the number of lymph node metastases, and the mean distal resection margin length were not significantly different. However, postoperative neutrophil counts in the SILS + 1-AR group were lower than those in the C-AR group (P = 0.085). A significant difference in body temperature was observed in the SILS + 1-AR group on POD 1 (P = 0.028). No significant differences were observed in perioperative and overall morbidity between the two groups. Conversion to open surgery was required in 2 (10 %) of the 20 patients in the SILS + 1-AR group. The mean postoperative length of stay and recurrence rates were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION SILS + 1-AR for rectal cancer is similar to C-AR in safety, feasibility, and provision of oncological radicality.","Kawamata, Futoshi; Homma, Shigenori; Minagawa, Nozomi; Kawamura, Hideki; Takahashi, Norihiko; Taketomi, Akinobu",World journal of surgery,40,1

Contact tracing is an important strategy to control tubercular infection in the community. This study was done to find out prevalence of tuberculosis and tubercular infection in children living with sputum smear-positive adult patients receiving DOTS at recruitment and to find out incidence of tubercular infection and disease in these children on follow up. METHOD Children (< 15 years) living in contact with adults on DOTS were grouped as < 6 years and 6-14 years. They were further sub grouped as being - uninfected, infected, diseased and on prophylaxis and were followed at 3, 6 and 9 months. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and chest X-ray were done. RESULTS At recruitment 152 children were enrolled and 21.1% (n = 32) had TB. On follow up, 4.3% (n = 5), 5.8% (n = 6) and 11.6% (n = 11) children developed TB after 3, 6 and 9 months respectively.9 children did not come for the last follow up so the overall prevalence of TB disease at 9 months was 37.7% (n = 54).

METHODS The medical records of 231 cats with confirmed FIP that presented to the Clinic of Small Animal Medicine of the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, were reviewed for signalment, history, and clinical and laboratory parameters. Age, sex and breed distribution of the cats were compared with the clinic population. RESULTS Male sex and young age were significantly correlated with FIP. Neutering status was not associated with FIP. No breed predisposition was observed and the majority of cats presented were domestic shorthair and mixed breed. Microcytosis of peripheral erythrocytes was found in 35.1% of cats, of which 42.4% did not have concurrent anaemia. Band neutrophilia was documented in 44.3% (81/183), of which 35.8% did not have mature neutrophilia. Lymphopenia, observed significantly more often with effusion, was documented in only 26.8% of cats without effusion. Hyperbilirubinaemia also occurred significantly more often in cats with vs without effusion. While serum total protein was increased in only 17.5% of cats, hyperglobulinaemia was documented in 89.1%. Nearly 85.0% of cats had an albumin-to-globulin (A:G) ratio <0.8, while 67.8% had an A:G ratio <0.6. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Microcytosis was common and can increase suspicion of FIP in the presence of other typical clinical and laboratory abnormalities. The low prevalence of lymphopenia in cats without effusion suggests that this is not a useful parameter in non-effusive FIP. The frequent occurrence of a left shift in the absence of a mature neutrophilia complicates the differentiation of effusive FIP and septic peritonitis. Globulins and A:G ratio were of higher diagnostic value than hyperproteinaemia.","Riemer, Friederike; Kuehner, Kirsten A; Ritz, Susanne; Sauter-Louis, Carola; Hartmann, Katrin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,40,30

While the role of MerTK in cardioprotection is well-characterized, the unique role of the other structurally similar TAMs, and particularly AXL, in clinically-relevant models of myocardial ischemia-reperfused infarction (IRI) is comparatively unknown. Utilizing complementary approaches, validated by flow cytometric analysis of human and murine macrophage subsets and conditional genetic loss and gain of function, we uncover a unique maladaptive role for myeloid AXL during IRI in the heart. Cross signaling between AXL and TLR4 in cardiac macrophages directed a switch to glycolytic metabolism and secretion of proinflammatory IL-1β, leading to increased intramyocardial inflammation, adverse ventricular remodeling, and impaired contractile function. AXL interestingly functioned independently of cardioprotective MerTK to reduce the efficacy of cardiac repair, but like MerTK, was proteolytically cleaved. Administration of a selective small molecule AXL inhibitor alone improved cardiac healing, which was further enhanced in combination with blockade of MerTK cleavage. These data support further exploration of macrophage TAM receptors as therapeutic targets for myocardial infarction.","DeBerge, Matthew; Glinton, Kristofor; Subramanian, Manikandan; Wilsbacher, Lisa D; Rothlin, Carla V; Tabas, Ira; Thorp, Edward B",The Journal of clinical investigation,40,1

OBJECTIVE The aim of this work was to define reference ranges and centile charts for a regional cerebral tissue oxygenation index (cTOI), measured with the NIRO 200NX (NIRO, Hamamatsu, Japan), and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) during the first 15 min after birth in preterm and term neonates without any medical support. METHODS cTOI was measured with the NIRO 200NX during the first 15 min after delivery via Caesarean section in preterm and term infants. The NIRS-sensor was placed on the right forehead. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate were continuously measured by pulse oximetry. cFTOE was calculated out of cTOI and SpO2. Neonates with a requirement for any medical support were excluded. RESULTS A total of 230 neonates were enrolled, from which 90 had to be excluded. Therefore, 140 term neonates were included and data were used to define reference ranges and centile charts. The 50th centile (10th to 90th centiles) of cTOI was 56% (39-75) at 2 min, 66% (50-78) at 5 min, 75% (62-85) at 10 min and 73% (61-84) at 15 min after birth. The 50th centile of cFTOE was 0.24 (0.11-0.44) at 2 min, 0.20 (0.10-0.35) at 5 min, 0.21 (0.09-0.35) at 10 min and 0.24 (0.13-0.37) at 15 min after birth. CONCLUSION The present observational study adds the reference ranges and centile charts of cTOI measured with the NIRO 200NX and cFTOE calculated out of cTOI and SpO2 in neonates during the immediate neonatal transition. Centiles for each instrument will be necessary for future clinical application, since the differences between cTOI and cerebral regional tissue oxygen saturation measured with INVOS 5100C change with increasing regional oxygenation.","Baik, Nariae; Urlesberger, Berndt; Schwaberger, Bernhard; Schmölzer, Georg M; Mileder, Lukas; Avian, Alexander; Pichler, Gerhard",Neonatology,40,17

METHODS We invited the participants from Hubei and Henan Provinces of China for an internetbased survey starting from 12:00 on February 21, 2020 to 12:00 on February 23. The survey included the general conditions, KAP of COVID-19, psychological status and living conditions of the residents. RESULTS The effective response rate of the questionnaire was 98.9%. The mean (P25, P75) age of the participants was 19 (16, 40) years, and 54.3% of them were students. Social media were the most important source of information concerning the pandemic of the respondents. The respondents had a high awareness of person-to-person transmission of the virus through the respiratory tract or droplets but showed a relatively low level of awareness of the population susceptible to COVID-19 and its specific symptoms. The results of multivariate analysis showed that women, undergraduate students (including college students) and higher degree holders had better knowledge of COVID-19 (P < 0.05); the proportion of respondents who expressed to have different levels of psychological stressed such as worry, anxiety and panic reached 77.2%; 16.7% of the responders considered psychological interventions necessary for their psychological conditions; 63.6% of the respondents confessed a bias against the people returning from Hubei and Henan provinces, while 22.4% worried that they might be biased because of their residence in Hubei and Henan. The rate of personal protective equipment shortage was as high as 69.4%; the rates of the responders who would ""covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing"", ""properly use masks in accordance with regulations"", ""maintain proper hand hygiene "", ""avoid gatherings with relatives and friends"" and ""refrain from going to public places"" were 92.4%, 95.9%, 93.5%, 88.8% and 93.1%, respectively.

Inertial sensors facilitate in performing quantitative motion analysis and by estimating body symmetry more accurately assess coordination lesion and imbalance. OBJECTIVES To assess the body symmetry of upper and lower limbs quantitatively, and to find the best body symmetry indices to discriminate MS from healthy individuals (CO). METHODS 28 MS patients and 23 CO participated in the study. Spatiotemporal parameters obtained from six Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) were placed on the upper and lower extremities during FNT and HST tests. All data were analyzed using statistical methods in MATLAB. RESULTS Asymmetry indices of temporal parameters showed a significant increase in upper body and lower body asymmetry of MS compared to CO. However, CO have a greater kinematic asymmetry compared to MS. CONCLUSION Temporal parameters are the most sensitive to body asymmetry evaluation. However, range of motion is completely inappropriate if it is calculated for one movement cycle.","Daunoraviciene, Kristina; Ziziene, Jurgita; Ovcinikova, Agne; Kizlaitiene, Rasa; Griskevicius, Julius",Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine,40,1

The purpose of this study is to report results over the past 9 years of testing in order to identify trends over time and evaluate the need to update scoring practices. This is a quality initiative of the SAGES FLS committee. METHODS A representative sample of FLS exam data from 2008 to 2016 was analyzed. The de-identified data included demographics and scores for the cognitive and manual tests. Standard descriptive statistics were used to compare trends over the years, training levels, and to assess the pass/fail rate. RESULTS A total of 7232 FLS tests were analyzed [64% male, 6.4% junior (postgraduate year-PGY1-2), 84% senior (PGY3-5), 2.8% fellows (PGY6), and 6.7% attending surgeons (PGY7)]. Specialties included 93% general surgery (GS), 6.2% gynecology, and 0.9% urology. The Pearson correlation between cognitive and manual scores was 0.09. For the cognitive exam, there was an increase in scores over the years, and the most junior residents scored the lowest. For the manual skills, there were marginal differences in scores over the years, and junior residents scored the highest. The odds ratio of PGY3+ passing was 1.8 (CI 1.2-2.8) times higher than that of a PGY1-2. The internal consistency between tasks on the manual skills exam was 0.73. If any one of the tasks was removed, the Cronbach's alpha dropped to between 0.65 and 0.71, depending on the task being removed. CONCLUSION The cognitive and manual components of FLS test different aspects of laparoscopy and demonstrate evidence for reliability and validity. More experienced trainees have a higher likelihood of passing the exam and tend to perform better on the cognitive skills. Each component of the manual skills contributes to the exam and should continue to be part of the test.","Bilgic, Elif; Kaneva, Pepa; Okrainec, Allan; Ritter, E Matthew; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical endoscopy,40,1

It can cause serious infections in humans that may result in encephalitis/meningoencephalitis. Although several studies have described the involvement of specific genes in the host response to TBEV infection in the central nervous system (CNS), the overall network remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated the response of DAOY cells (human medulloblastoma cells derived from cerebellar neurons) to TBEV (Neudoerfl strain, Western subtype) infection to characterize differentially expressed genes by transcriptome analysis. Our results revealed a wide panel of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including type III but not type I (or II) interferons (IFNs), which are activated upon TBEV infection, as well as a number of non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs. To obtain a broader view of the pathways responsible for eliciting an antiviral state in DAOY cells we examined the effect of type I and III IFNs and found that only type I IFN pre-treatment inhibited TBEV production. The cellular response to TBEV showed only partial overlap with gene expression changes induced by IFN-β treatment - suggesting a virus-specific signature - and we identified a group of ISGs that were highly up-regulated following IFN-β treatment. Moreover, a high rate of down-regulation was observed for a wide panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon IFN-β treatment. These data can serve as the basis for further studies of host-TBEV interactions and the identification of ISGs and/or lncRNAs with potent antiviral effects in cases of TBEV infection in human neuronal cells.","Selinger, Martin; Wilkie, Gavin S; Tong, Lily; Gu, Quan; Schnettler, Esther; Grubhoffer, Libor; Kohl, Alain",The Journal of general virology,40,28

The larvae of the housefly (Musca domestica) have been used to study immune-induced molecules because they can survive in pathogenic environments. OBJECTIVE The antiviral activity of a protein-enriched fraction (PEF) from the larvae of the housefly was evaluated in vitro and the possible antiviral mechanism was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS PEF was isolated from the larvae of the housefly. The cytotoxicity of PEF was detected by the MTT assay. The in vitro antiviral activity of PEF against influenza virus was investigated. PEF was incubated with the virus and its target cells under various conditions, and its antiviral effects were examined by reduction in virus yield in cell cultures. Experiments with ribavirin were performed in parallel under the same conditions. RESULTS The results indicated that PEF had minimal cytotoxicity against MDCK cells and the CC₅₀ value was calculated to be 284.45 μg/ml. The antiviral results showed the loss of infectious capacity was more than two log (2) units in cell cultures compared with virus control. The effect of PEF was direct virucidal activity and the interference on the adsorption of cell and virus. The antiviral mechanism of PEF is different from ribavirin. CONCLUSION The results indicate that PEF showed strong antiviral activity against influenza virus at a very early stage of the interaction with virus particles or their entry into the cells. PEF has a great potential as a resource of healthy products.","Wang, Furong; Ai, Hui; Lei, Chaoliang",Pharmaceutical biology,40,16

The aim of the present study was to compare the inter-reagent agreement of anti-Xa activity. METHODS Citrate tubes were obtained from 104 inpatients on UFH. Plasma samples were stored frozen in aliquots at -70°C before being shipped to 3 accredited coagulation laboratories to be evaluated for anti-Xa activity using their routine assay(s). Pooled normal plasmas spiked with dilutions of the 6th International Standard of UFH to achieve anti-Xa activities up to 1.0 IU/mL were evaluated using the same techniques. RESULTS In the plasmas from patients on UFH, the median anti-Xa activity ranged from 0.37 IU/mL with one reagent to 0.57 IU/mL with another; results were in-between (0.45 IU/mL) using two other reagents. Comparisons of results obtained using the different reagents demonstrated unacceptable bias up to 0.24 IU/mL between some reagents (41% difference). The concordance as whether anti-Xa activities measured using different reagents were within or outside the therapeutic range was between 0.411 and 0.939 (kappa). Similar discrepancy was demonstrated for anti-Xa activities when evaluating normal plasma spiked with the International Standard. A discrepancy of the same order of magnitude was demonstrated in the 2017 ECAT EQAP exercises. CONCLUSIONS The reported discrepancy between test results obtained using different anti-Xa assays clearly suggests a lack of standardization of that assay with potentially significant impact on the patients'anticoagulation.","Smahi, Motalib; De Pooter, Neila; Hollestelle, Martine J; Toulon, Pierre",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,40,0

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising strategy to detect pathogens and may serve as an early-warning system for disease outbreaks. Notably, WBE has garnered substantial interest during the COVID-19 pandemic to track disease burden through analyses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been an important tool for understanding the spread of the virus. Unlike traditional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from clinical samples, which adds testing burden to the healthcare system, in this study, metatranscriptomics was used to sequence virus directly from wastewater. Here, we present a study in which we explored RNA viral diversity through sequencing 94 wastewater influent samples across seven treatment plants (WTPs), collected August 2020 - January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California. Enriched viral libraries identified a wide diversity of RNA viruses that differed between WTPs and over time, with detected viruses including coronaviruses, influenza A, and noroviruses. Furthermore, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in wastewater and we measured proportions of overall virus and SNVs across several months. We detected several SNVs that are markers for clinically-important SARS-CoV-2 variants, along with SNVs of unknown function, prevalence, or epidemiological consequence. Our study shows the potential of WBE to detect viruses in wastewater and to track the diversity and spread of viral variants in urban and suburban locations, which may aid public health efforts to monitor disease outbreaks. Importance: Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) can detect pathogens across sewersheds, which represents the collective waste of human populations. As there is a wide diversity of RNA viruses in wastewater, monitoring the presence of these viruses is useful for public health, industry, and ecological studies. Specific to public health, WBE has proven valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 without adding burden to healthcare systems. In this study, we used metatranscriptomics and RT-ddPCR to assay RNA viruses across Southern California wastewater from August 2020 - January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people from Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties. We found that SARS-CoV-2 quantification in wastewater correlates well with county-wide COVID-19 case data, and that we can detect SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide variants through sequencing. Likewise, WTPs harbored different viromes, and we detected other human pathogens such as noroviruses and adenoviruses, furthering our understanding of wastewater viral ecology.","Rothman, J.

The lambda spike protein contains novel mutations within the receptor binding domain (L452Q and F490S) that may contribute to its increased transmissibility and could result in susceptibility to re-infection or a reduction in protection provided by current vaccines. In this study, the infectivity and susceptibility of viruses with the lambda variant spike protein to neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies was tested. Virus with the lambda spike had higher infectivity and was neutralized by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies with a relatively minor 2.3-3.3-fold decrease in titer on average. The virus was neutralized by the Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibody cocktail with no loss of titer. The results suggest that vaccines in current use will remain protective against the lambda variant and that monoclonal antibody therapy will remain effective.","Tada, Takuya; Zhou, Hao; Dcosta, Belinda M.; Samanovic, Marie I.; Mulligan, Mark J.; Landau, Nathaniel R.",bioRxiv,40,1

A recent study used a novel algorithm to construct OLGs from arbitrary protein domain pairs and concluded that virus genes are best suited for creating OLGs, a result which fitted with common assumptions. However, improving sequence evaluation using Hidden Markov Models shows that the previous result is an artifact originating from dataset-database biases. When parameters for OLG design and evaluation are optimized we find that 94.5% of the constructed OLG pairs score at least as highly as naturally occurring sequences, while 9.6% of the artificial OLGs cannot be distinguished from typical sequences in their protein family. Constructed OLG sequences are also indistinguishable from natural sequences in terms of amino acid identity and secondary structure, while the minimum nucleotide change required for overprinting an overlapping sequence can be as low as 1.8% of the sequence. Separate analysis of datasets containing only sequences from either archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes or viruses showed that, surprisingly, virus genes are much less suitable for designing OLGs than bacterial or eukaryotic genes. An important factor influencing OLG design is the structure of the standard genetic code. Success rates in different reading frames strongly correlate with their code-determined respective amino acid constraints. There is a tendency indicating that the structure of the standard genetic code could be optimized in its ability to create OLGs while conserving mutational robustness. The findings reported here add to the growing evidence that OLGs should no longer be excluded in prokaryotic genome annotations. Determining the factors facilitating the computational design of artificial overlapping genes may improve our understanding of the origin of these remarkable genetic constructs and may also open up exciting possibilities for synthetic biology.","Wichmann, Stefan; Scherer, Siegfried; Ardern, Zachary",bioRxiv,40,1

However, our understanding of pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. Bat species centrality to the network of shared hemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rare—but detectable—bacterial sharing between species. Our study highlights the importance of using fine phylogenetic scales when assessing host specificity and suggests phylogenetic similarity may play a key role in host shifts for not only viruses but also bacteria.

Overall, 161,537 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered LFIA tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 between 27 October and 10 November 2020. Results: The overall adjusted and weighted prevalence was 5.6% (95% CI 5.4-5.7). This was an increase from 4.4% (4.3-4.5) in round 3 (September), a relative increase of 26.9% (24.0-29.9).The largest increase by age was in the 18 to 24 year old age group, which increased (adjusted and weighted) from 6.7% (6.3-7.2) to 9.9% (9.3-10.4), and in students, (adjusted, unweighted) from 5.9% (4.8-7.1) to 12.1% (10.8-13.5). Prevalence increased most in Yorkshire and The Humber, from 3.4% (3.0-3.8) to 6.3% (5.9-6.8) and the North West from 4.5% (4.2-4.9) to 7.7% (7.2-8.1).

Tauopathies are characterized by the deposition of insoluble aggregated tau in neurons and, occasionally, glial cells. Tauopathies are classified as either primary, in which tau is thought to be the driver of disease, or secondary, in which tau aggregation is downstream of another insult. SARS-CoV-2 might cross the blood- brain barrier and directly infect neurons or the surrounding vasculature, as shown in non-human primates. Once inside cells, SARS-CoV-2 can directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce tau mislocalisation4 in human cells in vitro. A second possible mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 could affect the CNS is through inducing a widespread systemic inflammatory response. Accumulated exposures to pathogens that contribute to neuroinflammation might increase the risk of developing a tauopathy. Only 0.01-0.1% of measles infections lead to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. If a COVID-19-induced tauopathy develops at a similar rate, there could be 10 000-100 000 cases for every 100 million people infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the proportion of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have substantial neuroinflammation, and who are therefore potentially at a higher risk of developing secondary tauopathy, is unknown. It is also important to note that no direct causal link between COVID-19 and neurological or psychiatric sequelae has been found, and some complications-including anxiety disorders-might be due to the stress and trauma associated with social factors and treatment options.

Chronic patients were more susceptible to the psychological and healthy impact in the pandemic. This observational, exploratory, multicenter study aims to evaluate the oncology patient's perception about the psychosocial impact of cancer treatment in the scenario of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected from cancer patients who voluntarily answered two self-applied questionnaires. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) were also used to assess the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms. High score was defined by cutoff &gt; 8. Clinical characteristics and patients perception were reported as frequencies. Chi Square test was used to compare risk of anxiety/depression through HADS and categorical variables, including gender, type of cancer treatment and psychosocial aspects. Odds-Ratio was calculated using logistic regression. Results: 122 patients were included, 86% were receiving chemotherapy, 53.3% with palliative intention. Mean age was 54.8, and 59% were female. Most patients attended the hospital for cancer treatment every 14 days (44.2%). Regarding social isolation, 47.5% only left home when necessary;62.3% of respondents reported not being afraid of being infected by the virus when going to the hospital for treatment. This fact can be understood as 100% of the patients reported that the protocol changes adopted by the hospital in the pandemic were positive and beneficial. A total of 77.8% noticed changes during the pandemic, mainly related to reduced physical activity (53.4%), loss of family (62.2%) or social (54,9%) contact. According to HADS, anxiety and depression symptoms were reported in 17% and 15,5% respectively. Female patients scored higher on HADS-A (OR 4,091 (CI95% 1,114-15,021)). No difference was observed in HADS independently of line of chemotherapy or type of treatment. HADS score was not higher in inpatients. 52,4% of patients were more afraid of cancer than COVID infection. Patients who answered that the fear of cancer was higher than the fear of COVID-19 infection scored higher at HADS-D (OR 4,712 (CI95% 1,77-15,028)). Conclusions: Patients were more afraid of cancer than COVID-19 infection. Female patients had a higher anxiety score and more depression was observed in patients who were more afraid of cancer. This study indicates that, in a patientAs psychological view, the maintenance of treatment and consultations frequency during oncological care may be as important as restrictive strategies used to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection.","Armentano, D.

Therefore, understanding the dynamics of transmission is very important. In this paper, the COVID-19 mathematical model has been formulated, analyzed, and validated using incident data from West Java Province, Indonesia. The model made considers the asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments and decreased immunity. The model is formulated in the form of a system of differential equations, where the population is divided into seven compartments, namely Susceptible Population ( S 0 ) , Exposed Population ( E ) , Asymptomatic Infection Population ( I A ) , Symptomatic Infection Population ( Y S ) , Recovered Population ( Z ) , Susceptible Populations previously infected ( Z 0 ) , and Quarantine population ( Q ) . The results show that there has been an outbreak of COVID-19 in West Java Province, Indonesia. This can be seen from the basic reproduction number of this model, which is 3.180126127 ( R 0 > 1 ) . Also, the numerical simulation results show that waning immunity can increase the occurrence of outbreaks; and a period of isolation can slow down the process of spreading COVID-19. So if a strict social distancing policy is enforced like a quarantine, the outbreak will lessen.","Anggriani, Nursanti; Ndii, Meksianis Z.; Amelia, Rika; Suryaningrat, Wahyu; Aji Pratama, Mochammad Andhika",,40,21

For arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, base excess (BE) approach enables limited evaluation of the etiological factors. The Stewart’s physicochemical approach, on the other hand, may not reveal etiological agents adequately. In this study, we aimed to compare BE approach versus physicochemical method for the evaluation of metabolic acid-base disturbances in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Method: Between March 2020 and May 2020, ABG analysis results of a total of 113 patients (71 males, 42 females) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized in the adult intensive care units were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into groups according to the BE approach and evaluated for physicochemical components. The ABG and some electrolyte values were compared among groups. Results: The most common acidotic components according to the Stewart’s method were hyperphosphatemia (84.9%), but low strong ion difference (SID) acidosis (62.2%) in patients with metabolic acidosis according to the BE approach. Low SID acidosis (50%) and hyperphosphatemia (30.9%) in patients with normal BE and hyperphosphatemia (77.7%) in patients with metabolic alkalosis according to the BE approach were observed. In patients with metabolic acidosis according to BE approach, 71.6% of the patients had hypoalbuminemia and 24.5% of the cases had high SID alkalosis among the Stewart’s alkalosis components. Strong ion gap (SIG) acidosis was seen in 11.1% and low SID acidosis was seen in 11.1% in patients with metabolic acidosis according to the BE approach. Conclusion: Physiochemical approach seems to provide additional information regarding the etiological factors and unravel the invisible part of the iceberg for the evaluation of metabolic acid-base disturbances in critically ill patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Şenkal, S.; Kara, U.; Özdemirkan, amp; Iacute,; Şimşek, F.; Eksert, S.; Daşdan, N.; Yamanyar, S.; Uyar, E.; Savaşçı, amp; Uuml,; Taşkın, G.; Doğan, D.; Coşar, A.",Anestezi Dergisi,40,9

We set out to investigate the association between NCDs and the risk of death from any infection in the pre-COVID-19 era. Design: Prospective population-based study Setting: UK Biobank Participants: 493,295 participants Main outcome measures: Infection death prior to December 31st 2019. Results: During 5,277,344 participant-years of follow-up, 1,385 infection deaths occurred, accounting for 5% of all deaths. Competing risks regression revealed that advancing age, male sex, smoking, socio-economic deprivation and all studied NCDs were independently associated with both the risk of infection death and non-infection death; ethnicity was associated with neither. Only smoking, socio-economic deprivation, hypertension, respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, psychiatric disease and rheumatological disease were associated with greater hazard ratios for infection than non-infection death. Accrual of multimorbidity was also associated with a greater increases in the risk of infection death (HR 9.03 [95% confidence interval 6.61 to 12.34] for 5+ comorbidities versus none; p<0.001), than non-infection death (HR 5.68 [95% confidence interval 5.22 to 6.17] for 5+ comorbidities versus none; p<0.001). Conclusions: Diverse NCDs are associated with increased risk of infection death, suggesting that recently reported associations with COVID-19 death may be non-specific. Moreover, only a subset of NCDs, together with the accrual of multimorbidity, smoking and socio-economic deprivation, are associated with greater relative risks of infection death than other causes of death. Further research is needed to define why these risk factors are biased toward infection death so that more effective preventative strategies can be targeted to high-risk groups.","Drozd, M.; Lillie, P.; Pujades-Rodriguez, M.; Straw, S.; Morgan, A.

Our goals with the project are three-fold. First, we provide an overarching narrative about life in western New York during the 19th century through the telling of five digitally-rendered characters whose stories are recounted in short-form vignettes shared with audiences. Second, we endeavor to develop “thinking dispositions” that encourage visitors to gauge and construct the significance of historical narratives that have the capacity to motivate reflection upon these stories on a personal, local, and global level. Third, we create a tripartite deployment that offers a common experience and supports a variety of delivery methods that respond directly to the health safety concerns raised by COVID-19. In sum, our project offers first-person accounts of the past mediated via XR, a blending of past and present to enhance the visitor experience. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Decker, J.; Doherty, A.; Geigel, J.; Jacobs, G.

The findings indicated significant improvements in the reading comprehension of the Saudi learners participating this study, as reflected in the students' effective use of the different IRT strategies and the significant results of the post-test. However, despite the proved effectiveness of IRT in strengthening reading comprehension, some challenges were voiced by the participants. These include computer competency, familiarity with online courses and, most notably, their linguistic difficulties with English, which justified their resorting to their native language (Arabic) as one way of demonstrating their comprehension.

In this paper, we study the collective counts of palindromes in the SARS genome along with all the completely sequenced coronaviruses. Based on a Markov-chain model for the genome sequence, the mean and standard deviation for the number of palindromes at or above a given length are derived. These theoretical results are complemented by extensive simulations to provide empirical estimates. Using a z score obtained from these mathematical and empirical means and standard deviations, we have observed that palindromes of length four are significantly underrepresented in all the coronaviruses in our data set. In contrast, length-six palindromes are significantly underrepresented only in the SARS coronavirus. Two other features are unique to the SARS sequence. First, there is a length-22 palindrome TCTTTAACAAGCTTGTTAAAGA spanning positions 25962-25983.

PATIENTS Seventeen patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia (10 males and 7 females; mean age, 39 years [age range, 11-71 years]). Sixteen patients had common variable immunodeficiency, and 1 patient had X-linked agammaglobulinemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Magnetic resonance imaging and x-ray imaging of paranasal sinuses when patients did not have signs of acute infection and reevaluation 6 months later. Maxillary sinus aspiration and lavage were performed at a follow-up visit. Sinus fluid analysis for bacteria and viruses was performed by culture and by polymerase chain reaction. A questionnaire on symptoms related to sinusitis was administered during the follow-up period. RESULTS Among 17 patients, 9 (53%) had radiologically defined sinusitis without subjective symptoms at study enrollment. At reevaluation 6 months later, radiological findings remained unchanged in two thirds of the patients. Among 15 patients, bacteria were found in sinus lavage samples from 13 patients, and viruses were found in samples from 7 patients. Eight patients had 2 pathogens or more on bacterial culture. Rhinovirus was identified from sinus lavage samples in 5 patients (33%), enterovirus in 3 patients (20%), and respiratory syncytial virus in 1 patient (7%).

In the 20th century, collaborative efforts between medicine and veterinary medicine diminished considerably. While there have been some notable exceptions, such as Calvin W. Schwabe's proposal for unifying human and veterinary medicine and joint efforts by the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization to control zoonotic diseases, 'one medicine' has languished in the modern milieu of clinical care, public health, and biomedical research. Risks of zoonotic disease transmission are rarely discussed in clinical care which is of particular concern if humans and/or animals are immunosuppressed. Physicians and veterinarians should advise their patients and pet-owning clients that some animals should not be pets. The risk of zoonotic disease acquisition can be considerable in the occupational setting. Collaborative efforts in biomedical research could do much to improve human and animal health.

Radiological imaging plays a prominent role in the evaluation and treatment of patients with pneumonia. This paper reviews recent innovations in the radiologic diagnosis and management of suspected pulmonary infections. RECENT FINDINGS Chest radiography is the most commonly used imaging tool in pneumonias because of availability and an excellent cost-benefit ratio. Computed tomography is mandatory in unresolved cases or when complications of pneumonia are suspected. A specific radiologic pattern can suggest a diagnosis in many cases. Bacterial pneumonias are classified into four main groups: community-acquired, aspiration, healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The radiographic patterns of community-acquired pneumonia may be variable and are often related to the causative agent. Aspiration pneumonia involves the lower lobes with bilateral multicentric opacities. The radiographic patterns of healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired pneumonia are variable, most commonly showing diffuse multifocal involvement and pleural effusion. SUMMARY Combination of pattern recognition with knowledge of the clinical setting is the best approach to the radiologic interpretation of pneumonia. Radiological imaging will narrow the differential diagnosis of direct additional diagnostic measures and serve as an ideal tool for follow-up examinations.","Sharma, Sat; Maycher, Bruce; Eschun, Gregg",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,40,28

In the 2003 outbreak, it infected more than 8,000 people worldwide and claimed the lives of more than 900 victims. The high mortality rate resulted, at least in part, from the absence of definitive treatment protocols or therapeutic agents. Although the virus spreading has been contained, due preparedness and planning, including the successful development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV, is necessary for possible reappearance of SARS. In this review, we have discussed currently available strategies for antiviral drug discovery and how these technologies have been utilized to identify potential antiviral agents for the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. Moreover, progress in the drug development based on different molecular targets is also summarized, including 1) Compounds that block the S protein-ACE2-mediated viral entry; 2) Compounds targeting SARS-CoV M(pro); 3) Compounds targeting papain-like protease 2 (PLP2); 4) Compounds targeting SARS-CoV RdRp; 5) Compounds targeting SARS-CoV helicase; 6) Active compounds with unspecified targets; and 7) Research on siRNA.

This mode of infection is a property of wild-type (wt) JHMV cl-2 virus but is not seen in cultures infected with the mutant virus JHMV srr7. In this study, we show that soluble MHVR (soMHVR) potentiates MHVR-independent fusion in JHMV srr7-infected cultures. Thus, in the presence of soMHVR, JHMV srr7-infected DBT cells overlaid onto BHK cells induce BHK cell syncytia and the spread of JHMV srr7 infection. This does not occur in the absence of soMHVR. soMHVR also enhanced wt virus MHVR-independent fusion. These effects were dependent on the concentration of soMHVR in the culture and were specifically blocked by the anti-MHVR monoclonal antibody CC1. Together with these observations, direct binding of soMHVR to the virus spike (S) glycoprotein as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that the effect is mediated by the binding of soMHVR to the S protein. Furthermore, fusion of BHK cells expressing the JHMV srr7 S protein was also induced by soMHVR. These results indicated that the binding of soMHVR to the S protein expressed on the DBT cell surface potentiates the fusion of MHV-infected DBT cells with nonpermissive BHK cells. We conclude that the binding of soMHVR to the S protein converts the S protein to a fusion-active form competent to mediate cell-cell fusion, in a fashion similar to the fusion of virus and cell membranes.","Taguchi, Fumihiro; Matsuyama, Shutoku",Journal of virology,40,28

Current recommendations advocate narcotic-limiting multimodal analgesia regimens. The objective of this review is to determine if in patients with renal colic (Population), intravenous (IV) amide anesthetics (Intervention) result in better pain control, lower requirements for rescue analgesia, or less adverse medication effects (outcome) compared to placebo, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or opiates (Comparisons). Methods Scholarly databases and relevant bibliographies were searched using a pre-designed systematic review protocol and registered with PROSPERO. Inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized clinical trial (RCT), (2) age ≥ 18 years, (3) confirmed or presumed renal colic, (4) amide anesthetic administered IV. Eligible comparison groups included: placebo, conventional therapy, acetaminophen, NSAID, or opiate. The primary outcome was pain intensity at baseline, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Trial quality was graded, and risk-of-bias was assessed. Results Of the 3930 identified references, 4 RCTs (479 participants) were included. One trial (n=240) reported improved analgesia with IV lidocaine (LidoIV) plus metoclopramide, compared to morphine. All other trials reported unchanged or less analgesia compared to placebo, ketorolac, or fentanyl. Very severe heterogeneity (I2= 88%) precluded pooling data. Conclusion Current evidence precludes drawing a firm conclusion on the efficacy or superiority of LidoIV over traditional therapies for ED patients with renal colic. Evidence suggests LidoIV may be an effective non-opiate analgesic alliterative; however, it's efficacy may not exceed that of NSAIDs or opiates. Further study is needed to validate the potential improved efficacy of LidoIV plus metoclopramide.","C Miller, Andrew C; Faza, Colton; Castro Bigalli, Alberto A; M Khan, Abbas; A Sewell, Kerry; King, Alexandra; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Zehtabchi, Shahriar",Archives of academic emergency medicine,40,11

METHODS Fourteen teenaged patients underwent planned tonsillectomy. Intraoral digital photographs were collected at the time of tonsillectomy, during the management of complications, and at postoperative office visits. Serial intraoral photographs of one patient were taken at 48-hour intervals from the time of surgery until postoperative day 17. RESULTS Intraoral photographs from the days after tonsillectomy revealed a pattern of inflammation and healing that closely paralleled that in human skin and in canine and porcine oral wound models. CONCLUSIONS Edema and pain are greatest immediately after surgery, probably as a result of thermal effects and expression of inflammatory mediators that stimulate pharyngeal nociceptors. Pain gradually decreases over time, with an increase in analog pain measures on postoperative days 3 to 5 corresponding to the maximal wound inflammation documented in experimental models. Epithelial ingrowth beneath a fibrin clot begins shortly after wounding. Separation of the fibrin clot about 7 days after surgery exposes vascular stroma. Involution of the vascular stroma and completion of epithelial coverage correlate with decreased pain levels and a lessened risk of bleeding.","Isaacson, Glenn","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",40,5

Here, we have investigated the effect of an acute viral infection on the cellular composition and bacterial protection in Mycobacterium bovis strain bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-induced granulomas using an immunocompetent and a partially immunodeficient murine model. Acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) coinfection of C57BL/6 mice led to substantial accumulation of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing LCMV-specific T cells in liver granulomas and increased local IFN-gamma. Despite traffic of activated T cells that resulted in a CD8 T-cell-dominated granuloma, the BCG liver organ load was unaltered from control levels. In OT-1 T-cell-receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, ovalbumin (OVA) immunization or LCMV coinfection of BCG-infected mice induced CD8 T-cell-dominated granulomas containing large numbers of non-BCG-specific activated T cells. The higher baseline BCG organ load in this CD8 TCR transgenic animal allowed us to demonstrate that OVA immunization and LCMV coinfection increased anti-BCG protection. The bacterial load remained substantially higher than in mice with a more complete TCR repertoire. Overall, the present study suggests that peripherally activated CD8 T cells can be recruited to chronic inflammatory sites, but their contribution to protective immunity is limited to conditions of underlying immunodeficiency.","Hogan, Laura H; Co, Dominic O; Karman, Jozsef; Heninger, Erika; Suresh, M; Sandor, Matyas",Infection and immunity,40,16

Using this system, we studied how two intergenic regions in close proximity affected subgenomic RNA synthesis. When two intergenic regions were separated by more than 100 nucleotides, slightly less of the larger subgenomic DI RNA (synthesized from the upstream intergenic region) was made; this difference was significant when the intergenic region separation was less than about 35 nucleotides. Deletion of sequences flanking the two intergenic regions inserted in close proximity did not affect transcription. No significant change in the ratio of the two subgenomic DI RNAs was observed when the sequence between the two intergenic regions was altered. Removal of the downstream intergenic region restored transcription of the larger subgenomic DI RNA. The UCUAAAC consensus sequence was needed for efficient suppression of the larger subgenomic DI RNA synthesis. These results demonstrated that the downstream intergenic sequence was suppressing subgenomic DI RNA synthesis from the upstream intergenic region. We discuss possible mechanisms to account for the regulation of this suppression of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis and the ways in which they relate to the general regulation of coronavirus transcription.","Joo, M; Makino, S",Journal of virology,40,24

Contaminants that derive from earlier work using a given primer pair (carryover PCR products) are of particular concern when those primers are used routinely, as in clinical diagnostics or environmental monitoring. In addition, contamination by genomic DNA can significantly interfere with quantitative and qualitative analysis of RNAs by RT-PCR. Here we describe contaminant restriction (ConR), a method that can be used to neutralize carryover and genomic DNA contamination in RT-PCR studies. Restriction enzymes (REs) added to the amplification cocktail cleave contaminant DNA molecules while sparing the intended target nucleic acid. Restriction, reverse transcription, and amplification steps all take place in the same sealed vessel, thus avoiding any danger of recontamination. ConR eliminates carryover contamination in PCR without compromising target sequence amplification. Because the method is effective against both genomic and carryover contamination, it can be employed routinely in one-step RT-PCR, whatever the RNA target or the nature of the potential DNA contaminant. A variation of this decontamination method, amplicon primer site restriction (APSR), is effective specifically against carryover contamination. APSR, unlike ConR, can be applied during PCR-based amplification of DNA target molecules.","Ashkenas, John; Dennis, James W; Ho, Chi Yip",BioTechniques,40,9

These errors are particularly worthy of attention because they are not likely to be detected by computerized physician order entry systems. METHODS We prospectively studied patients reporting the use of at least 4 regular prescription medications who were admitted to general internal medicine clinical teaching units. The primary outcome was unintended discrepancies (errors) between the physicians' admission medication orders and a comprehensive medication history obtained through interview. We also evaluated the potential seriousness of these discrepancies. All discrepancies were reviewed with the medical team to determine if they were intentional or unintentional. All unintended discrepancies were rated for their potential to cause patient harm. RESULTS After screening 523 admissions, 151 patients were enrolled based on the inclusion criteria. Eighty-one patients (53.6%; 95% confidence interval, 45.7%-61.6%) had at least 1 unintended discrepancy. The most common error (46.4%) was omission of a regularly used medication. Most (61.4%) of the discrepancies were judged to have no potential to cause serious harm. However, 38.6% of the discrepancies had the potential to cause moderate to severe discomfort or clinical deterioration.

Microarray analysis was applied to assess changes in cellular expression profiles during different stages of two independent, highly controlled murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infections in vitro. Fibroblast-like L cells were infected at high multiplicity in order to study the direct effects of a synchronized lytic coronavirus infection. Total RNA was harvested from MHV- or mock-infected L cells at 3, 5 and 6 h post-infection and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays representing approximately 12,500 murine genes and expressed sequences. The expression data were compared to their respective mock-infected controls. Quantitative RT-PCR of selected transcripts was used to validate the differential expression of transcripts and inter-experiment reproducibility of microarray analysis. It was concluded that MHV-A59 infection in fibroblast-like cells triggers very few transcriptional cellular responses in the first 3 h of infection. Later, after having established a productive infection, a chemokine response is induced together with other cellular changes associated with RNA and protein metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis. Interferon responses are not triggered during infection, although the L cells can be readily stimulated to produce interferon by dsRNA, a known potent inducer of interferon. Possibly, the interferon response is actively counteracted by a virus-encoded antagonist as has been described previously for other RNA viruses.","Versteeg, Gijs A; Slobodskaya, Olga; Spaan, Willy J M",The Journal of general virology,40,23

One of our challenge is the detection of the behavior, respiration and heartbeat of the occupants by analyzing these radar signals without using a camera which is difficult to install in the field due to privacy protection issues, and without the subject wearing a wearable sensor directly. If it is detected that the patient or resident has gone out, the situation of the resident's walking area around the facility can be detected by using the Wi-SUN FAN mesh network in the area around the facility with a radius of about 500 m. In addition, in the suburbs area, GPS information using a LoRaWAN small terminal will enable centralized management of location information of residents without smartphones. As described above, in this study, we propose the Hybrid Wireless Sensor Network platform for medical and nursing care sites by utilizing 24 GHz radar sensing technology and hybrid wireless sensor network technology. We will report the results of a demonstration experiment of this system in an actual nursing facility.","Tsuge, A.; Nuno, F.; Yamaguchi, K.; Furuya, Y.; Iguchi, A.; Matsue, H.; Ieee,",2020 23rd International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications,40,16

Despite its utility and increasing demands resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic, some clinicians and clients continue to report apprehension to adopting telepractice service delivery model due to discomfort with technology. Among currently available telepractice platforms, ""ZOOM"" is one of the popular platforms among speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the United States because of its usability and subscription cost. However, many challenges have been experienced by clinicians and clients when ZOOM is used. The purpose of this article was twofold. The first goal of this article was to address barriers and challenges to implement successful telepractice SLP services. The second goal of this article was to develop four step-bystep troubleshooting manuals (one for client and one for clinician in both English and Spanish) to enhance its utility for users.

We find that: 1) intercity travel restriction has minimal or even negative effect compared to the other two at the national level; 2) the time of reaching turning point is independent of the current number of cases, and only related to the enforcement stringency of epidemiological control and social interaction control measures; 3) strong enforcement at the early stage is the only opportunity to maximize both antiepidemic effectiveness and cost-effectiveness; 4) mediocre stringency of social interaction measures is the worst choice. Subsequently, we cluster countries/regions into four groups based on their control measures and provide situation assessment and policy suggestions for each group.","Xu, Liyan; Zhang, Hongmou; Deng, Yuqiao; Wang, Keli; Li, Fu; Lu, Qing; Yin, Jie; Di, Qian; Liu, Tao; Yin, Hang; Zhang, Zijiao; Du, Qingyang; Yu, Hongbin; Liu, Aihan; Jiang, Hezhishi; Guo, Jing; Yuan, Xiumei; Zhang, Yun; Liu, Liu; Liu, Yu",,40,23

However, the range of analytical procedures available to evaluate these profiles remains limited and are typically based on transesterification of the triglyceride fatty acid residues to methyl esters, followed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography (GC) coupled with flame ionization or mass spectrometry detection. Although robust and long-proven, these analytical methods tend to entail long chromatographic runs and are relatively insensitive. In order to expand the range of available techniques for the analysis of the fatty acid profile of triglycerides in vegetable oils, we report herein a novel method based upon a rapid and straightforward transesterification of the triglycerides with dimethylaminoethanol under alkaline conditions, followed by a ""dilute-and-shoot"" analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The chromatographic analysis is accomplished in 1.5 min, affording a high throughput of samples compared to techniques based upon GC approaches. The method performance was assessed intra- and inter-day with 10 representative saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ranging from C8 to C18 and afforded fatty acid profile accuracies of 93-108% and imprecisions of only 0.3-2.0%. The limit of quantification of the method, estimated as the minimum amount of derivatized oil sample capable of affording less than 20% accuracy and precision error was determined to be approximately 0.5 pg on-column, making this new method potentially valuable for fields where high sensitivity, precision, and accuracy may be required, such as in toxicology studies, forensics, archeology, or art analysis.","Nagumalli, Suresh K; Jacob, Cristina C; Gamboa da Costa, Gonçalo",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,40,2

Forty-one youths, aged 7-18 years, were randomly assigned to receive either ICBIT (n = 25) or a wait-list (WL) condition (n = 16) in a crossover design. ICBIT was feasible to implement and at post-treatment, 64% of the participants have improved significantly. Results demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in tic severity and improved youth global impairment and functioning. Gains were maintained over a 6-month follow-up period. The effect size for the primary outcome measure (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale) ranged between large effect size (Cohen""s d = 0.91) at post-intervention to very large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.25) 6 months after the end of the acute intervention. These were comparable to face-to-face delivery treatment trials for TD. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable and satisfactory. Youth receiving ICBIT experienced improvement in self-esteem and comorbidity. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ICBIT program enabled the delivery of the intervention consecutively without interruption. The results observed provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of this innovative modality to assist youth with TD and remove various barriers to treatment, including those during a public crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, various brownfields or degraded lands along public transport routes, e.g., tram lanes, are effectively transformed for this purpose. The significant potential of tram systems is that they can became a backbone of green corridors across the city. This case study of the Warsaw tram system (total length over 300 km of single tracks in service in 2019) enables us to simulate the potential growth of a biologically active area connected with an increasing share of greenery around tram lanes in Warsaw. Experience allows the authors to present the types of greenery systems based on existing and future tram corridors best suited for this city. The suggested usage of tram lanes as green corridors is in line with the generally-accepted concept of urban green infrastructure. Therefore, the aim of the authors is to present in a condensed fashion their views on a very important issue within the program of the revitalization of the Warsaw landscape by converting where possible the existing tram lines, as well as planning new ones according to the “green point of view”.","Łukaszkiewicz, Jan Fortuna-Antoszkiewicz Beata Oleszczuk Łukasz Fialová Jitka",Land,40,16

This included restricted testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, and enforcement of a nation-wide lockdown starting 25 March 2020. The objectives of this study were to i) describe the age,gender distribution and mortality among COVID-19 patients identified till 14 April 2020 and predict the range of contact rate; and ii) predict the number of active COVID-19 patients after 40 days of lockdown. Methods: We used a cross-sectional descriptive design for first objective and a susceptible-infected-removed model for in silico predictions. We collected data from government-controlled and crowdsourced websites. Results: Studying age and gender parameters of 1161 Indian COVID-19 patients, the median age was 38 years (IQR, 27-52) with 20-39 year-old males being the most affected group. The number of affected patients were 854 (73.6%) men and 307 (26.4%) women. If the current contact rate continues (0.25-27), India may have 110460 to 220575 infected persons at the end of 40 days lockdown.

Here we report strong Kerr-like nonlinearities by employing efficient optical transitions of charged excitons (trions) observed in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). By hybridising trions in monolayer MoSe2 at low electron densities with a microcavity mode, we realise trion-polaritons exhibiting significant energy shifts at small photon fluxes due to phase space filling. We find the ratio of trion- to neutral exciton-polariton interaction strength is in the range from 10 to 100 in TMDC materials and that trion-polariton nonlinearity is comparable to that in other polariton systems. The results are in good agreement with a theory accounting for the composite nature of excitons and trions and deviation of their statistics from that of ideal bosons and fermions. Our findings open a way to scalable quantum optics applications with TMDCs.","Emmanuele, R P A; Sich, M; Kyriienko, O; Shahnazaryan, V; Withers, F; Catanzaro, A; Walker, P M; Benimetskiy, F A; Skolnick, M S; Tartakovskii, A I; Shelykh, I A; Krizhanovskii, D N",Nat Commun,40,21

In addition to oxygen saturation for severity classification, stethoscope, chest X-ray and lung computer tomography are routinely used. However, the standard methods stethoscope and chest X-ray are unreliable. Moreover, all three diagnostic examination techniques expose physicians, support staff and subsequent patients to an additional risk of exposure.

We find that although antibody binding sites are widely dispersed, neutralizing antibody binding is focused, with nearly all highly inhibitory mAbs (IC50 < 0.1 µg/mL) blocking receptor interaction, except for one that binds a unique epitope in the N-terminal domain. Many of these neutralizing mAbs use public V-genes and are close to germline. We dissect the structural basis of recognition for this large panel of antibodies through X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy of 19 Fab-antigen structures.

Despite growing evidence on the suitability of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for mass screening at the event entry, this strategy has not been assessed under controlled conditions. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a prevention strategy during a live indoor concert. METHODS: We designed a randomised controlled open-label trial to assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive preventive intervention for a mass-gathering indoor event (a live concert) based on systematic same-day screening of attendees with Ag-RDTs, use of facial masks, and adequate air ventilation. The event took place in the Sala Apolo, Barcelona, Spain. Adults aged 18-59 years with a negative result in an Ag-RDT from a nasopharyngeal swab collected immediately before entering the event were randomised 1:1 (block randomisation stratified by age and gender) to either attend the indoor event for 5 hours or go home. Nasopharyngeal specimens used for Ag-RDT screening were analysed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cell culture (Vero E6 cells). 8 days after the event, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and analysed by Ag-RDT, RT-PCR, and a transcription-mediated amplification test (TMA). The primary outcome was the difference in incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 days between the control and the intervention groups, assessed in all participants who were randomly assigned, attended the event, and had a valid result for the SARS-CoV-2 test done at follow-up. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04668625. FINDINGS: Participant enrollment took place during the morning of the day of the concert, Dec 12, 2020. Of the 1140 people who responded to the call and were deemed eligible, 1047 were randomly assigned to either enter the music event (experimental group) or continue with normal life (control group). Of the 523 randomly assigned to the experimental group, 465 were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (51 did not enter the event and eight did not take part in the follow-up assessment), and of the 524 randomly assigned to the control group, 495 were included in the final analysis (29 did not take part in the follow-up). At baseline, 15 (3%) of 495 individuals in the control group and 13 (3%) of 465 in the experimental group tested positive on TMA despite a negative Ag-RDT result. The RT-PCR test was positive in one case in each group and cell viral culture was negative in all cases. 8 days after the event, two (<1%) individuals in the control arm had a positive Ag-RDT and PCR result, whereas no Ag-RDT nor RT-PCR positive results were found in the intervention arm. The Bayesian estimate for the incidence between the experimental and control groups was -0·15% (95% CI -0·72 to 0·44). INTERPRETATION: Our study provides preliminary evidence on the safety of indoor mass-gathering events during a COVID-19 outbreak under a comprehensive preventive intervention.

OBJECTIVES: We examine outcomes in critically ill individuals with COVID-19 who develop atrial tachyarrhythmias. METHODS: We collected data from electrocardiograms and the electronic medical record of COVID-19 positive (COVID+ ) and negative (COVID- ) individuals admitted to our medical intensive care unit between February 29 and June 28, 2020. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics, new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia, hemodynamic compromise following atrial tachyarrhythmia, and in-hospital mortality in COVID+ versus COVID- . Hemodynamic compromise was defined as having a new or increased vasopressor requirement or the need for direct current cardioversion for hemodynamic instability within 1 hour of atrial tachyarrhythmia onset. RESULTS: Of 300 individuals included, 200 were COVID+ and 100 were COVID- . Mean age was 60 ± 16 years, 180 (60%) were males, and 170 (57%) were African American. New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia occurred in 16% of COVID+ and 19% of COVID- individuals (P = .51). When compared to COVID- participants without atrial tachyarrhythmia, COVID+ individuals with new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia had higher mortality after multivariable adjustment (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.9-13.5). New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia was followed by hemodynamic compromise in 18 COVID+ but no COVID- participants (P = .0001). COVID+ individuals with hemodynamic compromise after atrial tachyarrhythmia required increased ventilatory support at the time of atrial tachyarrhythmia onset.

By mimicking a natural mechanism of complement regulation, the small peptide compstatin has proven to be a very promising complement inhibitor. Over the years, several compstatin analogs have been created, with improved inhibitory potency. A recent analog is being developed as a candidate drug against several pathological conditions, including COVID-19. However, the reasons behind its higher potency and increased binding affinity to complement proteins are not fully clear. This computational study highlights the mechanistic properties of several compstatin analogs, thus complementing previous experimental studies. We perform molecular dynamics simulations involving six analogs alone in solution and two complexes with compstatin bound to complement component 3. These simulations reveal that all the analogs we consider, except the original compstatin, naturally adopt a pre-bound conformation in solution. Interestingly, this set of analogs adopting a pre-bound conformation includes analogs that were not known to benefit from this behavior. We also show that the most recent compstatin analog (among those we consider) forms a stronger hydrogen bond network with its complement receptor than an earlier analog.","Devaurs, Didier; Antunes, Dinler A; Kavraki, Lydia E",J Mol Model,40,16

Here we report on the performance of a depth-sensing camera system for the continuous non-contact monitoring of Respiratory Rate (RR) and Tidal Volume (TV), where these parameters were compared to a ventilator reference. Depth sensing data streams were acquired and processed over a series of runs on a single volunteer comprising a range of respiratory rates and tidal volumes to generate depth-based respiratory rate (RRdepth) and tidal volume (TVdepth) estimates. The bias and root mean squared difference (RMSD) accuracy between RRdepth and the ventilator reference, RRvent, across the whole data set was found to be -0.02 breaths/min and 0.51 breaths/min respectively. The least squares fit regression equation was determined to be: RRdepth = 0.96 × RRvent + 0.57 breaths/min and the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient, R, was 0.98 (p < 0.001). Correspondingly, the bias and root mean squared difference (RMSD) accuracy between TVdepth and the reference TVvent across the whole data set was found to be - 0.21 L and 0.23 L respectively. The least squares fit regression equation was determined to be: TVdepth = 0.79 × TVvent-0.01 L and the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient, R, was 0.92 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, a high degree of agreement was found between the depth-based respiration rate and its ventilator reference, indicating that RRdepth is a promising modality for the accurate non-contact respiratory rate monitoring in the clinical setting. In addition, a high degree of correlation between depth-based tidal volume and its ventilator reference was found, indicating that TVdepth may provide a useful monitor of tidal volume trending in practice. Future work should aim to further test these parameters in the clinical setting.","Addison, Paul S; Smit, Philip; Jacquel, Dominique; Addison, Anthony P; Miller, Cyndy; Kimm, Gardner",J. clin. monit. comput,40,28

Here, we examine the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by determining the cryo-EM structures of the stalled pre- and post- translocated polymerase complexes. Compared with the apo complex, the structures show notable structural rearrangements happening to nsp12 and its co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 to accommodate the nucleic acid, whereas there are highly conserved residues in nsp12, positioning the template and primer for an in-line attack on the incoming nucleotide. Furthermore, we investigate the inhibition mechanism of the triphosphate metabolite of remdesivir through structural and kinetic analyses.

High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work, we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here, the pseudotyped particles (PP) contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles, and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells, resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5,158 approved drugs and drug candidates, our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven, six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay. Our results demonstrated the utility of this assay in the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors as well as the mechanistic study of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds.

Here, we illustrate why it is important, from a wellbeing perspective, to recognise such trade-offs, and provide a framework, based on the economic concept of 'marginal analysis', for doing so. We illustrate its potential through consideration of optimising the balance between reducing the reproductive rate (R) of the virus and further opening of the economy. The framework accommodates both perspectives in the health-vs-economy debate whereby, depending on where we are within the marginal analysis framework, either health issues are allowed to dominate or, below some threshold of R and/or background level of infection, health and economic considerations can be traded off against each other. Given the inevitability of such trade-offs, the framework exposes crucial questions to be addressed, such as: the critical value of R and/or background infection, above which health considerations predominate, and which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; and the value of lives forgone resulting from the small increases in R and/or background infection levels that may have to be tolerated as the economy is gradually opened.","Donaldson, Cam; Mitton, Craig",Health Econ Policy Law,40,29

Methods: We performed a systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19, which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in men.","Wei, Xiyi; Xiao, Yu-Tian; Wang, Jian; Chen, Rui; Zhang, Wei; Yang, Yue; Lv, Daojun; Qin, Chao; Gu, Di; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Weidong; Hou, Jianquan; Song, Ninghong; Zeng, Guohua; Ren, Shancheng",,40,20

The virus enters the host cell through an S protein on its surface and begins its life cycle with the help of a key protein, MPro. On the other hand, several bioactive from Ginger have been reported for their antiviral properties, but few studies related to COVID-19. This study aims to evaluate the potential of a few bioactive compounds from Ginger as anti-SARS-CoV2. Gingerenone A, gingerol, geraniol, shogaol, zingiberene, zingiberenol, and zingerone were used as ligand to be docked with S protein and MPro. Drug-likeness properties also evaluated using SwissADME. Gingerenone A constantly gave the lowest binding energy compared to others both with S or MPro. However, gingerol, geraniol, shogaol, zingiberene, zingiberenol, and zingerone could interact with key residues responsible for MPro catalytic domain, while geraniol, shogaol, zingiberene, zingiberenol, and zingerone could interfere S-ACE2 binding shape and increase its binding energy. The drug-likeness analysis also revealed that all of the analyzed compounds have no violation of Lipinski's Rule of 5. In conclusion, gingerol, geraniol, shogaol, zingiberene, zingiberenol, and zingerone from Ginger have good potential as antiviral agents with good oral bioavailability and flexibility.","Ahkam, A.

This review highlights and discusses the implications that climate change has already had and is expected to have for inpatient dermatologists. Recent Findings: There are a variety of conditions affected by climate changes. The distribution and frequencies of infectious diseases and their vectors are changing in line with variations in climate conditions. Increased temperatures have already been associated with exacerbation of existing skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, and recent evidence suggests that higher temperatures will also magnify the effects of harmful ultraviolet radiation. Extreme weather events that result from climate change are followed by an array of dermatologic conditions that may be unusual for the given location. Inpatient dermatologists should be prepared to manage these potentially unfamiliar dermatologic consequences of climate change. Summary: Climate change will have widespread effects on the medical field, and inpatient dermatologists will be faced with their own unique set of challenges and practice variations. Practitioners should be familiar with the ongoing and predicted effects of climate change in their locations so that they can readily identify and treat associated conditions, and they should adjust their practice to reduce their carbon footprint and serve as a model for patients to do the same.","Fathy, R; Rosenbach, Misha",Curr Dermatol Rep,40,24

Some of the challenges, like the severity of COVID-19 among patients on immunosuppressive agents, are predictable and are being evaluated with great care and effort across the globe. A few others, such as atypical manifestations of COVID-19 mimicking rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) are being reported. Like in many other viral infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can potentially lead to an array of rheumatological and autoimmune manifestations by molecular mimicry (cross-reacting epitope between the virus and the host), bystander killing (virus-specific CD8 + T cells migrating to the target tissues and exerting cytotoxicity), epitope spreading, viral persistence (polyclonal activation due to the constant presence of viral antigens driving immune-mediated injury) and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. In addition, the myriad of antiviral drugs presently being tried in the treatment of COVID-19 can result in several rheumatic musculoskeletal adverse effects. In this review, we have addressed the possible spectrum and mechanisms of various autoimmune and rheumatic musculoskeletal manifestations that can be precipitated by COVID-19 infection, its therapy, and the preventive strategies to contain the infection.","Shah, Sanket; Danda, Debashish; Kavadichanda, Chengappa; Das, Saibal; Adarsh, M B; Negi, Vir Singh",Rheumatol Int,40,21

Preliminary evidence suggests that this variability negatively affects people who stutter and that stuttering behaviors are more variable than adverse impact associated with stuttering. More information is needed to determine how variability affects people who stutter and what the clinical and research implications of variability may be. Method Two hundred and four adults who stutter participated in a mixed-methods study exploring (a) how variability of stuttering affects people who stutter in comparison to other aspects of the condition and (b) which aspects of the overall experience of stuttering are variable. Results Analyses indicated that variability is very commonly experienced by people who stutter and that it is among the most frustrating aspects of the condition. Qualitative analyses revealed that variability is experienced in all aspects of the stuttering condition, including the observable behavior other affective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions; and the adverse impact of stuttering. Notable individual differences were found in terms of which specific aspects of the condition were more variable for different respondents. Overall, analyses revealed that the variability of different aspects of stuttering can be viewed in a hierarchy from most variable to least variable: more external aspects (e.g., frequency, duration), more internal aspects (e.g., covert behaviors, physical tension), and cognitive-affective experiences (e.g., negative thoughts, feelings, and self-image). Discussion These findings suggest that variability is a common and burdensome aspect of the experience of stuttering and underscore the importance of considering variability in stuttering behavior, reactions, and impact in research, assessment, and treatment for adults who stutter.","Tichenor, Seth E; Yaruss, J Scott",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,40,22

Dexamethasone is commonly used for antiemetic prophylaxis with systemic therapy for cancer. However, dexamethasone is associated with increased risk of viral and respiratory infections, and causes lymphopenia, which is associated with worse outcomes during COVID-19 infections. Our purpose was to minimize dexamethasone exposure during antiemetic prophylaxis for systemic therapy for solid tumors during the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining control of nausea and emesis. METHODS: We convened an expert panel to systematically review the literature and formulate consensus recommendations. RESULTS: No studies considered the impact of dexamethasone-based antiemetic regimens on the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. Expert consensus recommended modifications to the 2019 Cancer Care Ontario Antiemetic Recommendations. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should prescribe the minimally effective dose of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis. Single-day dexamethasone dosing is recommended over multi-day dosing for regimens with high emetogenic risk excluding high-dose cisplatin, preferably in combination with palonosetron, netupitant, and olanzapine. For regimens with low emetogenic risk, 5-HT3 antagonists are recommended over dexamethasone.","Grant, Robert C; Rotstein, Coleman; Liu, Geoffrey; Forbes, Leta; Vu, Kathy; Lee, Roy; Ng, Pamela; Krzyzanowska, Monika; Warr, David; Knox, Jennifer",Support Care Cancer,40,24

We aimed to quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection on high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P < 0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (Rrange, 0.36-0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.","Xiong, Ying; Sun, Dong; Liu, Yao; Fan, Yanqing; Zhao, Lingyun; Li, Xiaoming; Zhu, Wenzhen",Invest Radiol,40,24

Results: From January through April 2020, a total of 8,437 patients were admitted to our surgical department; 5.9% (498/8437) required peri-operative testing for SARS-CoV-2. Because testing was in-house with turnaround within 24 hours, only a small number of emergency operations (n = 10) were conducted for suspected COVID-19 cases prior to results; none tested positive. The testing yield was lower in surgical inpatients compared with medical inpatients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.32, p < 0.001). Three operations were conducted in known COVID-19 cases; all healthcare workers (HCWs) used full PPE. A risk-stratified testing strategy picked up previously unsuspected COVID-19 in six cases; 66.7% (4/6) were asymptomatic at presentation. Although 48 HCWs were exposed to these six cases, delayed diagnosis was averted and no evidence of spread to patients or HCWs was detected. Conclusion: A risk-stratified approach allowed for early recognition, testing, and isolation of potential COVID-19 infection in surgical patients, ensuring continuity of surgical services.","Wee, Liang En; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Aung, May Kyawt; Wong, Hei Man; Teh, Yii Ean; Tan, Kwee Yuen; Wijaya, Limin; Tan, Tan Ban Hock; Ling, Moi Lin; Venkatachalam, Indumathi",Surg Infect (Larchmt),40,16

Given dominant ethical trends, such reactive ethics tends to lead to either individualized struggles over the right way to act or hasty sets of guidelines that leave out contextualizing questions concerning regimes of care. Good people will find themselves suggesting strange things, from setting up lifeboat scenarios to supporting structural racism. This essay argues against both these paths-crisis-ridden agonism or algorithmic resource-allocation-and turns instead to a form of ethics of care which takes its departure from older forms of ethics, while recognizing that modern and postmodern challenges no longer allow their grounding in animated relations, natural rights, or cosmological truths.","James, Paul",J Bioeth Inq,40,22

Many patients require screening tests of one form or the other before being attended to in hospitals. The protean clinical manifestations of this highly transmissible infection require that a high index of suspicion be maintained. Pulmonary embolism is a potentially fatal emergency whose presentation is mimicked by COVID-19. Delays in ruling out COVID-19 may result in undue delays in initiating treatment for pulmonary embolism, potentially resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. This article presents a patient whose treatment for acute pulmonary embolism was forestalled by delays in getting the polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 done. It reiterates the need for physicians to test promptly in order to allow early focus on differential diagnoses which were routinely being investigated promptly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Asamoah, K.

The authors employed a quantitative method approach, conducting an online survey with 508 respondents in Lithuania. Empirical research analysis reveals that the greater the perceived value of a luxury brand, the greater the consumer purchase intention. The latter is most strongly affected by the luxury brand perceived functional value. The study demonstrates that the greater the luxury brand perceived value among consumers, the greater their brand attachment, which in turn leads to a greater purchase intention. As there is a positive emotional relationship between a luxury brand and the consumer, the consumer’s purchase intention is also affected by the luxury brand perceived symbolic value, i.e., the capacity of the brand to communicate the consumer’s success, leadership, and power. Consumer vanity was not statistically significant to the nature of the relationship between luxury brand perceived value, brand attachment, and purchase intention. Luxury car marketers may benefit by focusing on the social and symbolic value of luxury car brand value in communication with brand-attached consumers in Lithuania.","Petravičiūtė, Kristina Šeinauskiené Beata Rūtelionė Aušra Krukowski Krzysztof",Sustainability,40,1

Molecular stratification, in conjunction with the traditional TNM staging, is a promising way to predict patient outcomes. We investigated the interconnectivity between tumor stage and tumor biology reflected by the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMSs) in CRC, and explored the possible value of these insights in patients with stage II colon cancer. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using clinical records and gene expression profiling in a meta-cohort of 1040 CRC patients. The interconnectivity of tumor biology and disease stage was assessed by investigating the association between CMSs and TNM classification. In order to validate the clinical applicability of our findings we employed a meta-cohort of 197 stage II colon cancers. RESULTS: CMS4 was significantly more prevalent in advanced stages of disease (stage I 9.8% versus stage IV 38.5%, p < 0.001). The observed differential gene expression between cancer stages is at least partly explained by the biological differences as reflected by CMS subtypes. Gene signatures for stage III-IV and CMS4 were highly correlated (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). CMS4 cancers showed an increased progression rate to more advanced stages (CMS4 compared to CMS2: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46). Patients with a CMS4 cancer had worse survival in the high-risk stage II tumors compared to the total stage II cohort (5-year DFS 41.7% versus 100.0%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable interconnectivity between tumor biology and tumor stage in CRC exists. This implies that the TNM stage, in addition to the stage of progression, might also reflect distinct biological disease entities. These insights can potentially be utilized to optimize identification of high-risk stage II colon cancers.","Coebergh van den Braak, R R J; Ten Hoorn, S; Sieuwerts, A M; Tuynman, J B; Smid, M; Wilting, S M; Martens, J W M; Punt, C J A; Foekens, J A; Medema, J P; IJzermans, J N M; Vermeulen, L",BMC Cancer,40,16

A total of 7,882 pig farms in the Red River Delta (RRD) region were obtained from the General Statistics Office, and then, random points corresponding to the number of farms in each province were generated as exact farm locations were not available. A total of 10 models were developed, including movement control scenarios. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of indirect contact transmission probability (TP). Overall, the indirect contact exhibited an important role in transmitting the ASF virus. In order to minimize ASF transmission between farms, we found that movement restriction needed to reach a certain level (approximately between 50% and 75%) and that the restriction had to be applied in a timely manner. This study offers valuable insight into how ASF virus can be transmitted via direct and indirect contact and controlled among farms under the various simulation scenarios. Our results suggest that the enforcement of movement restriction was an effective control measure as soon as the outbreaks were reported. In addition, this study provided evidence that high standards of biosecurity can contribute to the reduction of disease spread.","Lee, Hu Suk; Thakur, Krishna K; Bui, Vuong Nghia; Pham, Thanh Long; Bui, Anh Ngoc; Dao, Tung Duy; Thanh, Vu Thi; Wieland, Barbara",,40,23

Its exploitation in the thermonuclear regime, however, appears to be prohibitive due to the low reactivity of the $^{11}$B fuel at temperatures up to 100 keV. A fusion chain sustained by elastic collisions between the alpha particles and fuel ions, this way scattered to suprathermal energies, has been proposed as a possible route to overcome this limitation. Based on a simple model, this work investigates the reproduction process in an infinite, non-degenerate $^{11}$B plasma, in a wide range of densities and temperatures which are of interest for laser-driven experiments ($10^{24} \lesssim n_e \lesssim 10^{28} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, $T_e \lesssim 100$ keV, $T_i \sim$ 1 keV). In particular, cross section data for the $\alpha$-$p$ scattering which include the nuclear interaction have been used. The multiplication factor, $k_\infty$, increases markedly with electron temperature and less significantly with plasma density. However, even at the highest temperature and density considered, and despite a more than twofold increase by the inclusion of the nuclear scattering, $k_\infty$ turns out to be of the order of $10^{-2}$ only. In general, values of $k_\infty$ very close to 1 are needed in a confined scheme to enhance the suprathermal-to-thermonuclear energy yield by factors of up to $10^3$-$10^4$.","Belloni, Fabio",,40,1

The symposium's rationale was the highly likely inflation of criminal and civil proceedings concerning alleged errors committed by health care professionals and decision makers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its aim was to identify and discuss the main issues of legal and medicolegal interest and thus to find solid solutions in the spirit of preparedness planning. METHODS: There were 5 main points of discussion: (A) how to judge errors committed during the pandemic because of the application of protocols and therapies based on no or weak evidence of efficacy, (B) whether hospital managers can be considered liable for infected health care professionals who were not given adequate personal protective equipment, (C) whether health care professionals and institutions can be considered liable for cases of infected inpatients who claim that the infection was transmitted in a hospital setting, (D) whether health care institutions and hospital managers can be considered liable for the hotspots in long-term care facilities/care homes, and (E) whether health care institutions and hospital managers can be considered liable for the worsening of chronic diseases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Limitation of the liability to the cases of gross negligence (with an explicit definition of this term), a no-fault system with statal indemnities for infected cases, and a rigorous methodology for the expert witnesses were proposed as key interventions for successfully facing future proceedings.","Oliva, Antonio; Caputo, Matteo; Grassi, Simone; Vetrugno, Giuseppe; Marazza, Marco; Ponzanelli, Giulio; Cauda, Roberto; Scambia, Giovanni; Forti, Gabrio; Bellantone, Rocco; Pascali, Vincenzo L",J Patient Saf,40,10

It will examine how case study research is defined, the methodologies adopted, and the context in which it is applied. Most importantly, it will consider the viability of case study research for contributing to the evidence base for occupation and health. INTRODUCTION: Occupational therapists report barriers to conducting research due to the complexities of clinical practice, and lack of knowledge, time, and resources. Case study research is generating interest as a potentially manageable and practical solution to increase research engagement. However, it is not clear how this is being utilized by occupational therapists or how feasible it is to contribute to the evidence base. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Opinion, text, and empirical studies that explicitly use or discuss case study research methodology within an occupational therapy context will be included. Studies will be excluded where the occupational therapy context cannot be clearly defined, for example, where they are multi-disciplinary focused or where a case study research design is not explicit (eg, a descriptive case report without data collection). All countries and practice settings will be included.

Growing evidence indicates an increased prevalence of neurological involvement (e.g., in the form of stroke) during virus infection. COVID-19 has been suggested to be more than a lung infection because it affects the vasculature of the lungs and other organs and increases the risk of thrombosis. Patients with stroke are vulnerable to secondary events as a result not only of their poor vascular condition but also of their lack of access to rehabilitation resources. Herein, we review current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of COVID-19, its possible association with neurological involvement, and current drug therapies.

Point-of-care antigen tests (POCT) may provide an alternative to time-consuming PCR tests to rapidly screen for acute infections on site. Here, we evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests: the STANDARD&#8482; F COVID-19 Ag FIA (FIA) and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). For diagnostic assessment, we used a large set of PCR-positive and PCR-negative respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients and health care workers in the setting of two University Hospitals in Munich, Germany, i.e. emergency rooms, patient care units or employee test centers. For FIA, overall clinical sensitivity and specificity were 45.4% (n = 381) and 97.8% (n = 360), respectively, and for RAT, 50.3% (n = 445) and 97.7% (n = 386), respectively. For primary diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, diagnostic sensitivities were 60.9% (FIA) (n = 189) and 64.5% (RAT) (n = 256). This questions these tests' utility for the reliable detection of acute SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, in particular in high-risk settings. We support the proposal that convincing high-quality outcome data on the impact of false-negative and false-positive antigen test results need to be obtained in a POCT setting.

In the setting of pericardial diseases, there are two possible different scenarios to consider: the patient being treated for pericarditis who subsequently becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the patient with COVID-19 who develops pericarditis or pericardial effusion. In both conditions, clinicians may be doubtful regarding the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, colchicine, and biological agents, such as anti-IL1 agents (e.g. anakinra), that are the mainstay of therapy for pericarditis.For NSAIDs, there is no clear scientific evidence linking ibuprofen and other NSAIDs to worsening of COVID-19; however, it seems prudent to continue them, if necessary to control pericarditis, and on the other hand, to prefer paracetamol for fever and systemic symptoms related to COVID-19. Treatments with corticosteroids, colchicine, and anakinra appear well tolerated in the context of COVID-19 infection and are currently actively evaluated as potential therapeutic options for COVID infection at different stages of the disease. On this basis, currently most treatments for pericarditis do not appear contraindicated also in the presence of possible COVID-19 infection and should not be discontinued, and some (corticosteroids, colchicine, and anakinra) can be considered to treat both conditions.","Imazio, Massimo; Brucato, Antonio; Lazaros, George; Andreis, Alessandro; Scarsi, Mirko; Klein, Allan; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; Adler, Yehuda",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),40,24

Shed ß2-m is measurable in circulation, and various disorders are accompanied by increases in ß2-m levels, including several viral infections. Therefore, we explored whether ß2-m levels could also be elevated in Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and whether they predict disease severity. Serum ß2-m levels were measured in a cohort of 34 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 on admission to a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as well as in an approximately age-sex matched group of 34 uninfected controls. Mean ß2-m level was 3.25±1.68 mg/l (reference range 0.8-2.2 mg/l) in patients (mean age 48.2±21.6) and 1.98±0.61 mg/l in controls (mean age 48.2±21.6). 17 patients (mean age 36.9± 18.0) with mean ß2-m levels of 2.27±0.64 mg/l had mild disease by WHO severity categorization, 12 patients (mean age 53.3±18.1) with mean ß2-m levels of 3.57±1.39 mg/l had moderate disease, and five patients (of whom 2 died; mean age 74.4±13.8) with mean ß2-m levels of 5.85±1.85 mg/l had severe disease (P < = 0.001, by ANOVA test for linear trend). In multivariate ordinal regression ß2-m levels were the only significant predictor of disease severity. Our findings suggest that higher ß2-m levels could be an early indicator of severity of disease and predict outcome of Covid-19. As the main limitations of the study are a single-center study, sample size and ethnicity, these results need confirmation in larger cohorts outside the Arabian Peninsula in order to delineate the value of ß2-m measurements. The role of ß2-m in the etiology and pathogenesis of severe Covid-19 remains to be elucidated.","Conca, Walter; Alabdely, Mayyadah; Albaiz, Faisal; Foster, Michael Warren; Alamri, Maha; Alkaff, Morad; Al-Mohanna, Futwan; Nagelkerke, Nicolaas; Almaghrabi, Reem Saad",PLoS One,40,1

Their protective capacity largely depends on the fraction of these that are filtered from the incoming air volume. While the performance and physics of different filter materials have been the topic of intensive study, less well understood are the effects of mask sealing. To address this, we introduce an approach to calculate the influence of face-seal leakage on filtration ratio and fit factor based on an analytical model and a finite element method (FEM) model, both of which take into account time-dependent human respiration velocities. Using these, we calculate the filtration ratio and fit factor for a range of ventilation resistance values relevant to filter materials, 500-2500 Paâsâm-1, where the filtration ratio and fit factor are calculated as a function of the mask gap dimensions, with good agreement between analytical and numerical models. The results show that the filtration ratio and fit factor are decrease markedly with even small increases in gap area. We also calculate particle filtration rates for N95 FFRs with various ventilation resistances and two commercial FFRs exemplars. Taken together, this work underscores the critical importance of forming a tight seal around the face as a factor in mask performance, where our straightforward analytical model can be readily applied to obtain estimates of mask performance.","Xu, Mingxin; Lee, Peter; Collins, David",PLoS One,40,1

Early detection of COVID-19 positive patients and timely isolation of the patients are essential to prevent its spread. Chest X-ray images of COVID-19 patients often show the characteristics of multifocality, bilateral hairy glass turbidity, patchy network turbidity, etc. It is crucial to design a method to automatically identify COVID-19 from chest X-ray images to help diagnosis and prognosis. Existing studies for the classification of COVID-19 rarely consider the role of attention mechanisms on the classification of chest X-ray images and fail to capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes. This paper proposes a multi-kernel-size spatial-channel attention method to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Our proposed method consists of three stages. The first stage is feature extraction. The second stage contains two parallel multi-kernel-size attention modules: multi-kernel-size spatial attention and multi-kernel-size channel attention. The two modules capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes using multiple 1D and 2D convolutional kernels of different sizes to obtain channel and spatial attention feature maps. The third stage is the classification module. We integrate the chest X-ray images from three public datasets: COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, ActualMed COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, and COVID-19 radiography database for evaluation.

Remarkable progress has led this field toward animal trials and the next challenge lies with translation to humans. There is an emerging number of small human trials that can take advantage of new models integrating behavioral and social factors. Understanding dynamic aging mechanisms, given the powerful social determinants of aging (Crimmins, 2020) and human variability and environmental contexts (Moffitt, 2020), will be critical. Behavioral and social factors are intrinsic to aging. Toxic stressors broadly defined can lead to stress-acceleration of aging, either directly impacting aging processes or by shaping poor behavioral health, and underlie the socioeconomic disparities of aging. In contrast, hormetic stressors, acute intermittent stressors of moderate intensity, can produce stress resilience, the ability for quick recovery and possibly rejuvenation of cells and tissues. Although health research usually examines static biomarkers, aging is reflected in dynamic ability to recover from challenges pointing to new interventions and targets for examining mechanisms. A fuller model incorporating stress resilience provides innovative biobehavioral interventions, both for bolstering response to challenges, such as COVID-19, and for improving healthspan.","Epel, Elissa S",Ageing Res Rev,40,1

We sought to evaluate factors associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 among residents of homeless shelters and to evaluate positivity rates in shelters where testing was conducted in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks or for surveillance. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart audit to obtain repeated cross-sectional data from outreach testing done at homeless shelters between Apr. 1 and July 31, 2020, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate for shelters where testing was conducted because of an outbreak (at least 1 known case) with those tested for surveillance (no known cases). A patient-level analysis evaluated differences in demographic, health and behavioural characteristics of residents who did and did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 at shelters with at least 2 positive cases. RESULTS: One thousand nasopharyngeal swabs were done on 872 unique residents at 20 shelter locations. Among the 504 tests done in outbreak settings, 69 (14%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 (0.2%) was indeterminate. Among the 496 tests done for surveillance, 11 (2%) were positive and none were indeterminate. Shelter residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were significantly less likely to have a health insurance card (54% v. 72%, p = 0.03) or to have visited another shelter in the last 14 days (0% v. 18%, p < 0.01). There was no association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and medical history or symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Our findings support testing of asymptomatic shelter residents for SARS-CoV-2 when a positive case is identified at the same shelter. Surveillance testing when there are no known positive cases may detect outbreaks, but further research should identify efficient strategies given scarce testing resources.","Kiran, Tara; Craig-Neil, Amy; Das, Paul; Lockwood, Joel; Wang, Ri; Nathanielsz, Nikki; Rosenthal, Esther; Snider, Carolyn; Hwang, Stephen W",CMAJ Open,40,24

Although some lives are considered sacred, others are deliberately sacrificed. This article draws on the theoretical work of Foucault and scholars who further developed his concept of biopolitics. While biopolitics aims to ameliorate the health of populations, Foucault never systematically accounted for the unequal value of lives. In the name of saving the biological lives of people who use drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, the harm reduction movement has emphasized the need for safe supply, decriminalization, and housing; governments have started implementing these measures, which were previously rejected as utopian and unrealistic. Paradoxically, the use of drugs itself, and therefore the increased risk of death from overdose or other medical sequelae, is the only way PWUD can achieve enough visibility to be recognized as a life worth saving. The humanitarian rationale of harm reduction concerns itself with the biological life and stipulates social and political rights in the name of its sacredness. This is what anthropologist Fassin and others called biolegitimacy-the recognition of life reduced to its physiological, biological essence.","Larocque, Catherine; Foth, Thomas",Nurs Inq,40,26

Uncertainty around medical education due to cancelled exams and placements also increases stress.4 Although a recent meta-analysis showed no difference in anxiety during COVID-19 in medical students,2 isolated studies worldwide have shown increased anxiety in those whose loved ones had contracted COVID-19 and who had interacted with COVID-19 patients.4 Higher levels of baseline stress and depression are negative predictors of poor mental health,1 so more research must be done to identify those especially at risk.

Evidence has been documented that the immune system is impressively involved in the pathogenesis of this disease, especially in causing inflammation. One of the important components of the immune system is the complement system whose increased activity has been shown in inflammatory diseases and consequently damage caused by the activity of its components. In the present study, serum levels of C3 and C4 factors as well as the activity level of complement system in the classical pathway were measured by CH50 test in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Participants in the study consisted of 53 hospitalized patients whose real-time PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean age of these patients was 42.06 ± 18.7 years, including 40% women and 60% men. The most common symptoms in these patients were cough (70%), fever (59%), dyspnea (53%) and chills (53%), respectively. Analysis of biochemical and hematological test results revealed that 26 (49%) patients had lymphopenia, 34 (64%) patients were positive for C-reactive protein (CRP) and 26 (49%) patients had ESR and LDH levels significantly higher than normal. In addition, 27 patients (51%) had vitamin D deficiency. The mean CH50 activity level in COVID-19 patients was significantly reduced compared to healthy individuals (84.9 versus 169.9 U/ml, p = < 0.0001). Comparison of the mean CH50 activity levels between different subgroups of patients indicated that COVID-19 patients with decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte count and positive CRP had a significant increase in activity compared to the other groups (p = 0.0002). The serum levels of C3 and C4 factors had no significant change between patients and healthy individuals. Conclusion: The activity level of complement system in the classical pathway decreases in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals, due to increased activity of complement system factors in these patients.","Keshavarz, Fatemeh Ghalamfarsa Farideh Javdansirat Saeed Hasanzadeh Sajad Azizi Arsalan Sabz Gholamabbas Salehi Marziyeh Ghalamfarsa Ghasem",Virusdisease,40,3

This study investigated two risk factors for HCC in these patients, specifically hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. METHODS: A total of 355 patients in whom HCV was eradicated by DAAs were evaluated. Fibrosis and steatosis were assessed using transient elastography (TE) and the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was applied to patient age, sex, albumin-bilirubin, &#945;-fetoprotein, history of HCC, TE, or CAP. RESULTS: The 12-, 24-, and 36-month cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0.9%, 2.4%, and 4.1%, respectively. Univariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards model showed that while a high TE value (&#8805;10 kPa) was significantly associated with HCC development (hazard ratio [HR], 7.861; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.126-29.070; p=0.002), while CAP was not. Additionally, univariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards model adjusted by IPW showed that a high TE value was significantly associated with HCC development (HR, 3.980; 95% CI, 1.036-15.290; p=0.044), while CAP was not. The cumulative IPW-adjusted incidence of HCC rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.7%, respectively, in patients with a low TE value, and 2.5%, 5.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, in those with a high TE value. CONCLUSION: A high TE value was a risk factor for HCC in HCV patients who received DAA therapy and achieved SVR. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of adolescents. METHODS: A cohort study with schoolchildren from southern Brazil was conducted. Data on adolescents' OHRQoL were collected from December 2019 to February 2020 (T1), before the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak. Posteriorly, the data were collected again in June and July of 2020 (T2), under the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak. The OHRQoL was assessed using the Brazilian short version of the CPQ11-14. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the degree of social distancing were also assessed. Changes in OHRQoL between T1 and T2 were evaluated by adjusted Multilevel Poisson regression models for repeated measures. RESULTS: From 290 individuals evaluated at T1, 207 were reevaluated at T2 (response rate of 71.3%). The overall CPQ11-14 mean score was significantly lower during the pandemic, reducing from 10.8 at T1 to 7.7 at T2. This significant reduction was also observed for all CPQ domains, indicating a lower negative impact of oral conditions on adolescents' quality of life during the pandemic. Adolescents from families that had a middle or low degree of social distancing during the pandemic and whose parents were harmed in employment had higher CPQ11-14 scores. CONCLUSION: Overall and specific-domains CPQ-14 scores were significantly lower during the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak, indicating a decrease in the perception of oral health problems by adolescents over that period.","Knorst, Jessica Klöckner; Brondani, Bruna; Tomazoni, Fernanda; Vargas, Andressa Weber; Cósta, Marina Dutra; da Silva Godois, Leonardo; Mendes, Fausto Medeiros; Ardenghi, Diego Machado; Ardenghi, Thiago Machado",Qual. life res,40,1

In this context, a Slovak nationwide survey on forests was conducted, with the main objective of casting light on possible changes in NFV as a coping mechanism or behavioral response to the discomfort and severe restrictions stemming from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related measures. The survey was administered on a statistically representative sample after the pandemic's first wave ebbed and restrictions were eased in the summer months of 2020. Collected data were assessed using ANOVA, the results of which supported the importance of forests as places providing opportunities for restoration of mental and physical resources. Forest accessibility as represented by forest coverage and settlement size emerged as a paramount factor affecting NFV rates both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and its accompanying measures affected the relationships between NFV and average per capita income, type of employment, and most importantly age, highlighting possible vulnerabilities and disadvantages in certain population segments.","Pichlerová, Magdaléna; Önkal, Dilek; Bartlett, Anthony; Výbostok, Jozef; Pichler, Viliam",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),40,2

To address this need, we developed the SCENTinel 1.0 test, which rapidly evaluates three olfactory functions: detection, intensity, and identification. We tested whether self-administering the SCENTinel 1.0 test discriminates between individuals with self-reported smell loss and those with average smell ability (normosmic individuals) and provides performance comparable to the validated and standardized NIH Toolbox ® Odor Identification Test in normosmic individuals. Using Bayesian linear models and prognostic classification algorithms, we compared the SCENTinel 1.0 performance of a group of self-reported anosmic individuals (N=111, 47±13yo, F=71%) and normosmic individuals (N=154, 47±14yo, F=74%), as well as individuals reporting other smell disorders (such as hyposmia or parosmia; N=42, 55±10yo, F=67%). Ninety-four percent of normosmic individuals met our SCENTinel 1.0 accuracy criteria, compared to only 10% of anosmic individuals and 64% of individuals with other smell disorders. Overall performance on SCENTinel 1.0 predicted belonging to the normosmic group better than identification or detection alone (vs anosmic: AUC=0.95,specificity=0.94). Odor intensity provided the best single-feature predictor to classify normosmic individuals. Among normosmic individuals, 92% met the accuracy criteria at both SCENTinel 1.0 and the NIH Toolbox ® Odor Identification Test. SCENTinel 1.0 is a practical test able to discriminate individuals with smell loss and will likely be useful in many clinical situations, including COVID-19 symptom screening.","Parma, Valentina; Hannum, Mackenzie E; O039,; Leary, Maureen; Pellegrino, Robert; Rawson, Nancy E; Reed, Danielle R; Dalton, Pamela H",Chem. senses,40,32

The frequency of these outbreaks, their mortality and associated disruption to normal life calls for concerted efforts to understand their occurrence and fate in different environments. There is an increased interest in the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater from the perspective of wastewater-based epidemiology. However, there is no comprehensive review of the knowledge on coronavirus occurrence, fate and potential transmission in wastewater. This paper, provides a review of the literature on the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater treatment processes. We discuss the presence of viral RNA in feces as a result of diarrhoea caused by gastrointestinal infections. We also reviewed the literature on the presence, survival and potential removal of coronaviruses in common wastewater treatment processes. The detection of infectious viral particles in feces of patients raises questions on the potential risks of infection for people exposed to untreated sewage/wastewater. We, therefore, highlighted the potential risk of infection with coronaviruses for workers in wastewater treatment plants and the public that may be exposed through faulty plumbing or burst sewer networks. The mortalities and morbidities associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic warrants a much more focused research on the role of environments, such as wastewater and surface water, in disease transmission. The current wealth of knowledge on coronaviruses in wastewater based on the reviewed literature is scant and therefore calls for further studies.","Amoah, Isaac Dennis; Kumari, Sheena; Bux, Faizal",Environ Int,40,16

We computed a composite descriptive statistic, H, from ß's of each first-level model fit and carried it to the group-level analysis. The number of activated voxels and the t value of the group-level analysis as well as a goodness-of-fit measure were used as surrogate markers of data quality for comparison. RESULTS: Increasing the temporal sampling rate did not provide a universal improvement in the group-level statistical outcome. Rather, both the voxel-wise and ROI-averaged group-level results varied widely with anatomical location, choice of HRF and the setting of the TR. Correspondingly, the goodness-of-fit of HRFs became worse with increasing the sampling frequency. CONCLUSION: Rather than universally increasing the temporal sampling rate in cognitive fMRI experiments, these results advocate the performance of a pilot study for the specific ROIs of interest to identify the appropriate temporal sampling rate for the acquisition and the correspondingly suitable HRF for the analysis of the data.","Darányi, Virág; Hermann, Petra; Homolya, István; Vidnyánszky, Zoltán; Nagy, Zoltan",Magma,40,21

We have recently shown that a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) strain LaSota expressing the spike (S) protein of IBV strain Mass-41 (rLaSota/IBV-S) was a promising vaccine candidate for IBV. Here we evaluated a novel chimeric rNDV/avian paramyxovirus serotype 2 (rNDV/APMV-2) as a vaccine vector against IBV. The rNDV/APMV-2 vector was chosen because it is much safer than the rNDV strain LaSota vector, particularly for young chicks and chicken embryos. In order to determine the effectiveness of this vector, a recombinant rNDV/APMV-2 expressing the S protein of IBV strain Mass-41 (rNDV/APMV-2/IBV-S) was constructed. The protective efficacy of this vector vaccine was compared to that of the rNDV vector vaccine. In one study, groups of one-day-old specific-pathogenic-free (SPF) chickens were immunized with rLaSota/IBV-S and rNDV/APMV-2/IBV-S and challenged four weeks later with the homologous highly virulent IBV strain Mass-41. In another study, groups of broiler chickens were single (at day one or three weeks of age) or prime-boost (prime at day one and boost at three weeks of age) immunized with rLaSota/IBV-S and/or rNDV-APMV-2/IBV-S. At weeks six of age, chickens were challenged with a highly virulent IBV strain Mass-41. Our challenge study showed that novel rNDV/APMV-2/IBV-S provided similar protection as rLaSota/IBV-S in SPF chickens. However, compared to prime-boost immunization of chickens with chimeric rNDV/APMV-2, rLaSota/IBV-S and/or a live IBV vaccine, single immunization of chickens with rLaSota/IBV-S, or live IBV vaccine provided better protection against IBV. In conclusion, we have developed the novel rNDV/APMV-2 vector expressing S protein of IBV that can be a safer vaccine against IB in chickens. Our results also suggest a single immunization with a LaSota vectored IBV vaccine candidate provides better protection than prime-boost immunization regimens.","Shirvani, Edris; Samal, Siba K",Viruses,40,26

We compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, ambient temperature (AT), diurnal temperature range (DTR), absolute humidity (AH) and migration scale index (MSI) for each city during the period of January 20th to March 2nd, 2020. First, we explored the associations between COVID-19 confirmed case counts, meteorological factors, and MSI using non-linear regression. Then, we conducted a two-stage analysis for 17 cities with more than 50 confirmed cases. In the first stage, generalized linear models with negative binomial distribution were fitted to estimate city-specific effects of meteorological factors on confirmed case counts. In the second stage, the meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effects. Our results showed that among 13 cities that have less than 50 confirmed cases, 9 cities locate in the Northern China with average AT below 0 °C, 12 cities had average AH below 4 g/m3, and one city (Haikou) had the highest AH (14.05 g/m3). Those 17 cities with 50 and more cases accounted for 90.6% of all cases in our study. Each 1 °C increase in AT and DTR was related to the decline of daily confirmed case counts, and the corresponding pooled RRs were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), respectively. For AH, the association with COVID-19 case counts were statistically significant in lag 07 and lag 014. In addition, we found the all these associations increased with accumulated time duration up to 14 days. In conclusions, meteorological factors play an independent role in the COVID-19 transmission after controlling population migration. Local weather condition with low temperature, mild diurnal temperature range and low humidity likely favor the transmission.","Liu, Jiangtao; Zhou, Ji; Yao, Jinxi; Zhang, Xiuxia; Li, Lanyu; Xu, Xiaocheng; He, Xiaotao; Wang, Bo; Fu, Shihua; Niu, Tingting; Yan, Jun; Shi, Yanjun; Ren, Xiaowei; Niu, Jingping; Zhu, Weihao; Li, Sheng; Luo, Bin; Zhang, Kai",Sci Total Environ,40,16

Digital health technologies (eHealth) open up new possibilities for improving the quality of care, but there is a limited understanding of what productive interactions entail. This study explores characteristics of productive interactions to support self-care and healthcare in the context of eHealth use in diabetes care. We collected qualitative data based on interviews with nurses and responses to open-ended survey questions from patients, prior to and post using an eHealth service for self-monitoring and digital communication. We found that eHealth’s influence on productive interactions was characterized by unconstrained access, health parameter surveillance, and data-driven feedback, with implications for self-care and healthcare. Our findings indicate that eHealth perforates the boundaries that define interactions under traditional, non-digital care. This was manifested in expressions of uncertainty and in blurred boundaries between self-care and healthcare. We conclude that the attainment of a sustainable eHealth ecosystem will require healthcare to acknowledge eHealth as a disruptive change that may require re-organization to optimally support the productive use of eHealth services for both patients and staff, which includes agreement on new routines, as well as social interaction rules.","Wannheden, Carolina Ulrica von Thiele Schwarz Claes-Göran Östenson Karin Pukk Härenstam Stenfors Terese",Sustainability,40,24

In addition to the treatment of COVID-19 patients, universities and other acute care hospitals had to provide emergency medical care, including for patients undergoing trauma surgery. The challenge was that no reliable planning figures were available regarding the expected volume for such a crisis situation and therefore no reliable resource planning was possible in this respect. Therefore, the aim of this work was to record the incidence of polytrauma and other injuries during the pandemic crisis in a university trauma surgery clinic and to compare it with the years 2017-2019. METHODS: In this single-center study, a retrospective analysis of the injury incidence during calendar weeks with existing exit restrictions (12th-19th week) for the year 2020 for trauma surgery patients of a university hospital was performed. At first, the treatment of COVID-19 patients was recorded daily in order to objectify the burden and expenditure of inpatient treatment for these patients. Then, for the evaluation period from 20.03.2020 to 06.05.2020, the numbers of 1. polytrauma, 2. work-related accidents and 3. leisure-related trauma patients were recorded and compared with the numbers from 2017-2019 during the same period. RESULTS: In total, 118 patients were treated with COVID-19 as inpatients during the period under study, of which up to 43 patients had to be treated simultaneously in intensive care on 1 day. Overall, the number of polytrauma, work-related accidents and leisure-time accident patients was lower in 2020 than in the previous years. Nevertheless, with a decline of only -28% (22â¯± 4.9 vs. 16), a considerable number of polytrauma patients were recorded, while all work-related accidents (44%, 304â¯± 31.3 vs. 170) and also leisure-time accidents (39%, 173â¯± 22.7 vs. 106) considerably decreased. In the group of leisure-time accidents, there was initially a remarkable decline in the number of cases per week after the initial restrictions began, but as the duration of the restrictions increased, the number per week has risen to the level of previous years. DISCUSSION: Even in exceptional situations such as the corona pandemic, there were a significant number of patients in need of acute treatment, especially polytrauma patients. This should be considered in the future in the event of similar exceptional situations in the inpatient care framework when providing trauma surgery care capacities.","Popp, Daniel; Worlicek, Michael; Koch, Matthias; Kerschbaum, Maximilian; Rupp, Markus; Schicho, Andreas; Künzig, Holger; Zimmermann, Markus; Pfeifer, Christian; Alt, Volker",Unfallchirurg,40,13

Overall, the course of the crisis can be considered W-shaped, although some aspects and sectors show a different picture. However, as the viral situation improves, it will be an important task of economic policy to ensure that the last stem of the W is steep, i.e. that the Hungarian economy can return to its previous growth trajectory.

Here, we experimentally tested the vulnerability of a demersal temperate fish (Sparus aurata) to long-lasting heatwaves, on larval, juvenile and adult life-stages. Fish were exposed to simulated coastal (18 °C), estuarine (24 °C) summer temperatures, and heatwave conditions (30 °C) and their physiological responses were assessed based on cellular stress response biomarkers (heat shock protein 70 kDa, ubiquitin, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation) and phenotypic measures (histopathology, condition and mortality). Life-stage vulnerability can be ranked as larvae > adults > juveniles, based on mortality, tissue pathology and the capacity to employ cellular stress responses, reflecting the different environmental niches of each life stage. While larvae lacked acclimation capacity, which resulted in damage to tissues and elevated mortality, juveniles coped well with elevated temperature. The rapid induction of cytoprotective proteins maintained the integrity of vital organs in juveniles, suggesting adaptive phenotypic plasticity in coastal and estuarine waters. Adults displayed lower plasticity to heatwaves as they transition to deeper habitats for maturation, showing tissue damage in brain, liver and muscle. Life cycle closure of sea breams in coastal habitats will therefore be determined by larval and adult stages.","Madeira, Diana; Madeira, Carolina; Costa, Pedro M; Vinagre, Catarina; Pörtner, Hans-Otto; Diniz, Mário S",Mar Environ Res,40,7

It is still debated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a higher risk for developing COVID-19 or its complications. AIM: To assess geographical distribution of IBD patients at the highest risk and correlate these data with COVID-19 mortality rates in Brazil. METHODS: The Brazilian IBD Study Group (Grupo de Estudos da Doença Inflamatória Intestinal do Brasil) developed a web-based survey adapted from the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. The included categories were demographic data and inquiries related to risk factors for complications from COVID-19. Patients were categorized as highest, moderate or lowest individual risk. The Spearman correlation test was used to identify any association between highest risk and mortality rates for each state of the country. RESULTS: A total of 3568 patients (65.3% females) were included. Most participants were from the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil, and 84.1% were using immunomodulators and/or biologics. Most patients (55.1%) were at moderate risk, 23.4% were at highest risk and 21.5% were at lowest risk of COVID-19 complications. No association between the proportion of IBD patients at highest risk for COVID-19 complications and higher mortality rates was identified in different Brazilian states (r = 0.146, P = 0.467). CONCLUSION: This study indicates a distinct geographical distribution of IBD patients at highest risk for COVID-19 complications in different states of the country, which may reflect contrasting socioeconomic, educational and healthcare aspects. No association between high risk of IBD and COVID-related mortality rates was identified.","Queiroz, Natália Sousa Freitas; Teixeira, Fábio Vieira; Motta, Marina Pamponet; Chebli, Liliana Andrade; Hino, Adriano Akira Ferreira; Martins, Camilla de Almeida; Quaresma, Abel Botelho; da Silva, Alexandre Augusto de Paula; Damião, Adérson Omar Mourão Cintra; Saad-Hossne, Rogerio; Kotze, Paulo Gustavo",World J Gastroenterol,40,1

We find that the mitotic centrosome, a structure that assembles the mitotic spindle [1], is notably large in the zebrafish embryo (246.44 ± 11.93 µm2 in a 126.86 ± 0.35 µm diameter cell) compared to a C. elegans embryo (5.78 ± 0.18 µm2 in a 55.83 ± 1.04 µm diameter cell). During embryonic cell divisions, cell size changes rapidly in both C. elegans and zebrafish [2, 3], where mitotic centrosome area scales more closely with changes in cell size compared to changes in spindle length. Embryonic zebrafish spindles contain asymmetrically sized mitotic centrosomes (2.14 ± 0.13-fold difference between the two), with the larger mitotic centrosome placed toward the embryo center in a polo-like kinase (PLK) 1- and PLK4-dependent manner.

Mental illness and associated medication use has been proven to have a negative effect on bone health and fracture healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collated data retrospectively from the records of orthopaedic inpatients in a non-COVID and COVID period. We analysed demographic data, referral and admission numbers, orthopaedic injuries, surgery performed and patient comorbidities, including psychiatric history. RESULTS: There were 824 orthopaedic referrals and 358 admissions (six/day) in the non-COVID period, with 38/358 (10.6%) admissions having a psychiatric diagnosis and 30/358 (8.4%) also having a fracture. This was compared with 473 referrals and 195 admissions (three/day) in the COVID period, with 73/195 (37.4%) admissions having a documented psychiatric diagnosis and 47/195 (24.1%) having a fracture. DISCUSSION: There was a reduction in the number of admissions and referrals during the pandemic, but a simultaneous three-fold rise in admissions with a psychiatric diagnosis. The proportion of patients with both a fracture and a psychiatric diagnosis more than doubled and the number of patients presenting due to a traumatic suicide attempt almost tripled. CONCLUSION: While total numbers using the orthopaedic service decreased, the impact of the pandemic and lockdown disproportionately affects those with mental health problems, a group already at higher risk of poorer functional outcomes and non-union. It is imperative that adequate support is in place for patients with vulnerable mental health during these periods, particularly as we look towards a potential 'second wave' of COVID-19.","Hay, D; Jamal, M S; Al-Tawil, K; Petohazi, A; Gulli, V; Bednarczuk, N F; Baldwin-Smith, R; Gibbons, J; Sinha, J",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,40,26
359951,359951,359951,When should the UK lift its lockdown?,14.374084,9.492061,2021,"The paper is dedicated to a philosophical consideration of the transformation strategies for higher education, particularly those revealed by the current Covid-19 pandemic. The situation of the latter is presented as a particular form of the general VUCA characteristics of the today's world of uncertainty, unpredictability and qualitative complexity ('supercomplexity'). It is argued that the main result of our acknowledgement of the VUCA situation in the world for higher education is the image of the developed human personality becoming the main value and at the same time the main goal of higher education. Under the conditions of volatility and ambiguity, any existing 'ready-made' knowledge, as well as any instructions for effective rational behavior, turns to be inadequate. Because of that, it is no longer sufficient to have a set of 'competences' as a final result of the educational process at today's university. Higher education has to turn to developing in its graduates certain multidisciplinary qualities, like critical independent thinking and ability to create one's own knowledge, up to aiming at an all-round development of cultured personality. The paper argues that the education of critical and creative thinking is closely related to the transition to student-centered learning, as each individual student is to become a full-powered subject of the educational process according to one's own interests, abilities and curricula, with the role of a teacher starting to resemble that of a moderator, the one who is to help his or her undergraduates to navigate through the vast ocean of available information in order for them to choose and to create their own, personal knowledge. The latter task is especially enforced by the distant and online learning having become popular during the Covid-19 pandemic: that form of learning puts especially high demands on self-discipline and self-responsibility of a student's personality, while presenting itself as rather a supplement than a replacement to more traditional forms of higher education with personal communication between student and teacher.","Mielkov, Y.; Bakhov, I.; Bilyakovska, O.; Kostenko, L.; Nych, T.",Revista Tempos E Espacos Educacao,40,26

We surveyed all 18 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded PH/GPM and OM residency program directors to evaluate program and resident involvement in pandemic response activities from January 1 through June 30, 2020. Of 116 residents, 110 (95%) participated at some level in the response activities including screening/testing, contact tracing, surveillance, data analysis, incident command, provider support, reopening, direct patient care, education, and risk communication. Residents' response activities were in multiple settings, such as state, local, and federal health agencies; hospital systems; long-term care facilities; academic centers; local businesses and labor unions; Federally Qualified Health Centers; homeless shelters; and clinics. Residents' participation was facilitated by their training in public health, epidemiology, the care of patients and populations, and emergency preparedness. Programs should continue to promote these experiences and key roles that PH/GPM and OM residents can play, as this leadership is a necessity for the successful navigation of future major public health events. As the pandemic continues, evaluation of residents' experiences will help guide longer-term changes to program curriculum and partnerships. Many trainees' contributions and expertise met both educational and service goals and therefore should be integrated into ongoing pandemic response work in PH/GPM and OM programs.","Miller, Lisa A",J Public Health Manag Pract,40,24

Cytokine storm is also associated with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), a complication of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, a highly effective treatment for refractory hematological malignancies. We investigated whether COVID-19-related encephalopathy, ICANS, and other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, share clinical and investigative findings. METHODS: Narrative literature review. RESULTS: Comparisons between COVID-19-related encephalopathy and ICANS revealed several overlapping features. Clinically, these included dysexecutive syndrome, language disturbances, akinetic mutism and delirium. EEG showed a prevalence of frontal abnormalities. Brain MRI was often unrevealing. CSF elevated cytokine levels have been reported. A direct correlation between cytokine storm intensity and severity of neurological manifestations has been shown for both conditions. Clinical recovery occurred spontaneously or following immunotherapies in most of the patients. Similar clinical and investigative features were also reported in other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis, and febrile infection-associated encephalopathies. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19-related encephalopathy and ICANS are characterized by a predominant electro-clinical frontal lobe dysfunction and share several features with other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, which may represent the common denominator of a clinical spectrum of neurological disorders. Therefore, we propose a unifying definition of cytokine storm-associated encephalopathy (CySE), and its diagnostic criteria.","Pensato, Umberto; Muccioli, Lorenzo; Cani, Ilaria; Janigro, Damir; Zinzani, Pier Luigi; Guarino, Maria; Cortelli, Pietro; Bisulli, Francesca",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,40,30

A mini-review,14.460872,9.382882,2020,"Neonatal brain injury or neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a significant morbidity and mortality factor in preterm and full-term newborns. NE has an incidence in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 per 1000 live births carrying a considerable burden for neurological outcomes such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and hydrocephaly. Many scoring systems based on different risk factor combinations in regression models have been proposed to predict abnormal outcomes. Birthweight, gestational age, Apgar scores, pH, ultrasound and MRI biomarkers, seizures onset, EEG pattern, and seizure duration were the most referred predictors in the literature. Our study proposes a decision-tree approach based on clinical risk factors for abnormal outcomes in newborns with the neurological syndrome to assist in neonatal encephalopathy prognosis as a complementary tool to the acknowledged scoring systems. We retrospectively studied 188 newborns with associated encephalopathy and seizures in the perinatal period. Etiology and abnormal outcomes were assessed through correlations with the risk factors. We computed mean, median, odds ratios values for birth weight, gestational age, 1-min Apgar Score, 5-min Apgar score, seizures onset, and seizures duration monitoring, applying standard statistical methods first. Subsequently, CART (classification and regression trees) and cluster analysis were employed, further adjusting the medians. Out of 188 cases, 84 were associated to abnormal outcomes. The hierarchy on etiology frequencies was dominated by cerebrovascular impairments, metabolic anomalies, and infections. Both preterms and full-terms at risk were bundled in specific categories defined as high-risk 75-100%, intermediate risk 52.9%, and low risk 0-25% after CART algorithm implementation. Cluster analysis illustrated the median values, profiling at a glance the preterm model in high-risk groups and a full-term model in the inter-mediate-risk category. Our study illustrates that, in addition to standard statistics methodologies, decision-tree approaches could provide a first-step tool for the prognosis of the abnormal outcome in newborns with encephalopathy.","NeamÈu, Bogdan Mihai; Visa, Gabriela; Maniu, Ionela; Ognean, Maria Livia; Pérez-Elvira, Rubén; Dragomir, Andrei; Agudo, Maria; Èofariu, Ciprian Radu; Gheonea, Mihaela; Pitic, Antoniu; Brad, Remus; Matei, Claudiu; Teodoru, Minodora; Bacila, Ciprian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),40,20

Internalized EGF-receptor is either recycled or degraded, which fate is regulated in part by Ras interference 1 (RIN1). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RIN1, a Ras effector protein and Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, controls several signaling molecules leading to the modulation of the telomerase activity; thus, allowing proper cell proliferation. We report that expression of RIN1 completely blocked proliferation of MCF-12â¯A and MCF-7â¯cells, while partially inhibited proliferation of MDA-MB-231â¯cells upon EGF stimulation. Furthermore, expression of the C-terminal region of RIN1 selectively plays a critical role in the inhibition of the proliferation of MDA-MB-231â¯cells. However, this inhibitory effect was specifically affected by the independent expression of RIN1:Vsp9 and RIN1:RA domains. Additionally, endogenous level of expression of RIN1 was decreased in metastatic MDA-MB-231â¯cells as compared with non-tumorigenic MCF-12â¯A cells. We observed that expression of RIN1:R94A mutant blocked the proliferation of MDA-MB-231â¯cells, while expression of RIN1:Y561F and RIN1:R629A mutants completely reversed the inhibitory effect of RIN1:WT. Consistent with our observations, we found that expression of RIN1:WT in MDA-MB-231â¯cells diminished both protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activities while p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38â¯MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were unaffected, but it produced downregulation of cellular-myelocytomatosis (c-Myc), erythroblast transformation specific (Ets2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) activities. Inversely, expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMBG1) was inhibited whereas expression of forkhead box transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) was increased in cells expressing RIN1. Interestingly, expression of RIN1 blocked telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression, which correlated with the downregulations of c-Myc, Ets-2 and Stat3 activation. Taken together these findings indicate that RIN1 is a critical player in the modulation of the telomerase activity as well as hTERT expression in MDA-MB-231â¯cells upon EGF stimulation.","Zhang, W; Veisaga, M L; Barbieri, M A",Exp Cell Res,40,12

However, accurate predictions of new remedies, which are often enzyme inhibitors, require a clear understanding of the nature and function of the key players governing the interaction between the drug candidate and its target. Here, we propose to calculate electric fields to explicitly link structure to function in molecular dynamics simulations, a method that can easily be integrated within the rational drug discovery workflow. By projecting the electric fields onto specific bonds, we can identify the system components that are at the origin of stabilizing intermolecular interactions (covalent and non-covalent) in the active site. This helps to significantly narrow the exploration space when predicting new inhibitors. To illustrate this method, we characterize the binding of the non-covalent inhibitor X77 to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, a particularly time-sensitive drug discovery problem. With electric field calculations, we were able to identify 3 key residues (Asn-142, Met-165 and Glu-166), that have functional consequences on X77. This contrasts with the nearly 20 residues reported in previous studies as being in close contact with inhibitors in the active site of the protease. As a result, the search for new non-covalent inhibitors can now be accelerated by techniques that look to optimize the interaction between candidate molecules and these residues.","Welborn, Valerie Vaissier",,40,26

However, the clinical prognosis and molecular mechanisms of TMEM161B-AS1 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain still unknown. Here, TMEM161B-AS1 and HIF1AN were significantly lower in ESCC tissues than in normal samples, and their low expressions were both related to TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of ESCC patients. Functionally, TMEM161B-AS1 overexpression or miR-23a-3p depletion suppressed the proliferation, invasion and glycolysis as well as reduced glucose consumption and lactate production in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, TMEM161B-AS1 manipulated HIF1AN expression by competitively sponging miR-23a-3p in ESCC cells.

A virtual pharmacy simulation, MyDispense, developed by the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Monash University, enables students to practice the skills of a professional pharmacist, from novice to highly advanced, in a safe virtual environment that is web-based and highly accessible. The free online simulation allows students to undertake scenarios where patients can present with prescription or self-care requirements, and are also challenged with validation tasks requiring them to check the work of virtual colleagues for accuracy, legality, and medicine safety. COMMENTARY: This commentary describes the use of a virtual simulation, MyDispense, in enhancing didactic instruction, complementing experiential education, and the challenges of the virtual simulation to pharmacy educators. MyDispense is now deployed to 186 schools of pharmacy across 34 countries to over 25,000 students worldwide who have completed over 963,000 exercises globally. IMPLICATIONS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (aka COVID-19) pandemic presents challenges to pharmacy education requiring many educators to switch to remote online learning. Simulation programs, such as MyDispense, help to replicate aspects of pharmacy practice and can be used creatively to meet course needs. The use of MyDispense is an excellent example of pharmacy educators collaborating globally and learning from each other to improve student learning.","Mak, Vivienne; Fitzgerald, Jill; Holle, Lisa; Vordenberg, Sarah E; Kebodeaux, Clark",Curr Pharm Teach Learn,40,1

A proof of concept (PoC) and prototype are presented, demonstrating a reusable custom-made three-dimensionally (3D) printed face mask based on materials and techniques (3D imaging and 3D printing) with global availability. The individualized 3D protective face mask consists of two 3D-printed reusable polyamide composite components (a face mask and a filter membrane support) and two disposable components (a head fixation band and a filter membrane). Computer-aided design (CAD) was used to produce the reusable components of the 3D face mask based on individual facial scans, which were acquired using a new-generation smartphone with two cameras and a face scanning application. 3D modelling can easily be done by CAD designers worldwide with free download software. The disposable non-woven melt-blown filter membrane is globally available from industrial manufacturers producing FFP2/3 protective masks for painting, construction, agriculture, and the textile industry. Easily available Velcro fasteners were used as a disposable head fixation band. A cleaning and disinfection protocol is proposed. Leakage and virological testing of the reusable components of the 3D face mask, following one or several disinfection cycles, has not yet been performed and is essential prior to its use in real-life situations. This PoC should allow the reader to consider making and/or virologically testing the described custom-made 3D-printed face masks worldwide.

A developing country's perspective,14.490337,9.702167,2021,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 which causes Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of acute infection relies on RT-PCR based viral detection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal serological testing strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which provides an important indicator of prior infection and potential short-term immunity. METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of four different ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgG, Euroimmun NCP-IgG, Fortress and DIAsource) and one CLIA assay (Roche ELECSYS) were evaluated in 423 samples; 137 patients with confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 infection (true positives), and 100 pre-pandemic samples collected prior to October 2019 (true negatives). A further 186 samples were collected from healthcare staff and analysed by all five assays. RESULTS: The Fortress ELISA assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity followed by the Roche ECLIA assay. The highest overall sensitivity came from the assays that measured total antibody (IgM-IgG combined) and the three assays that performed the best (Fortress, Roche, Euroimmun IgG) all have different antigens as their target proteins which suggests that antigen target does not affect assay performance. In mildly symptomatic participants with either a negative RT-PCR or no RT-PCR performed, 16.76% had detectable antibodies suggesting previous infection. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a combined testing strategy utilising assays with different antigenic targets using the fully automated Roche ECLIA assay and confirming discordant samples with the Fortress Total Antibody ELISA assay. This study provides an important indicator of prior infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.","Heffernan, Emma; Kennedy, Lisa; Hannan, Margaret; Ramlaul, Navneet; Denieffe, Stephanie; Courtney, Garry; Watt, Alison; Hurley, John; Lynch, Maureen; Fitzgibbon, Maria C",Ann Clin Biochem,40,24

A developing country's perspective,14.136443,9.806384,2021,"Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, has become a predominant circulating variant in many countries since it first emerged in India in December 2020. Delta variant is less sensitive to serum neutralization from COVID-19 convalescent individuals or vaccine recipients, relative to Alpha strains. It was also resistant to neutralization by some anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-N-terminal domain (NTD) antibodies in clinics. Previously, we reported the discovery of nanobodies isolated from an alpaca immunized with spike protein, exhibiting ultrahigh potency against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutated variants, where a novel inhalable bispecific Nb15 protected SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 mice. Here, we found that Nb22-Fc, among our previously reported nanobodies, exhibited 8.4-fold increased neutralization potency against Delta variant with an IC50 value of 0.41 ng/ml (5.13 pM) relative to Alpha variant. Furthermore, our crystal structural analysis reveals that the binding of Nb22 on SARS-CoV-2 RBD effectively blocks the binding of RBD to ACE2 during virus infection. Furthermore, the L452R mutation in RBD of Delta variant forms an additional hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of T30 of Nb22, leading to the increased neutralization potency of Nb22 against Delta variant. Thus, Nb22 is a potential therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2, especially the highly contagious Delta variant.","Wu, Xilin; Wang, Yaxing; Cheng, Lin; Zhu, Linjing; Ma, Sen; Huang, Bilian; Xu, Shijie; Shi, Haixia; Liu, Linshuo; Nawaz, Waqas; Ye, Sheng; Wu, Zhiwei",,40,1

A compound Poisson generalized linear modeling (CPGLM), along with a Monte-Carlo method and random forest (RF) model, was employed to explore how meteorological factors affecting the COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh. Results showed that subtropical climate (mean temperature about 26.6 °C, mean relative humidity (MRH) 64%, and rainfall approximately 3 mm) enhanced COVD-19 onset. The CPGLM model revealed that every 1 mm increase in rainfall elevated by 30.99% (95% CI 77.18%, - 15.20%) COVID-19 cases, while an increase of 1 °C of diurnal temperature (TDN) declined the confirmed cases by - 14.2% (95% CI 9.73%, - 38.13%) on the lag 1 and lag 2, respectively. In addition, NRH and MRH had the highest increase (17.98% (95% CI 22.5%, 13.42%) and 19.92% (95% CI: 25.71%, 14.13%)) of COVID-19 cased in lag 4. The results of the RF model indicated that TDN and AH (absolute humidity) influence the COVID-19 cases most. In the Dhaka division, MRH is the most vital meteorological factor that affects COVID-19 deaths. This study indicates the humidity and rainfall are crucial factors affecting the COVID-19 case, which is contrary to many previous studies in other countries.

Delayed or eliminated care may place patients at risk for adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To identify opportunities for laboratory test stewardship to close potential gaps in care created by the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: The study was a retrospective time series design examining laboratory services received before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large metropolitan health system serving women and children. RESULTS: Laboratory test volumes displayed three distinct patterns: (1) a decrease during State lockdown, followed by near-complete or complete recovery, (2) no change, and (3) a persistent decrease. Tests that diagnose or monitor chronic illness recovered only partially (e.g., HbA1c initially declined 82% (2232 for April 2019 to 452 for April 2020), and there was a sustained 16% drop (28-day average 117 at 8/30/2019 to 98 at 8/30/2020) four months later. Blood lead dropped 39% (2158 for April 2019 to 1314 for April 2020) and remained 20% lower after four months. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has taken a toll on patients, practitioners, and health systems. Laboratory professionals have access to data that can provide insight into clinical practice and identify pandemic-related gaps in care. During the pandemic, the biggest patient threat is underuse, particularly among tests to manage chronic diseases and for traditionally underserved communities and people of color. A laboratory stewardship program, focused on peri-pandemic care, positions pathologists and other laboratory professionals as healthcare leaders with a commitment to appropriate, equitable, and efficient care.","Singh, Ila R; Dowlin, Michael; Chong, Thomas H; Nakamoto, Jon M; Hilborne, Lee H",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

However, there are no large population-based data evaluating potential causal associations between alcohol consumption and COVID-19. Method: We conducted a Mendelian randomization study using data from UK Biobank to explore the association between alcohol consumption and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. A total of 12,937 participants aged 50-83 who tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 16 March to 27 July 2020 (12.1% tested positive) were included in the analysis. The exposure factor was alcohol consumption. Main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 positivity and death in COVID-19 patients. We generated weighted and unweighted allele scores using three genetic variants (rs1229984, rs1260326, and rs13107325) and applied the allele scores as the instrumental variables to assess the effect of alcohol consumption on outcomes. Analyses were conducted separately for white participates with and without obesity. Results: Of the 12,937 participants, 4,496 were never or infrequent drinkers and 8,441 were frequent drinkers. (including 1,156 light drinkers, 3,795 moderate drinkers, and 3,490 heavy drinkers). Both logistic regression and Mendelian randomization analyses found no evidence that alcohol consumption was associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants either with (OR=0.963, 95%CI 0.800-1.159; q =1.000) or without obesity (OR=0.891, 95%CI 0.755-1.053; q =.319). However, frequent drinking (HR=1.565, 95%CI 1.012-2.419; q =.079), especially heavy drinking (HR=2.071, 95%CI 1.235-3.472; q =.054), was associated with higher risk of death in patients with obesity and COVID-19, but not in patients without obesity. Notably, the risk of death in frequent drinkers with obesity increased slightly with the average amount of alcohol consumed weekly (HR=1.480, 95%CI 1.059-2.069; q =.099). Conclusions: Our findings suggested alcohol consumption may had adverse effects on the progression of COVID-19 in white participants with obesity, but was not associate with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fan, Xiude; Liu, Zhengwen; Poulsen, Kyle L; Wu, Xiaoqin; Miyata, Tatsunori; Dasarathy, Srinivasan; Rotroff, Daniel M; Nagy, Laura E",,40,24

Methods: An online Emotional Regulation Questionnaire was applied, together with a survey covering the students’ beliefs about the pandemic, including information about their housing conditions and beliefs about online learning. The study included a sample of 1030 university students. Results: On the mainland and at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the students most frequently used adaptive strategies. Three of the strategies were used in both groups but to different extents (Acceptance, Positive reappraisal, Putting into perspective), while the other strategies were used in both groups to the same extent (Refocusing on planning, Positive refocusing, Rumination, Blaming others, Catastrophizing, Self-blame). Meanwhile, the results were quite similar regarding the students’ housing conditions and beliefs about the pandemic and online learning.","Mercedes Cuevas, López Inmaculada Ávalos Ruiz Emilio Jesús Lizarte Simón",Sustainability,40,1

Fever, cough, fatigue, gastrointestinal infection symptoms form the main clinical symptoms. Pregnants and newborns form a vulnerable population and urgent measures must be addressed. Studies about the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women, developing fetuses, and infants are limited. Various viral diseases can cause congenital or acquired, unilateral or bilateral hearing loss. METHODS: 37 infants whose mother was pregnant between March 2020 and December 2020 and were born after the diagnosis of COVID- 19 during pregnancy and 36 healthy infants were included in the study. Transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and contralateral suppression of OAE (CLS OAE) tests were performed on all infants. RESULTS: According to the TEOAE results of patients and controls in the silent a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups at 3 kHz and 4 kHz (p < 0.05). Contralateral suppression of OAE test results of patients and controls a statistically significant difference was found in all frequencies (p< 0.05). Suppression was much more effective at all frequencies in the normal group than patient group. This difference was found to be more significant at higher frequencies (2,3 and 4 kHz) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an insufficiency in medial olivocochlear efferent system in infants exposed to SARS-CoV-2 intrauterine. Cochlear functions should be examined in infants whose mothers had COVID-19.","Celik, Turgut; Simsek, Agit; Koca, Cigdem Firat; Aydin, Sukru; Yasar, Seyma",Am J Otolaryngol,40,13

In the present study, we examined the association between distribution frequency of ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: We undertook an ecological study to examine the association between ACE genotypes and COVID-19 mortality across 25 countries to represent different geographical regions of the world. The population frequencies of ACE genotypes were drawn from previously published reports and data on COVID-19-related mortality were extracted from 'Worldometer'. Multivariable analyses were also undertaken adjusting for age (median age), sex (percentage of females) and the number of COVID-19 tests undertaken. Associations between genotypes deletion/deletion (DD) and insertion/insertion (II) prevalence and COVID-19-related mortality (per million people per day since the first diagnosed case) were evaluated. RESULTS: The frequency of II genotype is highest in east Asian countries and lower among the European and African countries. An inverse geographical distribution frequency was noted for DD genotype. Increasing II genotype frequency was significantly associated with decreased COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.7, pâ¯=â¯0.03). However, no association was found between DD genotype frequency and COVID-19 mortality rates (adjusted IRR 4.3, 95% CI: 0.5-41.2, pâ¯=â¯0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Distribution frequency of ACE insertion/insertion (II) genotype may have a significant influence on COVID-19 mortality. This information has potential utility for resource planning at a systemic level, as well as for clinical management.","Aung, Ar K; Aitken, Tess; Teh, Bing M; Yu, Christiaan; Ofori-Asenso, Richard; Chin, Ken L; Liew, Danny",J. infect,40,29

The disruption and challenges require parents to develop strategies to cope with the current situation. One factor that may influence how parents deal with pandemic-associated stressors are experiences of parental childhood maltreatment (CM), which represent a high risk of engaging in endangered parenting. A decisive candidate for the connection between parental CM and the transgenerational transmission could be the parental ability to employ coping strategies. Mothers of a well-documented birth cohort for investigating the pathways leading to resilience or vulnerability in the transgenerational transmission of CM were imbedded in an online ?SARS-CoV-2 pandemic survey? assessing maternal ability for coping strategies and the dimension of endangered maternal parenting behavior. 91 mothers completed the online survey. To describe the maternal CM, data from a longitudinal survey were used. Our mediation analysis shows a significant positive relationship between the sum of maternal CM experiences, lack of coping strategies and endangered parenting behavior. This suggests a partial mediation of the association between CM and endangered parenting behavior as the direct effect remained significant when the maternal lack of coping strategies was included as the mediator. Parental CM is a risk factor for coping with stressful situation as well as for endangered parenting behavior. The ability to deal with stress seems to have a significant influence on the context of a possible transgenerational transmission of CM. The results underline the need to consider the unique needs of families with children and to support them as to how to overcome the current crisis.","Köhler-Dauner, Franziska Clemens Vera Hildebrand Katherina Ziegenhain Ute Fegert Jörg M.",Developmental Child Welfare,40,2

Most of the currently authorized tests return results in approximately 15 minutes Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are generally less sensitive than real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detecting the presence of viral nucleic acid However, RT-PCR can detect levels of viral nucleic acid that cannot be cultured, suggesting that the presence of viral nucleic acid does not always indicate contagiousness Proper interpretation of both antigen test results and confirmatory testing when indicated is important for accurate clinical management of patients with suspected COVID-19, or for identification of infected persons when used for screening The clinical performance of antigen diagnostic tests largely depends

Data from a national probability-based sample of the U.S. population show that highly religious individuals and evangelicals suffered less distress in March 2020. They were also less likely to see the coronavirus outbreak as a crisis and less likely to support public health restrictions to limit the spread of the virus. The conservative politicization of religion in the United States can help explain why religious Americans (and evangelicals in particular) experienced less distress and were less likely to back public health efforts to contain the virus. We conclude that religion can be a source of comfort and strength in times of crisis, but-at least in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic-it can also undercut efforts to end the root causes of suffering.","Schnabel, Landon; Schieman, Scott",,40,1

We hypothesize that patients with COVID-19 may develop a hypermetabolic state which may be a major contributing factor to the extraordinary ventilatory and oxygenation demands in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Resting energy expenditure (REE), carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured by indirect calorimetry on seven critically ill patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: The median measured REE was 4044 Kcal/day which was 235.7% ± 51.7% of predicted. The median VCO2 was 452 mL/min (range 295-582 mL/min) and the median VO2 was 585 mL/min (range 416-798 mL/min). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are in an extreme hypermetabolic state.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective search of our six obstetrical and gynecologic departmental ultrasound databases for all CSPs and recurrent CSPs between 2010 and 2019. We extracted various data, including numbers of CSPs with follow-up, numbers attempting and numbers achieving pregnancy following treatment of the CSP and numbers of recurrent CSPs, as well as details of the treatment of the original CSP. After analyzing the clinical data, we evaluated whether the mode of treatment terminating the previous CSP was associated with the risk of recurrent CSP. We also performed a PubMed search for: 'recurrent Cesarean scar pregnancy' and 'recurrent Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy'. Articles were reviewed for year of publication and extraction and analysis of the same data as those obtained from our departmental databases. RESULTS: Our database search identified 252 cases of CSP. The overall rate of clinical follow-up ranged between 71.4% and 100%, according to treatment site (mean, 90.9%). Among these, 105 were followed by another pregnancy after treatment of the previous CSP. Of these, 36 (34.3%) pregnancies were recurrent CSP, with 27 women having a single recurrence and three women having multiple recurrences, one with two, one with three and one with four. We did not find any particular single or combination treatment mode terminating the previous CSP to be associated with recurrent CSP. The literature search identified 17 articles that yielded sufficient information for us to evaluate their reported prevalence of recurrent CSP. They reported 1743 primary diagnoses of CSP, and 944 had reliable follow-up. There were data for 489 cases in which a woman attempted to conceive again, and on 327 pregnancies achieved, after treatment of a previous CSP. Of these, 67 (20.5%) were recurrent CSP. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our pooled clinical data and review of the literature, recurrent CSP is apparently more common than was previously assumed based upon mostly single case reports or series with few cases. This should be borne in mind when counseling patients undergoing treatment for CSP regarding their risk of recurrence. We found no obvious causal relationship or association between the type of treatment for the previous CSP and recurrence of CSP. Patients pregnant after treatment for a CSP should be encouraged to have an early (5-7-week) first-trimester transvaginal scan to determine the location of the gestation.

They are suitable for population-based screening in the context of studies.","Blankenfeld, Hannes; Grill, Eva; Kaduszkiewicz, Hanna; Pömsl, Josef; Kochen, Michael M.",Z. Allg.med.,40,18

Some viruses may be secreted into milk - others may be contaminants. The effect of thermal pasteurization on viruses in HM has yet to be rigorously reviewed. The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of common pasteurization techniques on viruses in HM and non-HM matrices. Databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science) were searched from inception to April 20th, 2020 for primary research articles assessing the impact of pasteurization on viral load or detection of live virus. Reviews were excluded, as were studies lacking quantitative measurements or those assessing pasteurization as a component of a larger process. Overall, of 65,131 reports identified, 109 studies were included. Pasteurization of HM at a minimum temperature of 56ºC-60ºC is effective at reducing detectable live virus. In cell culture media or plasma, coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) are highly susceptible to heating at &#8805;56ºC. Although pasteurization parameters and matrices reported vary, all viruses studied, except parvoviruses, were susceptible to thermal killing.

The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity. MethodsDouble-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 {micro}g) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects. ResultsUFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a two-phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 hours, 2.1% of the initial administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels after 24 hours. ConclusionsUFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 hours after dosing.","Harris, Hannah M.; Boyet, Katherine L.; Liu, Hao; Dwivedi, Rohini; Ashpole, Nicole M.; Tandon, Ritesh; Bidwell, Gene L.; Pomin, Vitor H.; Mitra, Dipanwata; Harrison, Kerri A.; Dahl, Eric; Gurley, Bill J.; Kotha, Arun Kumar; Chougule, Mahavir Bhupal; Sharp, Joshua S.",,40,24

Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays with high specificity and positive predictive values are needed to obtain an accurate epidemiological picture. As more data accumulate about the immune responses and the kinetics of neutralizing antibody (nAb) production in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, new applications are forecasted for serological assays such as nAb activity prediction in convalescent plasma from recovered patients. This multicenter study, involving six hospital centres, determined the baseline clinical performances, reproducibility and nAb level correlations of ten commercially available immunoassays. In addition, three lateral flow chromatography assays were evaluated as these devices can be used in logistically challenged area. All assays were evaluated using the same patient panels in duplicate thus enabling accurate comparison of the tests. Seven immunoassays examined in this study were shown to have excellent specificity (98 to 100%) and good to excellent positive predictive values (82 to 100%) when used in a low (5%) seroprevalence setting. We observed sensitivity values as low as 74% and as high as 95% at &#8805;15 days post symptom onset. The determination of optimized cut-off values through ROC curves analyses had a significant impact on the diagnostic resolution of several enzyme immunoassays by increasing the sensitivity significantly without a large trade-off in specificity. We found that Spike-based immunoassays seems to be better correlates of nAb activity. Finally, the results reported here will add up to the general knowledge of the inter-laboratory reproducibility of clinical performance parameters of immunoassays and provide new evidence about nAb activity prediction.","Therrien, C; Serhir, B; Bélanger-Collard, M; Skrzypczak, J; Shank, D K; Renaud, C; Girouard, J; Loungnarath, V; Carrier, M; Brochu, G; Tourangeau, F; Gilfix, B; Piche, A; Bazin, R; Guérin, R; Lavoie, M; Martel-Laferrière, V; Fortin, C; Benoit, A; Marcoux, D; Gauthier, N; Laumaea, A M; Gasser, R; Finzi, A; Roger, M",J. clin. microbiol,40,16

The market for these devices has since expanded considerably. This evaluation of IRT performance may have significant implications for febrility screening worldwide. AIM: Perform controlled nonhuman trials of IRT devices to identify and quantify deviations in the human temperature range. APPROACH: We compared IRT readings of a temperature-controlled non-human subject with one FDA-cleared IRT and one FDA-cleared handheld NCIT. In individual trials for each device, the subject was measured between 35°C and 40°C at 0.25°C increments. RESULTS: The IRT device measurements were consistently normalized around the human mean (â¼37 ° C). Temperatures were decremented as they approached the febrile range, and systematically reported as normal across all seven devices. This effect does not appear to be explained by a fixed offset or any known approach to estimating body temperature, or by random error. CONCLUSION: The IRTs in this study generated human temperature measurements that were systematically biased to the mean human temperature. Given that these devices are utilized for sentinel detection of possible infectious disease transmission, and are now globally employed, the implications for reduced detection of febrility are a widespread false sense of security. This vulnerability must be considered with respect to facility access control, clinical applications, and travel screening in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response.","Healy, Conor; Segal, Zachary; Hinnerichs, Chris; Ace, Ethan; Ward, Derek; Honovich, John",J. biomed. opt.

Some aspects of this expanded repertoire of platelet function are mediated via expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns. Activation of these receptors is crucial for orchestrating and sustaining the inflammatory response to both types of danger signals. The TLR family consists of 10 known receptors, and there is at least some evidence that each of these are expressed on or within human platelets. This review presents the literature on TLR-mediated platelet activation for each of these receptors, and the existing understanding of platelet-TLR immune modulation. This review also highlights unresolved methodological issues that potentially contribute to some of the discrepancies within the literature, and we also suggest several recommendations to overcome these issues. Current understanding of TLR-mediated platelet responses in influenza, sepsis, transfusion-related injury and cardiovascular disease are discussed, and key outstanding research questions are highlighted. In summary, we provide a resource-a ""researcher's toolkit""-for undertaking further research in the field of platelet-TLR biology.","Hally, Kathryn; Fauteux-Daniel, Sebastien; Hamzeh-Cognasse, Hind; Larsen, Peter; Cognasse, Fabrice",,40,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 294 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary referral pandemic center. The study cohort was grouped into tertiles based on the initial PNI values as T1, T2, and T3. The PNI was calculated for each case and the prognostic value of this index was compared to CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores in predicting in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Patients stratified into the T1 tertile had a lower lymphocyte count, serum albumin level, and PNI values. In a multivariate analysis, the PNI (OR: 0.688,%95CI: 0.586-0.808, p < 0.001) was an independent predictor for all-cause in-hospital death. After adjusting for confounding independent parameters, patients included in the T1 tertile were found to have 11.2 times higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared to the T3 group, which was presumed as the reference group. In addition, we found that the area under curve (AUC) value of PNI was significantly elevated than that of serum albumin level and total lymphocyte counts alone. [(AUC):0.79 vs AUC:0.75 vs AUC:0.69; respectively). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNI is independently related with in-hospital mortality in patient with COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk factors.

There is a paucity of evidence on the causative pathways for this trend, but expert opinions, commentaries, and some reviews offer theoretical underpinnings. METHODS: In this rapid review, we collate the available published evidence, expert opinions, commentaries, and reviews on the unintended pathways between COVID-19 public health responses and increasing illicit drug overdoses. Using tenets of thematic analyses and grounded theory, we also offer a visual conceptual framework for these unintended pathways. RESULTS: Our framework focuses on five particular public health responses, namely social isolation/physical distancing/quarantine; staff/resource reallocations and reductions; closures of businesses and other places of employment; border closures and transportation restrictions; and the early release of people from prisons. As argued in the literature reviewed here, these public health responses have unintentionally created increased overdose risks by producing high risk use scenarios; increased risks of relapsing; disrupted addictions services and treatment; an increasingly toxic supply of drugs; and the risk of using with lowered tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Health care systems should respond to these pathways to mitigate the unintended consequences. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may represent an opportunity to enact proactive, progressive, and innovative solutions to an overdose crisis that will surely outlast the current pandemic.","Nguyen, Tribesty; Buxton, Jane A",Int J Drug Policy,40,30

We investigated the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection among young adults seropositive for a previous infection. METHODS: This analysis was performed as part of the prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines study (CHARM). CHARM included predominantly male US Marine recruits, aged 18-20 years, following a 2-week unsupervised quarantine at home. After the home quarantine period, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised 2-week quarantine facility (college campus or hotel), participants were enrolled and were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a dilution of 1:150 or more on receptor-binding domain and full-length spike protein ELISA. Participants also completed a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, risk factors, reporting of 14 specific COVID-19-related symptoms or any other unspecified symptom, and brief medical history. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at weeks 0, 1, and 2 of quarantine and participants completed a follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about the same COVID-19-related symptoms since the last study visit. Participants were excluded at this stage if they had a positive PCR test during quarantine. Participants who had three negative swab PCR results during quarantine and a baseline serum serology test at the beginning of the supervised quarantine that identified them as seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 then went on to basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot-Parris Island. Three PCR tests were done at weeks 2, 4, and 6 in both seropositive and seronegative groups, along with the follow-up symptom questionnaire and baseline neutralising antibody titres on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants (prospective study period). FINDINGS: Between May 11, 2020, and Nov 2, 2020, we enrolled 3249 participants, of whom 3168 (98%) continued into the 2-week quarantine period. 3076 (95%) participants, 2825 (92%) of whom were men, were then followed up during the prospective study period after quarantine for 6 weeks. Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the 6-week follow-up (1·1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1079 (48%) of 2247 seronegative participants tested positive (6·2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0·18 (95% CI 0·11-0·28; p<0·001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was more likely with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres than in those with higher baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres (hazard ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·32-0·65]; p<0·001). Infected seropositive participants had viral loads that were about 10-times lower than those of infected seronegative participants (ORF1ab gene cycle threshold difference 3·95 [95% CI 1·23-6·67]; p=0·004). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralising titres were detected in 45 (83%) of 54 uninfected and in six (32%) of 19 infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings might be relevant for optimisation of mass vaccination strategies.

CSP has been shown to induce robust CD8+ T cell responses that are capable of eliminating developing parasites in hepatocytes resulting in protective immunity. In this study, we characterised the importance of the immunodominant CSP-derived epitope, SYIPSAEKI, of Plasmodium berghei in both sporozoite- and vaccine-induced protection in murine infection models. In BALB/c mice, where SYIPSAEKI is efficiently presented in the context of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule H-2-Kd, we established that epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses contribute to parasite killing following sporozoite immunisation. Yet, sterile protection was achieved in the absence of this epitope substantiating the concept that other antigens can be sufficient for parasite-induced protective immunity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SYIPSAEKI-specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited by viral-vectored CSP-expressing vaccines effectively targeted parasites in hepatocytes. The resulting sterile protection strictly relied on the expression of SYIPSAEKI. In C57BL/6 mice, which are unable to present the immunodominant epitope, CSP-based vaccines did not confer complete protection, despite the induction of high levels of CSP-specific antibodies. These findings underscore the significance of CSP in protection against malaria pre-erythrocytic stages and demonstrate that a significant proportion of the protection against the parasite is mediated by CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant CSP-derived epitope.","Gibbins, Matthew P; Müller, Katja; Glover, Maya; Liu, Jasmine; Putrianti, Elyzana D; Bauza, Karolis; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Matuschewski, Kai; Silvie, Olivier; Hafalla, Julius Clemence R",Infect. immun,40,16

SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins, among which spike protein has always been a main target for new vaccine studies. This in silico study aimed to investigate some physicochemical, functional, immunological, and structural features of spike protein using several bioinformatics tools. Method: We retrieved all SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from different countries registered in NCBI GenBank. CLC Sequence Viewer was employed to translate and align the sequences, and several programs were utilized to predict B-cell epitopes. Modification sites such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and disulfide bonds were defined. Secondary and tertiary structures of all sequences were further computed. Results: Some mutations were determined, where only one (D614G) had a high prevalence. The mutations did not impact the B-cell and physicochemical properties of the spike protein. Seven disulfide bonds were specified and also predicted in several N-link glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. The results also indicated that spike protein is a non-allergen. Conclusion: In summary, our findings provided a deep understanding of spike protein, which can be valuable for future studies on SARS-CoV-2 infections and design of new vaccines.","Ebrahim-Saraie, Hadi Sedigh; Dehghani, Behzad; Mojtahedi, Ali; Shenagari, Mohammad; Hasannejad-Bibalan, Meysam",Ethiop J Health Sci,40,14

We aimed to evaluate the effect of ferric carboxymaltose, compared with placebo, on outcomes in patients who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure. METHODS: AFFIRM-AHF was a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial done at 121 sites in Europe, South America, and Singapore. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, were hospitalised for acute heart failure with concomitant iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <100 µg/L, or 100-299 µg/L with transferrin saturation <20%), and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%. Before hospital discharge, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo for up to 24 weeks, dosed according to the extent of iron deficiency. To maintain masking of patients and study personnel, treatments were administered in black syringes by personnel not involved in any study assessments. The primary outcome was a composite of total hospitalisations for heart failure and cardiovascular death up to 52 weeks after randomisation, analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one post-randomisation data point. Secondary outcomes were the composite of total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular death; cardiovascular death; total heart failure hospitalisations; time to first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death; and days lost due to heart failure hospitalisations or cardiovascular death, all evaluated up to 52 weeks after randomisation. Safety was assessed in all patients for whom study treatment was started. A pre-COVID-19 sensitivity analysis on the primary and secondary outcomes was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02937454, and has now been completed. FINDINGS: Between March 21, 2017, and July 30, 2019, 1525 patients were screened, of whom 1132 patients were randomly assigned to study groups. Study treatment was started in 1110 patients, and 1108 (558 in the carboxymaltose group and 550 in the placebo group) had at least one post-randomisation value. 293 primary events (57·2 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 372 (72·5 per 100 patient-years) occurred in the placebo group (rate ratio [RR] 0·79, 95% CI 0·62-1·01, p=0·059). 370 total cardiovascular hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 451 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·64-1·00, p=0·050). There was no difference in cardiovascular death between the two groups (77 [14%] of 558 in the ferric carboxymaltose group vs 78 [14%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·96, 95% CI 0·70-1·32, p=0·81). 217 total heart failure hospitalisations occurred in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 294 occurred in the placebo group (RR 0·74; 95% CI 0·58-0·94, p=0·013). The composite of first heart failure hospitalisation or cardiovascular death occurred in 181 (32%) patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 209 (38%) in the placebo group (HR 0·80, 95% CI 0·66-0·98, p=0·030). Fewer days were lost due to heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular death for patients assigned to ferric carboxymaltose compared with placebo (369 days per 100 patient-years vs 548 days per 100 patient-years; RR 0·67, 95% CI 0·47-0·97, p=0·035). Serious adverse events occurred in 250 (45%) of 559 patients in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 282 (51%) of 551 patients in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: In patients with iron deficiency, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 50%, and who were stabilised after an episode of acute heart failure, treatment with ferric carboxymaltose was safe and reduced the risk of heart failure hospitalisations, with no apparent effect on the risk of cardiovascular death.

Methods: Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Enze Hospital from January 17, 2020 to February 15, 2020 were included. The evolving characteristics of CT manifestations and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: Twenty-two patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Clinical symptoms at the time of onset included fever (n=19) and cough (n=8). The first CT findings mainly included ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (n=18), lung consolidation (n=7), interlobular septal thickening (n=5), and fibrosis-like stripes (n=4). Dynamic CT showed GGOs, lung consolidation, and fibrosis-like stripes, all of which demonstrated a trend that initially increased in number, and then gradually decreased in number or disappeared. According to the characteristics of CT evolution. COVID-19 could be divided into early stage, progressing stage, recovery stage, and dissipation stage. The median times of the respective stages were: early stage - 3 days (1-8 days) after disease onset, progressing stage - 7 days (4-17 days) after onset, recovery stage - 10 days (8-14 days) after onset, and dissipation stage - 19.5 days (11-25 days) after onset. Conclusions: COVID-19 has an acute onset, with main imaging manifestations of different types of GGO with or without lung consolidation in the subpleural regions of the bilateral lungs. The CT manifestations of lung lesions change rapidly. The lung lesions of mild and ordinary types of COVID-19 may improve significantly or disappear in a short period after active treatment, with good prognosis. Moreover, fibrosislike stripes may be a sign of atelectasis of sub-segment lung tissue of COVID-19 and may be a specific sign for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Kong, Min; Yang, Hai; Li, Xiaodong; Shen, Jianfei; Xu, Xinjian; Lv, Dongqing",J.

Anecdotal evidence has described atypical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in older adults; however, the frequency of and outcomes associated with delirium in older ED patients with COVID-19 infection have not been well described. Objective: To determine how frequently older adults with COVID-19 present to the ED with delirium and their associated hospital outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter cohort study was conducted at 7 sites in the US. Participants included consecutive older adults with COVID-19 presenting to the ED on or after March 13, 2020. Exposure: COVID-19 was diagnosed by positive nasal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (99% of cases) or classic radiological findings (1% of cases). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was delirium as identified from the medical record according to a validated record review approach. Results: A total of 817 older patients with COVID-19 were included, of whom 386 (47%) were male, 493 (62%) were White, 215 (27%) were Black, and 54 (7%) were Hispanic or Latinx. The mean (SD) age of patients was 77.7 (8.2) years. Of included patients, 226 (28%) had delirium at presentation, and delirium was the sixth most common of all presenting symptoms and signs. Among the patients with delirium, 37 (16%) had delirium as a primary symptom and 84 (37%) had no typical COVID-19 symptoms or signs, such as fever or shortness of breath. Factors associated with delirium were age older than 75 years (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.17-1.95), living in a nursing home or assisted living (aRR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.98-1.55), prior use of psychoactive medication (aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.11-1.81), vision impairment (aRR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.54-2.54), hearing impairment (aRR, 1.10; 95% CI 0.78-1.55), stroke (aRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.15-1.88), and Parkinson disease (aRR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.30-2.58). Delirium was associated with intensive care unit stay (aRR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.30-2.15) and death (aRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.55). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 817 older adults with COVID-19 presenting to US emergency departments, delirium was common and often was seen without other typical symptoms or signs. In addition, delirium was associated with poor hospital outcomes and death. These findings suggest the clinical importance of including delirium on checklists of presenting signs and symptoms of COVID-19 that guide screening, testing, and evaluation.","Kennedy, Maura; Helfand, Benjamin K I; Gou, Ray Yun; Gartaganis, Sarah L; Webb, Margaret; Moccia, J Michelle; Bruursema, Stacey N; Dokic, Belinda; McCulloch, Brigid; Ring, Hope; Margolin, Justin D; Zhang, Ellen; Anderson, Robert; Babine, Rhonda L; Hshieh, Tammy; Wong, Ambrose H; Taylor, R Andrew; Davenport, Kathleen; Teresi, Brittni; Fong, Tamara G; Inouye, Sharon K",JAMA Netw Open,40,16

This is especially true for products of early region three (E3), which have provided the foundation for understanding many new mechanisms regulating intracellular trafficking of host cell proteins involved in the host immune response. Cholesterol homeostasis is vital for proper cellular physiology, and disturbances in cholesterol balance are increasingly recognized as important factors in human disease. Despite its central role in numerous aspects of cellular functions, the mechanisms responsible for delivery of dietary cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum, where the lipid metabolic and regulatory machinery reside, remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe a novel intracellular pathway for cholesterol trafficking that has been co-opted by an adenovirus E3 gene product. We describe what is known about the molecular regulation of this pathway, how it might benefit viral replication, and its potential involvement in normal cell physiology. Finally, we make a case that adenovirus has co-opted a cellular pathway that may be dysregulated in various human diseases.","Carlin, Cathleen; Manor, Danny",,40,16

The older age, the severity of COVID-19 infection, the ethnicity, and the history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are the risk factor for AKI in COVID-19 patients. Of them, inflammation may be a key player in the pathogenesis of AKI in patients with COVID-19. It is highly possible that SARS-COV-2 infection may trigger the activation of multiple inflammatory pathways including angiotensin II, cytokine storm such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), TGF-ß signaling, complement activation, and lung-kidney crosstalk to cause AKI. Thus, treatments by targeting these inflammatory molecules and pathways with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 (Tocilizumab), C3 inhibitor AMY-101, anti-C5 antibody, anti-TGF-ß OT-101, and the use of CRRT in critically ill patients may represent as novel and specific therapies for AKI in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Junzhe; Wang, Wenbiao; Tang, Ying; Huang, Xiao-Ru; Yu, Xueqing; Lan, Hui-Yao",Int J Biol Sci,40,9

However, complications do occur and may be very severe, such as intravascular injection (with occasional residual tissue loss, visual and neurological sequelae) and late nodularity and swelling. Methods to lessen the likelihood of complications have been the subject of much recent literature. Depth of injection has been identified as a key safety consideration. PATIENTS/METHODS: The role of injection of facial filler into the muscular layer of the face is explored in this article. Literature was explored using available search facilities to study the role of injections in or around this layer in the production of significant adverse reactions. RESULTS: A body of literature seems to suggest that injection into mimetic musculature of the face especially the musculature in the periorbital and perioral regions is prone to adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Injection of agents into the perioral and periorbital mimetic muscular layer may produce, product clumping, displacement, and tendency to late nodularity and swelling. It also risks intravascular injection as compared to injection of other layers of the face. Injection into the mimetic muscles especially the sphincteric muscles should be avoided to minimize the risk of complications.","Goodman, Greg J; Al-Niaimi, Firas; McDonald, Cara; Ciconte, Antoinette; Porter, Catherine",J Cosmet Dermatol,40,9

Travel-associated cases were reported in many other countries leading to epidemic transmission. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collected samples from two groups of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. In one group, 63 serum samples were analyzed IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 35 healthy serum samples were served as controls. In the other group, 91 plasma samples were analyzed by colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA) for IgG and IgM antibodies and 35 healthy plasma samples were served as controls. Throat swab samples for nucleic acids retest were collected from 81/91 of these participant. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and IgG detection was 55/63 (87.3%). Sensitivity of the com-bined GICA IgM and IgG detection was 75/91 (82.4%). Both methods were negative for healthy controls and had a specificity of 100%. In 81 cases, the follow up throat swab samples were retested by RT-PCR, showing that 42 cases were positive. The sensitivity was 51.9% (42/81). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for IgG (AUC(IgG)) was 0.934. The area under the ROC curve for IgM (AUC(IgM)) was 0.812. The area under the ROC curve for IgG + IgM (AUC(IgG+IgM)) was 0.983. CONCLUSIONS: The serological test of SARS-CoV-2 can be used as an important supplement to the existing RT-PCR test for the specific and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. AUC(IgG) > AUC(IgM) indicates that IgG has better classification performance than IgM. AUC(IgG + IgM) > AUC(IgG) indicates that the combination of IgG and IgM has better classification performance than IgG alone.","Huang, Shuang; Lin, Chenyao; Yan, Mingzhe; Li, Hongze; Liu, Ting; Michael, White; Xiang, Jie; Shen, Changxin",Clin. lab,40,1

We first use representative German business survey data to analyze the impact of the reform on German firms. Many firms with substantial US revenues or capacities in the USA intend to expand US investment in response to the reform, in particular large firms and manufacturing companies. The effects on investment in Germany are ambiguous: While some firms substitute between investment locations, others expand in both countries.

New mobility-related businesses will emerge, whereas existing ones will have to adapt to changes. There are various aspects that affect urban transport systems: in this work, we highlight how road markings, intersections, and pavement design upgradings have a key role for AVs operation. This work aims to describe how contemporary society will be influenced by Autonomous Vehicles’ spread in regard to urban transport systems. A comprehensive analysis of the expected developments within urban transport systems is hereby presented, and some crucial issues concerning benefits and drawbacks are also discussed. From our studies, it emerges that the detection performed by vehicles is mainly affected by road markings characteristics, especially at intersections. Indeed, the need for a new cross-sections type arise, since vehicles wandering phenomena will be reduced due to AVs position-keeping systems.","Severino, Alessandro Curto Salvatore Barberi Salvatore Arena Fabio Pau Giovanni",Applied Sciences,40,18

The extent of that increased risk compared to the general population and the groups most at risk have not been extensively studied. It is also not known to what extent the natural production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is protective against re-infection. Methods: A prospective observational study of health and social care workers in NHS Tayside (Scotland, UK) from May to September 2020. The Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay was used to establish seroprevalence in this cohort. Patients provided clinical information including demographics and workplace. Controls, matched for age and sex to the general Tayside population, were studied for comparison. New laboratory confirmed infections post September 2020 were recorded to determine if the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies protect against re-infection. Results: A total of 2063 health and social care workers were recruited for this study. The participants were predominantly female (81.7%) and 95.5% were white. 300 healthcare workers had a positive antibody test (14.5%). 11 out of 231 control sera tested positive (4.8%). Healthcare workers therefore had an increased likelihood of a positive test (Odds ratio 3.4 95% CI 1.85-6.16, p&lt;0.0001). Dentists, healthcare assistants and porters were the job roles most likely to test positive. Those working in front-line roles with COVID-19 patients were more likely to test positive (17.4% vs. 13.4%, p=0.02). 97.3% of patients who had previously tested positive for SARSCoV-2 by RT-PCR had positive antibodies, compared to 10.9% of individuals with a symptomatic illness who had tested negative. 18.7% of HCW had an asymptomatic infection. Anosmia was the symptom most associated with the presence of detectable antibodies. There were 38 new infections with SARS-CoV-2 in HCW who were previously antibody negative and 1 symptomatic RT-PCR positive re-infection in a HCW who had detectable antibodies 76 days prior to re-infection. The presence of antibodies was 85% protective against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.35, p=0.03). Conclusion: In this study, healthcare workers were three times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. Almost all of the infected individuals developed an antibody response and this was 85% effective in protecting against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2.","Abo-Leyah, H.; Gallant, S.; Cassidy, D.; Giam, Y.; Killick, J.; Marshall, B.; Hay, G.; Pembridge, T.; Strachan, R.; Gallant, N.; Parcell, B.; Snowden, C.; Hothersall, E.; George, J.; Furrie, E.; Chalmers, J.

In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl), glucose range (70-180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. Results: In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177 ± 45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160 ± 40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown. Conclusion: Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.","Bonora, Benedetta Maria; Boscari, Federico; Avogaro, Angelo; Bruttomesso, Daniela; Fadini, Gian Paolo",Diabetes Ther,40,1

494208,494208,494208,An almanac of pandemonium,14.252464,9.574121,2021,"Introduction: Wooden chest syndrome (WCS) is a rare and often fatal reaction to fentanyl where airways and chest wall musculature become rigid through α1-noradrenergic activation and cholinergic modulation causing ineffective ventilation.1-4 This dose-independent response is more easily diagnosed in non-ventilated patients either in the operating room or who overdose recreationally.2,4,5 In ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) it can be difficult to distinguish from poor lung compliance. We describe a case of a previously healthy male with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation who developed WCS.Case: A 47-year-old previously healthy male was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia requiring high-flow nasal cannula. On hospital day 11, he was intubated and placed on lung protective ventilation for moderate ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 192). On ventilator day (VD) 2 a fentanyl infusion was started. After 36 hours, hypoxemia improved but plateau pressures were consistently &lt;30 cm H2O necessitating a decrease to 4 cc/kg after minimizing dead space within the ventilator circuit. A trial of airway pressure release ventilation worsened hypercarbia and bronchoscopy did not reveal mucous plugging, airway collapse, or purulent secretions. Worsening lung compliance (PPlat 50 on 4 cc/kg) without change in oxygenation raised suspicion for WCS, so fentanyl was discontinued. Within one hour, plateau pressures nadired at 16 and the ventilator was changed to pressure support. The patient was successfully extubated on VD 10.Discussion: Differentiating low lung compliance in classical ARDS from disproportionately compliant hypoxemia in COVID-19-induced ARDS is an ongoing point of research in the thoracic community.6-9 The novelty of this paradigm allows potential to overlook less common, if not rare, complications such as fentanyl-induced WCS. Our patient's poor compliance despite relatively quick improvement in oxygenation countered available evidence on COVID-19 lung physiology, prompting suspicion for an alternative explanation for his poor ventilation. With descriptions of WCS limited to case reports we found that onset and severity of initial signs (contraction of the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal and laryngeal muscles2) can be masked in mechanically ventilated patients. Inadequate ventilation can be interpreted as manifestations of high airway and alveolar pressure making it difficult to differentiate it from classical ARDS and ultimately increasing ventilator use duration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of WCS in a patient with COVID-19 associated ARDS. It demonstrates that when mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients receiving fentanyl have poor lung compliance and oxygenation improves disproportionately faster than ventilation, WCS should be considered.","Judd, G.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed 148 chest CT scans of oncological patients who were referred to the Radiological Unit of Policlinico S. Marco from 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bergamo area. In parallel, we analyzed RT-PCR tests of these 148 patients. Results Among 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 17 patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (53.1%), while 15 developed severe disease (46.8%). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.9%, the mortality rate was 18.8%. We did not find any correlation between disease severity and age, sex, smoking, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Remarkably, patients who were on treatment for cancer developed a milder disease than patients who were not on treatment. Conclusions The acceptance of CT-defined diagnoses in COVID-19 high-incidence areas like Bergamo region highlighted a larger oncological population affected by COVID-19 than RT-PCR, in particular, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, because only symptomatic patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that patients actively treated for their cancer had a milder disease, in agreement with previous studies that suggested a protective role of immunosuppression.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with suspected COVID-19 who underwent chest CT and RT-PCR tests were enrolled consecutively in this retrospective study, regardless of symptoms. Imaging findings were categorized as ""typical"", ""indeterminate"", ""atypical"", or ""negative"" according to RSNA reporting language and compared to RT-PCR. ""Single, round GGO"" and ""single, peripheral GGO,"" do not fit the reporting language, were also analyzed as ""indeterminate"" patterns. RESULTS: Of the 1186 patients included in the analysis, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed in 388 patients. Of the 388 patients, CT findings were categorized as ""typical"" in 248, ""indeterminate"" in 77, and ""negative"" in 63. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ""typical"" findings were 63.9, 99.0, and 87.5% for COVID-19, respectively. In addition to the ""typical"" findings, the highest diagnostic accuracy of 92.2% was achieved when the ""single, peripheral GGO"" and ""single, round GGO"" were considered to be CT-positive. CONCLUSION: The RSNA reporting language has significant diagnostic performance for identifying COVID-19 pneumonia. CT findings that do not exactly fit the RSNA reporting language, such as ""single, round GGO"" and ""single, peripheral GGO"" improve diagnostic performance.","Özer, Halil; Kilinçer, Abidin; Uysal, Emine; Yormaz, Burcu; Cebeci, Hakan; Durmaz, Mehmet Sedat; Koplay, Mustafa",Jpn. j. radiol.

We posit that the favorable clinical outcomes following LDRT result from potent Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses that rebalance the oxidatively skewed redox states of immunological cells, driving them toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Activation of Nrf2 by ionizing radiation is highly dose dependent and conforms to the features of a biphasic (hormetic) dose-response. At the cellular and subcellular levels, hormetic doses of <1.0 Gy induce polarization shifts in the predominant population of lung macrophages, from an M1 pro-inflammatory to an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Together, the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses and the subsequent shifts to anti-inflammatory phenotypes have the capacity to suppress cytokine storms, resolve inflammation, promote tissue repair, and prevent COVID-19-related mortality. Given these mechanistic considerations-and the historical clinical success of LDRT early in the 20th century-we opine that LDRT should be regarded as safe and effective for use at almost any stage of COVID-19 infection. In theory, however, optimal life-saving potential is thought to occur when LDRT is applied prior to the cytokine storms and before the patients are placed on mechanical oxygen ventilators. The administration of LDRT either as an intervention of last resort or too early in the disease progression may be far less effective in saving the lives of ARDS patients.","Calabrese, Edward J; Kozumbo, Walter J; Kapoor, Rachna; Dhawan, Gaurav; Lara, Pedro C; Giordano, James",Radiother Oncol,40,9

Whether systemic medication for skin diseases affects the efficacy of vaccination and whether temporary interruption or extension of the dosing interval is necessary is under debate. Most immunomodulating/immunosuppressive drugs only affect vaccine-induced immune responses to a limited or moderate extent, preserving sufficient immunity in most patients. Mycophenolate mofetil, Janus kinase inhibitors, and rituximab require a more cautious approach, and judicious timing of vaccination might be appropriate in patients receiving these treatments. It should be noted that, for most drugs except methotrexate, data on the length of the interruption period to restore vaccine-induced immune responses to normal levels are either very limited or absent. In these cases, only the drug half-life can be used as a practical guideline. In most patients, systemic medication can be continued through the vaccination process, although case-by-case decisions can be considered.","Speeckaert, Reinhart; Lambert, Jo; Puig, Luis; Speeckaert, Marijn; Lapeere, Hilde; De Schepper, Sofie; van Geel, Nanja",Drugs R&amp;D (Online),40,20

It has dramatically affected daily lives, public health, and the world economy. This paper presents a segmentation and classification framework of COVID-19 images based on deep learning. Firstly, the classification process is employed to discriminate between COVID-19, non-COVID, and pneumonia by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then, the segmentation process is applied for COVID-19 and pneumonia CT images. Finally, the resulting segmented images are used to identify the infected region, whether COVID-19 or pneumonia. The proposed CNN consists of four Convolutional (Conv) layers, four batch normalization layers, and four Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). The sizes of Conv layer used filters are 8, 16, 32, and 64. Four max-pooling layers are employed with a stride of 2 and a 2 × 2 window. The classification layer comprises a Fully-Connected (FC) layer and a soft-max activation function used to take the classification decision. A novel saliency-based region detection algorithm and an active contour segmentation strategy are applied to segment COVID-19 and pneumonia CT images.

One hundred and thirty-one cases from the First Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, including 67 healthy individuals and 64 non-COVID-19 inpatients, served as the noninfected group. Approximately every 5 days, sera from 20 cases were collected and analyzed three times, using an automatic biochemical analyzer, to detect serum MMP3 concentrations. Correlation was analyzed between MMP3 and other proinflammatory cytokines. Following normality tests, differences in serum MMP3 levels between the infected and noninfected group were analyzed via SPSS (version 25.0) software, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The MMP3 concentration was 44.44 (23.46 ~ 72.12) ng/mL in the infected group and 32.42 (28.16 ~ 41.21) ng/mL in the noninfected group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (Z = -2.799, P = .005 < .05).

During the pandemic, physicians in our hospital have had to respond both to the issue of treating the patients and the increasing domestic burden associated with social disruption. The purpose of this study was to assess how much the burden on our doctors, especially female doctors, was increasing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Physicians' Career Support Committee in Sapporo Medical University conducted a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire inquired about a wide range of subjects with regard to working style and family life during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was sent to all medical/dental physicians working in Sapporo Medical University. RESULTS: A total of 266 (42.7%) physicians in our hospital responded to our questionnaire and the data for 264 data were analyzed. The total numbers of males, females, and others, including those who did not want to specify, were 178 (67.4%), 82 (31.0%), and 4 (1.5%), respectively. Among them, 62 (23.5%) and 23 (8.7%) answered that their domestic burden was slightly or markedly increased. The increase in the domestic burden showed a significant difference between genders (p = 0.04). Even after correction for background differences using multivariate analysis, being female (p<0.001), having child dependents (p<0.001), and treating COVID-19 patients (p = 0.03) were significantly related to an increased domestic burden. Regarding family style, 58.1% of the physician-fathers were from two-income families (i.e., families with both parents in employment), and they answered that their partner mainly cared for the children. In contrast, 97.3% of physician-mothers were from two-income families, and 94.6% of the physician-mothers had to take care of children by themselves. CONCLUSION: Physician-mothers are caught in a dilemma between an increased home burden and clinical duties in the hospital, with a significantly higher ratio than physician-fathers during the pandemic. As we showed, female doctors could have not continued their careers and take responsible positions in the same way as male doctors. This is a social risk in the timing of a crisis, such as a pandemic.","Nishida, Sachiyo; Nagaishi, Kanna; Motoya, Masayo; Kumagai, Ayako; Terada, Noriko; Kasuga, Ai; Kubota, Narumi; Iesato, Kotoe; Kimizuka, Motonobu; Miyajima, Satsuki; Koyama, Masayuki; Ohnishi, Hirofumi; Narimatsu, Eichi; Masumori, Naoya; Tsuchihashi, Kazufumi; Tsukamoto, Taiji; Tsuji, Yoshihisa",PLoS One,40,14

RESULTS: Among 1495 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 102 (6.8%) patients had acquired SBIs, and almost half of them (49.0%, 50/102) died during hospitalization. Compared with severe patients, critical patients had a higher chance of SBIs. Among the 159 strains of bacteria isolated from the SBIs, 136 strains (85.5%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The top three bacteria of SBIs were A. baumannii (35.8%, 57/159), K. pneumoniae (30.8%, 49/159), and S. maltophilia (6.3%, 10/159). The isolation rates of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae were 91.2 and 75.5%, respectively. Meticillin resistance was present in 100% of Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase negative staphylococci, and vancomycin resistance was not found. CONCLUSIONS: SBIs may occur in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and lead to high mortality. The incidence of SBIs was associated with the severity of illness on admission. Gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, were the main bacteria, and the resistance rates of the major isolated bacteria were generally high. This was a single-center study; thus, our results should be externally examined when applied in other institutions.","Li, Jie; Wang, Junwei; Yang, Yi; Cai, Peishan; Cao, Jingchao; Cai, Xuefeng; Zhang, Yu",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,40,5

However, there are inequalities in the procurement of vaccines particularly among US ethnic and racial minority males when compared to the rest of the US population. This study explored the reasons given by adult Mexican-origin males residing in Texas, for obtaining or not, immunizations. This was a cross-sectional, exploratory study with a sample of convenience of 401 adult males (age range 18–79) who were invited to participate in the study while waiting their turn to receive administrative services at the Mexican Consulate in Austin Texas. Data was collected in Spanish with a seven-item multiple choice questionnaire, using electronic tablets. The majority of respondents received their last vaccination longer than 5 years earlier. A higher percentage of individuals in the older age groups received a vaccine in the last year, as opposed to their younger counterparts who obtained their last immunization 3 to 5 years earlier. Among the reasons given for not getting vaccinated were lack of time or money, feared injections and side effects, insufficient information, interest or motivation. Others did not get vaccines because they perceived themselves to be healthy and did not feel sick. Findings from this study have important implications for future preventive medicine and vaccination practices that reach socially excluded groups in times of COVID-19. Recommendations are made to facilitate access to vaccines to the target group of this study and other socially disadvantaged populations in the global health context.","Snyder, V.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the tele-triage system on urgent visit volume and explore the characteristics of acute visit requests at a tertiary referral eye center. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed acute visit requests between April 6, 2020 and June 6, 2020. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, ANOVA, and bivariate logistic regression were used to compare variables with a p-value of 0.05. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-eight surveys were completed. Mean age was 49.7 ± 18.8 years (range 2–91). The majority of requests were determined as urgent (63.0%) or emergent (0.8%). Forty-nine patients had recent eye trauma (13.7%), and the most common reported symptoms were new onset eye pain (25.7%) and photophobia (22.9%). Most patients were self-referred (63.7%), though provider referral was more common in patients with symptoms of new onset lid swelling (p < 0.01), diplopia (p < 0.01), flashing lights (p = 0.02), or droopy eyelid (p < 0.01). Patients presenting with symptom onset within 48 h tended to be younger (45.8 years) versus those with symptom duration of 48 h to 1 week (49.6 years), or more than 1 week (52.6 years; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This novel tele-triage system screened out one-third of acute visit requests as non-urgent, which limited in-person visits during the initial shelter-in-place period of the pandemic. Tele-triage systems should be implemented in eye care practices for future emergency preparedness.","Scanzera, Angelica C.; Chang, Arthur Y.; Valikodath, Nita; Cole, Emily; Hallak, Joelle A.; Vajaranant, Thasarat Sutabutr; Kim, Sage J.; Chan, R.

While vaccines are available, there is a requirement for novel vaccine strategies due to high strain variation and poor cross-protection. This requires a more detailed understanding of virus-host cell interactions to identify candidates for targeted virus attenuation. One key area of research in the positive sense RNA virus field, due to its central role in virus replication, is the induction of cellular membrane rearrangements by this class of viruses for the assembly of virus replication complexes. In our recent work, we identified the structures induced by IBV during infection of cultured cells, as well as primary cells and ex vivo organ culture. We identified structures novel to the coronavirus family, which strongly resemble replication sites of other positive sense RNA viruses. We have begun to extend this work using recombinant IBVs, which are chimera of different virus strains to study the role of viral proteins in the induction of membrane rearrangements.","Maier, Helena J; Hawes, Philippa C; Keep, Sarah M; Britton, Paul",Bioengineered,40,5

The public health crisis underscores the importance of global health research partnerships and collaborations to develop and evaluate the requisite health technologies to assist in containing COVID-19, other diseases, and health-related concerns that defy national borders. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the member countries of the United Nations in September 2015, provide a framework for global development efforts including global health research. SDG3, which promotes health and well-being for the world populations across the age spectrum, highlights disease areas for special focus which can be adapted in specific global health research programs to serve local health needs. SDG17 promotes partnerships between high income (HIC) and low and middle-income countries (LMIC) for sustainable and equitable global development. However, given the wide disparities in fiscal and overall capacity for research between researchers in HIC and their counterparts in LMIC as well as the greater vulnerabilities of the LMIC communities when serving as research locations, a spotlight on the nature of such global health research partnerships in the context of the SDGs is desirable. This is to ensure that they are meaningful and mutually-beneficial partnerships which address local health concerns and promote long-term value for the communities involved. The objective of this commentary is, therefore, to provide a brief overview of the SDGs by way of context; explore the power differences at play when researchers from HIC are seeking research opportunities in LMIC; examine the social determinants of health and the disproportionate burden of global diseases carried by populations in LMIC to establish their vulnerability; discuss global research partnerships; and attempt to make a case for why community-based participatory research may be the preferred type of global health research partnership in the context of the SDGs.","Addo-Atuah, Joyce; Senhaji-Tomza, Batoul; Ray, Dipan; Basu, Paramita; Loh, Feng-Hua Ellen; Owusu-Daaku, Frances",Res Social Adm Pharm,40,28

Several drugs targeting the Ang-TIE signaling pathway in cancer patients are under clinical development. Similar to how cancer increases with age, unsuitable angiogenesis or endothelial dysfunction is often seen in other ageing-associated diseases (AADs) such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the Ang-TIE pathway is a possible molecular target for AAD therapy. In this review, we focus on the potential role of the Ang-TIE signaling pathway in AADs, especially non-cancer-related AADs. We also suggest translational insights and future clinical applications of this pathway in those AADs.","Hayashi, Shin-ichiro; Rakugi, Hiromi; Morishita, Ryuichi",Cells,40,1

Historically this was measured using plaque assays, or Culture Enhanced Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (CE-ELISA). Objectives: to develop and characterise real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to measure influenza A and B viral load in clinical samples, that offer improvements over existing methods, in particular virus infectivity assays. Study design: The dynamic range and robustness were established for the real time qPCR assays along with stability of the assay components. Cross validation of the real time PCR assays with CE-ELISA was performed by parallel testing of both serial dilutions of three different subtypes of cultured virus and a panel of influenza positive throat swab specimens. Results: the assays were specific for influenza A and B and the dynamic ranges were at least seven logs. The assay variability was within acceptable limits but increased towards the lower limit of quantification, which was 3.33 log(10) viral cDNA copies/ml of virus transport medium (ten viral RNA copies/PCR). The components of the assay were robust enough to withstand extended storage and several freeze–thaw cycles. For the real time PCR assays the limit of quantification was equivalent to the virus infectivity cut off, which equates to a 93-fold increase in sensitivity. Conclusion: Well characterised real time PCR assays offer significant improvements over the existing methods for measuring the viral load of strains of influenza A and B in clinical specimens.","Ward, C.L; Dempsey, M.H; Ring, C.J.A; Kempson, R.E; Zhang, L; Gor, D; Snowden, B.W; Tisdale, M",J Clin Virol,40,33

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a well-established intervention aimed at restoring an individual’s exercise capacity and improving their ability to complete their ADLs. Occupational therapists help individuals engage in meaningful “occupations,” improving their health and well-being. Given the concordance in the aims of PR and the occupational therapy (OT) scope of practice, occupational therapists appear to be well suited as key players in PR programs. However, the benefits of adding OT to PR programs have been sparsely reported in the literature and the role of OT in PR has never been synthesized or reported in national and international guidelines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to explore the role of OT in PR programs, the current guideline recommendations for the inclusion of OT in PR programs, the estimated prevalence of OT in PR programs, and the reported or anticipated effects of OT interventions in PR programs. METHODS: The review will be conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. A comprehensive search will be undertaken in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL (EBSCO) to identify and retrieve relevant literature published in English, French, or Portuguese. Gray literature on international OT association websites will also be identified, including position statements and guidelines relevant to PR programs. All literature published since the establishment of the effectiveness of PR for chronic respiratory disease in 1994 that explores OT in PR programs for these patients will be included. Search results will be exported to Covidence for title, abstract, and full-text screening by two independent reviewers. Data will be extracted by two independent reviewers using a pilot-tested template including the following: the number of PR programs including OT (specifically from surveys), the purpose of the study, the study design, patient characteristics, respiratory conditions included, PR components, OT role, outcomes, and results. Findings will be presented using a narrative summary, supplemented by figures and/or tables. Key themes will be displayed in an infographic or schematic. RESULTS: The study was initiated in January 2021 and registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF) in February 2021, prior to title and abstract screening. Data collection and analysis and drafting of the manuscript will occur throughout 2021, with expected publication in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this scoping review will help health care professionals improve patient care by broadening their understanding and awareness of the role of OT in PR programs. This role clarification may help to inform program development and clinical decision making and will serve to optimize the delivery of multidisciplinary care for patients in PR programs, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

In the midst of a pandemic, the main route for detection of the virus has been conducting antigen tests for rapid results, using qRT-PCR, and conducting more accurate molecular tests, using rRT-PCR, on samples from patients. Most common treatments for those infected with COVID-19 include Remdesivir, an antiviral, dexamethasone, a steroid, and rarely, monoclonal antibody treatments. Although these treatments exist and are used commonly in hospitals all around the globe, clinicians often challenge the efficacy and benefit of these remedies for the patient. Furthermore, targeted therapies largely focus on interfering with or reducing the binding of viral receptors and host cell receptors affected by the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus. In addition to treatment, the most efficacious method of preventing the spread of COVID-19 is the development of multiple vaccines that have been distributed as well as the development of multiple vaccine candidates that are proving hopeful in preventing severe symptoms of the virus. The exaggerated immune response to the virus proves to be a worrying complication due to widespread inflammation and subsequent clinical sequela. The medical and scientific community as a whole will be expected to respond with the latest in technology and research, and further studies into the pathogenesis, clinical implications, identification, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 will push society past this pandemic.","Tellez, Daniel; Dayal, Sujay; Phan, Phong; Mawley, Ajinkya; Shah, Kush; Consunji, Gabriel; Tellez, Cindy; Ruiz, Kimberly; Sabnis, Rutuja; Dayal, Surbi; Venketaraman, Vishwanath",Clin Pract,40,16

Quantitative RT-PCR showed that ScIRAK1 mRNA was primarily expressed in blood cells and posterior kidney. Seven days following infection with infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), the ScIRAK1 mRNA level was significantly higher in the blood cells of clinically symptomatic fish than in the blood cells of asymptomatic fish or control fish injected with phosphate-buffered saline. Additional experiments showed that overexpression of ScIRAK1 in the 293T cells could induce NF-κB activation.

To determine whether these loci function as gene-regulatory regions, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi; CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB) has been recently used.

Notably, Hi-C, ChIP-seq and eQTL predicted that non-coding regions located at chromosome 19q13 or chromosome 17q21 harboring single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to asthma/CF/COPD and chromosome 11p15 harboring an SNP linked to IPF interact with nearby genes and function as enhancers; however, CRISPRi indicated that the regions with rs1800469, rs2241712, rs12603332 and rs35705950, but not others, regulate the expression of nearby genes (single or multiple genes). These data indicate that CRISPRi is useful to precisely determine the roles of non-coding regions harboring lung disease-associated loci as to whether they function as gene-regulatory regions at a genomic level.","Stuart, William D; Guo, Minzhe; Fink-Baldauf, Iris M; Coleman, Alan M; Clancy, John P; Mall, Marcus A; Lim, Foong-Yen; Brewington, John J; Maeda, Yutaka",NAR Genom Bioinform,40,26

With the increasing involvement of dermatologist in management of this crisis, cutaneous symptoms gained more and more attention. In this review, we will describe cutaneous symptoms of patients of all ages in association with COVID‐19. We will focus on such disorders that are caused by direct action of SARS‐CoV‐2 on tissues, complement, and coagulation system and on nonspecific eruption of the systemic viral infection. Drug‐induced reactions are only mentioned in the differential diagnoses. Although more systematic investigations are warranted, it becomes clear that some symptoms are clinical signs of a milder COVID‐19 course, while others are a red flag for a more severe course. Knowledge of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 may help in early diagnosis, triage of patients, and risk stratification.","Wollina, Uwe; Karadağ, Ayşe Serap; Rowland‐Payne, Christopher; Chiriac, Anca; Lotti, Torello",Dermatol Ther,40,1

COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented and profound impact on the whole world, and the prevention and control of COVID-19 is a global public health challenge remains to be solved. The retrospective analysis of the large scale tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may indicate some important information of this pandemic. We selected 12400 SARS-CoV-2 tests detected in Wuhan in the first semester of 2020 and made a systematic analysis of them, in order to find some beneficial clue for the consistent prevention and control of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in suspected COVID-19 patients with real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The patients’ features including gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, and the dynamic changes of the clinical symptoms were recorded and statistically analyzed. Quantitative and qualitive statistical analysis were carried out after laboratory detection. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 33.02% in 12,400 suspected patients’ specimens in Wuhan at the first months of COVID-19 epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs might produce 4.79% (594/12400) presumptive results. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly different between gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, respectively (P < .05). The median window period from the occurrence of clinical symptom or close contact with COVID-19 patient to the first detection of positive PCR was 2 days (interquartile range, 1–4 days). The median interval time from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive to the turning negative was 14 days (interquartile range, 8–19.25 days). This study reveals the comprehensive characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from multiple perspectives, and it provides important clues and may also supply useful suggestions for future work of the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, Jingwei; Bao, Anyu; Gu, Jian; He, Xiaoyun; Wu, Zegang; Qiao, Bin; Chen, Zhen; Xiong, Liang; Zhang, Yan; Zheng, Hongyun; Li, Feng; Zhao, Zhijun; Mei, Siqing; Tong, Yongqing",Medicine (Baltimore),40,22

METHODS: Data were provided by the National Medical Center of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. These data included the clinical and epidemiological information of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were discharged on or before April 30, 2020 in Korea. We conducted comorbidity network and multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. The outcome variable was the clinical severity score (CSS), categorized as mild (oxygen treatment not needed), severe (oxygen treatment needed), or death. RESULTS: In total, 5,771 patients were included. In the fully adjusted model, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (odds ratio [OR], 2.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 5.61) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.35 to 7.52) were significantly associated with disease severity. CKD (OR, 5.35; 95% CI, 2.00 to 14.31), heart failure (HF) (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.22 to 8.15), malignancy (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.59 to 7.17), dementia (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.45 to 4.72), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.49) were associated with an increased risk of death. Asthma and hypertension showed statistically insignificant associations with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying diseases contribute differently to the severity of COVID-19. To efficiently allocate limited medical resources, underlying comorbidities should be closely monitored, particularly CKD, COPD, and HF.","Shin, Eun Kyong; Choi, Hyo Young; Hayes, Neil",Epidemiol Health,40,29

The overwhelming pathology seems to be in the upper and lower respiratory tract; however, the involvement of other organs, including the liver, has also been reported. Whether liver enzyme derangement is a common feature of COVID-19 is not known. For those patients who have concomitant liver enzyme derangement with COVID-19, the prevalence, extent, and rate of progression to liver failure is not known. In view of unclear evidence regarding this, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on liver injury in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this review was to ascertain whether liver enzyme derangement is a common feature in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, determine the relation of deranged liver enzymes with outcome or mortality in COVID-19, and determine if liver failure is a common feature of COVID-19. The PubMed and OVID Medline databases were searched systematically. Cross-sectional studies and case-control studies involving adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and having data on liver enzymes were included. Independent extraction of the data was done by two independent authors. A total of 23 articles were identified by the initial filtering search. Abstracts were reviewed and screened to shortlist studies. A full-text assessment of the shortlisted articles for eligibility criteria identified five articles. Manual searching via the LitCovid (National Library of Medicine tool) search hub produced a further two studies that were eligible. Many of the COVID-19 patients in the various studies had a varying degree of deranged liver enzymes. The degree of injury was mild in most cases; and it appears to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 infection. Severe liver injury causing significant liver damage, liver failure, or death is uncommon. The main limitations of the study were the heterogeneity of studies and incomplete data on the trajectory of liver tests during the disease course as well as the final outcomes of the patients in the studies.","Ghoda, Atit; Ghoda, Manoj",Cureus,40,1

It has previously been reported that a hydrolysate of Ge-132, 3-(trihydroxygermyl) propanoic acid (THGP), shows a modulatory effect on microbial infections, inflammation, and immune responses. However, the detailed mechanism by which THGP can modify these processes during viral infections remained unknown. Here, we show that THGP can specifically downregulate type I interferon (IFN) production in response to stimulation with a cytosolic RNA sensor RIG-I ligand 5′-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA) but not double-stranded RNA, DNA, or lipopolysaccharide. Consistently, treatment with THGP resulted in the dose-dependent suppression of type I IFN induction upon infections with influenza virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus, which are known to be mainly sensed by RIG-I. Mechanistically, THGP directly binds to the 5′-triphosphate moiety of viral RNA and competes with RIG-I-mediated recognition. Furthermore, we found that THGP can directly counteract the replication of IAV but not EMCV (encephalitismyocarditis virus), by inhibiting the interaction of viral polymerase with RNA genome. Finally, IAV RNA levels were significantly reduced in the lung tissues of THGP-treated mice when compared with untreated mice. These results suggest a possible therapeutic implication of THGP and show direct antiviral action, together with the suppressive activity of innate inflammation.","Baidya, Sunanda; Nishimoto, Yoko; Sato, Seiichi; Shimada, Yasuhiro; Sakurai, Nozomi; Nonaka, Hirotaka; Noguchi, Koki; Kido, Mizuki; Tadano, Satoshi; Ishikawa, Kozo; Li, Kai; Okubo, Aoi; Yamada, Taisho; Orba, Yasuko; Sasaki, Michihito; Sawa, Hirofumi; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Takada, Ayato; Nakamura, Takashi; Takaoka, Akinori",Viruses,40,1

Glucose-regulating medications such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and pioglitazone are known to have anti-inflammatory effects that may improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a multinational retrospective cohort study, we used the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network of 56 large healthcare organizations to examine these medications in relation to the incidence of hospital admissions, respiratory complications, and mortality within 28 days following a COVID-19 diagnosis. After matching for age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and significant comorbidities, use of GLP-1R agonists and/or pioglitazone was associated with significant reductions in hospital admissions (GLP-1R: 15.7% vs 23.5%; RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.57-0.79]; P <.001; pioglitazone: 20.0% vs 28.2%; RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.54-0.93]; P =.01). Use of GLP-1R agonists was also associated with reductions in respiratory complications (15.3% vs 24.9%; RR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.52-0.73]; P <.001) and incidence of mortality (1.9% vs 3.3%; RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.35-0.97]; P =.04). Use of DPP-4 inhibitors was associated with a reduction in respiratory complications (24.0% vs 29.2%; RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74-0.90]; P <.001), and continued use of DPP-4 inhibitors after hospitalization was associated with a decrease in mortality compared with those who discontinued use (9% vs 19%; RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.28-0.72]; P <.001). In conclusion, use of glucose-regulating medications such as GLP-1R agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, or pioglitazone may improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients with T2DM; randomized clinical trials are needed to further investigate this possibility.","Nyland, Jennifer E; Raja-Khan, Nazia T; Bettermann, Kerstin; Haouzi, Philippe A; Leslie, Douglas L; Kraschnewski, Jennifer L; Parent, Leslie J; Grigson, Patricia Sue",Diabetes,40,10

METHODS: Data of 889 patients with either newly diagnosed gynecological or breast cancer between January 2019 and December 2020 were collected. Clinical parameters including symptoms, performance status, comorbidities and referral status were compared in patients, who were newly diagnosed with cancer in the period of the first lockdown from March 2020 to April 2020 and the second lockdown from November 2020 to December 2020 and compared to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Our results showed a strong decline in newly diagnosed cancers during the lockdown periods: −45% in gynecological cancer and -52% in breast cancer compared to the same period in 2019. Compared to the analogue period of 2019, breast cancer patients reported significantly more tumor-associated symptoms (55% vs. 31%, p = 0.013) during and in between (48% vs. 32%, p = 0.022) the lockdowns. During the lockdown, periods in the group of breast cancer patients’ tumor stage varied significantly compared to 2019 (T2–T4; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Both lockdowns led to a strong decrease in newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers. Treatment delays in potentially curable disease could lead to inferior clinical outcomes, with the risk of missing the optimal treatment window.

This paper uses a unique survey data collected early on in the pandemic to measure economic deprivation among individuals. The Federal Reserve Board fielded a Survey of Household Economics and Decision-making (SHED) in April 2020. This survey is used to compile data on four indicators of economic deprivation, namely: i) Overall financial condition, ii) Loss of employment, iii) Reduction in income and iv) Inability to pay bills in full. Data on these indicators is compiled for each individual and is used in a novel way to construct a set of multidimensional deprivation indices. These indices measure the overlap of deprivations experienced by an individual. Results show that almost 25 percent of the respondents faced hardships in at least two of the four indicators.

This paper describes the incidence of emergencies in the Interventional Radiology section of the Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital and to analyze whether the presence of COVID-19 caused a decrease in the number of patients treated especially for ischemic strokes. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of 236 patients treated at the Interventional Radiology on call locatedGuard between June 1, 2019 and May 10, 2020, at the Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital. No specific results were found that indicate a decrease in the incidence of urgent procedures, especially mechanical thrombectomies in patients with ischemic strokes performed by the Interventional Radiology team since the establishment of the alarm state by COVID-19 in Cantabria. Patients' fear of contracting COVID-19 infection in the hospital environment has not led to a decrease in urgent procedures, especially for ischemic strokes.","Fernández Cacho, Luis Manuel; Cacho, Pedro Muñoz; Lope, Juan Jordá; Arriola, Rosa Ayesa",J Radiol Nurs,40,29

SUMMARY: Access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is essential, but patients face many barriers when pursuing treatment and MOUD. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has compounded the opioid crisis and worsened outcomes by introducing new barriers to MOUD access. Many strategies to ensure continued access to MOUD have been described, but the role of leveraging pharmacists during the opioid/COVID-19 syndemic to improve medication access and outcomes remains underappreciated. Pharmacists, while both qualified and capable of liberalizing access to all forms of MOUD, may have the strongest impact by increasing access to buprenorphine. Herein, we present progressive strategies to maintain and extend buprenorphine access for patients with OUD through deployment of clinical pharmacists, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which access may be further restricted. CONCLUSION: Leveraging pharmacists to extend access to MOUD, particularly buprenorphine, remains an underutilized strategy that should be implemented, particularly during the concurrent COVID-19 global pandemic.","Peckham, Alyssa M; Ball, Jennifer; Colvard, Michelle D; Dadiomov, David; Hill, Lucas G; Nichols, Stephanie D; Tallian, Kimberly; Ventricelli, Daniel J; Tran, Tran H",Am J Health Syst Pharm,40,16

At the core is an arms-race between SARS-CoV-2 antibody and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) recognition, a function of the viral protein spike. Mutations in spike impacting antibody and/or ACE2 binding are appearing worldwide, imposing the need to monitor SARS-CoV2 evolution and dynamics in the population. Determining signatures in SARS-CoV-2 that render the virus resistant to neutralizing antibodies is critical. We engineered 25 spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses containing individual and combined mutations in the spike protein, including all defining mutations in the variants of concern, to identify the effect of single and synergic amino acid substitutions in promoting immune escape. We confirmed that E484K evades antibody neutralization elicited by infection or vaccination, a capacity augmented when complemented by K417N and N501Y mutations. In silico analysis provided an explanation for E484K immune evasion. E484 frequently engages in interactions with antibodies but not with ACE2. Importantly, we identified a novel amino acid of concern, S494, which shares a similar pattern. Using the already circulating mutation S494P, we found that it reduces antibody neutralization of convalescent and post-immunization sera, particularly when combined with E484K and with mutations able to increase binding to ACE2, such as N501Y. Our analysis of synergic mutations provides a signature for hotspots for immune evasion and for targets of therapies, vaccines and diagnostics.","Alenquer, Marta; Ferreira, Filipe; Lousa, Diana; Valério, Mariana; Medina-Lopes, Mónica; Bergman, Marie-Louise; Gonçalves, Juliana; Demengeot, Jocelyne; Leite, Ricardo B.; Lilue, Jingtao; Ning, Zemin; Penha-Gonçalves, Carlos; Soares, Helena; Soares, Cláudio M.; Amorim, Maria João",PLoS Pathog,40,29

We introduce a new approach for estimating the IFR by first estimating the entire sequence of daily infections. Unlike prior approaches, we incorporate existing data on the number of daily COVID-19 tests into our estimation; knowing the test rates helps us estimate the ratio between the number of cases and the number of infections. Also unlike prior approaches, rather than determining a constant lag from studying a group of patients, we treat the lag as a random variable, whose parameters we determine empirically by fitting our infections sequence to the sequence of deaths. Our approach allows us to narrow our estimation to smaller time intervals in order to observe how the IFR changes over time. We analyze a 250 day period starting on March 1, 2020. We estimate that the IFR in the U.S. decreases from a high of $0.68\%$ down to $0.24\%$ over the course of this time period. We also provide IFR and lag estimates for Italy, Denmark, and the Netherlands, all of which also exhibit decreasing IFRs but to different degrees.","Pai, Naveen; Zhang, Sean; Harchol-Balter, Mor","1st IFIP TC 5 International Conference on Computer Science Protecting Human Society Against Epidemics, ANTICOVID 2021",40,24

METHODS: A multidisciplinary working group was formed consisting of representatives for orthopedics, epidemiology, ethics, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and intensive care medicine. Preparation for upcoming meetings consisted of reading up on literature and testing of proposed methodologies on our own waiting lists. RESULTS: A workflow based on 3 domains, that is, required resources, patient fitness, and time sensitivity of the procedure, was considered most useful. All domains function as standalones, in a specific order, and no sum score is used. The domain of required resources demands input from the surgical team, results in a categorical (yes or no) outcome, and generates a list of potential patients who can be scheduled for surgery under these particular circumstances. The (weighted) items for the domain of patient fitness are the same for every patient, are scored on a numerical scale, but are likely to change during the pandemic as more data become available. Time sensitivity of the procedure is again scored on a numerical scale and becomes increasingly important when returning to elective surgery proves to be acceptably safe. After patient selection, an augmented informed consent, screening, and testing according to local guidelines will take place. CONCLUSIONS: A workflow is proposed for patient selection aiming for the safest possible return to elective orthopedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vles, Georges F.; Ghijselings, Stijn; De Ryck, Iris; Meyfroidt, Geert; Sweeney, Nicola A.; Oosterlinck, Wouter; Casteels, Minne; Moke, Lieven",J Patient Saf,40,1

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the biochemical characteristics of the patients who urgent-start hemodialysis during the pandemic and additionally to evaluate their survival. METHOD: Patients urgent-start hemodialysis were taken during the months of August to November 2020, the admission laboratory data was recorded, including the test to determine SarsCov-2, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was applied taking in it counts variables such as sex, professional who placed the vascular access, COVID-19 test result and evaluation by nephrology in the pre-dialysis clinic. RESULTS: 92 patients were including in the analysis, 65% male, the nephrologist placed the vascular access in 54% of the patients, 71% had a negative result in the COVID-19 test and 55% had no evaluation in the pre-dialysis clinic. Among the biochemical results was found BUN 95.3mg/dl (SD 38.1), sCr 10.3mg/dl (SD 6.3), Na 130.6mg/dl (SD 7.5), K 5mmol/L (SD 1.1), Ca 7.8mg/dl (SD 1), P 6.5mg/dl (SD 3.3), uric acid 8.3mg/dl (SD 10) and PTH 279pg/ml (SD 267). As prognostic markers of infection by COVID-19, the following results were found WC 12.3k/UL (SD 9.3), hemoglobin 9.35g/dl (SD 2.5), hematocrit 28.7% (SD 9.4), platelets 291mcL (SD 137), sedimentation 75mm/hr. (SD 37), CRP 81.8mg/L (SD 113.8), interleukin-6 232-6pg/ml (SD 838.8), ferritin 1074.3mg/ml (SD 825.3), D dimer 4.3mcg/dl (SD 11.2), lactate dehydrogenase 322U/L (SD 255) and procalcitonin 6.5ng/ml (SD 16.8). When evaluating survival with the Kaplan-Meier analysis, no statistically significant difference was found when analyzing the variable presence of COVID-19 infection (Figure 2 - p: 0.89), sex (Figure 3 - p: 0.54), professional who placed vascular access (Figure 4 - p: 0.1), and the pre-dialysis evaluation (Figure 5 - p: 0.33), having a survival in general of 77% at 3 months (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: The present study found a 77% survival rate in patients with urgent-start hemodialysis. There are no other documented data in Guatemala, which is why it provides guidelines for future studies in the country. Among the variables taken, no one was found that would determine a better survival, including SarsCov-2 infection. It will be necessary to carry out more studies with greater follow-up, more patients and more centers to carry out a better analysis.","Mazariegos, Celso; Sánchez Polo, José Vicente",Nephrol Dial Transplant,40,20

National influenza surveillance systems play a critical role in detecting emerging viruses, monitoring influenza epidemics, improving public disease awareness and promoting pandemic preparedness, but vary widely across WPR countries. The aim of this study is to improve existing influenza surveillance systems by systematically comparing selected WPR influenza surveillance systems. METHODS: Three national influenza surveillance systems with different levels of development (Australia, China and Malaysia) were compared and their adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) guidance was evaluated using a structured framework previously tested in several European countries consisting of seven surveillance sub-systems, 19 comparable outcomes and five evaluation criteria. Based on the results, experts from the Asia-Pacific Alliance for the Control of Influenza (APACI) issued recommendations for the improvement of existing surveillance systems. RESULTS: Australia demonstrated the broadest scope of influenza surveillance followed by China and Malaysia. In Australia, surveillance tools covered all sub-systems. In China, surveillance did not cover non-medically attended respiratory events, primary care consultations, and excess mortality modelling. In Malaysia, surveillance consisted of primary care and hospital sentinel schemes. There were disparities between the countries across the 5 evaluation criteria, particularly regarding data granularity from health authorities, information on data representativeness, and data communication, especially the absence of publicly available influenza epidemiological reports in Malaysia. This dual approach describing the scope of surveillance and evaluating the adherence to WHO guidance enabled APACI experts to make a number of recommendations for each country that included but were not limited to introducing new surveillance tools, broadening the use of specific existing surveillance tools, collecting and sharing data on virus characteristics, developing immunization status registries, and improving public health communication. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza monitoring in Australia, China, and Malaysia could benefit from the expansion of existing surveillance sentinel schemes, the broadened use of laboratory confirmation and the introduction of excess-mortality modelling. The results from the evaluation can be used as a basis to support expert recommendations and to enhance influenza surveillance capabilities.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of interventional pulmonology (IP) fellows’ involvement in the care of COVID-19 and its impact on fellows’ clinical education, procedure skills, and postgraduation employment search. Methods: An internet-based survey was validated and distributed among IP fellows in North American fellowship training programs. Results: Of 40 eligible fellows, 38 (95%) completed the survey. A majority of fellows (76%) reported involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19. Fellows training in the Northeast United States reported involvement in the care of a higher number of patients with COVID-19 than in other regions (median, 30 [interquartile range, 20–50] vs. 10 [5–13], respectively; P < 0.01). Fifty-two percent of fellows reported redeployment outside IP during COVID-19, mostly into intensive care units. IP procedure volume decreased by 21% during COVID-19 compared with pre–COVID-19 volume. This decrease was mainly accounted for by a reduction in bronchoscopies. A majority of fellows (82%) reported retainment of outpatient clinics during COVID-19 with the transition from face-to-face to telehealth-predominant format. Continuation of academic and research activities during COVID-19 was reported by 86% and 82% of fellows, respectively. After graduation, all fellows reported having secured employment positions. Conclusion: Although IP fellows were extensively involved in the care of patients with COVID-19, most IP programs retained educational activities through the COVID-19 outbreak. The impact of the decrease in procedure volume on trainee competency would be best addressed individually within each training program. These data may assist in focusing efforts regarding the education of medical trainees during the current and future healthcare crises.","Kalchiem-Dekel, Or; Schwalk, Audra J.; Patel, Niral M.; Lin, I-Hsin; Beattie, Jason A.; Husta, Bryan C.; Chawla, Mohit; Sachdeva, Ashutosh; Akulian, Jason A.; Musani, Ali I.; Argento, A.

Using two parental DI RNAs, MIDI and MIDIΔH, a twin set of deletion mutants was generated with progressively shorter stretches of 5′ sequence colinear with the genomic RNA. All deletion mutants contained in-frame ORFs. We show that in transfected cells and after one passage the DI RNAs were detectable and that their accumulation was positively correlated with the length of 5′ sequence they contained. However, accumulation of two twin mutants, Δ2, in which sequences from nucleotide position 467 were fused to those from position 801, was undetectable. In passage 4 cells, but not in transfected or in passage 1 cells, recombination with genomic RNA led to the appearance of the parental DI RNAs. The accumulation of these parental RNAs was inversely correlated with the length of 5′ sequence on the deletion mutants and was highest in the Δ2 samples. In sharp contrast to the data reported for MHV-JHM-derived DI RNAs, we show that MHV-A59-derived mutant RNAs do not require an internal sequence domain for replication. The data suggest that coronavirus replication involves an RNA superstructure at the 5′ end of the genome or one comprising both ends of the genomic RNA. We also conclude from the recombination data that in-frame mutants with impaired replication signals are more fit than out-frame mutants with intact replication signals.","LUYTJES, WILLEM; GERRITSMA, HELEEN; SPAAN, WILLY J.M.",Virology,40,8

In this mixed-method study, surveys with 169 therapists and interviews with 17 therapists were used to determine the factors that currently influence their attitudes toward resuming traditional in-person psychotherapy in light of COVID-19. We focused on the therapists’ personal and professional characteristics to assess their plans to continue with telepsychotherapy or return to a traditional psychotherapy setting. Our findings suggest that positive attitudes toward telepsychotherapy, the lack of an effective vaccine, clients’ satisfaction with telepsychotherapy, insurance reimbursement for telepsychotherapy, and negative attitudes toward wearing masks during sessions influenced therapists’ decisions on whether or not to return to traditional in-person psychotherapy in the age of COVID-19.","Shklarski, Liat; Abrams, Allison; Bakst, Elana",J Contemp Psychother,40,19

This makes a strong case to patronize regional anaesthesia practises whenever possible. Due to various limitations of diagnostic tests available, all patients can be treated as COVID-19 positive and necessary precautions are suggested to limit the transmission. The importance of a practise advisory is to clear the mist around the dos and don'ts to ensure clarity of thoughts leading to improved safety of both patient and health care professional.

We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437. FINDINGS: We collected data for 1139 cases and 11 390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62–2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23–1·73) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77–1·15). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64–1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88–1·37). Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34–0·80). The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.

The number of COVID-19 infection has crossed 120,000 with over 3500 deaths despite a prolonged period of lockdown and restrictions in public spaces. Given the likely scale and magnitude of this pandemic, this is a modest attempt to assess its impact on the age pattern of mortality under the varying scenarios. Data and Methods Data from the Sample Registration System (SRS), covid19india.org and country-specific data from worldmeter are used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics, case fatality ratio, case fatality ratio with 14 days delay, abridged life table, years of potential life lost (YPLL), disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used. Results The case fatality ratio (CFR) with 14 days delay for India is at least twice higher (8.0) than CFR of 3.4. Considering 8% mortality rate rate and varying scenarios of community infection by 0.5%, 1% and 2%, India's life expectancy will reduce by 0.8, 1.5 and 3.0 years and potential life lost by 12.1 million, 24.3 million and 48.6 million years respectively. A community infection of 0.5% may result in DALY by 6.2 per 1000 population. Major share of PYLL and DALY is accounted for the working ages. Conclusion COVID-19 has a visible impact on mortality with loss of productive life years in working ages. The sustained effort at containing the transmission at each administrative unit is recommended to arrest mortality owing by the working ages.

Stress is a modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factor. The objectives of this study were to examine whether stress was a predictor of resilience among rural younger women and to explore whether social support mediated the relationship between acute stress and resilience and between chronic stress and resilience. The study had a cross-sectional, descriptive design. A total of 354 women were randomly recruited in the rural, southeastern United States. Survey instruments were used to collect data about acute stress, chronic stress, social support, and resilience. A structural equation model was fit to test whether social support mediated the relationship between perceived stress and resilience and between chronic stress and resilience. Chronic stress predicted family and belongingness support and all the resilience subscales: adaptability, emotion regulation, optimism, self-efficacy, and social support. Acute stress predicted the self-efficacy subscale of resilience. Family support partially mediated the relationship between chronic stress and self-efficacy. Belongingness support partially mediated the relationships between chronic stress and the social support subscale of resilience.","Abbott, Laurie S.; Graven, Lucinda J.; Schluck, Glenna; Williams, Krystal J.",Healthcare (Basel),40,16

Grey literature was also examined. There were no restrictions with regards to language, time of publication or participant demographics including gender, age and ethnicity. Study selection Both clinical and in vitro studies were included in the data search. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly identified. Study selection was carried out in two phases by two independent reviewers. The studies included fitted the following criteria: studies that hypothesised the use of mouthwashes as a form of intervention to decrease the viral load in saliva contaminated with coronavirus. Two other studies were included in this review and both were conducted in Germany, performed in vitro, which tested povidone-iodine (PVP-I) mouthwash at two different concentrations: 1% and 7%. Both studies used the same culture mediums for clean and dirty conditions, and the evaluated outcome was the viral titre of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The studies were published in 2015 and 2018. Neither study evaluated the action of this mouthwash on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data extraction and synthesis The extraction of data followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline process. Studies chosen for analysis included assessment of the following data parameters for risk of bias: cell origin and cell type used, duration of exposure, frequency of exposure, magnetic flux density of exposure, environmental background magnetic field, use of control treatment, temperature control, blinding of exposure, randomisation of exposure, measurement of cell vitality, identical methods for control and exposure groups, randomisation of data measurements and potential industry sponsorship. Results One study assessed the effect of the mouthwash on MERS-CoV and the other on both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In both studies, following 15 seconds of exposure to the mouthwash, a reduction in viral load of >99.99% was seen. There was a measurable reduction in viral titre in the samples, with one study reporting a reduction to 4.30 log10 TCID50/ml from 6.00-6.50 log10 TCID50/ml. Other mouthwashes such as hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine were not assessed in these studies. Conclusions The study concludes that PVP-I mouthwash at concentrations of 1% and 7% for 15 seconds may be effective at reducing the viral load of COVID-19 in human saliva. The level of scientific evidence, however, is low.","Elmahgoub, Fatima; Coll, Yasmine",Evid Based Dent,40,12

With the digitization of health care and the wide availability of health apps, a more diverse range of eHealth skills is required to properly use such health facilities. Existing EHL measurements focus mainly on the skill of obtaining health information (Web 1.0), whereas skills for web-based interactions (Web 2.0) and self-managing health data and applying information (Web 3.0) have not been well measured. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an EHL scale (eHLS) termed eHLS-Web3.0 comprising a comprehensive spectrum of Web 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 skills to measure EHL, and evaluate its validity and reliability along with the measurement invariance among college students. METHODS: In study 1, 421 Chinese college students (mean age 20.5, SD 1.4 years; 51.8% female) and 8 health experts (mean age 38.3, SD 5.9 years; 87.5% female) were involved to develop the eHLS-Web3.0. The scale development included three steps: item pool generation, content validation, and exploratory factor analysis. In study 2, 741 college students (mean age 21.3, SD 1.4 years; 52.2% female) were recruited from 4 Chinese cities to validate the newly developed eHLS-Web3.0. The construct validity, convergent validity, concurrent validity, internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and measurement invariance across genders, majors, and regions were examined by a series of statistical analyses, including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multigroup CFAs using SPSS and Mplus software packages. RESULTS: Based on the item pool of 374 statements collected during the conceptual development, 24 items (4-10 items per subscale) were generated and adjusted after cognitive testing and content validity examination. Through exploratory factor analysis, a 3-factor eHLS-Web3.0 was finally developed, and it included acquisition (8 items), verification (6 items), and application (10 items). In study 2, CFAs supported the construct validity of the 24-item 3D eHLS-Web3.0 (χ2244=903.076, χ2244=3.701, comparative fit index=0.924, Tucker-Lewis index=0.914, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA]=0.06, and standardized root mean residual [SRMR]=0.051). The average variance extracted (AVE) value of 0.58 and high correlation between eHLS-Web3.0 subscales and the eHealth Literacy Scale (r=0.725-0.880, P<.001) indicated the convergent validity and concurrent validity of the eHLS-Web3.0. The results also indicated satisfactory internal consistency reliability (α=.976, ρ=0.934-0.956) and test-retest reliability (r=0.858, P<.001) of the scale. Multigroup CFA demonstrated the 24-item eHLS-Web3.0 to be invariant at all configural, metric, strength, and structural levels across genders (female and male), majors (sport-related, medical, and general), and regions (Yinchuan, Kunming, Xiamen, and Beijing). CONCLUSIONS: The 24-item 3D eHLS-Web3.0 proved to be a reliable and valid measurement tool for EHL in the Web 3.0 context among Chinese college students.","Liu, Hua-Xuan; Chow, Bik-Chu; Liang, Wei; Hassel, Holger; Huang, YaJun Wendy",J Med Internet Res,40,30

This study aimed to explore the predictors or associated factors for KDTs effectiveness by evaluating the subtle changes in brain functional connectivity (FC) before and after KDTs. Segments of interictal sleep electroencephalography (EEG) were acquired before and after six months of KDTs. Analyses of FC were based on network-based statistics and graph theory, with a focus on different frequency bands. Seventeen responders and 14 non-responders were enrolled. After six months of KDTs, the responders exhibited a significant functional connectivity strength decrease compared with the non-responders; reductions in global efficiency, clustering coefficient, and nodal strength in the beta frequency band for a consecutive range of weighted proportional thresholds were observed in the responders. The alteration of betweenness centrality was significantly and positively correlated with seizure reduction rate in alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands in weighted adjacency matrices with densities of 90%. We conclude that KDTs tended to modify minor-to-moderate-intensity brain connections; the reduction of global connectivity and the increment of betweenness centrality after six months of KDTs were associated with better KD effectiveness.","Su, Ting-Yu; Hung, Pi-Lien; Chen, Chien; Lin, Ying-Jui; Peng, Syu-Jyun",Nutrients,40,21

Thus, we assessed the effect of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccine's two-dose (2D) regimen on humoral responses in immunocompromised lung transplant (LT) recipients. About 25% (18/73) of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected-LT patients generated positive spike-IgG response following 2D of vaccines, with 36% (9/25) in the Moderna cohort and only 19% (9/48) in the Pfizer cohort. 2D in LT patients elicited significantly lesser median IgGSP response (1.7 AU/mL, 95% CI: 0.6-7.5 AU/mL) compared to non-transplanted, uninfected naive subjects (14209 AU/mL, 95% CI: 11261-18836 AU/mL) (p<0.0001). In LT patients, Moderna-evoked seropositivity trend was higher by 23-fold than Pfizer. 2D COVID-19 vaccination elicits a dampened serological response in LT patients. Whether assessing other arms of host immunity combined with higher vaccine dose can better capture and elicit improved immunogenicity in this immunocompromised population warrants investigation.","Narasimhan, M.; Mahimainathan, L.; Clark, A.

Risk stratification at hospital admission is of vital importance for medical decision making and resource allocation. There is no sophisticated tool for this purpose. This study aimed to develop neural network models with predictors selected by genetic algorithms (GA). METHODS: This study was conducted in Wuhan Third Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020. Predictors were collected on day 1 of hospital admission. The primary outcome was the vital status at hospital discharge. Predictors were selected by using GA, and neural network models were built with the cross-validation method. The final neural network models were compared with conventional logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 246 patients with COVID-19 were included for analysis. The mortality rate was 17.1% (42/246). Non-survivors were significantly older (median (IQR): 69 (57, 77) vs. 55 (41, 63) years; p < 0.001), had higher high-sensitive troponin I (0.03 (0, 0.06) vs. 0 (0, 0.01) ng/L; p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (85.75 (57.39, 164.65) vs. 23.49 (10.1, 53.59) mg/L; p < 0.001), D-dimer (0.99 (0.44, 2.96) vs. 0.52 (0.26, 0.96) mg/L; p < 0.001), and α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (306.5 (268.75, 377.25) vs. 194.5 (160.75, 247.5); p < 0.001) and a lower level of lymphocyte count (0.74 (0.41, 0.96) vs. 0.98 (0.77, 1.26) × 10(9)/L; p < 0.001) than survivors. The GA identified a 9-variable (NNet1) and a 32-variable model (NNet2). The NNet1 model was parsimonious with a cost on accuracy; the NNet2 model had the maximum accuracy. NNet1 (AUC: 0.806; 95% CI [0.693–0.919]) and NNet2 (AUC: 0.922; 95% CI [0.859–0.985]) outperformed the linear regression models. CONCLUSIONS: Our study included a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Several risk factors were identified considering both clinical and statistical significance. We further developed two neural network models, with the variables selected by using GA. The model performs much better than the conventional generalized linear models.","Yu, Yuetian; Zhu, Cheng; Yang, Luyu; Dong, Hui; Wang, Ruilan; Ni, Hongying; Chen, Erzhen; Zhang, Zhongheng",PeerJ,40,17

However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to determine the mental health status and explore related factors of anxiety and depression among patients with (COVID-19). METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This is a cross-sectional descriptive survey conducted among COVID-19 patients at the Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre in Marrakech over a period of four months. We assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on admission. The significance threshold used for any data comparison test was the value of p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 103 participants were included. The average age was 44, 17 ± 17, 19 years. About 54,4% of the subjects were male. Of the 103 participants, 36.89% and 23.30% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression; respectively. The mean score of anxiety subscale and depression subscale for all patients was 6.45 ± 4.29 and 5.38 ± 4.47, respectively. The bivariate analysis showed that age (p=0, 0004; p=0, 0002), oxygen saturation level (p=0, 0003; p=0, 0059), hospital stay (p <0, 0001; p <0, 0001) and family infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p=0, 0094; p=0, 0023) were associated with anxiety and depression respectively for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, gender (p=0, 0119) was associated with depression. CONCLUSION: There is an increasing level of anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Given the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, transmission associated with air travel is based on what is known about the dynamics of transmission of other respiratory virus infections, especially those due to other coronaviruses and influenza. Our objective was to provide a rapid summary and evaluation of relevant data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard aircraft, report important policy implications, and highlight research gaps requiring urgent attention. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar, and the WHO Covid-19 database from 1 February 2020 to 27 January 2021 and included studies on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard aircraft. We assessed study quality based on five criteria and reported important findings. Results: We included 18 studies on in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2, representing 130 unique flights and two studies on wastewater from aircraft. The overall quality of reporting was low. Two wastewater studies reported PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 samples, but with relatively high Cycle threshold values ranging from 36 to 40. The definition of an index case was very heterogeneous across the studies. The proportion of contacts traced ranged from 0.68% to 100%. In total, the authors successfully traced 2800/19729 passengers, 140/180 crew members, and 8/8 medical staff. Altogether, 273 index cases were reported, with 64 secondary cases. No secondary cases were reported in three studies, each investigating one flight. The secondary attack rate among the studies that followed up >80% of the passengers and crew (including data on 10 flights) varied between 0% and 8.2%. The included studies reported on the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. Viral cultures were performed in two studies, with 10 positive results reported. Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in individuals from four flights, with the completeness of genomic similarity ranging from 81-100%. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted during aircraft travel, but the published data do not permit any conclusive assessment of the likelihood and extent. Furthermore, the quality of evidence from most published studies is low. The variation in study design and methodology restricts the comparison of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting future studies of transmission on aircrafts should be developed.","Rosca, E. C.; Heneghan, C.; Spencer, E.

However, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has not been comprehensively studied for SARS-CoV-2, and the relationship between enhancing versus neutralizing activities and antibody epitopes remains unknown. Here, we select a convalescent individual with potent IgG neutralizing activity and characterize his antibody response. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from memory B cells target four groups of five non-overlapping receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes. Antibodies to one group of these RBD epitopes mediate ADE of entry in Raji cells via an Fcγ receptor-dependent mechanism. In contrast, antibodies targeting two other distinct epitope groups neutralize SARS-CoV-2 without ADE, while antibodies against the fourth epitope group are poorly neutralizing.

However, it is not known if interhospital transport impacts COVID-19 patient’s mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). A cohort from three French University Hospitals was analysed in ICUs between 15th of March and the 15th of April 2020. Patients admitted to ICU with positive COVID-19 test and mechanically ventilated were recruited. RESULTS: Among the 133 patients included in the study, 95 (71%) were male patients and median age was 63 years old (interquartile range: 54–71). Overall ICU mortality was 11%. Mode of transport included train (48 patients), ambulance (6 patients), and plane plus helicopter (14 patients). During their ICU stay, 7 (10%) transferred patients and 8 (12%) non-transferred patients died (p = 0.71). Median SAPS II score at admission was 33 (interquartile range: 25–46) for the transferred group and 35 (27–42) for non-transferred patients (p = 0.53). SOFA score at admission was 4 (3–6) for the transferred group versus 3 (2–5) for the non-transferred group (p = 0.25). In the transferred group, median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (P/F) value in the 24 h before departure was 197 mmHg (160–250) and remained 166 mmHg (125–222) in the first 24 h post arrival (p = 0.13). During the evacuation 46 (68%) and 21 (31%) of the patients, respectively, benefited from neuromuscular blocking agents and from vasopressors. Transferred and non-transferred patients had similar rate of nosocomial infections, 37/68 (54%) versus 34/65 (52%), respectively (p = 0.80). Median length of mechanical ventilation was significantly increased in the transferred group compared to the non-transferred group, 18 days (11–24) and 14 days (8–20), respectively (p = 0.007). Finally, ICU and hospital length of stay did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In France, inter-hospital evacuation of COVID-19 ventilated ICU patients did not appear to increase mortality and therefore could be proposed to manage ICU surges in the future.","Painvin, Benoit; Messet, Hélène; Rodriguez, Maeva; Lebouvier, Thomas; Chatellier, Delphine; Soulat, Louis; Ehrmann, Stephane; Thille, Arnaud W.; Gacouin, Arnaud; Tadie, Jean-Marc",Ann Intensive Care,40,16

Clinicians spontaneously form impressions of a patient’s apparent personality yet such unstructured impressions might lead to snap judgments or unhelpful labels. Here we review the evidence-based five-factor model from psychology science for understanding personalities (OCEAN taxonomy). Openness to experience is defined as the general appreciation for a variety of experiences. Conscientiousness is the tendency to exhibit self-discipline. Extraversion is the degree of engagement with the external world. Agreeableness is the general concern for social harmony. Neuroticism is the tendency to experience negative emotions. An awareness of these five dimensions might help clinicians avoid faulty judgments from casual contact. Expert assessment of personality requires extensive training and data, thereby suggesting that clinicians should take a humble view of their own unsophisticated impressions of a patient’s personality.","Redelmeier, Donald A.; Najeeb, Umberin; Etchells, Edward E.",J Gen Intern Med,40,1

Soon after its emergence in late December 2019, it was noticed that diabetic individuals were at an increased risk of COVID-19–associated complications, ICU admissions, and mortality. Maintaining proper blood glucose levels using insulin and/or other oral antidiabetic drugs (such as Metformin) reduced the detrimental effects of COVID-19. Interestingly, in diabetic COVID-19 patients, while insulin administration was associated with adverse outcomes, Metformin treatment was correlated with a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality rates among affected individuals. Metformin was extensively studied for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral capabilities that would explain its ability to confer cardiopulmonary and vascular protection in COVID-19. Here, we describe the various possible molecular mechanisms that contribute to Metformin therapy’s beneficial effects and lay out the scientific basis of repurposing Metformin for use in COVID-19 patients.","Varghese, Elizabeth; Samuel, Samson Mathews; Liskova, Alena; Kubatka, Peter; Büsselberg, Dietrich",PLoS Pathog,40,16

Use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) helped manage diabetes effectively. Some of these disruptions may be reflected in population-scale changes to metrics of glycemic control, such as time-in-range (TIR). Methods: We examined data from 65,067 U.S.-based users of the G6 rtCGM System (Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) who had uploaded data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users associated with three counties that included the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York or with five regions designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were compared. Public data were used to associate regions with prepandemic and intrapandemic glycemic parameters, COVID-19 mortality, and median household income. Results: Compared with an 8-week prepandemic interval before stay-at-home orders (January 6, 2020, to March 1, 2020), overall mean (standard deviation) TIR improved from 59.0 (20.1)% to 61.0 (20.4)% during the early pandemic period (April 20, 2020 to June 14, 2020, P < 0.001). TIR improvements were noted in all three counties and in all five CDC-designated regions. Higher COVID-19 mortality was associated with higher proportions of individuals experiencing TIR improvements of ≥5 percentage points. Users in economically wealthier zip codes had higher pre- and intrapandemic TIR values and greater relative improvements in TIR. TIR and pandemic-related improvements in TIR varied across CDC-designated regions. Conclusions: Population-level rtCGM data may be used to monitor changes in glycemic control with temporal and geographic specificity. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with improvements in TIR, which were not evenly distributed across the United States.","van der Linden, Joost; Welsh, John B.; Hirsch, Irl B.; Garg, Satish K.",Diabetes Technol Ther,40,20

Several minimally invasive methods (coronary sinus reducer, cell therapy, laser or shockwave revascularization, and spinal cord stimulation) or non-invasive methods (external counterpulzation) have been studied. However, their routine clinical use has not been widely implemented. Surgical or endoscopic sympathectomy is feasible for permanently relieving angina, but is often contraindicated due to the extent of complications associated with it. Neuromodulation by anaesthetic blockade of the left-sided stellate ganglion (SG) has been shown to relieve angina for days or weeks. To provide a long-term anti-anginal effect, novel pharmacological (phenol-based) or radiofrequency ablation techniques have been individually used to permanently destroy sympathetic pathways. CASE SUMMARY: We describe a first-in-man use of stereotactic radiosurgical SG ablation using a linear accelerator (CyberKnife) in a heart failure patient after myocardial infarction with chronic refractory AP. Repeated anaesthetic SG blockade in this patient resulted in a significant, but only short-term, clinical improvement. The left, and subsequently the right, SG was ablated by targeted irradiation. During the 1-year follow-up, the patient remained without angina. We did not observe any clinically relevant early or late complications. Atrial fibrillation that developed 2 months after the second procedure was deemed to be associated with a natural progression of co-existing heart failure. DISCUSSION: We conclude that stereotactic radiosurgical SG ablation has the potential to become a minimally invasive and low-risk procedure to treat refractory angina patients. However, this procedure needs to be evaluated in larger patient populations.","Hudec, Miroslav; Jiravsky, Otakar; Spacek, Radim; Neuwirth, Radek; Knybel, Lukas; Sknouril, Libor; Cvek, Jakub; Miklik, Roman",Eur Heart J Case Rep,40,5

In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1. However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.","Zhang, Chengxin; Zheng, Wei; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Bell, Eric W.; Zhou, Xiaogen; Zhang, Yang",J Proteome Res,40,1

Only emergency cases and teledermatology (TD) were allowed in outpatient settings. A standardized questionnaire was developed to compare the satisfaction level of patients and their treating physicians. Our main question was whether the patients would perceive TD as a valid alternative for direct physical face-to-face consultation. Eighty-two patients and their 4 treating dermatologists from one dermatology department participated in the study (43 females, 39 males) with a mean age of 46.6 years (SD ±23.9). The reason for TD was a chronic disease in the majority (87.8%), and mainly as a follow-up (96.3%). Regarding satisfaction, almost all categories rated around 9 on a 0–10 verbal analogue scale. The same level of global satisfaction could be seen between the patients and the physicians as well as for the quality of the patient-physician relation and whether all questions could be addressed during the TC. Physicians showed significantly higher scores than patients only for the category of “length” of the consultation. Gender, age, as well as distance between the clinic and home of the patient were not influencing factors for satisfaction. Regarding the technical parameters, the evaluation was mostly comparable for patients and physicians, but overall lower than the relational satisfaction parameters, especially for image quality. Patients were significantly more motivated to continue the TD after the lockdown than their treating dermatologists. We see an interest for implementing TD in specialized centers with chronic patients coming from remote places for regular follow-ups. TD cannot replace in-person patient-physician interaction, but was helpful during the lockdown. As a result, TD might become part of dermatology training to prepare for future lockdown situations.","Fluhr, Joachim W.; Gueguen, Annie; Legoupil, Delphine; Brenaut, Emilie; Abasq, Claire; Araújo, Helena; Misery, Laurent",Dermatology,40,1

METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study comparing patients with and those without NVHAP from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a 1,300-bed urban academic medical center in St. Louis, Missouri. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-four consecutive patients with NVHAP were enrolled. A random sample of 696 control patients matched by age, sex, race, and hospital admission date were selected from a total of 5,322 potential matched control subjects. NVHAP was pathogen-negative in 98 cases (56.3%). Respiratory viruses were identified in 42 patients (24.1%), gram-negative bacteria were seen in 25 patients (14.4%), and gram-positive bacteria were identified in 20 patients (11.5%). Individuals in whom NVHAP developed were more likely to die (15.5% vs 1.6%; P < .01), to require intensive care (56.3% vs 22.8%; P < .01) or mechanical ventilation (19.0% vs 3.9%; P < 0.01), and to have a longer hospital length of stay (15.9 days [range, 9.8-26.3 days] vs 4.4 days [range, 2.9-7.3 days]; P < 0.01). This case-control study identified a strong association between hospital mortality and NVHAP, with patients who acquired NVHAP having an 8.4 times greater odds of death (95% CI, 5.6-12.5). CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of NVHAP was associated with significant increases in mortality, the use of intensive care and mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. We also found that respiratory viruses were an important cause of NVHAP. These findings suggest that efforts aimed at the successful prevention of NVHAP could improve patient outcomes and reduce health-care costs.","Micek, Scott T.; Chew, Bethany; Hampton, Nicholas; Kollef, Marin H.",Chest,40,12

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate school absenteeism among children with medically attended ARI due to common viruses. METHODS: We analyzed follow‐up surveys from children seeking care for acute respiratory illness who were enrolled in the influenza vaccine effectiveness study at Marshfield Clinic during the 2012‐2013 through 2014‐2015 influenza seasons. Archived influenza‐negative respiratory swabs were retested using multiplex RT‐PCR to detect 16 respiratory virus targets. Negative binomial and logistic regression models were used to examine the association between school absence and type of respiratory viruses; endpoints included mean days absent from school and prolonged (>2 days) absence. We examined the association between influenza vaccination and school absence among children with RT‐PCR‐confirmed influenza. RESULTS: Among 1027 children, 2295 days of school were missed due to medically attended ARIs; influenza accounted for 39% of illness episodes and 47% of days missed. Mean days absent were highest for influenza (0.96‐1.19) and lowest for coronavirus (0.62).

The aim of this study was to produce IgY specific to PDR-Ab and investigate its antibacterial effects in vitro and in vivo. IgYs specific to two PDR-Ab strains were produced by immunizing hens with formaldehyde inactivated PDR-Ab cells and isolated from yolks with a purity of 90% by water dilution, salt precipitations and ultrafiltration. IgYs showed high titers when subjected to an ELISA and inhibited the growth of PDR-Ab in a dose-dependent manner in liquid medium. Scanning electron microscopy assay showed structural modification and aggregation of PDR-Ab treated with specific IgYs. Freshly cultured PDR-Ab cells were nasally inhaled in BALB/c mice to induce acute pneumonia. The infected mice were intraperitoneally injected with specific IgYs using cefoperazone/sulbactam and dexamethasone as positive controls. The IgYs specific to PDR-Ab lowered the mortality of mice with PDR-Ab-induced acute pneumonia, decreased the level of TNF-α and IL-1β in serum and reduced inflammation in lung tissue.

We examine differences in how media institutions reported the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic in China during the pre-crisis period from 1 January 2020 to 20 January 2020 in terms of both the “vertical” or hierarchical positions of media institutions in the Chinese media ecosystem and the “horizontal” positions of media institutions’ social proximity to Wuhan in terms of geographical human traffic flows. We find that the coverage of crisis severity is negatively associated with the media’s social proximity to Wuhan, but the effect varies depending on the positional prominence of a news article and situation severity. Implications of the institutions’ differentiated reporting strategies on future public health reporting in an authoritarian context are also discussed.","Xi, Yipeng; Chen, Anfan; Ng, Aaron",PLoS One,40,16

However, effective anti-SARS vaccines or medications are currently unavailable despite being desperately needed to adequately prepare for a possible SARS outbreak. SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, and one of its components, a viral helicase, is emerging as a promising target for the development of chemical SARS inhibitors. In the following review, we describe the characterization, family classification, and kinetic movement mechanisms of the SARS coronavirus (SCV) helicase—nsP13. We also discuss the recent progress in the identification of novel chemical inhibitors of nsP13 in the context of our recent discovery of the strong inhibition of the SARS helicase by natural flavonoids, myricetin and scutellarein. These compounds will serve as important resources for the future development of anti-SARS medications.","Keum, Young-Sam; Jeong, Yong-Joo",Biochem Pharmacol,40,20

Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to measure the overall burden of the pandemic in terms of mortality. As such, excess mortality has received considerable interest since the outbreak of COVID-19 began. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends, correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, or autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be misinterpreted as excess mortality. We propose a novel approach that overcomes the named limitations and draws a more realistic picture of excess mortality. Our approach is based on an established forecasting model that is used in demography, namely, the Lee-Carter model. We illustrate our approach by using the weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our findings show evidence of considerable excess mortality during 2020 in Europe, which affects different countries, age, and sex groups heterogeneously. Our proposed model can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor excess mortality from specific causes of death.","Vanella, Patrizio; Basellini, Ugofilippo; Lange, Berit",Genus,40,25

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 April 2020. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK. PARTICIPANTS: 545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n=13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, χ(2)=21.1034, p<0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers. Further investigation of these observations is required to inform future infection control and occupational health practices.","Shields, Adrian; Faustini, Sian E; Perez-Toledo, Marisol; Jossi, Sian; Aldera, Erin; Allen, Joel D; Al-Taei, Saly; Backhouse, Claire; Bosworth, Andrew; Dunbar, Lyndsey A; Ebanks, Daniel; Emmanuel, Beena; Garvey, Mark; Gray, Joanna; Kidd, I Michael; McGinnell, Golaleh; McLoughlin, Dee E; Morley, Gabriella; O'Neill, Joanna; Papakonstantinou, Danai; Pickles, Oliver; Poxon, Charlotte; Richter, Megan; Walker, Eloise M; Wanigasooriya, Kasun; Watanabe, Yasunori; Whalley, Celina; Zielinska, Agnieszka E; Crispin, Max; Wraith, David C; Beggs, Andrew D; Cunningham, Adam F; Drayson, Mark T; Richter, Alex G",Thorax,40,16

Design: observational cohort study. Setting: large Australian metropolitan health service with established virtual health care program and remote patient monitoring capability. Participants: patients with COVID-19 living within the health service who can self-isolate safely, do not require immediate admission to an inpatient setting, have no major active comorbid illness and can be managed at home or other suitable accommodation. Main outcome measures: care escalation rates, including hospital admission. Results: between 11-29 March 2020, 162/173 (93.6%) locally diagnosed patients with COVID-19 were accepted to the virtual health care program, median age 38y (range 11-79). For the 62 patients discharged during this period the median length of stay was 8 days (range 1-17). The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per Registered Nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 times (range 1-30) during this period, with video consultations used 66.3% of the time; 132/162 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low: ambulance attendance, 5 (3%); ED attendance, 4 (2.5%); hospital admission, 3 (1.9%). There were no deaths. Conclusions: community-based virtual health care is feasible for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian context for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them including strategies supporting consumer use of health information technologies.","Hutchings, Owen; Dearing, Cassandra; Jagers, Dianna; Shaw, Miranda; Raffan, Freya; Jones, Aaron; Taggart, Richard; Sinclair, Tim; Anderson, Teresa; Ritchie, Angus G",,40,2

Here, we evaluated whether a mobile technology-based personalized epilepsy SM education intervention, PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy (PAUSE), improves SM measures such as self-efficacy, epilepsy SM behaviors, epilepsy outcome expectations, quality of life (QOL), and personal impact of epilepsy in adults with epilepsy. METHODS: Recruitment for the PAUSE study occurred from October 2015 to March 2019. Ninety-one PWE were educated using an Internet-enabled computer tablet application that downloads custom, patient-specific educational programs from Epilepsy.com. Validated self-reported questionnaires were used for outcome measures. Participants were assessed at baseline (T0), the first follow-up at completion of the PWE-paced 8–12-week SM education intervention (T1), and the second follow-up at least 3 months after the first follow-up (T2). Multiple linear regression was used to assess within-subject significant changes in outcome measures between these time points. RESULTS: The study population was diverse and included individuals with a wide variety of SM educational needs and abilities. The median time for the first follow-up assessment (T1) was approximately 4 months following the baseline (T0) and 8 months following baseline for the second follow-up assessment (T2). Participants showed significant improvement in all SM behaviors, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, QOL, and personal impact of epilepsy measures from T0 to T1. Participants who scored lower at baseline tended to show greater improvement at T1. Similarly, results showed that participant improvement was sustained in the majority of SM measures from T1 to T2. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a mobile technology-based personalized SM intervention is feasible to implement. The results provide evidence that epilepsy SM behavior and practices, QOL, outcome expectation for epilepsy treatment and management, self-efficacy, and outcome expectation and impact of epilepsy significantly improve following a personalized SM education intervention. This underscores a greater need for a pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of personalized SM education, such as PAUSE to Learn Your Epilepsy, in broader settings specifically for the unique needs of the hard-to-reach and hard-to-treat population of PWE.","Pandey, Dilip K.; Dasgupta, Raktima; Levy, Jessica; Wang, Heng; Serafini, Anna; Habibi, Mitra; Song, Woojin; Shafer, Patricia O.; Loeb, Jeffrey A.",Epilepsy Behav,40,20

We aimed to assess whether baricitinib improved pulmonary function in patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids for moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: This observational study enrolled patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2))/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) <200 mmHg] who received lopinavir/ritonavir and HCQ plus either corticosteroids (CS group, n = 50) or corticosteroids and baricitinib (BCT-CS group, n = 62). The primary end point was the change in oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (SpO(2))/FiO(2) from hospitalization to discharge. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen at discharge and 1 month later. Statistics were adjusted by the inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW). RESULTS: A greater improvement in SpO(2)/FiO(2) from hospitalization to discharge was observed in the BCT-CS vs CS group (mean differences adjusted for IPSW, 49; 95% CI: 22, 77; P < 0.001). A higher proportion of patients required supplemental oxygen both at discharge (62.0% vs 25.8%; reduction of the risk by 82%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.43; P < 0.001) and 1 month later (28.0% vs 12.9%, reduction of the risk by 69%, OR adjusted for IPSW, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.86; P = 0.024) in the CS vs BCT-CS group. CONCLUSIONS: . In patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia a combination of baricitinib with corticosteroids was associated with greater improvement in pulmonary function when compared with corticosteroids alone.

However, the viral epidemiology of RV-associated RTIs in adults has long been under-recognized. Through a sensitive molecular assay, it would be possible to have a better understanding of the epidemiology of RV-associated RTIs. Material And Methods Respiratory tract (RT) specimens from adults hospitalized due to RTIs were tested for RVs, using the multiplex PCR-based Luminex xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel assay. A total of nineteen RVs, including influenza viruses and non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) were detected. Positive rates were compared using a chi-square test. Results A total of 2292 samples from adult patients hospitalized with RTIs were screened for RVs. The overall positive rate was 22%, with 17.8% samples positive for at least one NIRV. NIRVs had a higher positive rate in non-winter seasons. As many as 12.7% (46/363) of the samples collected through broncho-alveolar lavage and 20.5% (176/859) of the samples collected in ICUs were positive for RVs. Distribution of corona virus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) demonstrated seasonal variation. Also, temperature was associated with the positive rates of specific viruses, including CoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hMPV and PIV. Conclusion Respiratory viruses, notably NIRVs, were frequently detected in adults hospitalized with RTIs. Several RVs were detected with distinctive seasonal variations. A substantial number of RVs were identified in lower RT specimens or from patients admitted to ICU, highlighting their important role in causing severe respiratory infection.","Tai, Cheng-Chun; Tsai, Cheng-Hsien; Huang, Yu-Han; Lee, Chia-Lin; Chen, Hsin-Pai; Chan, Yu-Jiun",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,40,24

DESIGN: Systematic review of COS studies published between 2015 and 2019 that included more than one patient, carer or representative as participants (hereafter referred to as patients for brevity) in scoring outcomes in a Delphi. RESULTS: There were variations in the design and conduct of COS studies that included patients in the Delphi process, including differing: scoring and feedback systems, approaches to recruiting patients, length of time between rounds, use of reminders, incentives, patient and public involvement, and piloting. Minimal reporting of participant characteristics and a lack of translation of Delphi surveys into local languages were found. Additionally, there were indications that studies that recruited patients through treatment centres had higher round two response rates than studies recruiting through patient organisations. CONCLUSIONS: Variability was striking in how COS Delphi surveys were designed and conducted to include patient participants and other stakeholders. Future research is needed to explore what motivates patients to take part in COS studies and what factors influence COS developer recruitment strategies.

Although the direct fertility effects of people getting the virus may be minor, the impact of delayed marriages due to the first preventive lockdown, such as that imposed in Pakistan from March 14 to May 8 2020, and the closure of marriage halls that lasted till September 14 may be non-negligible. These demographic consequences are of particular import to developing countries such as Pakistan where birth rates remain high, marriage is nearly universal, and almost all child-bearing takes place within marriage. Based on historic marriage patterns, we estimate that the delay in nuptiality during the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak may affect about half of the marriages that were to take place during the year. In Pakistan, childbearing begins soon after marriage, and about 37% of Pakistani married women give birth to their first child within twelve months of marriage. A sizeable number out of these, around 400,000 annual births that occur within twelve months of the marriage, may consequently be delayed. Postponement of marriages due to the accompanying difficult economic situation and employment precariousness will accentuate this fertility effect. The net fertility impact of the Covid-19 outbreak will ultimately depend not only on the delay in marriages but also on the reproductive behavior of existing couples.","Mughal, Mazhar; Javed, Rashid",J Popul Res (Canberra),40,5

Methods: We used mobility data from a large, anonymized sample of smartphone users to assess the relationship between neighborhood median household income and physical distancing during the COVID-19 epidemic. We assessed changes in several behaviors including: spending the day entirely at home; working outside the home; and visits to supermarkets, parks, hospitals, and other locations. We also assessed differences in effects of state policies on physical distancing across neighborhood income levels. Results: We found a strong gradient between neighborhood income and physical distancing. Compared to January and February 2020, the proportion of individuals spending the day entirely at home in April 2020 increased by 10.9 percentage points in low-income neighborhoods and by 27.1 percentage points in high-income neighborhoods. During April 2020, people in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to work outside the home, compared to people in higher-income neighborhoods, but not more likely to visit non-work locations. State physical distancing orders were associated with a 1.5 percentage-point increase (95% CI [0.9, 2.1], p < 0.001) in staying home in low-income neighborhoods and a 2.4 percentage point increase (95% CI [1.4, 3.4], p < 0.001) in high-income neighborhoods. Discussion: People in lower-income neighborhoods have faced barriers to physical distancing, particularly the need to work outside the home.

The Tuberculosis Information Management System (TBIMS), an independent system launched in 2005, has encountered several challenges in meeting the current needs of TB control. The Chinese government also planned to establish the National Health Information System (NHIS) aggregating data in different areas. The China National Health Commission-Gates TB Project Phase III launched a new TB surveillance system to address these challenges and also as a pilot for the countrywide implementation of the NHIS. This commentary highlights the improvements and challenges in implementing the new TB system and also discusses the implications for the roll-out of the NHIS. MAIN TEXT: The new TB surveillance system piloted in each prefecture of the project provinces was designed based on the local information system under the unified principle of organizing patient information under a unique ID and realizing the function of data exchange. Upon mid-2019, the data exchange successful rate reached almost 100%, and the system showed good performance in data completeness. Major improvements of the new system included achieving automatic data extraction instead of manual entry, assisting clinical service provision, and the augmented statistical functions. The major challenges in the implementation and scale-up of the new system were the licensing issue and the diversities of infrastructures that hinder the promotion of the new system at a low cost. This pilot also accumulated experiences for the roll-out of the NHIS regarding the technical solutions of reforming current information systems as well as effective training approaches for the developers and users of the new system. CONCLUSIONS: The successful implementation of the new TB surveillance system in the three TB designated medical institutions demonstrated how the diverse infrastructures of the information system could be reformed to achieve the functions of automatic data extraction and data exchange and better cater to the needs of healthcare workers. This pilot also accumulated rich experiences and lessons learnt for developing technical solutions and personnel training for the scale-up of the NHIS.

ITIH4 was tested in two assays, one measuring intact ITIH4 and another also detecting any fragmented ITIH4 (total ITIH4). Control cohorts were 32 haemodialysis patients without COVID-19 and 32 healthy controls. We compared protease inhibitor concentration based on current and future COVID-19 severity and with C-reactive protein. Results were adjusted for repeated measures and multiple comparisons. Analysis of all available samples demonstrated lower plasma C1 esterase inhibitor and α2M and higher total ITIH4 in COVID-19 compared with dialysis controls. These differences were also seen in the first sample collected after COVID-19 diagnosis, a median of 4 days from diagnostic swab. Plasma ITIH4 levels were higher in severe than the non-severe COVID-19. Serum C-reactive protein correlated positively with plasma levels of antithrombin, intact ITIH4 and total ITIH4.

Moreover, most studies have used regression modeling, an approach that limits researchers’ ability to identify the most important predictors of patient safety due to intercorrelations among predictors in the model. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of seven dimensions of safety culture on nurse-rated patient safety and identify the relative importance of these dimensions for predicting patient safety. This correlational study used data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s 2018 Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Data from 13,031 nurses working in surgical areas of 443 hospitals in the United States were examined using logistic regression and dominance analysis. Staffing adequacy was the strongest predictor of patient safety, followed by hospital management support for patient safety and organizational learning/continuous improvement. However, dominance analysis showed that hospital management support for patient safety was the most important predictor rather than staffing adequacy. Nurse managers and hospital administrators should role model a culture of safety and demonstrate their valuing of patient safety by providing sufficient resources, listening to and valuing staff suggestions regarding patient safety, and providing feedback about organizational changes to improve patient safety.","Lee, Seung Eun; Dahinten, V.

There are several clinical reports suggesting higher incidence of venous as well as arterial thromboembolism in the infected individuals. Patients with evidence of thromboembolism are at higher risk of poor outcomes as well (Bilaloglu et al JAMA 2020). The underlying mechanism is thought to be due to increased platelet aggregation and activation (Manne et al Blood 2020) along with inflammatory activation of the coagulation cascade that can lead to a hypercoagulable state (McGonagle et al Lancet Rheumatology 2020). There is a suggestion that anticoagulation is associated with reduction in mortality in COVID-19 infections (Paranjpe et al Cardiology 2020). However, the role of antiplatelet therapy has not been very well described or studied. In this study we investigated the outcomes for patients who were on antiplatelet therapy or full dose anticoagulation at baseline who developed COVID-19 infections. Methods This is a retrospective electronic chart review of patients admitted to New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital (NYP BMH), a Weill Cornell Medicine-affiliated hospital in Brooklyn, NY. Patients who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19 between March to April 2020 were included. Clinical data was extracted manually from electronic medical record (EMR). Patients were divided into 3 cohorts, considered “high risk” due to chronic comorbidities which required therapeutic anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet therapy. The first cohort included patients on single or dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Ticagrelor, Prasugrel, Aspirin-Dipyridamole or dual antiplatelet therapy) prior to admission and continued on admission (AP only). The second cohort included patients on anticoagulation (therapeutic Coumadin, Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, Enoxaparin) without antiplatelet therapy prior to admission, and continued on equivalent anticoagulation inpatient (AC only). The third included patients who were on both antiplatelet therapy and therapeutic anticoagulation (AP + AC). Additionally, we collected data on baseline characteristics, demographics, and outcomes. The primary outcome of the study was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were median length of stay, ICU admission, Intubation requirement, bleeding, transfusions of blood products, development of venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction. Chi-squared analyses were performed to determine statistical significance. Results We analysed 684 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Ages ranged from 18 to 101 years old, 52% were male, and 48% were black, with a median age of 70. There were 146 patients in the AP group, 34 patients in the AC group, 24 patients in the AP + AC group, and 480 patients were on neither. Our data was significant for mortality of 82% in the AC group, 36% in the AP group, and 38% in the AP + AC group (p value <0.00001). 37% of AP patients required ICU admission, 44% of AC patients, and 46% for AP + AC patients. 31% of AP patients required intubation, 32% of AC patients, and 21% of AP + AC patients. 24% of AC patients required at least 1 unit packed red blood cell transfusion, and 25% of AP + AC patients (Table 1). Conclusion We determined our patients to be those at high risk of thrombosis at baseline due to their requirement of antiplatelets or anticoagulation prior to hospitalization for COVID-19 infection. Our study suggests that mortality is higher for these patients who already required anticoagulation prior to COVID infection. Significantly, we demonstrated that patients on both therapeutic anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy had less mortality than patients on anticoagulation alone, suggesting that antiplatelets in addition to anticoagulation might be protective against mortality in COVID-19 infection. Additionally, patients on antiplatelets and anticoagulation had less development of respiratory failure requiring intubation than either alone. This study provides proof of concept for prospective clinical trials for assessing the role of combination of antiplatelet therapy and therapeutic anticoagulation in high risk patients.

Sotalol, used to prevent AF relapse, prolongs cardiac repolarization and corrected QT interval (QTc). A pronounced QTc prolongation is an established marker of pro‐arrhythmias. Our objective was to use novel technique to quantify and evaluate the diurnal variation of the QTc interval after elective CV to SR in patients on sotalol or metoprolol. METHODS: Fifty patients underwent twelve‐lead Holter recording for 24 hr after elective CV for persistent AF. All patients had the highest tolerable stable dose of sotalol (n = 27) or metoprolol (n = 23). Measurements of QT and RR intervals were performed on all valid beats. RESULTS: A clear diurnal variation of both HR and QTc was seen in both groups, more pronounced in patients on sotalol, where a high percentage of heartbeats with QTc >500 ms was observed, especially at night. Six patients (22%) on sotalol but none on metoprolol had >20% of all heart beats within the 24‐hour recording with QTc >500 ms. CONCLUSION: Twenty‐four‐hour Holter recordings with QT‐measurement immediately after CV demonstrated that one in five patients on sotalol had >20% of all heart beats with prolonged QTc >500 ms, especially during night‐time. The QTc diurnal variation was retained in patients on β‐blockade or a potent class III anti‐arrhythmic drug with β‐blocking properties.","Lenhoff, Hanna; Darpö, Börje; Page, Alex; Couderc, Jean Philippe; Tornvall, Per; Frick, Mats",Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol,40,20

Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic have mainly focused on secondary care. AIM: To gain an understanding of the experiences of European primary care professionals (PCPs) working during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews in primary care in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Greece, and Sweden, between April and July 2020. METHOD: Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: Eighty interviews were conducted with PCPs. PCPs had to make their own decisions on how to rapidly transform services in relation to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care. Despite being overwhelmed with guidance, they often lacked access to practical training. Consequently, PCPs turned to their colleagues for moral support and information to try to quickly adjust to new ways of working, including remote care, and to deal with uncertainty. CONCLUSION: PCPs rapidly transformed primary care delivery despite a number of challenges. Representation of primary care at policy level and engagement with local primary care champions are needed to facilitate easy and coordinated access to practical information on how to adapt services, ongoing training, and access to appropriate mental health support services for PCPs. Preservation of autonomy and responsiveness of primary care are critical to preserve the ability for rapid transformation in any future crisis of care delivery.","Wanat, Marta; Hoste, Melanie; Gobat, Nina; Anastasaki, Marilena; Böhmer, Femke; Chlabicz, Slawomir; Colliers, Annelies; Farrell, Karen; Karkana, Maria-Nefeli; Kinsman, John; Lionis, Christos; Marcinowicz, Ludmila; Reinhardt, Katrin; Skoglund, Ingmarie; Sundvall, Pär-Daniel; Vellinga, Akke; Verheij, Theo JM; Goossens, Herman; Butler, Christopher C; van der Velden, Alike; Anthierens, Sibyl; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah",British Journal of General Practice,40,1

Pediatric population should have their own dosage regimens. The pediatric dosage regimens were derived from the adult dose that might lead to sudden reach of sub or supra-therapeutic doses. As the result, the medication therapy management is difficult in this populations. Despite this, a scanty of studies were conducted on medication related problems among pediatric populations. Therefore, this study examined the prevalence and risk factors for the occurrence of the medication related problems among patients admitted to pediatric ward of Mettu karl referral hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The pediatric population who were received the pharmacotherapy for their disease was observed and followed for the occurrences of medication related problems at pediatric wards of Mettu karl referral hospital from February 12, 2020 to February 24, 2021. Patients whose age was less than or equal to 18 years and who were on drug therapy or who needs drug therapy during study period were included. The possibility of adverse drug reactions developed from the drug was assessed by using the Naranjo scale. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of medication related problems. RESULT: Over the study period, a total of 189 pediatric populations were included. Among these, 115 (60.8%) were males, and the mean age of the patients was 1.4339 ± 0.864 years. The mediciation related problems was found among 121(64.01%) of pediatric patients. Among seven types of drug therapy problems unnecessary drug therapy, need additional drug therapy, ineffective drug therapy and dose too high were the most predominantly occured DRP that accounted 74 (27.72%), 67 (25.09%), 43 (16.10%), 36 (13.48%), respectively. The mean number of hospital stay was 4.29 days with minimum and maximum stay of 2 and 9 days and antibiotics 364(51.3%) were the most common class of drugs that was associated with drug related problems. Being a neonate (AOR = 1.48, 95CI%: 1.69–7.42, P = <0.001), hospital stay greater than or equal to seven days (AOR = 1.98, 95CI%: 2.471–12.644, P = 0.016), and the presence of co-morbidity(AOR = 2.507, 95CI%: 3.270–4.949, P = 0.080) were the predictors of the medication related problems. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of medication-related problems in pediatrics patient was found to be high. Being neonatal, prolonged hospital stay and the presence of a multiple disease were the predictors of medication-related problems in pediatric patients. Therefore special attention should be given for newborns, prolonged hospital stay and patients having co-morbidity. Besides this, the drug information service and the patients round activity should be started by clinical pharmacist to decrease the occurences of any preventable medication related problems.","Bekele, Firomsa; Bereda, Gudisa; Tamirat, Lalisa; Geleta, Bonsa Amsalu; Jabessa, Dabala",Ann Med Surg (Lond),40,18

The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a membrane-bound homolog of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Henceforth, this has brought the attention of the scientific community to study the interaction between COVID-19 and the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), as well as RAS inhibitors. However, these inhibitors are commonly used to treat hypertension, chronic kidney disorder, and diabetes. Obesity is a known risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, whereas diabetes and hypertension may be indirectly related to each other through the effects of obesity. Furthermore, people with hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and other related complications like cardiovascular and kidney diseases have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection than the general population and usually exhibit poor prognosis. This severity could be due to systemic inflammation and compromised immune response and RAS associated with these comorbid conditions.

The aim of this study was to identify routine laboratory variables that might indicate the need for SARS-CoV testing. Routine hematological/biochemical variables in patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS (2003) were compared with those in consecutive patients hospitalized June–December 2004 with radiologically confirmed CAP. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to identify discriminating variables at baseline and by day 3 of hospitalization. Nasopharyngeal aspiration and antigen detection for influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were routinely performed in patients with CAP. Altogether, 181 patients with CAP (who remained undiagnosed by IFA) and 303 patients with SARS were studied. The mean intervals from symptom onset to admission were 3.1 and 2.8 days, respectively (p > 0.05). The etiological agent of CAP was identified retrospectively in only 39% of cases, the majority being bacterial pathogens. At baseline, age and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were the only independent discriminating variables (p < 0.0001). Using a value of <4.4 × 10(9)/l as the cutoff for ANC, the sensitivity and specificity of ANC for discriminating SARS were 64 and 95%, respectively (AUC 0.90). By day 3 of hospitalization, age (p < 0.0001), change in ANC (p = 0.0003), and change in bilirubin (p = 0.0065) were discriminating variables. A model combining age <65 years, a change in ANC of >−3 × 10(9)/l, and a change in bilirubin of ≥0 mmol/l had a sensitivity of 43% and a specificity of 95% for SARS (AUC 0.90). There are only a few laboratory features (including lymphopenia) that clearly discriminate SARS from other causes of CAP. Nevertheless, when evaluating epidemiologically high-risk patients with CAP and no immediate alternative diagnosis, a low ANC on presentation along with poor clinical and laboratory responses after 72 h of antibiotic treatment may raise the index of suspicion for SARS and indicate a need to perform SARS-CoV testing.","Lee, N.; Rainer, T.

This study examined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies levels based on gender, age, and exposure source in close contacts of individuals with COVID-19 and compared antibody levels to patients with an asymptomatic or symptomatic COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Two patients had confirmed COVID-19 infections at a community hospital in Qiongzhong, Hainan province. Contact tracing identified all individuals in the community who had been exposed to the two patients during the 14 days before their diagnoses. Close contacts quarantined for 14 days, underwent two SARS-CoV-2 tests, and were screened for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies at 7 and 12 weeks after the end of quarantine. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels for the close contacts were compared to those for patients with an asymptomatic or symptomatic COVID-19 infection at 7 and 12 weeks after their diagnoses. RESULTS: Contact tracing identified 10,573 individuals in the community, including 360 (3.4%) close contacts. At 7 weeks, 30 (8.33%) close contacts were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (IgG, n = 26 [7.22%]; IgM, n = 4 [1.11%]), which were lower than the proportion of patients with an asymptomatic (IgG, 100% [12/12]) or symptomatic (IgG, 93.6% [44/47]) COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM antibody levels were significantly higher in close contacts who were exposed through a relative compared to a doctor–patient relationship (P = 0.032). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels were significantly higher in close contacts aged <18 years vs 18–64 years (P = 0.014). At 12 weeks, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels among close contacts were significantly lower than among patients with an asymptomatic (P = 0.004) or symptomatic COVID-19 infection (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Immune protection conferred by close contact is short term and unlikely to contribute to herd immunity. There remains an unmet public health need for mass vaccination of populations to increase levels of protective antibodies and achieve and maintain herd immunity.","Yao, JinJian; Wang, Hangfei; Yu, Weiling; Li, Yimin; Luo, Zhiqian; Wu, Biao; Zhang, Wei; Liu, Xiaoran; Lv, Chuanzhu",J Inflamm Res,40,26

We validated and updated the model in a real-world cohort and promoted its transferability to daily clinical practice. METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis included 1012 of the 2479 eligible patients aged 35 years or older undergoing surveillance for HCC. The data were extracted from the electronic medical records. Biomarker values within the test-to-diagnosis interval were used to validate the ASAP model. Due to its unsatisfactory calibration, three logistic regression models were constructed to recalibrate and update the model. Their discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were compared. The performance statistics of the final updated model at several risk thresholds are presented. The outcomes of 855 non-HCC patients were further assessed during a median of 10.2 months of follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed using packages in R software. RESULTS: The ASAP model had superior discriminative performance in the validation cohort [C-statistic = 0.982, (95% confidence interval 0.972–0.992)] but significantly overestimated the risk of HCC (intercept − 3.243 and slope 1.192 in the calibration plot), reducing its clinical usefulness. Recalibration-in-the-large, which exhibited performance comparable to that of the refitted model revision, led to the retention of the excellent discrimination and substantial improvements in the calibration and clinical utility, achieving a sensitivity of 100% at the median prediction probability of the absence of HCC (1.3%). The probability threshold of 1.3% and the incidence of HCC in the cohort (15.5%) were used to stratify the patients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups. The cumulative HCC incidences in the non-HCC patients significantly differed among the risk groups (log-rank test, p-value < 0.001). The 3-month, 6-month and 18-month cumulative incidences in the low-risk group were 0.6%, 0.9% and 0.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ASAP model is an accurate tool for HCC risk estimation that requires recalibration before use in a new region because calibration varies with clinical environments. Additionally, rational risk stratification and risk-based management decision-making, e.g., 3-month follow-up recommendations for targeted individuals, helped improve HCC surveillance, which warrants assessment in larger cohorts.

Since it may affect the overall cure as well as quality of life of these patients, it is necessary to continue providing surgical treatment but with minimal additional health hazards to the patient or the health care worker. For this, a workflow was formulated in a university teaching hospital in India with large head and neck cancer workload and implemented during the period of national lockdown. 125 major head and neck cancer cases were operated during this period out of which 25 patients were of high-risk status. Emergency (10%) and semi-emergency (83%) cases predominated with few electives. The number of noncancer reconstructive and craniomaxillofacial cases operated was 81, out of which 25% was of emergency in nature. When compared to the data of similar period in the previous year, 60% of the workload in the cancer-related cases could be offered surgical treatment, whereas the noncancer cases operated were only 25%. The workflow may be useful for all surgical departments in safely performing procedures during this pandemic or similar situations in future with suitable refinements.","Iyer, Subramania; Subramaniam, Sobha; Ravikumar, Beena; Pai, Rajesh; Satyapalan, Dipu; Moni, Merlin; Thankappan, Krishnakumar; Subash, Pramod",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,40,16

Olfactory and taste dysfunction are common in COVID-19, especially in mildly symptomatic patients. Here, we conducted a virologic, molecular, and cellular study of the olfactory neuroepithelium of seven patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute loss of smell. We report evidence that the olfactory neuroepithelium may be a major site of SARS-CoV2 infection with multiple cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, support cells, and immune cells, becoming infected. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the olfactory neuroepithelium was associated with local inflammation. Furthermore, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced acute anosmia and ageusia in golden Syrian hamsters, lasting as long as the virus remained in the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb. Finally, olfactory mucosa sampling from patients showing long-term persistence of COVID-19-associated anosmia revealed the presence of virus transcripts and of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, together with protracted inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 persistence and associated inflammation in the olfactory neuroepithelium may account for prolonged or relapsing symptoms of COVID-19, such as loss of smell, which should be considered for optimal medical management of this disease.","de Melo, Guilherme Dias; Lazarini, Françoise; Levallois, Sylvain; Hautefort, Charlotte; Michel, Vincent; Larrous, Florence; Verillaud, Benjamin; Aparicio, Caroline; Wagner, Sebastien; Gheusi, Gilles; Kergoat, Lauriane; Kornobis, Etienne; Donati, Flora; Cokelaer, Thomas; Hervochon, Rémi; Madec, Yoann; Roze, Emmanuel; Salmon, Dominique; Bourhy, Hervé; Lecuit, Marc; Lledo, Pierre-Marie",Sci Transl Med,40,24

In the dermatological setting, patients with stable plaque psoriasis on maintenance therapy with biological drugs may be suitable candidates for telemedicine, although their preference for telemedicine has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the preference for telemedicine versus in-person visit among patients with psoriasis receiving biological drugs and the reported reasons behind their preferences. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis in stable clinical remission (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] ≤ 3 for at least 12 months) receiving maintenance biological therapy answered a survey investigating whether they would choose telemedicine or in-person visit for the next scheduled visit and the reasons behind their preference. The survey was undertaken through a questionnaire that was developed according to a structured process. RESULTS: Of the 246 participants in the survey, 118 (48%) preferred telemedicine over an in-person visit for their next scheduled visit with a dermatologist. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that previous experience with digital video-communication tools was a significant predictor for the preference for telemedicine (odds ratio [OR] 10.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.61–32.03), while older age (< 60 years) was negatively associated with the preference for telemedicine (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10–0.90). The most common reasons (75%) for preferring telemedicine were saving time and safety in relation to the risk presented by the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic (38%). In contrast, 56% of the patients who preferred the in-person visit option declared that they were unable to use video-communication tools. CONCLUSION: About half of the patients with stable psoriasis receiving biological drugs may be good candidates for telemedicine.

The objective of this study was to explore the environmental and climatic risk factors for SARS-CoV-2. For this study, we analyzed the data at the beginning of the outbreak (from 20 January to 31 March 2020) to avoid the influence of preventive or control measures. We obtained the number of cases and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2, international tourism, population age, universal health coverage, regional factors, the SARS-CoV-2 testing rate, and population density of a country. A total of 154 countries were included in this study. There were high incidence rates and mortality risks in the countries that had an average ambient temperature between 0 and 10 °C. The adjusted incidence rate for temperatures between 0 and 10 °C was 2.91 (95% CI 2.87–2.95). We randomly divided the data into a training set (80% of data) for model derivation and a test set (20% of data) for validation. Using a random forest statistical model, the model had high accuracy for predicting the high epidemic status of a country (ROC = 95.5%, 95% CI 87.9–100.0%) in the test set. Population age, temperature, and international tourism were the most important factors affecting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in a country. An understanding the determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak can help to design better strategies for disease control. This study highlights the need to consider thermal effect in the prevention of emerging infectious diseases.","Yang, Hsiao-Yu; Lee, Jason Kai Wei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,40,12

The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","Cirone, Francesco; Padalino, Barbara; Tullio, Daniele; Capozza, Paolo; Losurdo, Michele; Lanave, Gianvito; Pratelli, Annamaria",Animals (Basel),40,16

However, epidemiological surveys of MERS in Korea indicated that some secondary patients were infected without close contact. Therefore, the possibility of other transmission routes must be identified. In this study, the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow was investigated on the eighth floor of Pyeongtaek St Mary's Hospital. Computational fluid dynamics was used to analyse the indoor airflow and passive tracer diffusion during the index patient's stay. Six cases were simulated for different outdoor wind directions and indoor mechanical ventilation operations. When a passive tracer was released in ward 8104, where the index patient was hospitalized, the passive tracer spread through the indoor airflow, which was created by the outdoor airflow. Ward 8109, which had the largest number of infected cases and was far distant from ward 8104, showed passive tracer concentration in all cases. This result indicates that MERS may have spread through airflow. The study results do not imply that the infection pathway of MERS is airborne. However, the results show the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow in specific environments such as poor ventilation environments.","Jo, Seongmin; Hong, Jinkwan; Lee, Sang-Eun; Ki, Moran; Choi, Bo Youl; Sung, Minki",R Soc Open Sci,40,20

Governments have issued stay-at-home directives, and as a result, colleges and universities have been shut down across the world. Hence, online classes have become a key component in the continuity of education. The present study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on online education at the College of Medicine (COM) of Alfaisal University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Between March and April 2020, we emailed a survey to 1,289 students and faculty members of the COM. We obtained 208 responses (16.1%); 54.8% of the respondents were females, and 66.8% were medical students; 14.9% were master’s students, and 18.3% were faculty. Among the respondents, 41.8% reported having little or no online teaching/learning experience before the pandemic, and 62.5% preferred blending online and face-to-face instruction. The reported challenges to online medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic included issues related to communication (59%), student assessment (57.5%), use of technology tools (56.5%), online experience (55%), pandemic-related anxiety or stress (48%), time management (35%), and technophobia (17%). Despite these challenges, most of the respondents (70.7%) believed that the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted their confidence in the effectiveness of online medical education. Consequently, 76% of participants intended to integrate the online expertise garnered during the pandemic into their practice.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS from 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia diagnosed between September 2012 and January 2018. We evaluated the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance using marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders. RESULTS: Of 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-α2a, rIFN-α2b, or rIFN-β1a; none received rIFN-β1b). RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .02]. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .73–1.44]; P = .87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .30–1.44]; P = .29). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-α2a, rIFN-α2b, or rIFN-β1a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.","Arabi, Yaseen M; Shalhoub, Sarah; Mandourah, Yasser; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Al-Omari, Awad; Al Qasim, Eman; Jose, Jesna; Alraddadi, Basem; Almotairi, Abdullah; Al Khatib, Kasim; Abdulmomen, Ahmed; Qushmaq, Ismael; Sindi, Anees A; Mady, Ahmed; Solaiman, Othman; Al-Raddadi, Rajaa; Maghrabi, Khalid; Ragab, Ahmed; Al Mekhlafi, Ghaleb A; Balkhy, Hanan H; Al Harthy, Abdulrahman; Kharaba, Ayman; Gramish, Jawaher A; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Merson, Laura; Hayden, Frederick G; Fowler, Robert",Clin Infect Dis,40,17

Cases have been detected in most countries worldwide. Italy is one of the most affected countries as of 30 March 2020. Public health response includes a rapid reorganization of the Italian National Healthcare System in order to reduce transmission of COVID-19 within hospitals and healthcare facilities, while optimizing the assistance to patients with severe COVID-19 complications. METHODS: We analysed the actions that were taken in three ophthalmology centres in northern Italy during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and how these measures affected patient’s attendance. In addition, due to the rapidly evolving scenario, we reviewed the evidence available during the course of this pandemic. RESULTS: A full reorganization of ophthalmology services is mandatory according to current existing infection containment measures in order to continue dispensing urgent procedures without endangering the community with amplification of the diffusion chain. Ophthalmologists are considered at elevated risk of exposure when caring patients and vice versa, due to their close proximity during eye examination. High volumes of procedures typically generated by ophthalmologists with concurrent implications on the risk of infection are considered when re-assessing healthcare facilities reorganization. CONCLUSION: Containment measures in the event of pandemic due to infective agents should be well known by healthcare professionals and promptly applied in order to mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak.","Veritti, Daniele; Sarao, Valentina; Bandello, Francesco; Lanzetta, Paolo",Eur J Ophthalmol,40,1

The transfer in colostrum of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the elicited cytokines may provide crucial protection to the infant. There is limited literature on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 present in colostrum. Objective: To evaluate the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and the associated cytokines in colostrum from women who tested positive for the virus. Study Design: Between March and September 2020 we obtained bilateral colostrum samples collected on spot cards within 48 hours of delivery from 15 new mothers who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Five of these 15 COVID-19 positive women also provided bilateral liquid colostrum within 1-2 days of providing the spot card samples. Archived bilateral colostrum samples collected from 8 women during 2011-2013 were used as pre-COVID-19 controls. All samples were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using an ELISA that measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM, and for concentrations of 10 inflammatory cytokines (IFN {gamma}, TNF , IL-1 {beta}, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13) using a multiplex electrochemiluminescent sandwich assay. Results: Bilateral colostrum samples from 73%, 73% and 33% of the 15 COVID-19 mothers exhibited IgA, IgG, and IgM reactivity to RBD respectively. Colostrum samples from two of the 8 pre-pandemic controls showed IgA and IgG reactivity to RBD. Additionally, COVID-19 mothers had significantly higher levels of 9 of the 10 inflammatory markers (all except IFN {gamma}) as compared to the pre-COVID-19 controls. Comparable results were obtained with both the spot card-eluates and liquid samples. Conclusions: A strong humoral immune response is present in the colostrum of women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before delivering. High levels of 9 inflammatory markers were also present in the colostrum. The evolution and duration of the antibody response, as well as dynamics of the cytokine response, remain to be determined. Our results also indicate that future large-scale studies can be conducted with milk easily collected on paper spot cards.","Narayanaswamy, V.; Pentecost, B.; Alfandari, D.; Chin, E.; Minor, K.; Kastrinakis, A.; Lieberman, T.; Arcaro, K.

The data collection tools used in the study include a demographic questionnaire and a Templer death-anxiety questionnaire. FINDINGS: The results showed that the level of death anxiety in nurses working at COVID-19 intensive care units is associated with age, working hours per week, childbearing, several patients needing end-of-life care, cases of direct participation in resuscitation operations, cases of patient death observations, and satisfaction with personal protective equipment (P < o.o5). CONCLUSION: Increasing the nurses’ awareness of the critical situations of COVID-19, management measures, improving the working environment, social support, and increasing personal protective equipment seem to be the effective factors in protecting the intensive care unit nurses against COVID-19 and reducing death anxiety.","Belash, Iran; Barzagar, Fateme; Mousavi, Gohar; Janbazian, Kosar; Aghasi, Zahra; Ladari, Arezoo Taheri; Taghizadeh, Maryam; Jahanbakhsh, Fateme; Saripour, Elnaz; Gholami, Fateme; Rahnamaei, Kosar",J Family Med Prim Care,40,16

In the multivariate analysis, patients with anosmia had a higher frequency of cough (OR: 1.96, 95%CI: 1.18–3.28), headache (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.66–4.03), and myalgia (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.12–2.71). They had higher adjusted values of hemoglobin (+0.87, 95% CI: 0.40–1.34), lymphocytes (+849.24, 95% CI: 157.45–1541.04), glomerular filtration rate (+6.42, 95% CI: 2.14–10.71), and lower D-dimer (−4886.52, 95% CI: −8655.29-(−1117.75)), and C-reactive protein (−24.92, 95% CI: −47.35-(−2.48)). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized Covid-19 patients with anosmia had a lower adjusted mortality rate and less severe course of the disease. This could be related to a distinct clinical presentation and a different inflammatory response.","Talavera, Blanca; García-Azorín, David; Martínez-Pías, Enrique; Trigo, Javier; Hernández-Pérez, Isabel; Valle-Peñacoba, Gonzalo; Simón-Campo, Paula; de Lera, Mercedes; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; López-Sanz, Cristina; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, María; Martínez-Velasco, Elena; Pedraza, María; Sierra, Álvaro; Gómez-Vicente, Beatriz; Guerrero, Ángel; Arenillas, Juan Francisco",J Neurol Sci,40,1

However, the effects of irregularity of meal timing on health and daily quality of life are still unclear. In this study, a web-based self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted involving 4490 workers (73.3% males; average age = 47.4 ± 0.1 years) in Japan to investigate the association between meal habits, health, and social relationships. This study identified that irregular meal timing was correlated with higher neuroticism (one of the Big Five personality traits), lower physical activity levels, and higher productivity loss. Irregular meal timing was also associated with a higher incidence of sleep problems and lower subjective health conditions. Among health outcomes, a high correlation of irregular meal timing with mental health factors was observed. This study showed that irregularity of meal timing can be explained by unbalanced diets, frequent breakfast skipping, increased snacking frequency, and insufficient latency from the last meal to sleep onset. Finally, logistic regression analysis was conducted, and a significant contribution of meal timing irregularity to subjective mental health was found under adjustment for other confounding factors. These results suggest that irregular meal timing is a good marker of subjective mental health issues.","Tahara, Yu; Makino, Saneyuki; Suiko, Takahiko; Nagamori, Yuki; Iwai, Takao; Aono, Megumi; Shibata, Shigenobu",Nutrients,40,3

Manganese (Mn) is capable of inducing IFN production, but its applications are limited by nonspecific distributions and neurotoxicity. Here, we exploit chemical engineering strategy to fabricate a nanodepot of manganese (nanoMn) based on Mn(2)+. Compared with free Mn(2+), nanoMn enhances cellular uptake and persistent release of Mn(2+) in a pH-sensitive manner, thus strengthening IFN response and eliciting broad-spectrum antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo. Preferentially phagocytosed by macrophages, nanoMn promotes M1 macrophage polarization and recruits monocytes into inflammatory foci, eventually augmenting antiviral immunity and ameliorating coronavirus-induced tissue damage. Besides, nanoMn can also potentiate the development of virus-specific memory T cells and host adaptive immunity through facilitating antigen presentation, suggesting its potential as a vaccine adjuvant. Pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations uncover that nanoMn treatment hardly induces neuroinflammation through limiting neuronal accumulation of manganese. Therefore, nanoMn offers a simple, safe, and robust nanoparticle-based strategy against coronavirus.

However, the role of host genetic polymorphisms in modulating maternal CMV status is inconclusive. This study investigated the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine genes with maternal plasma CMV DNA status in black Zimbabweans. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 110 women in late gestation who included 36 CMV infected cases and 74 CMV uninfected, age and HIV status matched controls were enrolled. Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes which code for proteins involved in immunity against CMV were genotyped using Iplex GOLD SNP genotyping protocol on the Agena MassARRAY® system. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE and the ‘Genetics’ and ‘SNPassoc’ packages of the statistical package R. RESULTS: The TLR7 rs179008A > T (p < 0.001) polymorphism was associated while the TLR9 rs352139T > C (p = 0.049) polymorphism was on the borderline for association with CMV positive (CMV+) status. In contrast, the interleukin (IL)-6 rs10499563T > C (p < 0.001) and TLR2 rs1816702C > T (p = 0.001) polymorphisms were associated with CMV negative (CMV-) status. Furthermore, allele frequencies of SNPs in TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, TLR7, IL-6, IL-10, IL-28B, IL-1A and interferon AR1 (IFNAR1) genes are being reported here for the first time in a Zimbabwean population. The allele frequencies in the Zimbabwean population are generally comparable to other African populations but different when compared to European and Asian populations. CONCLUSIONS: Toll-like receptor and interleukin genetic polymorphisms influence CMV status in late gestation among black Zimbabweans. This is attributable to possible modulation of immune responses to CMV reactivation in a population previously exposed to CMV infection.","Mhandire, Doreen Z.; Mhandire, Kudakwashe; Magadze, Mulalo; Wonkam, Ambroise; Kengne, Andre P.; Dandara, Collet",BMC Med Genet,40,20

Thus far, numerous approaches have been used to study the development of epidemics, with special attention paid to the identification of crucial elements that can strengthen or weaken the dynamics of the process. The main thread of this research is associated with the use of the ordinary differential equations method. There also exist several approaches based on the analysis of flows in the Cellular Automata (CA) approach. Methods In this paper, we propose a new approach to disease-spread modeling. We start by creating a network that reproduces contacts between individuals in a community. This assumption makes the presented model significantly different from the ones currently dominant in the field. It also changes the approach to the act of infection. Usually, some parameters that describe the rate of new infections by taking into account those infected in the previous time slot are considered. With our model, we can individualize this process, considering each contact individually. Results The typical output from calculations of a similar type are epidemic curves. In our model, except of presenting the average curves, we show the deviations or ranges for particular results obtained in different simulation runs, which usually lead to significantly different results. This observation is the effect of the probabilistic character of the infection process, which can impact, in different runs, individuals with different significance to the community. We can also easily present the effects of different types of intervention. The effects are studied for different methods used to create the graph representing a community, which can correspond to different social bonds. Conclusions We see the potential usefulness of the proposition in the detailed study of epidemic development for specific environments and communities. The ease of entering new parameters enables the analysis of several specific scenarios for different contagious diseases.","Gwizdałła, Tomasz",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,40,30

Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies plays an important role in understanding and controlling the pandemics, notably through epidemiological surveillance. Well validated and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed. We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, EUA-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity towards sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 pre-pandemic healthy donors was [â¥] 99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. The positive percent agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR reached 100% at [â¥] 16 days (VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and [â¥] 32 days (VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgG) of symptom onset. Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients. Altogether, the VIDAS(R) SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are highly specific and sensitive serological tests suitable for the reliable detection of past acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.","RENARD, NATHALIE; DANIEL, SOIZIC; CAYET, NADEGE; PECQUET, MATTHIEU; RAYMOND, FREDERIQUE; PONS, SYLVIE; LUPO, JULIEN; TOURNEUR, CAROLE; PRETIS, CATHERINE; GEREZ, GUILLAUME; BLASCO, PATRICK; COMBE, MAXIME; CANOVA, IMEN; LESENECHAL, MYLENE; BERTHIER, FRANCK",,40,1

In this unpredictable situation, a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was carried out by the Observatory on Food Surplus, Recovery and Waste of CREA Food and Nutrition Centre. The aim of this work was to evaluate how Italian habits changed during this period, the determinants of changes, and the effect on food waste prevention. In a sample of 2678 respondents, 62% showed low Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (AMD). During lockdown many of participants improved the quality of their diet, increasing their consumption of fruit (24.4%), vegetables (28.5%), legumes (22.1%), nuts (12%), and fish or shellfish (14%). Unfavorable changes were observed with the excessive consumption of sweets or pastries (36.9%) and comfort foods (22.7%), and a lack of physical activity (37.2%). The main novelty of this study was the examination of dietary changes identified by a cluster analysis. Respondents with generally high AMD improved their eating habits, while the habits of the respondents with generally low AMD remained unchanged. In addition, nearly 80% of respondents were sensitive to food waste. The study provides a useful contribution to the debate on nutritional recommendations in case of further lockdown.","Grant, Federica; Scalvedi, Maria Luisa; Scognamiglio, Umberto; Turrini, Aida; Rossi, Laura",Nutrients,40,24

DESIGN: Observational study of COVID-19 outcomes using quality-assured integrated data from a single UK hospital contextualised to its feeder population and associated factors (comorbidities, ethnicity, age, deprivation). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Single-city hospital with a feeder population of 228 632 adults in Wolverhampton. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admissions (defined as COVID-19 admissions (CA) or non-COVID-19 admissions (NCA)) and mortality (defined as COVID-19 deaths or non-COVID-19 deaths). RESULTS: Of the 5558 patients admitted, 686 died (556 in hospital); 930 were CA, of which 270 were hospital COVID-19 deaths, 47 non-COVID-19 deaths and 36 deaths after discharge; of the 4628 NCA, there were 239 in-hospital deaths (2 COVID-19) and 94 deaths after discharge. Of the 223 074 adults not admitted, 407 died. Age, gender, multimorbidity and black ethnicity (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.2), p<0.001, compared with white ethnicity, absolute excess risk of <1/1000) were associated with CA and mortality. The South Asian cohort had lower CA and NCA, lower mortality compared with the white group (CA, 0.5 (0.3 to 0.8), p<0.01; NCA, 0.4 (0.3 to 0.6), p<0.001) and community deaths (0.5 (0.3 to 0.7), p<0.001). Despite many common risk factors for CA and NCA, ethnic groups had different admission rates and within-group differing association of risk factors. Deprivation impacted only the white ethnicity, in the oldest age bracket and in a lesser (not most) deprived quintile. CONCLUSIONS: Wolverhampton’s results, reflecting high ethnic diversity and deprivation, are similar to other studies of black ethnicity, age and comorbidity risk in COVID-19 but strikingly different in South Asians and for deprivation. Sequentially considering population and then hospital-based NCA and CA outcomes, we present a complete single health economy picture. Risk factors may differ within ethnic groups; our data may be more representative of communities with high Black, Asian and minority ethnic populations, highlighting the need for locally focused public health strategies. We emphasise the need for a more comprehensible and nuanced conveyance of risk.","Singh, Baldev M; Bateman, James; Viswanath, Ananth; Klaire, Vijay; Mahmud, Sultan; Nevill, Alan; Dunmore, Simon J",BMJ Open,40,1

The incidence of OA is progressively rising due to the diminishing levels of physical activity and ever-expanding aging population. However, the mainstay for OA treatment only can improve symptoms without delay the progression of this severe disease. This study aimed to explore the biological role and clinical function of lncRNA HAND2-AS1 in OA. METHODS: Blood samples and synovial fluid were collected from OA patients and normal subjects. HAND2-AS1 expression was detected by qRT-PCR and IL-6 expression was detected by ELISA. The plasma levels of HAND2-AS1 were also detected in different ages, stages, and gender of OA patients and controls. Furthermore, the ROC curve was used to analyze whether HAND2-AS1 can distinguish OA patients from normal subjects. Also, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to analyze the correlation between lncRNA HAND2-AS1 and IL-6. In addition, Western blot was used to detect the IL-6 level upon HAND2-AS1 over-expression in chondrocytes and qRT-PCR was used to detect the HAND2-AS1 level after endogenous IL-6 treatment. RESULTS: HAND2-AS1 and IL-6 were dysregulated in plasma and synovial fluid of OA patients. The expression of HAND2-AS1 in plasma of OA patients was decreased with aging and progression. Furthermore, HAND2-AS1 downregulation effectively distinguished OA patients from the healthy controls. Over-expression of HAND2-AS1 inhibited IL-6 expression in chondrocytes, while treatment with exogenous IL-6 did not affect HAND2-AS1 expression. CONCLUSION: HAND2-AS1 effectively distinguished OA patients from the healthy controls and regulates IL-6 expression in human chondrocytes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR, ChiCTR2000038635.

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in patients with diabetes admitted with COVID-19 to Mediclinic Parkview Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30th March to 7th June 2020. They had laboratory and/or radiologically confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), known as COVID-19. Variation in characteristics, length of stay in hospital, diabetes status, comorbidities and outcomes were examined. Results: A total of 103 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presentations had diabetes. During the same timeframe, 410 patients overall were admitted with COVID-19 infection. This gives a total proportion of persons admitted with COVID-19 infection and coexistent diabetes/prediabetes of 25%. 67% (n=69) of the COVID-19 diabetes cohort were male. Patients admitted with COVID-19 and diabetes represented 17 different ethnicities. Of these, 59.2% (n=61) were Asians and 35% (n=36) were from Arab countries. Mean age (SD) was 54 (12.5) years. 85.4% (n=88) were known to have diabetes prior to admission, while 14.6% (n=15) were newly diagnosed with either diabetes or prediabetes during admission. Most patients in the study cohort had type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, with only 3% overall having type 1 diabetes (n=3). 46.9% of patients had evidence of good glycaemic control of their diabetes during the preceding 4-12 weeks prior to admission as defined arbitrarily by admission HbA1c <7.5%. 73.8% (n=76) had other comorbidities including hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, and dyslipidaemia. Laboratory data Mean(SD) on admission for those who needed ward-based care versus those needing intensive care unit (ICU) care: Fibrinogen 462.75 (125.16) mg/dl vs 660 (187.58) mg/dl ; D-dimer 0.66 (0.55) mcg/ml vs 2.3 (3.48) mcg/ml; Ferritin 358.08 (442.05) mg/dl vs 1762.38 (2586.38) mg/dl; and CRP 33.9 (38.62) mg/L vs 137 (111.72) mg/L were all statistically significantly higher for the ICU cohort (p<0.05). Average length of stay in hospital was 14.55 days. 28.2% of patients needed ICU admission. 4.9% (n=5) overall died during hospitalisation (all in ICU). Conclusions: In this single-centre study in Dubai, 25% of patients admitted with COVID-19 also had diabetes/prediabetes. Most diabetes patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease were males of Asian origin. 14.6% had new diagnosis of diabetes/prediabetes on admission. The majority of patients with diabetes/prediabetes and COVID-19 infection had other important comorbidities (n=76; 73.8%). Only 4 patients had negative COVID-19 RT-PCR but had pathognomonic changes of COVID-19 radiologically. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of biomarkers that are associated with poor prognosis: Fibrinogen, D-dimer, Ferritin and CRP levels were all statistically significantly higher (p<0.05) at presentation in patients who subsequently needed ICU care compared with those patients who remained ward-based. 28.2% overall needed ICU admission, out of which 5 patients died. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to compare data of COVID-19 patients admitted with and without diabetes within the UAE region.","Bhatti, R.; Omer, A.; Khattib, S.; Shiraz, S.; Matfin, G.",,40,9

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.","Ragonnet-Cronin, M.; Boyd, O.; Geidelberg, L.; Jorgensen, D.; Nascimento, F.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study from January 1995 to December 2004 in which 14,068 stool samples from pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis were analyzed. The variables analyzed were sex, age, origin, diagnosis of rotavirus, and date of diagnosis. Differences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 11.9 % of the samples (1687 cases) in the 10 years of the study, 12.14 % corresponded to boys and 11.81 % to girls (p = 0.5459). The mean age of the population was 2.63 years. The highest percentage of cases occurred in the group aged 1- 4 years old (14.1 %; p < 0.001) and in outpatients (12.76 %; p < 0.05). In this geographical region, there was a significant tendency (p < 0.001) for rotavirus to occur in the winter months. CONCLUSION: Rotavirus is one of the main causes of morbidity in children both in the hospital and the outpatient setting. Children aged less than 4 years old are most frequently affected, especially those aged 1 year. The infection appears mainly in winter.","Téllez Castillo, C.J.; Tirado Balaguer, M.aD.; Colomer Revuelta, J.; Moreno Muñoz, R.; Beltrán Garrido, J.M.",An Pediatr (Barc),40,14

Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) is one of the most ancient medical doctrines mostly known with the manuscripts of Avicenna and Rhazes. In this paper, we first introduce a series of medicinal plants that would potentially be beneficial in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection according to TPM textbooks. Then, we review medicinal plants based on the pharmacological studies obtained from electronic databases and discuss their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several medicinal plants in TPM with cardiotonic, kidney tonic, and pulmonary tonic activities, protecting the lung, heart, and kidney, the three main vulnerable organs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some medicinal plants can prevent “humor infection”, a situation described in TPM which has similar features to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological evaluations are in line with the therapeutic activities of several plants mentioned in TPM, mostly through antiviral, cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Amongst the primarily-introduced medicinal plants from TPM, rhubarb, licorice, garlic, saffron, galangal, and clove are the most studied plants and represent candidates for clinical studies. The antiviral compounds isolated from these plants provide novel molecular structures to design new semisynthetic antiviral agents. Future clinical studies in healthy volunteers as well as patients suffering from pulmonary infections are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of these plants as complementary and integrative interventions in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bahramsoltani, Roodabeh; Rahimi, Roja",Front Pharmacol,40,20
