718,True versus False Parasite Interactions: A Robust Method to Take Risk Factors into Account and Its Application to Feline Viruses,2012-01-03,"BACKGROUND: Multiple infections are common in natural host populations and interspecific parasite interactions are therefore likely within a host individual. As they may seriously impact the circulation of certain parasites and the emergence and management of infectious diseases, their study is essential. In the field, detecting parasite interactions is rendered difficult by the fact that a large number of co-infected individuals may also be observed when two parasites share common risk factors. To correct for these “false interactions”, methods accounting for parasite risk factors must be used. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present paper we propose such a method for presence-absence data (i.e., serology). Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic. The method is termed “the corrected chi-square.” Its robustness was compared to a pre-existing method based on logistic regression and the corrected chi-square proved to be much more robust for small sample sizes. Since the logistic regression approach is easier to implement, we propose as a rule of thumb to use the latter when the ratio between the sample size and the number of parameters is above ten. Applied to serological data for four viruses infecting cats, the approach revealed pairwise interactions between the Feline Herpesvirus, Parvovirus and Calicivirus, whereas the infection by FIV, the feline equivalent of HIV, did not modify the risk of infection by any of these viruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work therefore points out possible interactions that can be further investigated in experimental conditions and, by providing a user-friendly R program and a tutorial example, offers new opportunities for animal and human epidemiologists to detect interactions of interest in the field, a crucial step in the challenge of multiple infections.","Hellard, Eléonore; Pontier, Dominique; Sauvage, Frank; Poulet, Hervé; Fouchet, David",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250451/,230
2156,"Epidemiology, Seasonality and Treatment of Hospitalized Adults and Adolescents with Influenza in Jingzhou, China, 2010-2012",2016-03-09,"BACKGROUND: After the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, we conducted hospital-based severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance in one central Chinese city to assess disease burden attributable to influenza among adults and adolescents. METHODS: We defined an adult SARI case as a hospitalized patient aged ≥ 15 years with temperature ≥38.0°C and at least one of the following: cough, sore throat, tachypnea, difficulty breathing, abnormal breath sounds on auscultation, sputum production, hemoptysis, chest pain, or chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia. For each enrolled SARI case-patient, we completed a standardized case report form, and collected a nasopharyngeal swab within 24 hours of admission. Specimens were tested for influenza viruses by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We analyzed data from adult SARI cases in four hospitals in Jingzhou, China from April 2010 to April 2012. RESULTS: Of 1,790 adult SARI patients enrolled, 40% were aged ≥ 65 years old. The median duration of hospitalization was 9 days. Nearly all were prescribed antibiotics during their hospitalization, less than 1% were prescribed oseltamivir, and 28% were prescribed corticosteroids. Only 0.1% reported receiving influenza vaccination in the past year. Of 1,704 samples tested, 16% were positive for influenza. Influenza activity in all age groups showed winter-spring and summer peaks. Influenza-positive patients had a longer duration from illness onset to hospitalization and a shorter duration from hospital admission to discharge or death compared to influenza negative SARI patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial burden of influenza-associated SARI hospitalizations in Jingzhou, China, especially among older adults. More effective promotion of annual seasonal influenza vaccination and timely oseltamivir treatment among high risk groups may improve influenza prevention and control in China.","Zheng, Jiandong; Huo, Xixiang; Huai, Yang; Xiao, Lin; Jiang, Hui; Klena, John; Greene, Carolyn M.; Xing, Xuesen; Huang, Jigui; Liu, Shali; Peng, Youxing; Yang, Hui; Luo, Jun; Peng, Zhibin; Liu, Linlin; Chen, Maoyi; Chen, Hui; Zhang, Yuzhi; Huang, Danqin; Guan, Xuhua; Feng, Luzhao; Zhan, Faxian; Hu, Dale J.; Varma, Jay K.; Yu, Hongjie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784897/,230
5455,A two-step high-risk immunization based on high-risk immunization,2014-07-09,"In this paper, we model the epidemic course of a pathogen infection within a semi-closed group which generates clinical signals which do not necessarily permit its ready and certain identification. Typical examples of such a pathogen are influenza-type viruses. We allow for time-varying infectivity levels among individuals, and model the probability of infection per contact as a function of the clinical signals. In order to accomplish this, we introduce a modified chain-binomial Reed-Frost model. We obtain an expression for the basic reproduction ratio and determine conditions which guarantee that the epidemic does not survive in the long-term. These conditions being functions of the signal’s distribution, they can be used to design and evaluate interventions, such as treatment protocols.","de Menezes, Renée X.; Ortega, Neli R.

11036,Bariatric Surgery Outcomes in Patients with Prior Solid Organ Transplantation: an MBSAQIP Analysis,2020-02-24,"PURPOSE: Sepsis survivors have a higher risk of rehospitalisation and of long-term mortality. We assessed the rate, diagnosis, and independent predictors for rehospitalisation in adult sepsis survivors. METHODS: We searched for non-randomized studies and randomized clinical trials in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE (OVID interface, 1992–October 2019). The search strategy used controlled vocabulary terms and text words for sepsis and hospital readmission, limited to humans, and English language. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data using predefined criteria and data extraction forms. RESULTS: The literature search identified 12,544 records. Among 56 studies (36 full and 20 conference abstracts) that met our inclusion criteria, all were non-randomised studies. Studies most often report 30-day rehospitalisation rate (mean 21.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.6–25.4%; N = 36 studies reporting 6,729,617 patients). The mean (95%CI) rehospitalisation rates increased from 9.3% (8.3–10.3%) by 7 days to 39.0% (22.0–59.4%) by 365 days. Infection was the most common rehospitalisation diagnosis. Risk factors that increased the rehospitalisation risk in sepsis survivors were generic characteristics such as older age, male, comorbidities, non-elective admissions, hospitalisation prior to index sepsis admission, and sepsis characteristics such as infection and illness severity, with hospital characteristics showing inconsistent associations. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate for rehospitalisation rates and low for risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Rehospitalisation events are common in sepsis survivors, with one in five rehospitalisation events occurring within 30 days of hospital discharge following an index sepsis admission. The generic and sepsis-specific characteristics at index sepsis admission are commonly reported risk factors for rehospitalisation. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD 42016039257, registered on 14-06-2016.

11087,Selecting the dosage of ceftazidime–avibactam in the perfect storm of nosocomial pneumonia,2019-12-14,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal replacement is a challenge to the therapeutic skills of surgeons and a technically demanding operation in the pediatric age group. Various conduits and routes have been described in the literature, each with their specific advantages and disadvantages. We carried out this retrospective study to share our experience of esophageal replacement. METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted at the department of pediatric surgery The Children’s Hospital and The Institute of Child Health, Lahore. The records of patients treated for esophageal replacement were reviewed. The patients under follow-up were called for clinical evaluation and assessed of long terms complications if any. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients with esophageal replacement were included in the study. Esophageal replacement was done with gastric transposition in 84 cases (90%), colon interposition in 7 cases (7.5%) including one case of redo colonic interposition, and jejunal interposition in 2 cases (2%). Routes of esophageal replacement were trans-hiatal in 71 (76%), retrosternal in 13 (14%), and trans-hiatal with thoracotomy in 9 (10%) patients. Postoperatively, all of the conduits maintained viability. Wound infection was seen in 10 (11%), wound dehiscence in 5 (5%), anastomotic leak in 9 (10%), anastomotic stenosis in 12 (13%), fistula formation in 4 (4%), aortic injury 1 (1%), dumping syndrome 8 (9%), reflux 18 (19%), dysphagia 15 (16%) and death occurred in 12 patients (13%). CONCLUSION: There are problems with esophageal replacement in developing countries. In this context, gastric conduit appeared as the best conduit for esophageal replacement, using the trans-hiatal route for replacement, in the authors’ experience.","Saleem, Muhammad; Iqbal, Asif; Ather, Uzma; Haider, Naveed; Talat, Nabila; Hashim, Imran; Mirza, Muhammad Bilal; Butt, Jamal; Mahmud, Hassan; Majeed, Fatima",Pediatr Surg Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223057/,230
11137,False-positive anti-NMDA receptor antibodies in severe case of Lyme neuroborreliosis,2019-07-04,"Many medical advancements—including improvements to anti-rejection therapies in transplantation and vaccine development—rely on preclinical studies conducted in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II genes of cynomolgus macaques are orthologous to human leukocyte antigen complex (HLA) class I and class II genes, respectively. Both encode cell-surface proteins involved in cell recognition and rejection of non-host tissues. MHC class I and class II genes are highly polymorphic, so comprehensive genotyping requires the development of complete databases of allelic variants. Our group used PacBio circular consensus sequencing of full-length cDNA amplicons to characterize MHC class I and class II transcript sequences for a cohort of 293 Indonesian cynomolgus macaques (ICM) in a large, pedigreed breeding colony. These studies allowed us to expand the existing database of Macaca fascicularis (Mafa) alleles by identifying an additional 141 MHC class I and 61 class II transcript sequences. In addition, we defined co-segregating combinations of allelic variants as regional haplotypes for 70 Mafa-A, 78 Mafa-B, and 45 Mafa-DRB gene clusters. Finally, we defined class I and class II transcripts that are associated with 100 extended MHC haplotypes in this breeding colony by combining our genotyping analyses with short tandem repeat (STR) patterns across the MHC region. Our sequencing analyses and haplotype definitions improve the utility of these ICM for transplantation studies as well as infectious disease and vaccine research.

12514,Which sample type is better for Xpert MTB/RIF to diagnose adult and pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis?,2020-08-04,"The use of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-assisted encapsulating emulsion polymerization (REEP) has been explored to prepare diverse types of colloidal stable core–shell nanostructures. A major field of application of such nanoparticles is in emergent nanomedicines, which require effective biofunctionalization strategies, in which their response to bioanalytes needs to be firstly assessed. Herein, functional core–shell nanostructures were prepared via REEP and click chemistry. Thus, following the REEP strategy, colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs, d = 15 nm) were coated with a poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA) macroRAFT agent containing an azide (N3) group to afford N3–macroRAFT@Au NPs. Then, chain extension was carried out from the NPs surface via REEP, at 44 °C under monomer-starved conditions, to yield N3–copolymer@Au NPs–core–shell type structures. Biotin was anchored to N3–copolymer@Au NPs via click chemistry using an alkynated biotin to yield biofunctionalized Au nanostructures. The response of the ensuing biotin–copolymer@Au NPs to avidin was followed by visible spectroscopy, and the copolymer–biotin–avidin interaction was further studied using the Langmuir–Blodgett technique. This research demonstrates that REEP is a promising strategy to prepare robust functional core–shell plasmonic nanostructures for bioapplications. Although the presence of azide moieties requires the use of low polymerization temperature, the overall strategy allows the preparation of tailor-made plasmonic nanostructures for applications of biosensors based on responsive polymer shells, such as pH, temperature, and photoluminescence quenching. Moreover, the interaction of biotin with avidin proved to be time dependent.","Pereira, Sónia O.; Trindade, Tito; Barros-Timmons, Ana",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7408358/,230

Diagnostics 2020, 10, 935",2021-01-04,"Background: Approximately 6.5 to 6.9 million individuals in the United States have heart failure, and the disease costs approximately $43.6 billion in 2020. This research provides geographical incidence and cost models of this disease in the U.S. and explanatory models to account for hospitals’ number of heart failure DRGs using technical, workload, financial, geographical, and time-related variables. Methods: The number of diagnoses is forecast using regression (constrained and unconstrained) and ensemble (random forests, extra trees regressor, gradient boosting, and bagging) techniques at the hospital unit of analysis. Descriptive maps of heart failure diagnostic-related groups (DRGs) depict areas of high incidence. State- and county-level spatial and non-spatial regression models of heart failure admission rates are performed. Expenditure forecasts are estimated. Results: The incidence of heart failure has increased over time with the highest intensities in the East and center of the country; however, several Northern states have seen large increases since 2016. The best predictive model for the number of diagnoses (hospital unit of analysis) was an extremely randomized tree ensemble (predictive R(2) = 0.86). The important variables in this model included workload metrics and hospital type. State-level spatial lag models using first-order Queen criteria were best at estimating heart failure admission rates (R(2) = 0.816). At the county level, OLS was preferred over any GIS model based on Moran’s I and resultant R(2); however, none of the traditional models performed well (R(2) = 0.169 for the OLS). Gradient-boosted tree models predicted 36% of the total sum of squares; the most important factors were facility workload, mean cash on hand of the hospitals in the county, and mean equity of those hospitals. Online interactive maps at the state and county levels are provided. Conclusions. Heart failure and associated expenditures are increasing. Costs of DRGs in the study increased $61 billion from 2016 through 2018. The increase in the more expensive DRG 291 outpaced others with an associated increase of $92 billion. With the increase in demand and steady-state supply of cardiologists, the costs are likely to balloon over the next decade. Models such as the ones presented here are needed to inform healthcare leaders.","Kruse, Clemens Scott; Beauvais, Bradley M.; Brooks, Matthew S.; Mileski, Michael; Fulton, Lawrence V.",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824516/,230
15041,Sudden Cardiac Death Prediction in Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy: A Multinational Collaboration,2020-12-09,"Magnesium (Mg)-based biomaterials hold considerable promise for applications in regenerative medicine. However, the degradation of Mg needs to be reduced to control toxicity caused by its rapid natural corrosion. In the process of developing new Mg alloys with various surface modifications, an efficient assessment of the relevant properties is essential. In the present study, a WE43 Mg alloy with a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO)-generated surface was investigated. Surface microstructure, hydrogen gas evolution in immersion tests and cytocompatibility were assessed. In addition, a novel in vitro immunological test using primary human lymphocytes was introduced. On PEO-treated WE43, a larger number of pores and microcracks, as well as increased roughness, were observed compared to untreated WE43. Hydrogen gas evolution after two weeks was reduced by 40.7% through PEO treatment, indicating a significantly reduced corrosion rate. In contrast to untreated WE43, PEO-treated WE43 exhibited excellent cytocompatibility. After incubation for three days, untreated WE43 killed over 90% of lymphocytes while more than 80% of the cells were still vital after incubation with the PEO-treated WE43. PEO-treated WE43 slightly stimulated the activation, proliferation and toxin (perforin and granzyme B) expression of CD8(+) T cells. This study demonstrates that the combined assessment of corrosion, cytocompatibility and immunological effects on primary human lymphocytes provide a comprehensive and effective procedure for characterizing Mg variants with tailorable degradation and other features. PEO-treated WE43 is a promising candidate for further development as a degradable biomaterial.","Hartjen, Philip; Wegner, Nils; Ahmadi, Parimah; Matthies, Levi; Nada, Ola; Fuest, Sandra; Yan, Ming; Knipfer, Christian; Gosau, Martin; Walther, Frank; Smeets, Ralf",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7835942/,230

AIM: To assess national IPC programmes worldwide according to the World Health Organization (WHO) IPC core components. METHODS: Between June 1(st), 2017 and November 30(th), 2018, a multi-country, cross-sectional study was conducted, based on semi-structured interviews with national IPC focal points of countries that pledged to the WHO ‘Clean Care is Safer Care’ challenge. Results and differences between regions and national income levels were summarized using descriptive statistics. FINDINGS: Eighty-eight of 103 (85.4%) eligible countries participated; 22.7% were low-income, 19.3% lower-middle-income, 23.9% upper-middle-income, and 34.1% high-income economies. A national IPC programme existed in 62.5%, but only 26.1% had a dedicated budget. National guidelines were available in 67.0%, but only 36.4% and 21.6% of countries had an implementation strategy and evaluated compliance with guidelines, respectively. Undergraduate IPC curriculum and in-service and postgraduate IPC training were reported by 35.2%, 54.5%, and 42% of countries, respectively.

15686,Cost–Utility Analysis of Home Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,2021-02-01,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by a mutation(s) in the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR), where progressive decline in lung function due to recurring exacerbations is a major cause of mortality. The initiation of chronic obstructive lung disease in CF involves inflammation and exacerbations, leading to mucus obstruction and lung function decline. Even though clinical management of CF lung disease has prolonged survival, exacerbation and age-related lung function decline remain a challenge for controlling the progressive lung disease. The key to the resolution of progressive lung disease is prognosis-based early therapeutic intervention; thus, the development of novel diagnostics and prognostic biomarkers for predicting exacerbation and lung function decline will allow optimal management of the lung disease. Hence, the development of real-time lung function diagnostics such as forced oscillation technique (FOT), impulse oscillometry system (IOS), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and novel prognosis-based intervention strategies for controlling the progression of chronic obstructive lung disease will fulfill a significant unmet need for CF patients. Early detection of CF lung inflammation and exacerbations with the timely resolution will not only prolong survival and reduce mortality but also improve quality of life while reducing significant health care costs due to recurring hospitalizations.","Vij, Neeraj",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913194/,230

As ventilation starts, air leakage may occur in this area. The aim of the present study was to investigate, whether additional coagulation either before or after ventilation has an additional sealing effect. Freshly slaughtered porcine heart-lung blocks were prepared. The trachea was connected to a ventilator. Using a Nd:YAG laser (wavelength: 1320 nm, power: 60 W), round lesions (1.5 cm in diameter) with a depth of 1.5 cm were applied to the lung using an 800-μm laser fiber (5 s per lesion). Group 1 (n = 12) was control. Additional coagulation was performed in group 2 (n = 12) without and in group 3 (n = 12) with ventilation restarted. Air leakage (ml) from the lesions was measured. The thickness of each coagulation layer was determined on histological slices. Differences between individual groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (significance p < 0.05). After resection, 26.2 ± 2.7 ml of air emerged from the lesions per single respiration in group 1. Air loss in group 2 was 24.6 ± 2.5 ml (p = 0.07) and in group 3 23.7 ± 1.8 ml (p = 0.0098). In comparison to groups 1 and 2 thickness of the coagulation layers in group 3 was significantly increased.

We evaluated several commonly used hospitalized ARI case definitions to identify influenza cases. METHODS: The study included all patients from a population-based surveillance site in Damanhour, Egypt hospitalized for a broad set of criteria consistent with community acquired ARIs. Naso- and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs were tested for influenza using RT-PCR. Sensitivity, specificity and PPV for influenza identification was compared between the 2014 WHO Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) definition (fever ≥38°C and cough with onset within 10 days), the 2011 WHO SARI definition (fever ≥38°C and cough with onset within 7 days), the 2006 PAHO SARI definition, the International Emerging Infections Program (IEIP) pneumonia case definition, and the International Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) case definitions for moderate and severe pneumonia. RESULTS: From June 2009-December 2012, 5768 NP/OP swabs were obtained from 6113 hospitalized ARI patients; 799 (13.9%) were influenza positive. The 2014 WHO SARI case definition captured the greatest number of ARI patients, influenza positive patients and ARI deaths compared to the other case definitions examined. Sensitivity for influenza detection was highest for the 2014 WHO SARI definition with 88.6%, compared to the 2011 WHO SARI (78.2%) the 2006 PAHO SARI (15.8%) the IEIP pneumonia (61.0%) and the IMCI moderate and severe pneumonia (33.8% and 38.9%) case definitions (IMCI applies to <5 only). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support use of the 2014 WHO SARI definition for identifying influenza positive hospitalized SARI cases as it captures the highest proportion of ARI deaths and influenza positive cases.

With recent advances in the field of neurology, autoimmune astrocytopathy (neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, NMOSD), myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated encephalomyelitis (MOG-EM), metabolic myelopathy, connective tissue diseases and viral infections have gained considerable focus in the list of differentials of LETM whereas tubercular association is often forgotten. This report presents a rare case of acute transverse myelopathy which unveiled previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis in an adult rural Indian male. The patient responded well to anti-tubercular therapy and corticosteroids. Exact pathogenesis of LETM in TB remains elusive. Association of TB with MOG-EM has been one of the recent hot-cakes. However, an ill-defined immune-inflammatory response to the infectious agent is the likely cause of tubercular LETM. Hence, the primary care physicians who are the first medical contacts of acute LETM cases and in most cases due to diagnostic dilemma there is an unavoidable delay in accurate diagnosis and initiation of therapy. Primary care doctors should nurture a high index of suspicion to diagnose this potentially lifetime-debilitating yet absolutely treatable clinical condition i.e. tubercular LETM.","Anand, Kumar Abhishek; Bhowmik, Kalyan Kumar; Sarkar, Amit; Ghosh, Ritwik; Mandal, Arpan; Swaika, Bikash; Ray, Biman Kanti",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138341/,230
17857,Cross-sectional imaging findings of splenic infections: is differential diagnosis possible?,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Health workers in both well-resourced and limited income settings face health threats from exposures encountered in their unique and complex work environment. Even before the 2014 Ebola outbreak, preventable harm was routinely felt by health workers, most visibly through the fatal collusion between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and tuberculosis (TB) infection in high endemic countries. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to examine the analyses of the health sector workforce by development and public health agencies regarding its sustainability, threats from workers’ personal health risks and discussion of protections to address those risks. METHODS: Development and public health agency reports assessing the sustainability of and threats to the health workforce both pre-and post the 2014 Ebola outbreak were examined with a focus on low and middle- income countries (LMICs). FINDINGS: Reviews of the health sector workforce have largely focused on its role as a necessary component of sustainable development. Hence, staff competency, numbers and productivity have been emphasized with little notice of the conditions of work and the highly hazardous environment contributing to worker out-migration, illness and death. CONCLUSIONS: Going forward, the 2016 World Health Assembly campaign to advance human resources for health and other UN efforts on health employment may offer some opportunities to address needed health worker protections. However, to these largely competency-focused workforce development efforts must first be brought resources for and commitment to protecting the safety of these workers’ lives and livelihood. Doing less defeats investments in fragile health systems and is plainly unethical.","McDiarmid, Melissa",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7052314/,230

Wealthier people largely had better outcomes while inequality associated with more respiratory disease, a leading cause of mortality. Greater inequality and lower wealth were associated with higher blood pressure. Psychosocial factors did not mediate wealth-health associations. Thus, relative socio-economic position and inequality may affect health across diverse societies, though this is likely exacerbated in high-income countries.","Jaeggi, Adrian V; Blackwell, Aaron D; von Rueden, Christopher; Trumble, Benjamin C; Stieglitz, Jonathan; Garcia, Angela R; Kraft, Thomas S; Beheim, Bret A; Hooper, Paul L; Kaplan, Hillard; Gurven, Michael",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8225390/,230

Although several pathogenic bacteria are associated with colorectal cancer etiology, some others are considered as highly selective therapeutic agents in colorectal cancer. Nowadays, researchers are concentrating on bacteriotherapy as a novel effective therapeutic method with fewer or no side effects to pay the way of cancer therapy. The introduction of advanced and successful strategies in bacterial colorectal cancer therapy could be useful to identify new promising treatment strategies for colorectal cancer patients. MAIN TEXT: In this article, we scrutinized the beneficial effects of bacterial therapy in colorectal cancer amelioration focusing on different strategies to use a complete bacterial cell or bacterial-related biotherapeutics including toxins, bacteriocins, and other bacterial peptides and proteins. In addition, the utilization of bacteria as carriers for gene delivery or other known active ingredients in colorectal cancer therapy are reviewed and ultimately, the molecular mechanisms targeted by the bacterial treatment in the colorectal cancer tumors are detailed.

We assessed the associations between sociodemographic, health, academic, policy, and lifestyle characteristics (independent variables); and individual, multiple and increasing ATOD use (dependent variables) using regression analyses. Data were collected by online questionnaire at the University of Turku, Finland (1177 students). Roughly 22% of the sample smoked, 21% ever used illicit drug/s, 41% were high frequency drinkers, and 31.4%, 16.3%, and 6.7% reported 1, 2, or 3 ATOD behaviors respectively. Individual ATOD use was significantly positively associated with the use of the other two substances [adjusted odds ratio (Adj OR range 1.893–3.311)]. Multiple ATOD use was negatively associated with being single (p = 0.021) or agreeing with total smoking or alcohol ban policy on campus (p < 0.0001 for each); but positively associated with not living with parents (p = 0.004). Increasing ATOD behaviors were significantly less likely among those agreeing with total smoking or alcohol ban policy on campus (p range 0.024 to <0.0001). Demographics significant to either individual, multiple, or increasing ATOD use included males, being single, not living with their parents during semesters, and to some extent, religiosity. Age, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, self-rated health, health awareness, income sufficiency, and academic variables were not associated with individual, multiple, or increasing ATOD use. Education and prevention efforts need to reinforce abstinence from ATOD, highlight their harmful outcomes, and target risk groups highlighted above.

Such opposing therapies can result in unexpected pathophysiology and there is a real risk of misdiagnosis resulting in harm. This case presents a previously unreported complication of prevention and management of thromboembolism- STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction) and tamponade mimic secondary to retroperitoneal haematoma. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 50-year-old male polytrauma patient who following treatment for presumed pulmonary embolus demonstrated classical clinical findings of myocardial infarction and pericardial tamponade secondary to a retroperitoneal haematoma. This is an event not previously reported in the literature. The risk of adverse outcome by management along the standard lines of STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction) was averted through awareness for alternative aetiology via a multi-team approach which resulted in percutaneous drainage of the haematoma and complete resolution of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This manuscript highlights the therapeutic conflict between haemorrhage control and prevention of thromboembolic events in critically injured, the importance of high index of suspicion in this patient cohort and the benefits of multidisciplinary decision making in the complex patient through a not previously published pathophysiologic phenomenon.","Brun, Mathew; Brun, Shane; Pearson, David; Wullschleger, Martin",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8325207/,230
20036,The factors associated with transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity,2021-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation (AE) has been reported to herald a poor prognosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and is now thought to do so in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs). However, the pathophysiology of AE-IIPs is not sufficiently understood. In our previously reported SETUP trial, we found better survival in patients with AE-IIPs treated with corticosteroids and thrombomodulin than in those treated with corticosteroids alone. In that study, we collected serum samples to evaluate changes in cytokine levels and retrospectively examined the prognostic significance and pathophysiological role of serum cytokines in patients with AE-IIPs. METHODS: This study included 28 patients from the SETUP trial for whom serial serum samples had been prospectively obtained. AE-IIPs were diagnosed using the Japanese Respiratory Society criteria. All patients were treated with intravenous thrombomodulin and corticosteroids from 2014 to 2016. Serum levels of 27 cytokines were measured using Bio-Plex. The high-resolution CT pattern at the time of diagnosis of AE was classified as diffuse or non-diffuse. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that higher serum levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12, IL13, basic fibroblast growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ inducible protein-10, platelet-derived growth factor and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) at AE were significant predictors of 90-day survival. The HRCT pattern was also a significant clinical predictor of 90-day survival. Multivariate analysis with stepwise selection identified a higher serum RANTES level at AE to be a significant predictor of 90-day survival, including after adjustment for HRCT pattern. Multivariate analysis with stepwise selection suggested that a marked increase in the serum IL-10 level on day 8 could predict 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A higher serum RANTES level at AE the time of diagnosis predicted a good survival outcome, and an elevated serum IL-10 level on day 8 predicted a poor survival outcome.

20148,"Clinical manifestations, risk factors, and prognostic factors of cytomegalovirus enteritis",2021-08-18,"ABSTRACT: Recently, the occurrence of candidiasis has increased dramatically, especially in immunocompromised patients. Additionally, their treatment is often ineffective due to the resistance of yeasts to antimycotics. Therefore, there is a need to search for new antifungals. A series of nine newly synthesized thiazole derivatives containing the cyclopropane system, showing promising activity against Candida spp., has been further investigated. We decided to verify their antifungal activity towards clinical Candida albicans isolated from the oral cavity of patients with hematological malignancies and investigate the mode of action on fungal cell, the effect of combination with the selected antimycotics, toxicity to erythrocytes, and lipophilicity. These studies were performed by the broth microdilution method, test with sorbitol and ergosterol, checkerboard technique, erythrocyte lysis assay, and reversed phase thin-layer chromatography, respectively. All derivatives showed very strong activity (similar and even higher than nystatin) against all C. albicans isolates with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.008–7.81 µg/mL Their mechanism of action may be related to action within the fungal cell wall structure and/or within the cell membrane. The interactions between the derivatives and the selected antimycotics (nystatin, chlorhexidine, and thymol) showed additive effect only in the case of combination some of them and thymol. The erythrocyte lysis assay confirmed the low cytotoxicity of these compounds as compared to nystatin. The high lipophilicity of the derivatives was related with their high antifungal activity. The present studies confirm that the studied thiazole derivatives containing the cyclopropane system appear to be a very promising group of compounds in treatment of infections caused by C. albicans. However, this requires further studies in vivo. KEY POINTS: • The newly thiazoles showed high antifungal activity and some of them — additive effect in combination with thymol. • Their mode of action may be related with the influence on the structure of the fungal cell wall and/or the cell membrane. • The low cytotoxicity against erythrocytes and high lipophilicity of these derivatives are their additional good properties.

20346,Aging in Place: Estimating the Impact of Unexpected Intensive Care Unit Admission on Long-Term Functional Outcomes of Older Adults after Major Cancer Surgery,2021-08-26,"Endothelial dysfunction is a key hallmark of hypertension, which is a leading risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults with or without frailty. Similarly, hyperglycemia is known to impair endothelial function and is a predictor of severe cardiovascular outcomes, independent of the presence of diabetes. On these grounds, we designed a study to assess the effects of high-glucose and metformin on brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) and on cognitive impairment in frail hypertensive patients. We tested the effects of metformin on high-glucose-induced cell death, cell permeability, and generation of reactive oxygen species in vitro, in human brain microvascular ECs. To investigate the consequences of hyperglycemia and metformin in the clinical scenario, we recruited frail hypertensive patients and we evaluated their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, comparing them according to the glycemic status (normoglycemic vs. hyperglycemic) and the use of metformin. We enrolled 376 patients, of which 209 successfully completed the study. We observed a significant correlation between MoCA score and glycemia. We found that hyperglycemic patients treated with metformin had a significantly better MoCA score than hyperglycemic patients treated with insulin (18.32 ± 3.9 vs. 14.94 ± 3.8; p < 0.001). Our in vitro assays confirmed the beneficial effects of metformin on human brain microvascular ECs. To our knowledge, this is the first study correlating MoCA score and glycemia in frail and hypertensive older adults, showing that hyperglycemia aggravates cognitive impairment.","Mone, Pasquale; Gambardella, Jessica; Pansini, Antonella; de Donato, Antonio; Martinelli, Giuseppe; Boccalone, Eugenio; Matarese, Alessandro; Frullone, Salvatore; Santulli, Gaetano",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391431/,230
20770,Validation of the Clinical Assessment Scale for Autoimmune Encephalitis: A Multicenter Study,2021-09-02,"BACKGROUND: The horn fly, Haematobia irritans irritans, causes significant production losses to the cattle industry. Horn fly control relies on insecticides; however, alternative control methods such as vaccines are needed due to the fly's capacity to quickly develop resistance to insecticides, and the pressure for eco-friendly options. METHODS: We used a reverse vaccinology approach comprising three vaccine prediction and 11 annotation tools to evaluate and rank 79,542 translated open reading frames (ORFs) from the horn fly's transcriptome, and selected 10 transcript ORFs as vaccine candidates for expression in Pichia pastoris. The expression of the 10 selected transcripts and the proteins that they encoded were investigated in adult flies by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and mass spectrometry, respectively. Then, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a vaccine candidate in an immunization trial and the antigen’s effects on horn fly mortality and fecundity in an in vitro feeding assay. RESULTS: Six of the ten vaccine candidate antigens were successfully expressed in P. pastoris. RT-PCR confirmed the expression of all six ORFs in adult fly RNA. One of the vaccine candidate antigens, BI-HS009, was expressed in sufficient quantity for immunogenicity and efficacy trials. The IgG titers of animals vaccinated with BI-HS009 plus adjuvant were significantly higher than those of animals vaccinated with buffer plus adjuvant only from days 42 to 112, with a peak on day 56. Progeny of horn flies feeding upon blood from animals vaccinated with BI-HS009 plus adjuvant collected on day 56 had 63% lower pupariation rate and 57% lower adult emergence than the control group (ANOVA: F ((1, 6)) = 8.221, P = 0.028 and F ((1, 6)) = 8.299, P = 0.028, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The reverse vaccinology approach streamlined the discovery process by prioritizing possible vaccine antigen candidates. Through a thoughtful process of selection and in vivo and in vitro evaluations, we were able to identify a promising antigen for an anti-horn fly vaccine.

The results showed that compounds 3e, 3f, 3h, 3i, 3j, and 3k possess effective tyrosinase inhibition with IC(50) values ranging from 7.30 μM to 62.60 μM. Particularly, compounds 3f displayed around three-fold improvement in the potency (IC(50) = 7.30 ± 1.15 μM) compared to that of kojic acid (IC(50) = 20.24 ± 2.28 μM) as the positive control. Kinetic study of compound 3f confirmed uncompetitive inhibitory activity towards tyrosinase indicating that it can bind to enzyme–substrate complex. Next, molecular docking analysis was performed to study the interactions and binding mode of the most potent compound 3f in the tyrosinase active site. Besides, the cytotoxicity of 3f, as well as its potency to reduce the melanin content were also measured on invasive melanoma B16F10 cell line. Also, 3f exhibited above 82% cell viability in the A375 cell line at 10 µM.

Remarkable advances have been made in cancer therapy and the 5-year survival has increased for most patients affected by malignancy. There are growing numbers of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and up to 20% of all patients admitted to an ICU carry a diagnosis of malignancy. Respiratory failure remains the most common reason for ICU admission and remains the leading causes of death in oncology patients. There are many causes of respiratory failure in this population. Pneumonia is the most common cause of respiratory failure, yet there are many causes of respiratory insufficiency unique to the cancer patient. These causes are often a result of immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). Treatment is focused on supportive care and specific therapy for the underlying cause of respiratory failure. Noninvasive modalities of respiratory support are available; however, careful patient selection is paramount as indiscriminate use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is associated with a higher mortality if mechanical ventilation is later required. Historically, respiratory failure in the cancer patient had a grim prognosis. Outcomes have improved over the past 20 years.

Our findings strongly suggest ongoing alignment and convergence between the SDGs and BRI, as exemplified by the recent overt inclusion of BRI within the UN’s 2030 Agenda. However, realization of such promising synergies hinges on several variables, including the geopolitical and public health environments, the adoption of more holistic trade and investment strategies, and greater openness and inclusiveness towards non-Chinese and local businesses, particularly regarding their participation in BRI sustainable infrastructure investment projects.

48692,Cybersecurity of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices,2020-11-05,"In this work, we present a multi-agent robotic system which explores the use of unpleasant emotions triggered by visual, sound and behavioural affordances of autonomous agents to interact with humans for preserving social distance in public spaces in a context of a pandemic emergency. The idea was born in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, where discomfort and fear have been widely used by governments to preserve social distancing. This work does not implicitly endorse the use of fear to keep order but explores controlled and moderate automated exploitations. On the contrary, it deeply analyses the pros and cons of the ethical use of robots with emotion recognition and triggering capabilities. The system employs a swarm of all-terrain hexapods patrolling a public open space and generally having a discrete and seamless presence. The goal is to preserve the social distance among the public with effective but minimal intervention, limited to anomaly detection. The single agents implement critical tasks: context detection strategies, triggering negative emotions at different degrees of arousal using affordances ranging from appearance and simple proximity or movements to disturbing sounds or explicit voice messages. The whole system exhibits an emerging swarm behaviour where the agents cooperate and coordinate in a distributed way, adapting and reacting to the context. An innovative contribution of this work, more than the application, is the use of unpleasant emotions affordances in an ethical way, to attract user attention and induce the desired behaviour in the emergency. This work also introduces a method for assessment of the emotional level of individuals and groups of people in the context of swarm agents. The system extends the experience of the gAItano hexapod project, an autonomous agent with image detection and planned object relocation capabilities.","Franzoni, Valentina; Biondi, Giulio; Milani, Alfredo",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978576/,230

Stepping into an empirical site where patients log in to their own site, ‘MyChart’, we inquire their practices reading health care data and their imaginaries about active involvement in their own health care. With this, our analysis focuses on the active patient and aims to bring forth local imaginaries in an effort to nuance data imaginaries located in political strategies, which relate data access with active partnerships. Within this, we illustrate how patients are active, while data is silent and in need of work before it vocals meaningful for the patients.","Laursen, Cæcilie Sloth; Finken, Sisse",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979026/,230
50090,Platelet Indices and Their Kinetics Predict Mortality in Patients of Sepsis,2021-03-24,"The termination behavior of probabilistic programs depends on the outcomes of random assignments. Almost sure termination (AST) is concerned with the question whether a program terminates with probability one on all possible inputs. Positive almost sure termination (PAST) focuses on termination in a finite expected number of steps. This paper presents a fully automated approach to the termination analysis of probabilistic while-programs whose guards and expressions are polynomial expressions. As proving (positive) AST is undecidable in general, existing proof rules typically provide sufficient conditions. These conditions mostly involve constraints on supermartingales. We consider four proof rules from the literature and extend these with generalizations of existing proof rules for (P)AST. We automate the resulting set of proof rules by effectively computing asymptotic bounds on polynomials over the program variables. These bounds are used to decide the sufficient conditions – including the constraints on supermartingales – of a proof rule. Our software tool Amber can thus check AST, PAST, as well as their negations for a large class of polynomial probabilistic programs, while carrying out the termination reasoning fully with polynomial witnesses. Experimental results show the merits of our generalized proof rules and demonstrate that Amber can handle probabilistic programs that are out of reach for other state-of-the-art tools.","Moosbrugger, Marcel; Bartocci, Ezio; Katoen, Joost-Pieter; Kovács, Laura",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984538/,230

The method comprises the following steps of: analyzing the motion characteristic quantity of the swing of a sprinting training limb, carrying out a sprinting training limb swinging image acquisition by adopting an infrared characteristic scanning technology, carrying out edge contour detection on the collected sprinting training limb swinging image. Carrying out contour segmentation and characteristic identification of the swinging of the limb of the sprinting training limb in combination with the image segmentation technology, constructing a gray histogram distribution structure model of a sprinting training limb swing image, and carrying out effective extraction of the motion characteristics of the limb swing and the motion characteristic of the sprinting training limb by adopting a regional block matching method, The method of multi-dimensional space reconstruction is adopted to simulate the motion of the limb, and the visual signal processing and the key feature point calibration method are adopted to calibrate and detect the characteristic points of the limb swing of the sprinting training, so as to realize the optimal recognition of the swing of the training limb of the sprinter. The simulation results show that the method of the invention has the advantages of high accuracy, good characteristic identification ability and the capability of improving the swing image recognition ability of the sprinter training limb.","Chen, Chong-gao; Ren, Jia",Multimedia Technology and Enhanced Learning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991468/,230

However, there remain considerable gaps in understanding “how do we actually do convergence?” In this article, we present three case studies from across geographies—New South Wales in Australia, and North Carolina and Oregon in the United States; and sectors of work—community, environmental, and urban resilience, to critically examine what convergence entails and how it can enable diverse disciplines, people, and institutions to reduce vulnerability to systemic risks in the twenty-first century. We identify key successes, challenges, and barriers to convergence. We build on current discussions around the need for convergence research to be problem-focused and solutions-based, by also considering the need to approach convergence as ethic, method, and outcome. We reflect on how convergence can be approached as an ethic that motivates a higher order alignment on “why” we come together; as a method that foregrounds “how” we come together in inclusive ways; and as an outcome that highlights “what” must be done to successfully translate research findings into the policy and public domains.","Lakhina, Shefali Juneja; Sutley, Elaina J.; Wilson, Jay",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993904/,230

First of all, governance itself has been shown to have several deficits and has been radically affected. Furthermore, it is questionable as to what challenges the BRICS will face internally in the future, especially at the end of the pandemic, and whether they will give rise to a new global order. For this reason, in this paper, we analyse the meaning of “power transition” and “hegemony”, and we also try to give a reading of some practices carried out by the BRICS in the fields of climate change governance, the inclusion of civil society and the role that these countries play in international institutions such as the United Nations and in forums such as the G20. Having noted the limits in these areas, our idea is that today, more than ever, the need to have a global approach to development is increasingly necessary. Even the BRICS, which in reality do not seem willing to overturn the current international context, will be called upon to play an important role in the future of GG and international relations, specifically in contributing to carrying forward this global development approach.","Petrone, Francesco",Int Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102847/,230
53067,Hyperglicemia at the Admission as Predictor of Severity,2021-05-03,"The rise of high-quality cloud services has made service recommendation a crucial research question. Quality of Service (QoS) is widely adopted to characterize the performance of services invoked by users. For this purpose, the QoS prediction of services constitutes a decisive tool to allow end-users to optimally choose high-quality cloud services aligned with their needs. The fact is that users only consume a few of the broad range of existing services. Thereby, perform a high-accurate service recommendation becomes a challenging task. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose a data sparsity resilient service recommendation approach that aims to predict relevant services in a sustainable manner for end-users. Indeed, our method performs both a QoS prediction of the current time interval using a flexible matrix factorization technique and a QoS prediction of the future time interval using a time series forecasting method based on an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The service recommendation in our approach is based on a couple of criteria ensuring in a lasting way, the appropriateness of the services returned to the active user. The experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the competing recommendation methods.","Ngaffo, Armielle Noulapeu; Ayeb, Walid El; Choukair, Zièd",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8124023/,230

The duration of unstable situations is unpredictable and can be weeks or years. Despite these disruptions, universities have to continue to fulfil their mission to educate young people. This paper discusses the notion of the resilient university with a particular focus on academic continuity. In order to investigate the migration to online learning under the COVID-19 pandemic and examine student and faculty perceptions and lessons learned, a literature study on resilient organizations and academic continuity and a case study of the World Maritime University (WMU) were undertaken. The case study employed two methods: a focus group (qualitative) and online questionnaire (quantitative and qualitative). The results show that in order to ensure academic continuity and build resilience, the university has to develop anticipation, coping, and adaptation capabilities and act on lessons learned. The research findings revealed the capability of a university in coping with the unexpected challenges and a potential to become a resilient university.","Bartusevičienė, Inga; Pazaver, Anne; Kitada, Momoko",WMU J Marit Affairs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8127490/,230

To protect public health, we designed and fabricated electrospun nanofibrous air filters that hold promise for applications in personal protective equipment (PPE) and the indoor environment. Due to ultrafine nanofibers (∼300 nm), the electrospun air filters had a much smaller pore size in comparison to the surgical mask and cloth masks (a couple of micrometers versus tens to hundreds of micrometers). A coronavirus strain served as a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and was used to generate aerosols for filtration efficiency tests, which can better represent SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to other agents used for aerosol generation in previous studies. The electrospun air filters showed excellent performance by capturing up to 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols, which outperformed many commercial face masks. In addition, we observed that the same electrospun air filter or face mask removed NaCl aerosols equivalently or less effectively in comparison to the coronavirus aerosols when both aerosols were generated from the same system. Our work paves a new avenue for advancing air filtration by developing electrospun nanofibrous air filters for controlling SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission.","Shen, Hongchen; Zhou, Zhe; Wang, Haihuan; Zhang, Mengyang; Han, Minghao; Durkin, David P.; Shuai, Danmeng; Shen, Yun",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147445/,230
54212,P642 Effects of Covid-19 on employment in IBD patients,2021-05-27,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to complement existing cash transfer programs and at improving food security among Syrian refugees (SR) in Lebanon by (1) examining their food literacy and food purchasing behaviors and (2) developing a social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) strategy. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted (Jan – Feb 2020) in two phases: Phase1 included 2 focus group discussions (FGD) among 21 SR women receiving cash assistance in Tyre, Lebanon to identify food literacy gaps and preferred health communication channels. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants (KI) from international and non-governmental organizations working with SR; Phase 2 utilized qualitative findings for the development of a culturally-appropriate SBCC strategy to improve the food purchasing and healthy dietary behaviors of SR. Five months after phase 2, key findings were shared with KI through interviews in a form of ‘member checking’ to enhance data credibility and inform the interpretations of study findings in the context of COVID-19. An inductive approach to textual analysis was used to identify key themes and sub-themes for interpretation. RESULTS: Three major themes emerged from phase 1 data: Theme 1 reflected the highly precarious conditions of settlement camps that make it difficult for refugees to be food secure. Theme 2 suggested several determinants of food purchasing behaviors (limited nutrition knowledge, poor dietary habits contributing to sub-optimal dietary diversity, and limited exposure to nutrition education on food resource management and budgeting). Theme 3 revealed important nutrition education needs, as well as preferred channels to receive such information (e.g., group education, one-on-one counselling sessions, and WhatsApp-based messaging). Other communication channels suggested by KI, and that differed from those suggested by the refugee community in phase 1, included mass media campaigns and community mobilization. CONCLUSIONS: Due to both environmental challenges and individual-level factors, SR living in Tyre, Lebanon were found to have poor dietary choices, thus an SBSS strategy tailored to their needs may help improve their food purchasing behaviors and alleviate their food insecurity levels.

58962,Investigation of fatigue and anxiety in patients with multiple sclerosis during COVID-19,2021-10-08,"Network interdiction problems by upgading critical edges/nodes have important applications to reduce the infectivity of the COVID-19. A network of confirmed cases can be described as a rooted tree that has a weight of infectious intensity for each edge. Upgrading edges (nodes) can reduce the infectious intensity with contacts by taking prevention measures such as disinfection (treating the confirmed cases, isolating their close contacts or vaccinating the uninfected people). We take the sum of root-leaf distance on a rooted tree as the whole infectious intensity of the tree. Hence, we consider the sum of root-leaf distance interdiction problem by upgrading edges/nodes on trees (SDIPT-UE/N). The problem (SDIPT-UE) aims to minimize the sum of root-leaf distance by reducing the weights of some critical edges such that the upgrade cost under some measurement is upper-bounded by a given value. Different from the problem (SDIPT-UE), the problem (SDIPT-UN) aims to upgrade a set of critical nodes to reduce the weights of the edges adjacent to the nodes. The relevant minimum cost problem (MCSDIPT-UE/N) aims to minimize the upgrade cost on the premise that the sum of root-leaf distance is upper-bounded by a given value. We develop different norms to measure the upgrade cost. Under weighted Hamming distance, we show the problems (SDIPT-UE/N) and (MCSDIPT-UE/N) are NP-hard by showing the equivalence of the two problems and the 0–1 knapsack problem. Under weighted [Formula: see text] norm, we solve the problems (SDIPT-UE) and (MCSDIPT-UE) in O(n) time by transforimg them into continuous knapsack problems. We propose two linear time greedy algorithms to solve the problem (SDIPT-UE) under unit Hamming distance and the problem (SDIPT-UN) with unit cost, respectively. Furthermore, for the the minimum cost problem (MCSDIPT-UE) under unit Hamming distance and the problem (MCSDIPT-UN) with unit cost, we provide two [Formula: see text] time algorithms by the binary search methods.

The theoretically sound and differentiated concepts are increasingly being escalated and misused in political practice by authoritarian populists and polarising pushers who try to pull the undecided to their side and tear society apart.

In this article, after an introductory definition of polarisation, two future scenarios are developed. In the scenario “Polarised Europe”, polarisation is extrapolated into the future and discussed with its serious consequences for the democratic and European consensus. The second scenario “Democratised Europe” shows how the concept of a relative cosmopolitanism can mitigate polarisation and what steps could possibly be taken to constructively turn it into a more democratic direction.","Pausch, Markus",Eur J Futures Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502502/,230

Decisions such as isolation, social distancing and quarantine made by countries unexpectedly and suddenly forced face-to-face education to change to distance education within days. All academics around the world had to move online overnight. All the educational and academic activities in higher education (courses, exams, meetings, etc.) had to be conducted online in a few days. Based on these changes, this study aimed to analyze the relationships among student, faculty (adaptations of faculty members to distance education) and institutional (distance learning capacities of the universities) variables that affected satisfaction of the students related to distance education in higher education institutions in Turkey during COVID-19 pandemic using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The study group included 14,962 students and 3631 academics from 30 universities. The results showed that universities with higher distance education capacities got higher satisfaction scores. HLM analysis showed that 43% of the variation in satisfaction scores resulted from universities. The second HLM analysis showed that 44% of the overall satisfaction score variance of the students could be explained by the factors of university features (Level 2: distance education capacity and acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members). Thus, it was determined that 44% of the university factor calculated as 43% in Model 1 (which is calculated within students’ general satisfaction scores) resulted from the distance education capacity and the acceptance and use of distance education systems of faculty members.

METHODOLOGY: In this prospective single centre study, consecutive patients diagnosed with RTPCR confirmed COVID 19 were included after 4–6 weeks of discharge from hospital. All patients underwent level I PSG. EEG was analysed for presence of abnormal EEG pattern. RESULTS: Total 189 patients were contacted telephonically for participation in this study. Finally 81 patients (55 males, 26 females) underwent Level I PSG. Total sleep time was 345.1 ± 85.1 min. Sleep efficiency was 76.0 ± 14.2%. Mean time (%) during N1, N2, N3 and Rapid Eye movement (REM) was 16.4%, 59.2%, 7.9% and 18.4% percentage, respectively. Mean AHI was 28.7 ± 22.8 per hour and arousal index was 23.9 ± 13.3. Alpha intrusion was the most common EEG finding (78%), followed by cyclical alternating pattern (59%). REM density was significantly increased in 38% of patients.

Medical personnel have a special role in containing the pandemic. The aim of the study was to investigate the SARS-CoV‑2 IgG antibody prevalence in extraclinical personnel depending on their operational area in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: On May 28 and 29, 2020, serum samples were taken from 732 of 1183 employees (61.9%) of the professional fire brigade and aid organizations in the city area and tested for SARS-CoV‑2 IgG antibodies. The employees were divided into four categories according to their type of participation. category 1: decentralized PCR sampling teams, category 2: rescue service, category 3: fire protection, category 4: situation center. Some employees participated in more than one operational area. RESULTS: SARS-CoV‑2 IgG antibodies were detected in 8 of 732 serum samples. This corresponds to a prevalence of 1.1%. A previous COVID-19 infection was known in 3 employees. In order to make a separate assessment of the other employees possible and to diagnose unknown infections, a corrected collective of 729 employees with 6 SARS-CoV‑2 antibody detection was considered separately.

We searched for risk factors in patients with gynecologic cancers and complemented this with a literature review. METHODS Evaluation of prospectively gathered information on all consecutive robotic surgeries for gynecologic cancers was performed in a tertiary academic cancer center between December 2007 and March 2012. The literature was reviewed for articles relevant to ""gynecologic oncology"" and ""robotics"" with ""vaginal cuff dehiscence"" in the English and French languages. Respective authors were contacted to complete relevant information. RESULTS Seven dehiscences were identified of 441 cases with established gynecologic cancers. The closures in these 7 were performed using interrupted 1-Vicryl (Ethicon Inc) (3/167; 1.8%), combination of interrupted 1-Vicryl and 1-Biosyn (Covidien Inc) (3/156, 1.9%), and V-Loc (Covidien Inc) (1/118, 0.8%) sutures. Associated risk factors included adjuvant chemotherapy and/or brachytherapy, early resumption of sexual activity, and low body mass index (mean, 23 ± 3.23 kg/m²). Dehiscences occurred regardless of suturing by staff or trainees. Review of operative videos did not reveal a detectable etiologic factor, such as excessive cautery damage to the vaginal cuff or shallow tissue sutured. All 7 colporrhexis repairs were performed through a vaginal approach without the need of laparoscopy or laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative chemotherapy, brachytherapy, and early resumption of sexual activities are risk factors for vaginal vault dehiscence. Surgical technique, particularly the use of delayed absorbable sutures, deserves further evaluation.","Drudi, Laura; Press, Joshua Z; Lau, Susie; Gotlieb, Raphael; How, Jeffrey; Eniu, Ioana; Drummond, Nancy; Brin, Sonya; Deland, Claire; Gotlieb, Walter H",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/igc.0b013e31828f38e1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23669442/,230

Whether proteinuria better predicts outcome than eGFR in stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) remains to be determined. METHODS In this explorative multicenter IVT register based study, the presence of urine dipstick proteinuria (yes/no), reduced eGFR (<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) and the coexistence of both with regard to (i) poor 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3-6), (ii) death within 3 months and (iii) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ECASS-II criteria) were compared. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS Amongst 3398 patients, 881 (26.1%) had proteinuria and 623 (18.3%) reduced eGFR. Proteinuria [ORadjusted 1.65 (1.37-2.00) and ORadjusted 1.52 (1.24-1.88)] and reduced eGFR [ORadjusted 1.26 (1.01-1.57) and ORadjusted 1.34 (1.06-1.69)] were independently associated with poor functional outcome and death, respectively. After adding both renal markers to the models, proteinuria [ORadjusted+eGFR 1.59 (1.31-1.93)] still predicted poor outcome whilst reduced eGFR [ORadjusted+proteinuria 1.20 (0.96-1.50)] did not. Proteinuria was associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [ORadjusted 1.54 (1.09-2.17)] but not reduced eGFR [ORadjusted 0.96 (0.63-1.62)]. In 234 (6.9%) patients, proteinuria and reduced eGFR were coexistent. Such patients were at the highest risk of poor outcome [ORadjusted 2.16 (1.54-3.03)] and death [ORadjusted 2.55 (1.69-3.84)]. CONCLUSION Proteinuria and reduced eGFR were each independently associated with poor outcome and death but the statistically strongest association appeared for proteinuria. Patients with coexistent proteinuria and reduced eGFR were at the highest risk of poor outcome and death.","Gensicke, H; Frih, A A; Strbian, D; Zini, A; Pezzini, A; Padjen, V; Haueter, M; Seiffge, D J; Mäkitie, L; Traenka, C; Poli, L; Martinez-Majander, N; Putaala, J; Bonati, L H; Sibolt, G; Giovannini, G; Curtze, S; Beslac-Bumbasirevic, L; Vandelli, L; Lyrer, P A; Nederkoorn, P J; Tatlisumak, T; Engelter, S T",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.13179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862667/,230

60958,Safety and role of chest CT in COVID-19 patients.,2020-05-22,"Introduction Beginning in 1999, residents in emergency medicine have been expected to demonstrate competence in the six Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Core Competencies. Expectations were further refined and clarified through the introduction of the Milestones in 2013. Emerging research and data from milestone reporting has illustrated the need for modification of the original milestones. Against this backdrop, the ACGME convened a committee to review and revise the original milestones. Methods The working group was convened in December 2018 and consisted of representatives from the American Board of Emergency Medicine, American Osteopathic Association, Council of Residency Directors in Emergency Medicine, Association of American Medical Colleges, ACGME-Emergency Medicine Review Committee, three community members, a resident member, and a public member. This group also included members from both academic and community emergency medicine programs. The group was overseen by the ACGME vice president for milestones development and met in person one time followed by four virtual sessions to revise and draft the Emergency Medicine Milestones and Supplemental Guide as part of the ACGME Milestones 2.0 Project. Results Using data from milestones reporting, needs assessment data, stakeholder interviews, and community commentary, the working group engaged in revisions and updates for the Emergency Medicine Milestones and created a supplemental guide to aid programs in the design of programmatic assessment for the milestones. Conclusion The Emergency Medicine Milestones 2.0 provide updated specialty-specific, competency-based behavioral anchors to guide the assessment of residents, the design of curricula, and the advancement of emergency medicine training programs.","Cooney, Robert R; Murano, Tiffany; Ring, Hope; Starr, Ryan; Beeson, Michael S; Edgar, Laura",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471793/,230

61167,Cardiac Effects of Music and a Presidential Impeachment.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is reportedly associated with increased prevalence rates of cognitive impairment. However, data concerning the association between the cerebral saturation of oxygen (rSO2) and cognitive function of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is limited. This study aimed to (i) elucidate the clinical factors associating with cerebral rSO2 and (ii) investigate the association between cerebral rSO2 and cognitive assessment in CKD patients. METHODS A total of 40 CKD patients not requiring dialysis (26 men and 14 women; mean age, 61.0 ± 2.7 years) were recruited. The numbers of patients at each CKD stage were as follows: G1, 5; G2, 8; G3a, 6; G3b, 5; G4, 11; and G5, 5. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored at the forehead using the oxygen saturation monitor INVOS 5100C. The cognitive function of each patient was confirmed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS Cerebral rSO2 levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in hemodialysis patients (63.8 ± 1.5% vs. 44.9 ± 2.2%, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with eGFR (standardized coefficient: 0.530), serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.365), and serum sodium concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.224). Furthermore, MMSE showed a significantly positive correlation with cerebral rSO2 (r = 0.624, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Cerebral rSO2 was affected by eGFR and serum albumin and sodium concentrations in CKD patients. Furthermore, cerebral rSO2 monitoring, which reflected MMSE scores, might be a useful method for assessing cognitive function in CKD patients.","Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Ookawara, Susumu; Ito, Kiyonori; Ueda, Yuichiro; Yanai, Katsunori; Ishii, Hiroki; Mutsuyoshi, Yuko; Kitano, Taisuke; Shindo, Mitsutoshi; Aomatsu, Akinori; Hirai, Keiji; Hoshino, Taro; Morishita, Yoshiyuki",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940017/,230

The expression of these receptors on the ocular surface is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS Gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was investigated in conjunctival epithelial cell samples and in ex-vivo cornea samples using microarray or transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS ACE2 is expressed in conjunctival samples at a low level, while BSG and TMPRSS2 are expressed at intermediate levels in both conjunctiva and cornea. Other receptors such as ANPEP, AGTR2 are expressed at low level in the conjunctiva. Two RNA editing enzymes involved in antiviral responses, APOBEC3A, and ADAR-1 were also highly expressed. CONCLUSIONS The ocular surface may represent an entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. The conjunctiva and the cornea can adopt antiviral countermeasures which may explain the low prevalence of eye involvement.","Leonardi, Andrea; Rosani, Umberto; Brun, Paola",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2020.1772314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589459/,230
62225,Radiotherapy for cranial and brain metastases from prostate cancer: a systematic review.,2017,"BACKGROUND Surgical resection is still the main treatment option for patients with resectable Siewert type II adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG). This retrospective study evaluated the significance of minimally invasive Sweet esophagectomy (MISE) for the treatment of Siewert type II AEG. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 174 patients with Siewert type II AEG who received a Sweet esophagectomy in our center between October 2013 and September 2017. Of these patients, 73 underwent MISE and 101 underwent open Sweet esophagectomy (OSE). The clinicopathologic factors, operational factors and postoperative complications were compared. RESULTS The two groups were similar in terms of age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, preoperative staging and incidence of comorbidities (P > 0.05). Relative to the OSE approach, the MISE approach was associated with a significant decrease in surgical blood loss (P < 0.001), chest tube duration (P = 0.003) and postoperative admission duration (P = 0.002). The minimally invasive approach was associated with significantly less total morbidity and fewer respiratory complications than the open approach (P = 0.015 and P = 0.016, respectively). Relative to the open approach, the MISE approach was associated with a significant increase in the number of total lymph nodes removed and the locations of the total lymph nodes removed (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our MISE technique can be safely and effectively performed for intrathoracic anastomosis with favorable early outcomes.","Sun, Xiaohui; Wang, Gaoxiang; Liu, Changqing; Xiong, Ran; Wu, Hanran; Xie, Mingran; Xu, Shibin",Thoracic cancer,https://doi.org/10.1111/1759-7714.13415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239662/,230

METHODS We searched the English language literature between January 1990 and March 2020 in Medline, Embase, Emcare, PubMed, Psych Info, CINAHL, Scopus, and Medline Epub ahead of print. Data extraction, quality rating, and assessment of the reporting of interventions were performed by two reviewers independently and the findings were synthesized narratively. RESULTS Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria. All but two were carried out in the USA and half were randomized controlled trials. Six of the 29 studies were of strong methodological quality while 12 were moderate and 11 weak. Overall, CHW navigation interventions were effective in increasing adherence to cancer screening and improving use of primary care for chronic disease management. There was insufficient evidence that they improved clinical outcomes or risk factors and reduced use of secondary or tertiary care or that they were cost-effective. However, criteria for recruitment, duration, and mode of training and supervision arrangements varied greatly between studies. DISCUSSION CHW navigation interventions improved aspects of chronic disease management. However, there is insufficient evidence of the impact on patient experience, clinical outcomes, or cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Future research should focus on standardizing organizational components of the CHW navigation interventions and evaluating their cost-effectiveness.

62969,Induction of labor and nulliparity: a nation-wide clinical practice pilot evaluation.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND 'Gendered working environments' describes the ways in which (1) differential selection into work, (2) variations in employment arrangements and working hours, (3) differences in psychosocial exposures and (4) differential selection out of work may produce varied mental health outcomes for men and women. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to understand gender differences in mental health outcomes in relation to the components of gendered working environments. METHODS The review followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) search approach and focused on studies published in 2008-2018. The protocol for the review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019124066). FINDINGS Across the 27 cohort studies included in the review, we found that (1) there was inconclusive evidence on the effect of occupational gender composition on the mental health of men and women, (2) women's mental health was more likely to be affected by long working hours than men's; however, precarious employment was more likely to be negatively associated with men's mental health, (3) exposure to traditional constructs of psychosocial job stressors negatively affected the mental health of both women and men, and (4) unemployment and retirement are associated with poorer mental health in both genders. INTERPRETATION The findings from this review indicate that gendered working environments may affect the mental health of both men and women, but the association is dependent on the specific exposure examined. There is still much to be understood about gendered working environments, and future research into work and health should be considered with a gender lens.","Milner, Allison; Scovelle, Anna Joy; King, Tania; Marck, Claudia; McAllister, Ashley; Kavanagh, Anne; Shields, Marissa; Török, Eszter; Maheen, Humaira; O'Neil, Adrienne",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2019-106281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817251/,230

METHODS Thirty-seven IBV isolates were isolated from commercial chickens in China. The isolates were characterized by RT-PCR, sequencing, typing and analyzing the entire S1 gene. In addition, 4 selected IBV isolates were used to experimentally infect the specific pathogen-free chickens to study their pathogenicity. RESULTS Three types of IBV have been cocirculating in chicken flocks in China in recent years. Unique insertions and deletions in S1 protein regions were identified among different types of IBV. Moreover, a new IBV strain was isolated and identified in a layer hen. S1 gene analysis showed that a recombination event had occurred in the virus's evolutionary process. In addition, experimental infection has shown that IBV isolates have been nephropathogenic in China in recent years. CONCLUSION Mutations, insertions, deletions and recombination of the S1 protein gene contribute to the genetic diversity of IBV in China. Cocirculation of multiple types of IBV in field conditions in China renders its epidemiology and evolution very complicated, indicating the necessity for development of new vaccines or vaccine strategies.","Liu, Shengwang; Zhang, Xiaonan; Wang, Yu; Li, Chengren; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Kong, Xiangang",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000227134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19590226/,230

66027,Incidence and risk factors for seizures associated with deep brain stimulation surgery.,2020-08-07,"BACKGROUND Compared to end-to-side anastomosis with a circular stapler, the overlap method is favored for intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy because it facilitates handling of the stapler, even in narrow spaces, and wider anastomosis. However, it associates with technical difficulties during anastomosis, including difficult traction on the esophageal stump that necessitates stay sutures. Here, we introduce a new modified overlap method that employs knotless barbed sutures (MOBS) and report the outcomes of our case series. METHOD All consecutive patients who underwent intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy in 2015-2016 were included. All patients underwent surgery as follows: After esophageal transection with a linear stapler, two V-loc 90 sutures (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) were sutured in the center of the stapled line. The opening was made between the two threads, and the intraluminal space was identified. The jejunum was ascended toward the esophageal stump by inserting a 45-mm-long linear staple. The anastomosis was made at the space between the right and left crura. After firing the linear stapler, the entry hole was closed bidirectionally using the pre-sutured threads. RESULTS Forty patients underwent MOBS (27 by laparoscopy; 13 by robot). Mean total operative and MOBS procedural times were 180.6 and 22.4 min, respectively. Mean hospital stay was 6.9 days. Two patients had major complications (5.0 %). There were no anastomosis-related complications. Laparoscopy and robot subgroups did not differ in mean MOBS procedural times (22.2 vs. 22.7 min, p = 0.787). CONCLUSION MOBS is a safe and feasible method that is a good option for intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy after laparoscopic gastrectomy.","Son, Sang-Yong; Cui, Long-Hai; Shin, Ho-Jung; Byun, Cheulsu; Hur, Hoon; Han, Sang-Uk; Cho, Yong Kwan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5269-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27699517/,230
66178,Systematic Review of Video Education in Underrepresented Minority Cancer Survivors.,2020-05-25,"PURPOSE To report a subanalysis of the German centers enrolling patients in the prospective, global, multicenter, randomized LEVANT 2 pivotal trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01412541) of the Lutonix drug-coated balloon (DCB) for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease. METHODS Among the 476 patients in LEVANT 2, 126 patients (mean age 67.1±9.6 years; 79 men) were enrolled at the 8 participating German sites between August 2011 and July 2012 and were randomized 2:1 to treatment with the Lutonix DCB (n=83) vs an uncoated balloon during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, n=43). All patients had intermittent claudication or rest pain (Rutherford categories 2-4). Average lesion length was 58 mm and average treated length was 100 mm. Severe calcification was present in 11% of lesions, and 23% were total occlusions. The efficacy outcome was primary patency at 12 months, and the safety outcome was 12-month freedom from a composite of perioperative death, index limb-related death, amputation (below or above the ankle), and index limb revascularization. Secondary endpoints included target lesion revascularization (TLR), major adverse events, and functional outcomes. RESULTS Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched between Lutonix DCB and PTA groups, as were the final percent diameter stenosis (19%) and procedure success (91%). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 12-month primary patency rate was 80% vs 58% (p=0.015) and the composite safety endpoint rate was 94% vs 72% (p=0.001), respectively. Freedom from TLR was higher for DCBs (96%) vs PTA (82%, p=0.012). Major adverse events were similar for both groups. The benefit favoring DCB over PTA was observed in German men and women. Compared to the non-German LEVANT 2 cohort, there was a shorter time between insertion and inflation of treatment balloons (21.8 vs 39.5 seconds, p<0.001) in the German cohort. Balloons were inflated to higher pressures (9.0 vs 7.7 atm, p<0.001) but for a shorter period of time (130 vs 167 seconds, p<0.001), and although treated lesions in the German cohort had a higher baseline stenosis, final postprocedure diameter stenosis was lower (19% vs 22%, p=0.04) than in the non-German patients. CONCLUSION Superiority of DCB over PTA in the German cohort of LEVANT 2 was demonstrated for primary patency, composite safety, and freedom from TLR. The benefit of DCB was also consistent for both genders. Geographic or regional differences in procedural variables may account for the different outcomes between the German and non-German cohorts.","Scheinert, Dierk; Schmidt, Andrej; Zeller, Thomas; Müller-Hülsbeck, Stefan; Sixt, Sebastian; Schröder, Henrik; Weiss, Norbert; Ketelsen, Dominik; Ricke, Jens; Steiner, Sabine; Rosenfield, Kenneth",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602816644592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27117972/,230

DESIGN Analysis of a multicenter research network TriNETX was performed including patients > 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS Outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with concurrent HIV (PLH) were compared to a propensity matched cohort of patients without HIV (non-PLH). RESULTS 50,167 patients with COVID-19 were identified (49,763 non-PLH, 404 PLH). PLH were more likely to be males, African American, obese, and have concurrent hypertension, diabetes, CKD, and nicotine dependence compared to non-PLH cohort (all p values <0.05).We performed 1:1 matching for BMI, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, chronic kidney disease, race, history of nicotine dependence and gender. In unmatched analysis, PLH had higher mortality at 30 days (RR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.01 - 2.39) and were more likely to need inpatient services (RR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.496 - 2.24). After propensity score matching, no difference in mortality was noted (RR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.69 - 2.57). A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31% vs 11.39%, RR 1.696, 95% CI: 1.21 - 2.38).Mean CRP, ferritin, ESR and LDH levels after COVID-19 diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with history of anti-retroviral treatment. CONCLUSION Crude COVID-19 mortality is higher in PLH; however, propensity matched analyses revealed no difference in outcomes, showing that higher mortality is driven by higher burden of comorbidities. Early diagnosis and intensive surveillance are needed to prevent a 'Syndemic' of diseases in this vulnerable cohort.","Hadi, Yousaf B; Naqvi, Syeda F Z; Kupec, Justin T; Sarwari, Arif R",AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000002666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796217/,230

Intravenous ribavirin can, however, be authorized for use as a result of an Emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) application as investigational treatment for patients with serious viral infections, including emerging or rare infections for which no alternative treatment is available. This retrospective study evaluated clinical experience with IV ribavirin based on a review of the FDA's EIND database and a literature review. The main outcome measures were disease condition, clinical outcomes, and adverse events (AEs). First, the FDA's EIND database was evaluated for these variables among patients authorized to receive investigational IV ribavirin. Second, published literature on IV ribavirin was reviewed for diseases treated, reported clinical outcomes, and AEs. Adverse events reported in the literature were compared with AEs listed in approved product labeling (aerosol and oral formulations). From February 1997 to December 2008, 608 IV ribavirin EIND requests were made for 19 disease conditions. Adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza infections comprised 84.7% of IV ribavirin EINDs. Inadequate reporting of clinical outcomes and AEs in the EIND database prevented analysis of either outcome. Data interpretation in the literature was limited by multiple factors, including retrospective design, small sample sizes, differences in reporting outcomes and AEs, lack of generalizability, and potential confounders such as concomitant medications, selection bias, and reporting bias. Reported AEs were consistent with labels of approved aerosol and oral formulations, except for lip and gingival swelling. However, estimates of frequency, severity, and causality of AEs associated with IV ribavirin could not be determined because of study limitations. Our study findings suggest that the literature is inconclusive on the potential benefit for continued use of IV ribavirin. A review of the literature and the FDA's EIND database suggests that prospective, controlled trials of IV ribavirin in patients with adenovirus, parainfluenza, or serious respiratory syncytial virus infections could be feasible.","Riner, Andrea; Chan-Tack, Kirk M; Murray, Jeffrey S",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.3810/pgm.2009.05.2014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19491552/,230
68392,Increased level of LIGHT/TNFSF14 is associated with survival in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,2021-01-25,"Objectives Children pose challenges to obtain quality EEG data due to excessive artifact. Collodion is used in EEG electrodes due to its water resistance and strong adhesive qualities. This study was done to evaluate differences in artifacts between the collodion and paste method. Methods 115 subjects (children age >3 years) were randomized into paste and collodion groups and artifacts evaluated at baseline and every hour over 30 s increments. Age, sleep state, and number of electrodes with artifact were also documented. T-test was performed to determine differences in the various parameters between the two groups. Results 61 subjects were in the paste group and 54 in the collodion group. Mean of total seconds of artifact from 0 to 24 h were 41.8 s in paste group versus 30.3 s in collodion group (P = 0.02). Children >11 years old had less artifact than younger children from 0 to 24 h (24.3 versus 41.2 s, P = 0.03), and from 24 to 48 h (33.1 versus 43.1 s, P = 0.03). There was a significant effect of sleep vs. awake state recordings on artifact from 0 to 24 h (30.3 versus 50.2 s, P = 0.01). Conclusion Electrode problems are common with both collodion and paste in prolonged AEEG monitoring. However, for studies less than 24 h, collodion may be a better alternative. Significance Our study provides evidence that in some cases collodion may be a better alternative to paste in terms of decreased artifacts.","Brigham, Danielle; Shah, Yash; Singh, Kanwaljit; Pavkovic, Ivan; Karkare, Shefali; Kothare, Sanjeev V",Clinical neurophysiology practice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnp.2019.11.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31890993/,230
68575,Quality of Life in Early Breast Cancer Patients: A Prospective Observational Study Using the FACT-B Questionnaire.,2021,"OBJECTIVES To examine the feasibility of early laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy for ureteral obstruction due to hysterectomy injury. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a 10-y experience from 2 institutions in patients who underwent early (<30 d) or late (>30 d) laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy for ureteral injury after hysterectomy. Evaluation of the surgery included the cause of the stricture and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS A total of 9 patients with distal ureteral injury after hysterectomy were identified. All injuries were identified and treated as early as 21 d after hysterectomy. Seven of 9 patients underwent open hysterectomy, and the remaining patients had vaginal and laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. All ureteroneocystostomy cases were managed laparoscopically without conversion to open surgery and without any intraoperative complications. The Lich-Gregoir reimplantation technique was applied in all patients, and 2 patients required a psoas hitch. The mean operative time was 206.6 min (range, 120-280 min), the mean estimated blood loss was 122.2 cc (range, 25-350 cc), and the mean admission time was 3.3 d (range, 1-7 d). Cystography showed no urine leak when the ureteral stent was removed at 4 to 6 wk after the procedure. Ureteroneocystostomy patency was followed up with cystography at 6 mo and at least 10 y after ureteroneocystostomy. CONCLUSION Early laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation may offer an alternative surgical approach to open surgery for the management of distal ureteral injuries, with favorable cosmetic results and recovery time from ureteral obstruction due to hysterectomy injury.","Pompeo, Alexandre; Molina, Wilson R; Sehrt, David; Tobias-Machado, Marcos; Mariano Costa, Renato M; Pompeo, Antonio Carlos Lima; Kim, Fernando J",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680812x13517013317437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23743383/,230

Although there has been a recent focus on the cardiovascular and renal complications associated with these agents, NSAID gastropathy continues to be a particular concern in many patients, especially those at increased risk for serious adverse events, including the elderly. Complicating the diagnosis of NSAID gastropathy is its silent course, which, up to half of the time, is asymptomatic. Several strategies are currently employed by physicians to mitigate the risk of serious gastrointestinal events. These include either addition of a proton pump inhibitor to current nonselective NSAID therapy or the use of a cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective NSAID. Although these agents are effective at mitigating the overall risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, they fail to address NSAID-related cardiovascular and renal risks. Due to their reduced systemic absorption, topical NSAIDs may present a viable option for patients at increased risk for serious NSAID-related adverse events, including gastropathy.","Roth, Sanford H",Drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/11633740-000000000-00000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22564130/,230

69283,Predicting major bleeding in patients with noncardioembolic stroke on antiplatelets: S2TOP-BLEED.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion can be concurrent with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large vessel occlusion in patients with COVID-19 are substantially unknown. Our aim was to study early outcomes after MT in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Multicenter, European, cohort study involving 34 stroke centers in France, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. Data were collected between March 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020. Consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with large vessel occlusion, who were treated with MT, were included. Primary investigated outcome: 30-day mortality. SECONDARY OUTCOMES early neurological improvement (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement ≥8 points or 24 hours National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 0-1), successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade ≥2b), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS We evaluated 93 patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusion who underwent MT (median age, 71 years [interquartile range, 59-79]; 63 men [67.7%]). Median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score were 17 (interquartile range, 11-21) and 8 (interquartile range, 7-9), respectively. Anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke represented 93.5% of cases. The rate modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b to 3 was 79.6% (74 patients [95% CI, 71.3-87.8]). Thirty-day mortality was 29% (27 patients [95% CI, 20-39.4]). Early neurological improvement was 19.5% (17 patients [95% CI, 11.8-29.5]), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 5.4% (5 patients [95% CI, 1.7-12.1]). Patients who died at 30 days exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count, higher levels of aspartate, and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase). After adjustment for age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score, and successful reperfusion, these biological markers remained associated with increased odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 2.70 [95% CI, 1.21-5.98] per SD-log decrease in lymphocyte count, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.22-5.77] per SD-log increase in aspartate, and 4.30 [95% CI, 1.43-12.91] per SD-log increase in LDH). CONCLUSIONS The 29% rate of 30-day mortality after MT among patients with COVID-19 is not negligible. Abnormalities of lymphocyte count, LDH and aspartate may depict a patient's profiles with poorer outcomes after MT.

Poor understanding of what PC provides is one of the barriers to the widespread implementation of their services in ICU. Evidence suggests that the availability of specialist PC is lacking in most European countries and provided differently depending on geographical location. The aim of this systematic review is to compare the numbers and types of PC interventions and gauge their impact on stakeholder outcomes and ICU resource utilisation. METHODS We will undertake a systematic review of the published peer-reviewed journal articles; our search will be carried out MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. The search strategy will include variations in the term 'palliative care' and 'intensive care'. All studies with patient populations undergoing palliative care interventions will be selected. Only full-text articles will be considered, and conference abstracts excluded. There will be no date restrictions on the year of publications or on language. The primary aim of the present study is to compare the numbers and types of PC interventions in ICU and their impact on stakeholder (patient, family, clinician, other) outcomes. Reporting of findings will follow the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. DISCUSSION This review will provide insight into the implementation of palliative care in ICU, elucidate differences between countries and health systems, reveal most effective models, and contribute to identifying research priorities to improve outcomes.

We evaluated a new technique for pancreatic stump reinforcement with synthetic glue after laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Ten female domestic pigs were divided into 2 groups; in group A (n=5), the pancreas was transected using an EndoGIA stapler, whereas in group B (n=5), the pancreas was transected using a Ligasure device and the pancreatic stump was reinforced with a hydrogel sealant. The clinical postoperative course was uneventful in all the cases. No differences were observed in pancreatic remnant healing between the groups, and only minor microscopic alterations of the healing process were found in the groups. The technique using Ligasure transection reinforced by the hydrogel sealant seems to be comparable with the standard transection technique using the stapler.","Jon, Bohumil; Cecka, Filip; Subrt, Zdenek; Ferko, Alexander; Neoral, Cestmír; Nikolov, Dimitar Hadzi; Tycová, Vera","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3181d8764c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393319/,230
73961,Noise and air pollution as triggers of hypertension.,2021-03-22,"Introduction Parastomal hernia (PSH) is a common problem following stoma formation. The optimal technique for stoma formation is unknown although recent studies have focused on whether placement of prophylactic mesh at stoma formation can reduce PSH rates. The aim of this study was to systematically review use of prophylactic mesh versus no mesh with regard to occurrence of PSH and peristomal complications. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase™ and the Cochrane Library to identify randomised controlled trials that analysed placement of prophylactic mesh versus no mesh at time of initial surgery. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects methods. Results A total of 506 studies were identified by our search strategy. Of these, 8 studies were included, involving 430 patients (217 mesh vs 213 no mesh). Prophylactic mesh placement resulted in a significantly lower rate of PSH formation (42/217 [19.4%] vs 92/213 [43.2%]) with a combined risk ratio of 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.75, p=0.004). Placement of prophylactic mesh did not result in increased peristomal complications (15/218 [6.9%] vs 16/227 [7.0%]) with a combined risk ratio of 1.0 (95% CI: 0.49-2.01, p=0.990). Conclusions Prophylactic placement of mesh at primary stoma formation may reduce the incidence of PSH, without an increase in peristomal complications. However, the overall quality of the randomised controlled trials included in the meta-analysis was poor, and should prompt caution regarding the applicability of the findings of the individual studies and the meta-analysis to everyday practice.","Cornille, J B; Pathak, S; Daniels, I R; Smart, N J",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2016.0186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27269439/,230

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the question arose as to 25(OH)D status would be related to susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, since several studies pointed out a higher prevalence and severity of the disease in populations with low levels of 25(OH)D. Thus, we investigated the 25(OH)D levels in adults ""Detected"" positive for SARS CoV-2 by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) test, and in negative controls, ""not Detected"", using the Fleury Group's examination database, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of a total of 14.692 people with recent assessments of 25(OH)D and RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, 2.345 were positive and 11.585 were negative for the infection.

RESULTS Twenty-three testimonies from clinical nurses were analyzed. Six macro themes were identified: organizational and logistic change; leadership models adopted to manage the emergency; changes in nursing approaches; personal protective equipment issues; physical and psychological impact on nurses; and team value/spirit. CONCLUSIONS Our testimonies highlighted the huge impact of COVID-19 on the Italian nursing workforce, especially in terms of the high risks associated with caring for COVID-19 patients, exacerbated by the shortage of appropriate personal protective equipment. Nurses had to care for their colleagues and live separately from their families to avoid infecting them, revealing nurses' resilience and the important role of effective and sensitive management.

However, evidence regarding the job burnout-depression association is limited in that most studies are cross-sectional in nature. Moreover, little is known about factors that may influence the job burnout-depression association, other than individual or organizational factors (e.g., gender, supervisor support). The current study seeks to address these gaps by (a) unraveling the temporal relationship between job burnout and depression and (b) examining whether the job burnout-depression association may be contingent upon the degree to which employees engage in physical activity. On the basis of a full-panel 3-wave longitudinal design with a large sample of employees (N = 1,632), latent difference score modeling indicated that an increase in depression from Time 1 to Time 2 predicts an increase in job burnout from Time 2 to Time 3, and vice versa. In addition, physical activity attenuated these effects in a dose-response manner, so that the increase in job burnout and depression was strongest among employees who did not engage in physical activity and weakest to the point of nonsignificance among those engaging in high physical activity.","Toker, Sharon; Biron, Michal",The Journal of applied psychology,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0026914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22229693/,230

We aimed to assess the reporting quality of CPGs for pancreatic cancer following the RIGHT checklist. Methods Guidelines for pancreatic cancer were identified by searching electronic databases, guideline databases, and medical society websites. The reporting quality was evaluated by calculating the adherence to the items of the RIGHT checklist and summarizing them over the seven domains and the entire checklist. We also present results stratified by selected characteristics. Results A total of 22 guidelines were found eligible. Mean overall adherence to the RIGHT items was 60.0%. All guidelines adhered to the RIGHT items 3, 7a, 13a, while no guidelines reported the items 14c or 18b, which are some of the topics dealing with rationale for recommendations and funding source, respectively. Of the seven domains of the RIGHT checklist, ""Review and quality assurance"" and ""Funding and declaration and management of interests"" had the lowest reporting rates (25.0% and 43.2%, respectively); the remaining five domains had reporting rates >50%.

79371,Association of ATP2B1 common variants with asymptomatic intracranial and extracranial large artery stenosis in hypertension patients.,2019,"Endothelial cell (EC) activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary microvascular occlusion, which is a hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consistent with EC activation, increased plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) levels have been reported in COVID-19. Importantly however, studies in other microangiopathies have shown that plasma VWF propeptide (VWFpp) is a more sensitive and specific measure of acute EC activation. In the present study, we further investigated the nature of EC activation in severe COVID-19. Markedly increased plasma VWF:Ag [median (interquatile range, IQR) 608·8 (531-830)iu/dl] and pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII) levels [median (IQR) 261·9 (170-315) iu/dl] were seen in patients with severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Sequential testing showed that these elevated VWF-FVIII complex levels remained high for up to 3 weeks. Similarly, plasma VWFpp levels were also markedly elevated [median (IQR) 324·6 (267-524) iu/dl]. Interestingly however, the VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio was reduced, demonstrating that decreased VWF clearance contributes to the elevated plasma VWF:Ag levels in severe COVID-19. Importantly, plasma VWFpp levels also correlated with clinical severity indices including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sustained fulminant EC activation is occurring in severe COVID-19, and further suggest that VWFpp may have a role as a biomarker in this setting.","Ward, Soracha E; Curley, Gerard F; Lavin, Michelle; Fogarty, Helen; Karampini, Ellie; McEvoy, Natalie L; Clarke, Jennifer; Boylan, Maria; Alalqam, Razi; Worrall, Amy P; Kelly, Claire; de Barra, Eoghan; Glavey, Siobhan; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Bergin, Colm; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Townsend, Liam; Mallon, Patrick W; O'Sullivan, Jamie M; O'Donnell, James S",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326604/,230
79474,Cardiorespiratory fitness is not associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer: A cohort study and review of the literature.,2021-03-25,"Background In patients with large vessel occlusions, endovascular treatment (ET) has been shown to be superior to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in recent trials. However, it is currently unclear if patients with mild strokes also benefit from ET. Methods We compared the discharge rates of good outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] ≤2), very good outcome (mRS 0-1), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages (SICH), and infarct sizes in patients with mild strokes (admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤10) and distal intracranial carotid artery, M1, and M2 occlusions during two time periods. Results From 1/2008 to 10/2012 160 patients (mean age: 72 ± 12 years) were treated with IVT, and from 11/2012 to 11/2016 145 patients (mean age: 71 ± 13 years,) received ET with or without IVT. The clinical results were comparable between both treatment groups (59% after ET vs. 56% after IVT, p = 0.5 for an mRS 0-2) and (38% after ET vs. 32% after IVT, p = 0.3 for an mRS 0-1). In the subgroup of patients with an mRS ≤6, the early outcome did not differ significantly between ET and IVT either. The rates of SICH as well as the infarct sizes were not significantly different after ET compared with IVT. Conclusion Compared with IVT, the routine use of ET did not significantly improve the early clinical or radiological outcome in patients with mild strokes and anterior circulation large vessel occlusions. Further randomized trials are urgently needed to determine the role of ET in this cohort.","Kastrup, Andreas; Brunner, Freimuth; Hildebrandt, Helmut; Roth, Christian; Winterhalter, Michael; Giessing, Carsten; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000489708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410521/,230
79636,Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor imaging for the localisation of insulinomas: a prospective multicentre imaging study.,2013,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a serious viral disease affecting global swine industry. Its causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped virus, and therefore membrane fusion between its envelope and host cell target membrane is critical for viral infection. Despite much research has been focusing on PRRSV infection, the detailed mechanisms involved in its membrane fusion remain to be elucidated. In the current study, we performed confocal microscopy in combination with constitutive active (CA) or dominant negative (DN) mutant, specific inhibitors and small interference RNAs (siRNAs), as well as other multiple approaches to explore PRRSV membrane fusion. We first observed that PRRSV membrane fusion occurred in Rab11-recycling endosomes during early infection with labeled virions and subcellular markers. We further demonstrated that low pH and cathepsin E in Rab11-recycling endosomes were critical for PRRSV membrane fusion. Moreover, PRRSV glycoprotein 5 (GP5) is identified to be cleaved by cathepsin E during this process. Taken together, our work actually provides in-depth information for PRRSV pathogenesis, which supports novel opportunities for the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.IMPORTANCEPRRS, caused by PRRSV, is an economically critical factor in pig farming worldwide. As a lipid membrane-wrapped virus, merging of PRRSV envelope with host cell membrane is indispensible for viral infection. However, there is a lack of knowledge on its membrane fusion. Here, we first explored when and where PRRSV membrane fusion occurred. Furthermore, we determined which host cell factors were involved in the process. Importantly, PRRSV GP5 was shown to be cleaved by cathepsin E during membrane fusion. Our work not only provides information on PRRSV membrane fusion for the first time, but also deepens the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection, which lay a foundation for future applications in prevention and control of PRRS.","Hou, Jie; Li, Rui; Qiao, Songlin; Chen, Xin-Xin; Xing, Guangxu; Zhang, Gaiping",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00097-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32102888/,230
80528,Perceived stress and social support in a large population of people with Multiple Sclerosis recruited online through COVID 19 pandemic.,2020-12-23,"INTRODUCTION In bariatric surgery, new surgical techniques are continually being developed. The one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) has become increasingly common since 2001. However, some patients experience bile reflux or excessive weight loss. This study aimed to assess a new bariatric procedure designed to avoid some of the drawbacks of conventional OAGB. MATERIAL AND METHODS To lower the complication rate and pathophysiological impact after OAGB, we performed an omega loop gastroileal bypass (OLGIBP/SAGI) with a 300-cm common limb. We compared this technique with OAGB. RESULTS Seventeen patients underwent OLGIBP and 23 underwent OAGB. Mean operative time was 108 min for OLGIBP vs 103 min for OAGB. The mean hospital length of stay was 3 days (1 to 7). No complications related to the gastroenterostomy occurred. At 3 years, among OAGB patients, there were 5 (21.7%) cases of bile reflux including 2 (8.7%) requiring a revision to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Among OLGIBP patients, there were 3 (17.6%) cases of bile reflux 1 (5.9%) requiring a revision to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. There was no albumin deficiency. At 3 years, % of total weight loss (TWL) was 43.6 + - 6.2 in the OAGB group vs 48.2 + - 7.4 in the OLGIBP group. CONCLUSIONS The bariatric and metabolic outcomes of OLGIBP are expected to be similar to those of OAGB. The OLGIBP technique should reduce the risks of malnutrition and bile reflux. The two techniques can be safely performed and offer alternatives in bariatric surgery.","Kassir, Radwan; Giudicelli, Xavier; Lointier, Patrice; Breton, Christophe; Blanc, Pierre",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-05165-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409980/,230
80954,A Dizzying Complaint: Investigating the Intended Meaning of Dizziness Among Patients and Providers.,2020-11-13,"BACKGROUND Most children with intermediate-risk rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) have gross disease (group III) at the initiation of chemotherapy. Delayed primary excision (DPE) after induction chemotherapy allows for a reduction in adjuvant radiation dose, but with the risk of potential surgical morbidity. The objectives of this study were to compare outcomes in children with group III RMS who did and did not undergo DPE and to assess surgical morbidity. METHODS The study included 369 patients who had clinical group III RMS at sites amenable to DPE from intermediate-risk Children's Oncology Group studies D9803 (encouraged DPE) and ARST0531 (discouraged DPE). RESULTS The primary tumor site was bladder/prostate (136 patients; 37%), extremity (97 patients; 26%), trunk (24 patients; 7%), retroperitoneum (91 patients; 25%), or intrathoracic/perineum/perianal (21 patients; 6%). In total, 112 patients (53.9%) underwent DPE in D9803, and 26 patients (16.2%) underwent DPE in ARST0531 (P < .001), with loss of vital organ or function in 30 of 138 patients (22%). DPE allowed for a reduced radiation dose in 110 of 135 patients (81%; 51% were reduced to 36 Gy, and 30% were reduced to 42 Gy). Patients who underwent DPE had improved unadjusted overall survival (P = .013). In adjusted regression analysis, the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI 0.43-1.16) was similar for patients who did and did not undergo DPE and was improved for the subset of patients who had tumors of the trunk and retroperitoneum (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.97). CONCLUSIONS Children with group III RMS have equivalent or improved outcomes with DPE and can receive a decreased radiation dose for definitive local control. The choice of local control modality should weigh the potential morbidity of surgery versus that of higher dose irradiation.","Lautz, Timothy B; Chi, Yueh-Yun; Li, Minjie; Wolden, Suzanne L; Casey, Dana L; Routh, Jonathan C; Granberg, Candace F; Binite, Odion; Rudzinski, Erin R; Hawkins, Douglas S; Venkatramani, Rajkumar; Rodeberg, David A",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079399/,230
81917,Severity of Chest Imaging is Correlated with Risk of Acute Neuroimaging Findings among Patients with COVID-19.,2021-02-04,"The design of new protein folds represents a grand challenge for synthetic, chemical and structural biology. Due to the good understanding of the principles governing its pairing specificity, coiled coil (CC) peptide secondary structure elements can be exploited for the construction of modular protein assemblies acting as a proxy for the straightforward complementarity of DNA modules. The prerequisite for the successful translation of the modular assembly strategy pioneered by DNA nanotechnology to protein design is the availability of orthogonal building modules: a collection of peptides that assemble into CCs only with their predetermined partners. Modular CC-based protein structures can self-assemble from multiple polypeptide chains whose pairing is determined by the interaction pattern of the constituent building blocks. Orthogonal CC sets can however also be used for the design of more complex coiled coil protein origami (CCPO) structures. CCPOs are based on multiple CC modules concatenated into a single polypeptide chain that folds into a polyhedral protein cage as the peptide segments assemble into CC dimers. The CCPO strategy has hitherto led to successful de novo design of protein cages in the shape of a tetrahedron, square pyramid and triangular prism. Recent advances in the design of CC modules and design principles have enabled the construction of CCPOs that self-assemble in vivo without any apparent toxicity to human cells or animals, opening the path towards therapeutic applications. The CCPO platform therefore has potential for diverse applications in biomedicine and biotechnology, from drug delivery to molecular cages.","Lapenta, Fabio; Aupič, Jana; Strmšek, Žiga; Jerala, Roman",Chemical Society reviews,https://doi.org/10.1039/c7cs00822h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29400389/,230
82701,Medical and surgical management of acute type B aortic intramural hematoma.,2020-07-15,"INTRODUCTION At the end of the second week of June 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19 infected above 7.5 million people and killed over 400,000 worldwide. Estimation of case fatality rate (CFR) and determining the associated factors are critical for developing targeted interventions. METHODOLOGY The state-level adjusted case fatality rate (aCFR) was estimated by dividing the cumulative number of deaths on a given day by the cumulative number confirmed cases 8 days before, which is the average time-lag between diagnosis and death. We conducted fractional regression analysis to determine the predictors of aCFR. RESULTS As of 13 June 2020, India reported 225 COVID-19 cases per million population (95% CI:224-226); 6.48 deaths per million population (95% CI:6.34-6.61) and an aCFR of 3.88% (95% CI:3.81-3.97) with wide variation between states. High proportion of urban population and population above 60 years were significantly associated with increased aCFR (p=0.08, p=0.05), whereas, high literacy rate and high proportion of women were associated with reduced aCFR (p<0.001, p=0.03). The higher number of cases per million population (p=0.001), prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (p=0.012), cardiovascular diseases (p=0.05), and any cancer (p<0.001) were significantly associated with increased aCFR. The performance of state health systems and proportion of public health expenditure were not associated with aCFR. CONCLUSIONS Socio-demographic factors and burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were found to be the predictors of aCFR. Focused strategies that would ensure early identification, testing and effective targeting of non-literate, elderly, urban population and people with comorbidities are critical to control the pandemic and fatalities.","Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Lakshmanan, Jeyaseelan; Sarman, Charishma Jones; Joy, Melvin",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33175707/,230
82813,Excess Body Weight and Pancreatic Disease.,2021-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Patients experience substantial morbidity following discharge from hospital and during recovery from communi-ty-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has demonstrated improved functional capacity and reduced patient-reported symptoms. To date the safety and tolerability of these methods have not been determined in CAP patients recovering following hospitalization. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of IMT in adults discharged from hospital with CAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS Participants received an IMT device (POWERbreathe KHP2) and completed 9-weeks IMT training with weekly follow-up. Frequency (twice daily) and load (50% PImax) were fixed throughout, but training volume increased incrementally (2-week habituation phase, 7-week training phase). Primary outcomes of interest included IMT safety and tolerability. RESULTS Twenty-two participants were recruited; 16 were male, mean age 55.2 years (range 27.9-77.3). From 1183 possible training days, side effects were reported on 15 occasions by 10 individual participants. All reported side-effects were assessed as grade 1 and did not prevent further training. Participant-reported IMT acceptability was 99.4%. CONCLUSION Inspiratory muscle training is safe and tolerable in patients following hospitalisation for CAP. Patient satisfaction with IMT is high and it is viewed by patients as being helpful in their recovery. Distinguishing CAP-related symptoms and device-related side effects is challenging. Symptom prevalence declined during follow-up with concurrent improvements in spirometry observed. Further research is required to determine the efficacy of IMT interventions following CAP and other acute respiratory infections.","Pick, Harry J; Faghy, Mark A; Creswell, Gareth; Ashton, Deborah; Bolton, Charlotte E; McKeever, Tricia; Lim, Wei Shen; Bewick, Thomas",Advances in respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5603/arm.a2021.0002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881155/,230

83367,Late-onset cutaneous manifestations in a patient with severe COVID-19 infection.,2020-07-28,"Chronic cardiac ischemia that impairs cardiac function, but does not result in infarct, is termed hibernating myocardium (HM). A large clinical subset of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients have HM, which in addition to causing impaired function, puts them at higher risk for arrhythmia and future cardiac events. The standard treatment for this condition is revascularization, but this has been shown to be an imperfect therapy. The majority of pre-clinical cardiac research focuses on infarct models of cardiac ischemia, leaving this subset of chronic ischemia patients largely underserved. To address this gap in research, we have developed a well-characterized and highly reproducible model of hibernating myocardium in swine, as swine are ideal translational models for human heart disease. In addition to creating this unique disease model, we have optimized a clinically relevant treatment model of coronary artery bypass surgery in swine. This allows us to accurately study the effects of bypass surgery on heart disease, as well as investigate additional or alternate therapies. This model surgically induces single vessel stenosis by implanting a constrictor on the left anterior descending (LAD) artery in a young pig. As the pig grows, the constrictor creates a gradual stenosis, resulting in chronic ischemia with impaired regional function, but preserving tissue viability. Following the establishment of the hibernating myocardium phenotype, we perform off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery to revascularize the ischemic region, mimicking the gold-standard treatment for patients in the clinic.","Hocum Stone, Laura; Wright, Christin; Chappuis, Erin; Messer, Mia; Ward, Herbert B; McFalls, Edward O; Kelly, Rosemary F",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/57229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658941/,230

METHODS Participants (n = 42) were divided into three groups according to their laparoscopic experience: 'Novices' (n = 18), 'Intermediates' (n = 14) and 'Experts' (n = 10). A laparoscopic training course consisting of six exercises was constructed. To emphasise precision, a penalty score was added. Every participant performed two repetitions of the exercises; total score per exercise was calculated. To determine face validity, participants filled in a questionnaire after completion of the exercises. An evidence-based literature search for validated box/video trainer exercises was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Face and construct validity. RESULTS The mean score of the 'experts' was set as the training target. Total scores appeared to be positively correlated with individual's laparoscopic experience. The overall score and the score for each exercise were significantly higher in the intermediate and expert groups when compared with the novice group (P ≤ 0.001). All participants completed the questionnaire. The overall assessment of the exercises was considered to be good. The course was found to be most appropriate for training residents year 1-3. CONCLUSION Face and construct validity for an inexpensive course for box/video training was established. A comprehensive and practical overview of all validated and published exercises for box/video trainers is provided to facilitate an inexpensive, but optimal and tailored selection for training purposes.","Schreuder, H W R; van den Berg, C B; Hazebroek, E J; Verheijen, R H M; Schijven, M P",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03146.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21981275/,230

87996,Letter: population mortality from COVID-19 and latitude-data from China. Authors' reply.,2020-10-01,"Oxidative stress (OS) has been strongly associated with postprandial lipemia (PPL) in humans, and still requires further investigation in dogs. However, since lipemia interferes with spectrophotometric determinations such as those used to assess OS, the present study investigated the effect of PPL on OS parameters of healthy dogs. Twenty dogs had lipemic postprandial samples compared to the average of two non-lipemic moments. Subsequently, PPL was simulated in vitro using a commercial lipid emulsion and twelve pools of non-lipemic serum of these dogs were used to simulate the minimum, median and maximum concentrations of triglycerides obtained during the lipemic state. Serum OS parameters were assessed using the antioxidants uric acid, albumin and total bilirubin; total antioxidant capacity (TAC); total oxidant capacity (TOC); and lipid peroxidation. In vivo PPL caused an increase in albumin, TAC-CUPRAC, TAC-FRAP, uric acid (p < 0.0001), TOC (p = 0.0012) and total bilirubin (p = 0.0245); reduction of TAC-ABTS (p = 0.0008); and did not alter the lipid peroxidation (p = 0.8983). In vitro, levels of albumin increased at the three lipemic concentrations (p < 0.0001), uric acid increased in the median and maximum levels (p < 0.0001), and total bilirubin concentration increased only at the maximum lipemic level (p = 0.0012). All lipemic levels tested increased TAC-ABTS (p = 0.0011) and TAC-FRAP (p < 0.0001). TAC-CUPRAC (p = 0.5002), TOC (p = 0.5938) and lipid peroxidation (p = 0.4235) were not affected by in vitro lipemia. In conclusion, both the in vivo postprandial state and in vitro simulated lipemia affect oxidative stress markers in dogs depending on the oxidative stress marker, and thus the postprandial state and/or lipemic samples should be avoided.","Bonatto, Natália Camila Minucci; de Oliveira, Paula Lima; Mancebo, Aline Martins; Costa, Letícia Ramos; Bosculo, Maria Raquel Melo; Bosco, Anelise Maria; Ciarlini, Paulo César; Floriano, Beatriz Perez; de Barros, Luiz Daniel; Almeida, Breno Fernando Martins de",Research in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725655/,230

Large cohort analysis.,2020-02-07,"BACKGROUND The effectiveness of transradial stroke thrombectomy has been limited by guide catheter size and lack of good balloon options. In this study we describe our technique for the use of a sheathless 8-French balloon guide catheter (Walrus) through radial access and present our initial clinical experience. METHODS This was a retrospective case series of consecutive patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion using the sheathless catheter over a period of 3 months. Clinical characteristics, procedural details, reperfusion success (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b-3 grade), first-pass effect (FPE; mTICI reperfusion grade 2c or 3 with a single pass), access site complications and clinical improvement at discharge were recorded. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS Among the 10 patients in the series, median age was 77 years (IQR 75-79) and three were women. All patients had a baseline modified Rankin Scale score ≤2. Median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 12.5 (IQR 9-16). Four patients received intravenous alteplase before mechanical thrombectomy. Eight patients had M1 occlusion and two had proximal M2 occlusion. The median radial artery diameter was 2.5 mm (IQR 2.5-2.7). Successful reperfusion was achieved in all patients. FPE was achieved in six patients. No access site-related complications or post-procedural intracranial hemorrhages occurred. All patients had improvement in NIHSS score at discharge. CONCLUSIONS The use of this sheathless catheter for transradial access was safe and feasible. The technique can potentially improve the outcomes of transradial access for stroke intervention.","Dossani, Rimal H; Waqas, Muhammad; Monteiro, Andre; Cappuzzo, Justin M; Almayman, Faisal; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Davies, Jason M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429347/,230

We hypothesized that localizing nodules with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy and marking them with methylene blue would allow minimally invasive resection and reduce conversion to thoracotomy. METHODS We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy followed by minimally invasive resection of a pulmonary nodule from 2011 to 2014. Lung nodules smaller than 10 mm and nodules smaller than 20 mm that were also located more than 10 mm from the pleural surface were localized and marked with methylene blue. Immediately after marking, all patients underwent resection. RESULTS Seventy patients underwent electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy marking followed by minimally invasive resection. The majority of patients (68/70, 97%) had one nodule localized; 2 patients (2/70, 3%) had two nodules localized. The median nodule size was 8 mm (range, 4-17 mm; interquartile range, 5 mm). The median distance from the pleural surface was 6 mm (range, 1-19 mm; interquartile range, 6 mm). There were no conversions to thoracotomy. Nodule marking was successful in 70 of 72 attempts (97.2%); two nodules were identified by palpation. The nodules were most commonly metastases from other sites (31/70, 44.3%). There were no adverse events related to electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy-guided marking or wedge resection, and minimal adverse events after resections that were more extensive. CONCLUSIONS Localizing and marking small pulmonary nodules using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy is safe and effective for nodule identification before minimally invasive resection.","Marino, Katy A; Sullivan, Jennifer L; Weksler, Benny",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.03.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173068/,230

Safety data gathered from recent clinical trials, long-term extensions of prior trials, registries, and other real-world evidence are summarized here for biologics and novel therapeutics commonly prescribed for pediatric rheumatic diseases. RECENT FINDINGS With nearly 20 years of therapeutic experience, tumor necrosis inhibitors (TNFi) are generally well tolerated, although infections, malignancy, and development of new autoimmunity remain a concern. Risk of infections may be higher in IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors, and lower in abatacept, compared with TNFi. Safety data for B-cell-targeted therapeutics and janus kinase inhibitors are emerging, but remain limited, especially in children. SUMMARY Biologic and novel targeted therapeutics offer a promising future for children with pediatric rheumatic disease. However, long-term safety data in children remain limited for several agents. With any therapeutic option, both short-term and long-term safety concerns must be weighed against individual clinical needs when choosing the optimal treatment for each child.","Randell, Rachel L; Becker, Mara L",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34397604/,230
89120,"Rheumatoid Arthritis, Disease Modifying Agents, and Periprosthetic Joint Infection: What Does a Joint Surgeon Need to Know?",2018,"BACKGROUND Physical inactivity is a global public health challenge. Physical activity (PA) promotion in healthcare delivery systems is effective to reduce physical inactivity. A primary care setting provides an appropriate environment for PA counseling since it is a primary contact with primary care or family physicians encounter the majority of the population. Lack of knowledge and inadequate training in PA counseling is one of the most important barriers to PA promotion. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate PA counseling training in primary care residency programs. METHODS The authors systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and The Cochrane Library for articles published in English from 2000 to 2017. Articles regarding PA counseling in primary care residency training were extracted and outcomes assessed for this systematic review. RESULTS Based on the initial review, 378 articles were excluded (362 articles excluded based on titles and abstracts and 16 articles excluded based on full texts). Four articles were included in this review, addressed PA counseling curricula in primary care residency training. All studies included PA counseling training as part of obesity and healthy lifestyle training. The training improved knowledge among primary care residents, but may not necessarily result in better attitudes or self-efficacy, which could be improved by elective rotations that focus on improved attitudes, self-efficacy, and professional norms for PA counseling. Brief training in counseling did not improve quality nor increase the rate of counseling. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review demonstrates a lack of evidence due to a small number of included studies. The heterogeneous outcomes from the minimal programs are needed to carefully interpret. However, this review sheds light on the importance of training in PA counseling in primary care residency programs. The development of training in PA counseling should focus on an approach that improves attitudes and the self-efficacy of primary care residents. Elective rotations, where residents voluntarily choose their subject, may provide the appropriate training period for PA counseling. Policymakers and academics should play an active role in the implementation of PA counseling as an essential competency for primary care physicians.","Wattanapisit, Apichai; Tuangratananon, Titiporn; Thanamee, Sanhapan",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-018-1268-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29970092/,230
89560,Shoulder and head elevation improves laryngoscopic view for tracheal intubation in nonobese as well as obese individuals.,2012,"Purpose Beyond intravenous thrombolysis, evidence is lacking on acute treatment of minor stroke caused by large artery occlusion. To identify candidates for additional endovascular therapy, we aimed to determine the frequency of non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration in patients with intravenous thrombolysis-treated minor stroke caused by occlusion of large proximal and distal cerebral arteries. Secondary aims were to establish risk factors for non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration and report three-month outcomes in patients with and without non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration. Method We analysed data from the SITS International Stroke Thrombolysis Register on 2553 patients with intravenous thrombolysis-treated minor stroke (NIH Stroke Scale scores 0-5) and available arterial occlusion data. Non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration was defined as an increase in NIH Stroke Scale score ≥4 at 24 h, without parenchymal hematoma on follow-up imaging within 22-36 h. Findings The highest frequency of non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration was seen in 30% of patients with terminal internal carotid artery or tandem occlusions (internal carotid artery + middle cerebral artery) (adjusted odds ratio: 10.3 (95% CI 4.3-24.9), p < 0.001) and 17% in extracranial carotid occlusions (adjusted odds ratio 4.3 (2.5-7.7), p < 0.001) versus 3.1% in those with no occlusion. Proximal middle cerebral artery-M1 occlusions had non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration in 9% (adjusted odds ratio 2.1 (0.97-4.4), p = 0.06). Among patients with any occlusion and non-haemorrhagic early neurological deterioration, 77% were dead or dependent at three months. Conclusions Patients with minor stroke caused by internal carotid artery occlusion, with or without tandem middle cerebral artery involvement, are at high risk of disabling deterioration, despite intravenous thrombolysis treatment. Acute vessel imaging contributes usefully even in minor stroke to identify and consider endovascular treatment, or intensive monitoring at a comprehensive stroke centre, for patients at high risk of neurological deterioration.","Mazya, Michael V; Cooray, Charith; Lees, Kennedy R; Toni, Danilo; Ford, Gary A; Bar, Michal; Frol, Senta; Moreira, Tiago; Sekaran, Lakshmanan; Švigelj, Viktor; Wahlgren, Nils; Ahmed, Niaz",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987317746003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008335/,230

Although a past history of celiotomy is not a contradiction for PEG construction, this procedure is rarely undertaken in post-esophagectomy patients, for two reasons: anatomically limited gastric spaces and high susceptibility to pulmonary aspiration. To overcome these limitations, we developed an original method of introducing PEG with jejunal extension for esophagectomized patients with retrosternal gastric pull-up reconstruction. The procedures were as follows: (1) confirmation of endoscopic transillumination of the antrum; (2) test puncture of the antral wall and subsequent gastropexy using a double-needle device; (3) insertion of a needle jejunostomy catheter into the antrum; (4) direct catheter cannulation to the pylorus and introduction of a feeding tube into the jejunum. We successfully carried out this procedure in three male patients (70-78 years old): two suffering from repetitive aspiration pneumonia and one with extensive recurrence of esophageal carcinoma. The operative times ranged 15-50 min. There were no PEG-associated complications. Of note, none of the patients experienced aspiration pneumonia after PEG construction. Our novel method appears to be a promising approach to managing esophagectomized patients because of its feasibility and the potential to prevent postoperative pulmonary aspiration.","Urabe, Masayuki; Koga, Shuhei; Ohkura, Yu; Ueno, Masaki; Udagawa, Harushi",Clinical journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12328-020-01096-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31981087/,230

90796,The Impact of Asthma on In-Hospital Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients.,2021-06-18,"PURPOSE The application of mesh-reinforced hiatal closure has resulted in a significant reduction in recurrence rates in comparison with primary suture repair. However, the use of meshes has not completely extended in all the cases of large paraesophageal hiatal hernias (LPHH) due to the complications related to them. The aim of this study is to present our long-term results and complications related to Crurasoft® mesh (Bard) for the treatment of LPHH. METHODS From January 2004 to December 2014, 536 consecutive patients underwent open or laparoscopic fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease or LPHH at Ramón y Cajal University Hospital. Primary simple suture of the crura and additional reinforcement with a Crurasoft® mesh (Bard) was performed in 93 patients (17.35 %). Radiologic hiatal hernia recurrence and mesh-related complications were investigated. RESULTS Of the 93 patients undergoing mesh repair, there were 28 male and 65 female with a mean age of 67.27 years (range 22-87 years). Laparoscopic surgery was attended in 88.2 % of the cases, and open surgery in the rest 11.8 %. Mean operative time was 167.05 min (range 90-370 min). Median postoperative stay was 4.79 days (range 1-41 days). Conversion rate was 8.53 % (7 patients). Intraoperative complications were described in 10.75 % (10 patients), but all of them, except in one case, could be managed laparoscopically. Overall postoperative complications rate was 28 %. Early postoperative complications occurred in 11 patients (12 %), respectively, for grades 2 (6 cases), 3b (1 case) and 5 (4 cases) according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Late postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients (16 %), respectively, for grades 1 (7 cases), 2 (2 cases), 3b (5 cases) and 5 (1 case) according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Thirty day-mortality rate was 4.3 %. Mortality rate specific associated with the mesh was 1 %. Reoperation rate was 5.4 %. After a median follow-up of 76.33 months (range 3-130 months), 8 patients (9 %) developed a recurrent hiatal hernia. Mesh was removed in three cases (3.22 %). CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the recurrence rate in patients with a Crurasoft® (Bard) is acceptable. However, the rate of postoperative complications and mortality is excessive. The use of meshes in the hiatus keeps on being controversial due to the severe complications related to them. It would be advisable to compare our results in the non-mesh group in terms of recurrences and complications, to determine if meshes in the hiatus should be given in these patients due to its high rate of complications.","Priego, P; Perez de Oteyza, J; Galindo, J; Carda, P; García-Moreno, F; Rodríguez Velasco, G; Lobo, E",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-016-1486-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27023877/,230

This trend for small, low-stage tumors is the reflection of earlier diagnosis primarily as a result of the widespread and increasing use of non-invasive abdominal imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Renal tumors are often diagnosed in elderly patients, with medical comorbidities whom the risk of surgical complications may pose a greater risk of death than that due to the tumor itself. In these patients, unsuitable for surgical approach, thermal ablation represents a valid alternative to traditional surgery. Thermal ablation is a less invasive, less morbid treatment option thanks to reduced blood loss, lower incidence of complications during the procedure and a less long convalescence. At present, the most widely used thermal ablative techniques are cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation (MWA). MWA offers many benefits of other ablation techniques and offers several other advantages: higher intratumoral temperatures, larger tumor ablation volumes, faster ablation times, the ability to use multiple applicators simultaneously, optimal heating of cystic masses and tumors close to the vessels and less procedural pain. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview about the state of the art of microwave ablation for renal tumors and to cast a glance on the new development trends of this technique.","Floridi, Chiara; De Bernardi, Irene; Fontana, Federico; Muollo, Alessandra; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Agostini, Andrea; Fonio, Paolo; Squillaci, Ettore; Brunese, Luca; Fugazzola, Carlo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-014-0426-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25001585/,230

On each sample, an 8‑cm long enterotomy was performed. Enterotomies were closed using either barbed or unbarbed glycomer‑631. We compared the time to close, appearance, length of suture material, bursting pressure, and costs associated with each type of material. Our findings demonstrated that time to close was significantly shorter (caecum, P = 0.034; pelvic flexure, P = 0.039) using barbed sutures (caecum 610.4 seconds; pelvic flexure 699.3 seconds) than unbarbed sutures (caecum 661.0 seconds, pelvic flexure 743.1 seconds). The length of suture material used was significantly less (caecum, P < 0.0001; pelvic flexure, P < 0.0001) with barbed (caecum 28.1 cm, pelvic flexure 32.0 cm,) compared with unbarbed sutures (caecum 41.6 cm; pelvic flexure 46.6 cm). There were no significant differences in bursting pressure (caecum, P = 0.294; pelvic flexure, P = 0.430) between barbed (caecum, 172.5 mmHg, pelvic flexure, 188.9 mmHg) and unbarbed sutures (caecum 178.3 mmHg, pelvic flexure 183.3 mmHg). The cost was higher using barbed sutures. However, the use of barbed sutures was faster, left less suture material in the tissue, and sustained comparable bursting pressure to unbarbed sutures. We therefore conclude that barbed sutures are a valid alternative to unbarbed sutures for closing large intestine enterotomy in horses.","Giusto, Gessica; Caramello, Vittorio; Comino, Francesco; Gandini, Marco",Veterinaria italiana,https://doi.org/10.12834/vetit.691.3383.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599552/,230

93161,Impact of contrast agent viscosity on coronary balloon deflation times: bench testing results.,2014,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC) with acute colorectal obstruction (ACO) is an emergency. Transanal colorectal tube (TCT) use can be a safe single-stage surgery with laparoscopy-assisted colectomy; it offers long-term outcomes equivalent to emergency surgery for stage-II/III CRC with ACO. Self-expanding metallic stent use, another alternative, may have detrimental pathological and molecular effects, whereas the pathological impact of TCT placement remains unclear. We hypothesized that TCT placement might exert little damage on primary tumor. Hence, the current study analyzed the pathological impact of TCT placement for CRC with ACO compared to emergency surgery. METHODS Data from consecutive patients with stage-II/III distal CRC with ACO who underwent surgery between January 2007 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed at two Japanese affiliate hospitals. Inflammatory and malignant potential-related parameters were analyzed by a single blinded pathologist. We extracted mRNA from tumor tissues to analyze inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients with stage-II/III distal CRC with ACO were identified (surgery: 25 patients; TCT: 43 patients). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two groups. TCT showed a significantly lower frequency of abscess (surgery vs TCT, 36.0% vs 11.6%; P = 0.017) and a lower tendency of pathological perforation (surgery vs TCT, 20.0% vs 4.7%, respectively; P = 0.091), compared to the surgery group. There were no significant intergroup differences in oncological factors, including perineural invasion (surgery vs TCT, 52.0% vs 62.8%; P = 0.383), microlymphatic involvement (surgery vs TCT, 52.0% vs 58.1%; P = 0.623), and microvascular involvement (surgery vs TCT, 32.0% vs 25.6%; P = 0.570). No significant intergroup differences were found in interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, or IL-1β gene expression levels (P = 0.580, 0.250, 0.941). CONCLUSIONS TCT placement had no pathologically detrimental effects on the tumor or surrounding tissues and might be an attractive non-invasive strategy for cases of curative distal CRC with ACO.","Okuda, Yusuke; Shimura, Takaya; Kato, Hiroyuki; Yamada, Tomonori; Hirata, Yoshikazu; Natsume, Makoto; Iwasaki, Hiroyasu; Yamaguchi, Ryuzo; Sakamoto, Eiji; Takahashi, Satoru; Kataoka, Hiromi",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07188-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624940/,230
93373,A 16-Year-Old Boy With Cough and Fever in the Era of COVID-19.,2020-08-12,"Non-commercial poultry flocks (referred to as ""small flocks"") have become increasingly popular in Canada. Despite this popularity, little is known about the main causes of morbidity and mortality (health status) in these flocks. We assessed the baseline prevalence of infectious and non-infectious diseases among Ontario's small poultry flocks by conducting a prospective surveillance study over a 2-y period. With the owner's consent, for each bird ( n = 245) submitted to the Animal Health Laboratory, we performed a postmortem examination, including ancillary tests to reach a diagnosis. Infectious diseases were the most common primary cause of clinical signs or death (62%), with multifactorial respiratory diseases (21%) and Marek's disease (11%) being most frequent. Multifactorial respiratory diseases were commonly caused by coinfection with bacteria (e.g., Mycoplasma gallisepticum and M. synoviae, Escherichia coli, Avibacterium spp.) and viruses, such as infectious bronchitis and infectious laryngotracheitis viruses. No federally reportable diseases were diagnosed. The health status of small flocks in Ontario has not been reported previously, to our knowledge, and the data presented herein will produce helpful baseline information for the development of technology transfer material directed to owners and veterinarians, which will ultimately aid in the control of diseases among these flocks.","Brochu, Nancy M; Guerin, Michele T; Varga, Csaba; Lillie, Brandon N; Brash, Marina L; Susta, Leonardo","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638719843575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30973078/,230

In this procedure, an endostapler was vertically used, instead of using a horizontally orientated linear stapler, when dividing the rectum. A previous study reported that this technique is useful for treating patients with a narrow pelvis and/or performing a very low anastomosis. METHODS The use of IO-DST anastomosis during anterior resection(AR) and low anterior resection was performed on 80 cases of rectal cancer between April 1998 and June 2004 at our institution. We reviewed those cases and evaluated the leakage rate. RESULTS We found that leakage occurred in six cases (7.5%); however, leakage was not found in cases of AR or cases with a preserved left colic artery (LCA). CONCLUSIONS The IO-DST technique is an adequate procedure for performing AR. The preservation of the LCA could be used to prevent leakage.","Tsubaki, Masahiro; Ito, Yuichi; Fujita, Masanori; Kato, Hiroyuki",Asian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asjsur.2012.04.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884267/,230

The origin of the virus appears to be zoonotic; it has been proposed that it comes from a bat and that it may have had an intermediate host that led to its introduction in the human population. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, with a positive single-stranded RNA genome, and it binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme, present in susceptible cells, to infect the human respiratory system. Although other coronaviruses have been previously known, they have not had the same impact, and, therefore, research on pharmacological treatments is not sufficiently developed to face the current challenge. Almost since the beginning of the epidemic, several molecules have been proposed for the treatment of infection; however, there is not yet a drug available with sufficient effectiveness for treatment.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether pretreatment CVR can predict postoperative ischemic lesions after carotid artery stenting (CAS) by retrospective analysis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 46 patients (42 men; mean age 74.2±8.3 years) who underwent CAS and preprocedural cerebral blood flow measurement by quantitative single-photon emission CT. Ischemic lesions were evaluated by diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 72 h after the intervention. We also evaluated plaque characteristics using black-blood MR plaque imaging. RESULTS New ipsilateral DWI-positive lesions were found in 11 cases (23.9%). Patients were classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of new DWI-positive lesions, and no significant differences in characteristics were found between the DWI-positive and DWI-negative groups, except for age and CVR of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. The DWI-positive group was significantly older than the DWI-negative group (79.7±4.1 vs 72.5±8.6 years; p=0.0085) and had lower average regional CVR (1.4±18.2% vs 22.4±25.8%; p=0.016). MR plaque imaging showed no significant difference in relative overall plaque MR signal intensity between the two groups (1.53±0.37 vs 1.34±0.26; p=0.113). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, lower CVR of the ipsilateral MCA territory (<11%) was the only independent risk factor for new ischemic lesions following CAS (OR=6.99; 95% CI 1.17 to 41.80; p=0.033). CONCLUSIONS Impaired pretreatment CVR was associated with increased incidence of new infarction after CAS.","Koyanagi, Masaomi; Yoshida, Kazumichi; Kurosaki, Yoshitaka; Sadamasa, Nobutake; Narumi, Osamu; Sato, Tsukasa; Chin, Masaki; Handa, Akira; Yamagata, Sen; Miyamoto, Susumu",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25186444/,230
95236,Effectiveness of Semantic Encoding Strategy Training after Traumatic Brain Injury is Correlated with Frontal Brain Activation Change.,2015,"PURPOSE The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the feasibility of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), and to compare the short-term surgical outcomes with those of conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer. METHODS Forty-four patients who underwent SILS were compared with 263 patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal adenocarcinoma between November 2011 and September 2012. RESULTS In the SILS group, eleven cases (25.0%) of right hemicolectomy, 15 (34.1%) anterior resections, and 18 (40.9%) low anterior resections were performed. Additional ports were required in 10 rectal patients during SILS operation. In the 32 patients with rectosigmoid and rectal cancer in the SILS group, patients with mid and lower rectal cancers had a tendency to require a longer operation time (168.2 minutes vs. 223.8 minutes, P = 0.002), additional ports or multiport conversion (P = 0.007), than those with rectosigmoid and upper rectal cancer. Both SILS and conventional groups had similar perioperative outcomes. Operation time was longer in the SILS group than in the conventional laparoscopic surgery group (185.0 minutes vs. 139.2 minutes, P < 0.001). More diverting stoma were performed in the SILS group (64.7% vs. 24.2%, P = 0.011). Multivariate analysis showed that tumor location in the rectum (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.858-10.560; P = 0.001), SILS (95% CI, 3.450-20.233; P < 0.001), diverting stoma (95% CI, 1.606-9.288; P = 0.003), and transfusion (95% CI, 1.092-7.854; P = 0.033) were independent risk factors for long operation time (>180 minutes). CONCLUSION SILS is a feasible, not inferior treatment option for colorectal cancer, and appears to have similar results as standard conventional multiport laparoscopic colectomy, despite the longer operative time.","Lim, Sang Woo; Kim, Hyeong Rok; Kim, Young Jin",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2014.87.3.131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25247166/,230

We analyzed the outcome, efficacy, and complications of tunneled CVCs, placed in our unit in the last 3 years. Nineteen 10 F Split-Cath CVCs (two separate catheters fused along their length) were placed in 10 children, median age 9.19 years (range 2.15-13.31) and body weight (BW) between 10 and 40 kg. CVCs survival at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months was 94%, 77%, 51%, and 34%, respectively. Catheter survival was higher in children with BW > 20 kg than in smaller patients. Median survival was higher than that of 11 Quinton Permcath CVCs, placed in five children in the preceding 2 years (280 vs. 45 days, P < 0.05). Median blood flow rate and indices of HD adequacy were higher in children with lower BW (<20 kg vs. 20-30 kg vs. >30 kg) than in those with higher BW. Incidence of exit site and bloodstream infections was 2.32 and 0.66/1000 CVC days, respectively. One case of hemothorax due to subclavian artery puncture occurred during CVC placement. In conclusion, Split-Cath 10 F CVC allows for effective dialysis in children undergoing HD, particularly those between 10 and 30 kg BW. Catheter survival is acceptable, but could be improved in small children.","Paglialonga, Fabio; Rossetti, Giordano; Giannini, Alberto; Chidini, Giovanna; Napolitano, Luisa; Testa, Sara; Meregalli, Elisa; Biasuzzi, Antonietta; Edefonti, Alberto",Hemodialysis international.

Drawing on the job demand-control model, we proposed that a high-control job strategy (such as job crafting) alleviates the deleterious effect of customer incivility on job performance through emotional exhaustion, whereas a low-control job strategy (such as service scripts) aggravates this effect. To test the proposed moderated mediation effects, we collected three-wave data from 272 hotel employees and their 54 team leaders over a 6-month period. As predicted, job crafting and service scripts performed contrasting moderating functions. Specifically, the customer incivility-emotional exhaustion relationship was weaker for employees who engaged in job crafting more often than for those who did not. Job crafting also mitigated the negative indirect effect of customer incivility on job performance through emotional exhaustion. In contrast, the customer incivility-emotional exhaustion relationship was more pronounced among employees who used service scripts more often. Service scripts further exacerbate the negative indirect effect of customer incivility on job performance through emotional exhaustion.

However, use of anti-TNF therapy is complicated by loss of response. In order to maintain remission, adequate serum levels are required. Hence, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is important in order to optimize serum drug levels, especially in patients with loss of response to these agents. Optimization of anti-TNF therapy by applying TDM enables clinicians to regain response to TNF blockers in a significant proportion of patients. It is important to use anti-TNF agents in their most optimal way, since these therapeutic agents are expensive and the medical options after failing anti-TNF therapy are limited. Here, we will discuss how to optimize treatment with anti-TNF agents in IBD patients in order to improve treatment efficacy, prevent anti-drug antibody formation, reduce side effects, discontinue unnecessary treatment and manage costs.","Strik, A S; Bots, S J A; D'Haens, G; Löwenberg, M",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1586/17512433.2016.1133288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26681400/,230

Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for anal fistula. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes assessed and reported in these studies. This limits research quality and complicates evidence synthesis. A solution for heterogeneity in outcome reporting is the development of a Core Outcome Set (COS). This paper describes the protocol for the development of a European COS for Anal Fistula (AFCOS). METHODS The first step will be a systematic review of the literature to identify potential outcomes that may be included in the COS. Patient interviews will be conducted in The United Kingdom and The Netherlands to ensure that both clinician-important and patient-important outcomes are captured. The outcomes will be categorized using the COMET taxonomy and taken forward to a Delphi consensus exercise. In up to three web-based Delphi surveys the outcomes will be prioritized by patients, clinicians (surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists), and (clinical) researchers. The responses will be summarized and reported anonymously in subsequent round(s) facilitating convergence to a consensus opinion. The final COS will be decided during a face-to-face consensus meeting with patients, clinicians, and (clinical) researchers.

The aim of this study is to understand underlying factors that augment the HIV risk in ACB communities and to inform policy and practice in Ontario. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a cross-sectional study of first-generation and second-generation ACB adults aged 15-64 in Toronto (n=1000) and Ottawa (n=500) and collect data on sociodemographic information, sexual behaviours, substance use, blood donation, access and use of health services and HIV-related care. We will use dried blood spot testing to determine the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection among ACB people, and link participant data to administrative databases to investigate health service access and use. Factors associated with key outcomes (HIV infection, testing behaviours, knowledge about HIV transmission and acquisition, HIV vulnerability, access and use of health services) will be evaluated using generalised linear mixed models, adjusted for relevant covariates.

Rather than uncritically adopt the standards of the currently predominant paradigm, homeopathy should not forget its roots, peculiarities, and self-conception. Contrary to conventional medicine, it is based on a teleological image of humanity, a holistic and sustainable approach towards curing sickness, and an up-to-date concept of medical theory in terms of healing arts. However, under today's frameworked conditions of industrialisation, commercialisation and commodification, the strengths of homeopathy tend to be disregarded or even attacked, and a special kind of reductionist and materialist rationality, compatible with expanding markets and profits, is preferably facilitated.

The GLU-MCSB sorbents are insoluble in aqueous acidic solution and improve adsorption capacity. The adsorption process was carried out by considering various parameters, viz. adsorbent dose, contact time, pH and temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis of beads shows that degradation takes place in two stages. Fourier transform infra-red spectra of magnetic beads exhibit an absorption band at 606 cm-1 for Fe-O. The elemental analysis (energy dispersive X-ray analysis) and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the structure and characteristics of MCSB and GLU-MCSB. The Ni(II) removal efficiency attains a highest value of 95.12% with cross-linked GLU-MCSB in comparison to 79.5% with MCSB. Adsorption processes follow the pseudo-second-order rate kinetics model, which suggested that the rate-limiting step may be the chemical adsorption rather than the mass transport. The experimental data of adsorption fitted well with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with a high correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.9), showing that monolayer adsorption took place on the surface of GLU-MCSB absorbents. The negative values of entropy change, -175.64 and -163.30 J/(mol·K), and enthalpy change, -54.75 and -49.58 kJ/mol, for MCSB and GLU-MCSB suggest that the process is spontaneous and exothermic in nature.","Rani, Priti; Johar, Rajni; Jassal, P S",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263595/,230

Serologically, Lm can be classified into 13 serotypes, though only four are typically linked with food contamination and illness. Since 2000, a shift in serotypes involved in listeriosis outbreaks was observed, suggesting that tracking of serotypes could help identify emerging trends. A PCR method developed in 2004 allowed detection of the four major serotypes as molecular serogroups, corresponding to broad phylogenetic groups. In this study, a novel qPCR method was developed that uses two multiplex qPCRs, one to confirm the Listeria genus and Lm species, and the second for Lm molecular serogrouping. This method was compared with the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) method for Lm and the sero-agglutination method, using a 208-strain panel. Comparison of the genus/species qPCR assay with the BAM methods found an equal or slightly higher accuracy for the qPCR method (>98%), as compared to the BAM protocol (>96%), when evaluated against independent characterization data. Molecular serogrouping using the qPCR method (96.6%) was more accurate than the sero-agglutination assay (75.6%). The qPCR method identified Lm 4bV strains, which could not be resolved using sero-agglutination. The qPCR could not identify lineages III and IV serotype 4b strains but did correctly identify 16 of 18 lineage III/IV strains. The qPCR method performed genus identification for Lm, L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. ivanovii, and L. seeligeri.

102730,Dermatological Innovations in three directions.,2020-09-01,"Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), a causative agent of the common cold, enters host cells via two distinct pathways: one is mediated by cell surface proteases, particularly transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and the other by endosomal cathepsin L. Thus, specific inhibitors of these proteases block virus infection. However, it is unclear which of these pathways is actually utilized by HCoV-229E in the human respiratory tract. Here, we examined the mechanism of cell entry used by a pseudotyped virus bearing the HCoV-229E spike (S) protein in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. We found that, compared with a laboratory strain isolated in 1966 and passaged for a half century, clinical isolates of HCoV-229E were less likely to utilize cathepsin L; rather, they showed a preference for TMPRSS2. Two amino acid substitutions (R642M and N714K) in the S protein of HCoV-229E clinical isolates altered their sensitivity to a cathepsin L inhibitor, suggesting that these amino acids were responsible for cathepsin L use. After 20 passages in HeLa cells, the ability of the isolate to use cathepsin increased so that it was equal to that of the laboratory strain; this increase was caused by an amino acid substitution (I577S) in the S protein. The passaged virus showed a reduced ability to replicate in differentiated airway epithelial cells cultured at an air-liquid interface. These results suggest that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection of human airway epithelial cells; therefore, clinical isolates are less able to use cathepsin. IMPORTANCE Many enveloped viruses enter cells through endocytosis. Viral spike proteins drive the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes to facilitate insertion of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) utilizes endosomal cathepsin L to activate the spike protein after receptor binding. Here, we found that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferentially utilize the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin L. The endosome is a main site of Toll-like receptor recognition, which then triggers an innate immune response; therefore, HCoV-229E presumably evolved to bypass the endosome by entering the cell via TMPRSS2. Thus, the virus uses a simple mechanism to evade the host innate immune system. Therefore, therapeutic agents for coronavirus-mediated diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), should target cell surface TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsin.","Shirato, Kazuya; Kanou, Kazuhiko; Kawase, Miyuki; Matsuyama, Shutoku",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01387-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27733646/,230

103875,Using Patient-Reported Measures to Improve Outcomes in Kidney Disease.,2021-04-12,"HIV-1 enters cells via interaction of the viral glycoprotein gp120, the host cell surface receptor CD4 and the co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4. For entry, gp120 undergoes conformational changes that depend on the reduction of one or more disulfides. Previous studies indicate that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), and glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1) catalyze gp120 reduction, but their specific disulfide targets are not known. Here, it was demonstrated that PDI and Trx1 have similar gp120 disulfide targets as determined by labeling after reduction, but with some pattern differences, including overall stronger labeling with Trx1 than with PDI. Furthermore, uneven labeling of the residues of a disulfide may reflect altered accessibility by conformational changes upon the reduction process. Since both PDI and Trx1 may be involved in viral entry, compounds that target the host redox system or the viral gp120 were tested in vitro to investigate whether redox regulation is a target for anti-HIV therapy. Carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs), previously shown to bind gp120 and inhibit HIV entry, were now demonstrated to inhibit gp120 disulfide reduction. Auranofin, an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), also showed inhibitory activity towards HIV infection, although close to its cytotoxic concentration. Our results demonstrate that both the host redox system and the viral surface glycoproteins are of interest for the development of new generations of anti-HIV therapeutics.","Reiser, Kathrin; François, Katrien O; Schols, Dominique; Bergman, Tomas; Jörnvall, Hans; Balzarini, Jan; Karlsson, Anna; Lundberg, Mathias",The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2011.12.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22230366/,230
104236,Medicare expenditures for elderly patients undergoing surgical clipping or endovascular intervention for subarachnoid hemorrhage.,2017,"BACKGROUND Propofol reduces cerebral blood flow (CBF) secondary to cerebral metabolic depression. However, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that propofol directly dilates the vascular smooth muscle. This study investigates the effects of propofol-induced changes in bispectral index (BIS) on cerebral microcirculation and oxygenation during craniotomies. METHODS In 21 craniotomy patients undergoing routine craniotomy, anaesthesia was maintained with propofol 4-10 mg kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ and remifentanil 0.1-0.4 µg kg⁻¹ min⁻¹. Propofol concentration was adjusted to achieve higher BIS (target 40) or lower BIS (target 20). Regional measurements of capillary venous blood flow (rvCBF), oxygen saturation (srvO₂), and haemoglobin amount (rvHb) at 2 mm (grey matter) and 8 mm (white matter) cerebral depth were randomly performed at higher and lower BIS by combined laser-Doppler flowmetry and spectroscopy. Calculations: approximated arteriovenous difference in oxygen content (avDO₂) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (aCMRO₂). RESULTS mean values (sd). STATISTICS Mann-Whitney test (*P<0.05). Results Human cerebral microcirculation and oxygen saturation were assessed at propofol dosages 5.1 (2.3) mg kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ [BIS 40 (9)] and 7.8 (2.1) mg kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ [BIS 21 (7)]. Propofol-induced reduction in BIS resulted in increased srvO₂ (P=0.018), and decreased avDO₂ (P=0.025) and aCMRO(2) (P=0.022), in 2 mm cerebral depth, while rvCBF and rvHb remained unchanged. In 8 mm cerebral depth, srvO₂, rvCBF, rvHb, and also calculated parameters avDO₂ and aCMRO₂ remained unaltered. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest alteration of the CBF/CMRO₂ ratio by propofol in cortical brain regions; therefore, it might be possible that propofol affects coupling of flow and metabolism in the cerebral microcirculation.","Klein, K U; Fukui, K; Schramm, P; Stadie, A; Fischer, G; Werner, C; Oertel, J; Engelhard, K",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aer227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21862494/,230
104386,Depth of sedation during drug induced sedation endoscopy monitored by BiSpectral Index® and Cerebral State Index®.,2020-08-28,"INTRODUCTION Evidence to date indicates that patients from ethnic minority backgrounds may experience disparity in the quality and safety of health care they receive due to a range of socio-cultural factors. Although heightened risk of patient safety events is of key concern, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the nature and rate of patient safety events occurring amongst ethnic minority consumers, which is critical for the development of relevant intervention approaches to enhance the safety of their care. OBJECTIVES To establish how ethnic minority populations are conceptualised in the international literature, and the implications of this in shaping of our findings; the evidence of patient safety events arising among ethnic minority healthcare consumers internationally; and the individual, service and system factors that contribute to unsafe care. METHOD A systematic review of five databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL) were undertaken using subject headings (MeSH) and keywords to identify studies relevant to our objectives. Inclusion criteria were applied independently by two researchers. A narrative synthesis was undertaken due to heterogeneity of the study designs of included studies followed by a study appraisal process. RESULTS Forty-five studies were included in this review. Findings indicate that: (1) those from ethnic minority backgrounds were conceptualised variably; (2) people from ethnic minority backgrounds had higher rates of hospital acquired infections, complications, adverse drug events and dosing errors when compared to the wider population; and (3) factors including language proficiency, beliefs about illness and treatment, formal and informal interpreter use, consumer engagement, and interactions with health professionals contributed to increased risk of safety events amongst these populations. CONCLUSION Ethnic minority consumers may experience inequity in the safety of care and be at higher risk of patient safety events. Health services and systems must consider the individual, inter- and intra-ethnic variations in the nature of safety events to understand the where and how to invest resource to enhance equity in the safety of care.

104445,Genetic and proteomic biomarkers of head-and-neck cancer: A systematic review.,2020,"Currently FDG PET/CT is used as a tool for detection of active sites of sarcoidosis. Routine clinical practice relies on qualitative assessment with visual interpretation. When semi quantitatively expressed, e.g. for scientific purposes, this often leads to dichotomous ""positive"" or ""negative"" results. Metabolic activity in the lungs or mediastinum can also be expressed by SUVmax, but this measure is based only on the intensity of a single voxel. Likely for this reason these parameters show poor correlation with variables such as serum biomarkers and suboptimally predict clinical response to treatment. The current study focusses on new volumetric quantification methods for FDG PET/CT. Specifically the percentage of lung volume with increased metabolic activity, ""%SUV-high"", and the average metabolic activity in the lung ""SUVmean"", shows significantly better correlation with conventional biomarkers for disease activity than PET dichotomous and SUVmax. Our proposed quantification method needs subsequent and larger studies, however it may open new possibilities for future quantitative research in lung inflammation, and improve precision medicine in sarcoidosis.

STUDY DESIGN In vivo, experimental. ANIMALS Four adult horses. METHODS Full thickness wounds created on each dorsal metacarpus were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. One forelimb was randomly assigned to cephalic vein IVRLP with amikacin on days 2, 3, and 4 post-wounding. Biopsies on day 2 prior to IVRLP, and on days 5 and 8 were cultured to quantify wound bioburden (CFU/g). Two horses repeated the study in a crossover design, receiving IVRLP on the opposite limb (n = 6 experiments). IVRLP was performed on both forelimbs simultaneously in 3 horses at the end of the study: limbs were perfused with a volume of new methylene blue equal to that of the amikacin, through the cephalic vein or palmar digital vein. After euthanasia, wounds were photographed to subjectively assess dye diffusion. RESULTS The bioburden did not differ between control and IVRLP limbs overall or at any individual time point. No difference was detected between groups in terms of frequency of positive bacterial growth at any time. Methylene blue was visible in all excised tissues after IVRLP through the palmar digital vein, but was not visible in limbs perfused through the cephalic vein. CONCLUSION IVRLP may not effectively concentrate amikacin within a wound bed and did not influence S. aureus bioburden in an experimentally created wound infection.","Freeland, Russell B; Morello, Samantha L; DeLombaert, Melissa; Rajamanickam, Victora",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28256725/,230

Since the transmission risk increases with close contact, some cosmetic procedures are considered high risk and majority of them had to be postponed or canceled in private dermatocosmetology clinics especially during the heavy period of the outbreak. AIMS We aimed to document the medical and socioeconomic problems emerged in dermatocosmetology clinics in Turkey caused by COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss the management strategies taken by dermatologists. PATIENTS/METHODS This survey research was conducted with 100 dermatologists who work in private dermatocosmetology clinics. The survey included 38 questions about office re-arrangements including patient admission and office environment, safety precautions taken for cosmetic procedures, management of clinic staff, and financial impact of the pandemic. RESULTS A remarkable decrease in major cosmetic interest was reported in private clinics; meanwhile, there was an increase in applicants for noncosmetic dermatological complaints. The most avoided cosmetic procedures were application of skin care devices, lasers, chemical peeling, and thread lifting, while botulinum toxin injection was the most performed procedure. Nearly half of the participants had severe financial damage. Of the participants, 55% reported that they worked anxiously during this period and 60% believed that they managed the early period of the pandemic successfully.

Twenty-five years later, the role of epidemiology as an important contribution to human population research, preventive medicine, and public health is under substantial pressure because of the emphasis on ""big data,"" phenomenology, and personalized medical therapies. Epidemiology is the study of epidemics. The primary role of epidemiology is to identify the epidemics and parameters of interest of host, agent, and environment and to generate and test hypotheses in search of causal pathways. Almost all diseases have a specific distribution in relation to time, place, and person and specific ""causes"" with high effect sizes. Epidemiology then uses such information to develop interventions and test (through clinical trials and natural experiments) their efficacy and effectiveness. Epidemiology is dependent on new technologies to evaluate improved measurements of host (genomics), epigenetics, identification of agents (metabolomics, proteomics), new technology to evaluate both physical and social environment, and modern methods of data collection. Epidemiology does poorly in studying anything other than epidemics and collections of numerators and denominators without specific hypotheses even with improved statistical methodologies.","Kuller, Lewis H",American journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwv158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26493266/,230

We sought to summarize all studies assessing the prognostic accuracy of the HEART score for prediction of MACE in adult ED patients presenting with chest pain. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception through May 2018 and included studies using the HEART score for the prediction of short-term MACE in adult patients presenting to the ED with chest pain. The main outcome was short-term (i.e., 30-day or 6-week) incidence of MACE. We secondarily evaluated the prognostic accuracy of the HEART score for prediction of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI). Where available, accuracy of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score was determined. RESULTS We included 30 studies (n = 44,202) in analysis. A HEART score above the low-risk threshold (≥4) had a sensitivity of 95.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 93.3%-97.5%) and specificity of 44.6% (95% CI = 38.8%-50.5%) for MACE. A high-risk HEART score (≥7) had a sensitivity of 39.5% (95% CI = 31.6%-48.1%) and specificity of 95.0% (95% CI = 92.6%-96.6%) for MACE, whereas a TIMI score above the low-risk threshold (≥2) had a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI = 80.2%-92.8%) and specificity of 48.1% (95% CI = 38.9%-57.5%) for MACE. A high-risk TIMI score (≥6) was 2.8% sensitive (95% CI = 0.8%-9.6%), but 99.6% (95% CI = 98.5%-99.9%) specific for MACE. A HEART score ≥ 4 had a sensitivity of 95.0% (95% CI = 87.2%-98.2%) for prediction of mortality and 97.5% (95% CI = 93.7%-99.0%) for prediction of MI. CONCLUSIONS The HEART score has excellent performance for prediction of MACE (particularly mortality and MI) in chest pain patients and should be the primary clinical decision instrument used for the risk stratification of this patient population.","Fernando, Shannon M; Tran, Alexandre; Cheng, Wei; Rochwerg, Bram; Taljaard, Monica; Thiruganasambandamoorthy, Venkatesh; Kyeremanteng, Kwadwo; Perry, Jeffrey J",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.13649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30375097/,230

107012,Evaluation of lung volume loss with 3D CT volumetry in COVID-19 patients.,2020-09-02,"Background The relationship between local hospital culture and transfusion rates following endovascular and surgical cardiovascular procedures has not been well studied. Methods and Results Patients undergoing coronary revascularization, aortic valve replacement, lower extremity peripheral vascular intervention, or carotid artery revascularization from up to 852 US hospitals in the Nationwide Readmissions Database were identified. Crude and risk-standardized red blood cell transfusion rates were determined for each procedure. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between respective procedural transfusion rates. Median odds ratios were estimated to reflect between-hospital variability in red blood cell transfusion rates following the same procedure for a given patient. There was wide variation in red blood cell transfusion rates across different procedures, from 2% following carotid endarterectomy to 29% following surgical aortic valve replacement. For surgical and endovascular modalities, transfusion rates at the same hospital were highly correlated for aortic valve replacement (r=0.67; P<0.001), moderately correlated for coronary revascularization (r=0.56; P<0.001) and peripheral vascular intervention (r=0.51; P<0.001), and weakly correlated for carotid artery revascularization (r=0.19, P<0.001). Median odds ratios were all >2, highest for coronary artery bypass graft surgery and surgical aortic valve replacement, indicating substantial site variation in transfusion rates. Conclusions After adjustment for patient-related factors, wide variation in red blood cell transfusion rates remained across surgical and endovascular procedures employed for the same cardiovascular condition. Transfusion rates following these procedures are highly correlated at individual hospitals and vary widely across hospitals. In aggregate, these findings suggest that local institutional culture significantly influences the decision to transfuse following invasive cardiovascular procedures and highlight the need for randomized data to inform such decisions.","Apostolidou, Eirini; Kolte, Dhaval; Kennedy, Kevin F; Beale, Charles E; Abbott, J Dawn; Ehsan, Afshin; Gurm, Hitinder S; Carson, Jeffrey L; Mamdani, Shafiq; Aronow, Herbert D",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.016232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140685/,230

METHODS Phase 1 was an open-label safety study (10 patients); phase 2 was sham-controlled, randomized, and double-blind (10 sham procedure, 9 treated). All study patients fulfilled venous hemodynamic screening criteria indicative of CCSVI. Assessment was at 1, 3, and 6 months postprocedure with MRI, clinical, and hemodynamic outcomes. Primary endpoints were safety at 24 hours and 1 month, venous outflow restoration >75% at 1 month, and effect of angioplasty on new lesion activity and relapse rate over 6 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in disability, brain volume, cognitive tests, and quality of life. RESULTS No perioperative complications were noted; however, one patient with history of syncope was diagnosed with episodic bradycardia requiring placement of a pacemaker before discharge. Doppler evidence-based venous hemodynamic insufficiency severity score (VHISS) was reduced >75% compared to baseline in phase 1 (at 1 month) but not phase 2. In phase 2, higher MRI activity (cumulative number of new contrast-enhancing lesions [19 vs 3, p = 0.062] and new T2 lesions [17 vs 3, p = 0.066]) and relapse activity (4 vs 1, p = 0.389) were identified as nonsignificant trends in the treated vs sham arm over 6 months. Using analysis of covariance, significant cumulative new T2 lesions were related to larger VHISS decrease (p = 0.028) and angioplasty (p = 0.01) over the follow-up. No differences in other endpoints were detected. CONCLUSION Venous angioplasty is not an effective treatment for MS over the short term and may exacerbate underlying disease activity. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This is a Class I study demonstrating that clinical and imaging outcomes are no better or worse in patients with MS identified with venous outflow restriction who receive venous angioplasty compared to sham controls who do not receive angioplasty.

Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesise and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010-April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32,049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorised them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesised effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Kim; Jackson, Debra; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Bhullar, Navjot",International journal of mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860475/,230

108037,Facilitation of transvenous lead extraction using site-specific delivery of electrosurgical energy.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Despite clinical trials, there are still no approved specific therapies or any vaccine against COVID-19. The only option available is using investigational drugs for compassionate use. The update of the existing regulation regarding compassionate use is to ensure the effective and sustainable development of health policies and technologies over the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. AIM The present short communication aimed to highlight the need for early and expanded access to investigational drugs for compassionate use as well as a call for an update of the existing regulation in Bulgaria concerning compassionate use in the era of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS In EU and Bulgaria as well, the legal framework for compassionate use was introduced by Article 83 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council; in principle, Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council are mandatory for all Member States. Remdesivir appears to have a favorable clinical and safety profile, as reported in a case involving patients with severe COVID-19 through a compassionate use programme. RESULTS The overall probability of clinical improvement observed in 36 of 53 COVID-19 patients received intravenous remdesivir as part of a compassionate use programme was 68% (95% CI 40% to 80%). Thirty two patients (60%) demonstrated at least one adverse event, twelve 12 patients (23%) experienced serious adverse events and seven patients (13%) died. CONCLUSION The global pandemic mandates Bulgarian Drug Agency for a reasonable update of the existing national regulation concerning compassionate use and off-label therapies.

Here, two common plastic materials, an insulation layer of electric cables (polyvinyl chloride, PVC-cables) and plastic garbage bag (polyethylene, PE-bags), were incubated in natural seawater under laboratory conditions, and the PAE migration to the seawater phase was studied with varying light and bacterial conditions over a 90-day time course. Free PAEs diluted in seawater were also studied for bacterial degradation. Our results showed that, within the first month of incubation, both plastic materials significantly leached out PAEs into the surrounding water. We found that di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP) and di- n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) were the main PAEs released from the PE-bags, with the highest values of 83.4 ± 12.5 and 120.1 ± 18.0 ng g-1 of plastic, respectively. Furthermore, dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were the main PAEs released from PVC-cables, with mass fractions as high as 9.5 ± 1.4 and 68.9 ± 10.3 ng g-1, respectively. Additionally, we found that light and bacterial exposure increased the total amount of PAEs released from PVC-cables by a factor of up to 5, whereas they had no influence in the case of PE-bags.","Paluselli, Andrea; Fauvelle, Vincent; Galgani, François; Sempéré, Richard",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b05083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30479129/,230

The survey targeted hospital pharmacists (HPs), physicians (PHYs), nurses (NRS) and other healthcare professionals (OHCPs). A separate set of questions addressed patients (PTNs). METHODS A 28-question survey was conducted by EAHP, collecting information from European HPs, PTNs, NRS, PHYs and OHCPs on the shortage situation in their respective countries. The survey ran from 7 November 2019 to 13 January 2020. The results were analysed by EAHP. RESULTS There were 2136 HP responses to the 2019 survey compared with 1666 in 2018. While 95% of HPs and 89% of OHCPs consider medicine shortages a current problem, only 71% of PHYs and 62% of NRS state the same. Shortages of active pharmaceutical ingredients (72%), manufacturing (72%) and supply chain problems (49%) are leading causes of shortages according to HPs, while PHYs (40%) and NRS (37%) consider the pricing to be their driver. Antimicrobials and oncology medicines were most affected by shortages in 2019. Compared to 2018, the percentage of respondents who reported shortages of oncology medicines increased from 39% to 47% in 2019. HPs (42%), PHYs (36%) and OHCPs (38%) consider delays in care as the main consequence of medication shortages. The satisfaction with reporting systems for medicine shortages decreased from 56% in 2018 to 48% in 2019 for HPs, while they remain low for PHYs (36%). CONCLUSIONS Medicines shortages affect patient care and healthcare professionals' everyday tasks. Better enforcing of the mandatory early notification of shortages and structured mitigation response is recognised by all respondents as best strategy to tackle shortages.","Miljković, Nenad; Batista, Aida; Polidori, Piera; Kohl, Stephanie; Horák, Petr",European journal of hospital pharmacy : science and practice,https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2020-002341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471816/,230
109500,Are COVID-19 patients with hypertension at higher risk in China?,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Contingency management (CM), a behavioral intervention that provides incentives for achieving treatment goals, is an evidence-based adjunct to medication to treat opioid use disorder. Unfortunately, many front-line treatment providers do not utilize CM, likely due to contextual barriers that limit effective training and ongoing support for evidence-based practices. This study applied user-informed approaches to adapt a multi-level implementation strategy called the Science to Service Laboratory (SSL) to support CM implementation. METHODS Leaders and treatment providers working in community-based opioid treatment programs (OTPs; N = 43) completed qualitative interviews inquiring about their preferences for training and support implementation strategies (didactic training, performance feedback, and external facilitation). Our team coded interviews using a reflexive team approach to identify common a priori and emergent themes. RESULTS Leaders and providers expressed a preference for brief training that included case examples and research data, along with experiential learning strategies. They reported a desire for performance feedback from internal supervisors, patients, and clinical experts. Providers and leaders had mixed feelings about audio-recording sessions but were open to the use of rating sheets to evaluate CM performance. Finally, participants desired both on-call and regularly scheduled external facilitation to support their continued use of CM. CONCLUSIONS This study provides an exemplar of a user-informed approach to adapt the SSL implementation support strategies for CM scale-up in community OTPs. Study findings highlight the need for user-informed approaches to training, performance feedback, and facilitation to support sustained CM use in this setting.","Scott, Kelli; Jarman, Shelly; Moul, Samantha; Murphy, Cara M; Yap, Kimberly; Garner, Bryan R; Becker, Sara J",Implementation science communications,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00149-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931126/,230

110320,Evaluation of eosinopenia as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in COVID-19 infection.,2020-12-08,"OBJECTIVE The Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety (WCAHS) at the University of California, Davis implemented a multifaceted rapid response to COVID-19 in the western United States. This paper describes the center's response from mid-March through June 30, 2020. METHODS A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted with agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture-specific COVID-19 resources were developed and disseminated, and a farmer/employer survey was launched. RESULTS The WCAHS COVID-19 resources web page, worksite checklist, and training guide were shared on over 50 web pages nationally. As of June 30, 2020, 282 online surveys have been received. Ongoing informal discussions with agricultural stakeholders indicate a disconnect between the experiences of farmers/employers and farmworkers in relation to COVID-19 prevention at the worksite. Initial survey responses indicate that implementing social distancing is one of the greatest challenges at the worksite. Confusion over local, state, and federal guidelines and which to follow is another concern. CONCLUSION The WCAHS response to COVID-19, in close collaboration with agricultural stakeholders, represents a useful model for a rapid response to a public health crisis by regional centers. Key elements to its success include rapid personalized communication with a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, an actively engaged External Advisory Board, the development of industry-specific resources and information, recurring and iterative engagement with stakeholders as new COVID-19 information emerged and resources were developed, and the identification of the unique gap WCAHS was positioned to fill. The multipronged dissemination approach enhanced the reach of WCAHS COVID-19 resources.","Riden, Heather E; Schilli, Kara; Pinkerton, Kent E",Journal of agromedicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924x.2020.1815618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32896229/,230
111100,Radiofrequency ablation for the pre-excitation syndrome of functionally corrected transposition of great arteries.,2020-03-16,"Enveloped viruses such as SAR-CoV-2 are sensitive to temperature and are destroyed by temperatures tolerable to humans. All mammals use fever to deal with infections and heat has been used throughout human history in the form of hot springs, saunas, hammams, steam-rooms, sweat-lodges, steam inhalations, hot mud and poultices to prevent and treat respiratory infections and enhance health and wellbeing. This paper reviews the evidence for using heat to treat and prevent viral infections and discusses potential cellular, physiological and psychological mechanisms of action. In the initial phase of infection, heat applied to the upper airways can support the immune system's first line of defence by supporting muco-ciliary clearance and inhibiting or deactivating virions in the place where they first lodge. This may be further enhanced by the inhalation of steam containing essential oils with anti-viral, mucolytic and anxiolytic properties. Heat applied to the whole body can further support the immune system's second line of defence by mimicking fever and activating innate and acquired immune defences and building physiological resilience. Heat-based treatments also offer psychological benefits by directing focus on positive action, enhancing relaxation and sleep, inducing 'forced-mindfulness', and invoking the power of positive thinking and remembered wellness. Heat is a cheap, convenient and widely accessible therapeutic modality and while no clinical protocols exist for using heat to treat COVID-19, protocols that draw from traditional practices and consider contraindications, adverse effects and infection control measures could be developed and implemented rapidly and inexpensively on a wide scale. While there are significant challenges in implementing heat-based therapies during the current pandemic, these therapies present an opportunity to integrate natural medicine, conventional medicine and traditional wellness practices, and support the wellbeing of both patients and medical staff, while building community resilience and reducing the likelihood and impact of future pandemics.","Cohen, Marc",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.23299.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742639/,230

The aim of the present study was to systematically evaluate the safety and efficacy of propofol sedation for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). METHODS PubMed, the Cochrane library, and the Igaku-Chuo-Zasshi database were searched in order to identify randomized trials eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Data from the eligible studies were combined to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) of developing restlessness, full awakening at 1 h post-ESD, hypoxia, and hypotension. RESULTS We identified three randomized trials (298 patients) from the database search. Compared with traditional sedative agents, the pooled OR of restlessness and full awakening at 1 h post-ESD with propofol sedation were 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.81) and 8.59 (95% CI: 4.29-17.2), respectively, without significant heterogeneity. Compared with traditional sedative agents, the pooled OR of hypoxia and hypotension with propofol sedation were 1.13 (95% CI: 0.58-2.21) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.25-3.41), respectively, indicating no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSION Propofol sedation during ESD is more effective as compared with traditional sedative agent.

111888,MAFLD in COVID-19 patients: an insidious enemy.,2020-07-24,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the healthcare system in 2020. COVID-19 infection has been associated with poor outcomes after orthopedic surgery and elective, general surgery, but the impact of COVID-19 on outcomes after trauma is unknown. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to Pennsylvania trauma centers from March 21-July 31, 2020. The exposure of interest was COVID-19 (COV +) and the primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay and complications. We compared demographic and injury characteristics between positive, negative, and not-tested patients. We used multivariable regression with coarsened exact matching to estimate the impact of COV+ on outcomes. RESULTS Of 15,550 included patients, 8,170 (52.5%) were tested for COVID-19 and 219 (2.7%) were positive (COV+). Compared to COVID-19 negative (COV-) patients, COV+ patients were similar in terms of age and sex, but were less often white (53.5% vs. 74.7%, p < 0.0001), and more often uninsured (10.1 vs 5.6%, p = 0.002). Injury severity was similar, but firearm injuries accounted for 11.9% of COV+ patients vs. 5.1% of COV- patients (p < 0.001). Unadjusted mortality for COV+ was double that of COV- patients (9.1% vs 4.7%, p < 0.0001) and length of stay was longer (median of 5 vs. 4 days, p < 0.001). Using coarsened exact matching, COV+ patients had an increased risk of death (OR 6.05, 95% CI 2.29, 15.99), any complication (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.08, 3.16), and pulmonary complications (OR 5.79, 95% CI 2.02, 16.54) compared to COV- patients. CONCLUSIONS Patients with concomitant traumatic injury and COVID-19 infection have elevated risks of morbidity and mortality. Trauma centers must incorporate an understanding of these risks into patient and family counseling and resource allocation during this pandemic.

Their use, however, is not straightforward: choices and definitions, operationalisation of death, handling of missing data, choice of effect measures, and statistical analyses for these outcomes vary greatly. METHODS We will conduct a scoping review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. We will search 10 selected general and speciality journals for RCTs conducted in adult ICU patients from 2018 and onwards reporting at least one patient-important outcome other than mortality (including days alive without life support/days alive and out of hospital-type outcomes, health-related quality of life, functional/cognitive/neurological outcomes and other general patient-important outcomes). We will summarise data on outcome measures and definitions, assessment time points, proportions and handling of death, proportions and handling of missing data, and effect measures and statistical methods used for analysis. DISCUSSION The outlined scoping review will provide an overview of choices, definitions and handling of patient-important outcomes other than mortality in contemporary RCTs conducted in adult ICU patients.

112803,Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease and for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in older patients with moderate and severe functional impairments: a systematic review of controlled trials.,2021-07-16,"BACKGROUND Prenatal exposure to infections can modify immune development. These environmental disturbances during early life potentially alter the incidence of inflammatory disorders as well as priming of immune responses. Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is widely studied for its ability to alter immune responsiveness, and associated with variations in co-infection, allergy, and vaccine efficacy in endemic populations. OBJECTIVE Exposure to maternal schistosomiasis during early life, even without transmission of infection, can result in priming effects on offspring immune responses to bystander antigenic challenges as relate to allergic responsiveness and vaccination, with this work seeking to clarify further effects and underlying immunological imprinting. METHODS Here, we combine a chronic maternal schistosomiasis infection model with a thorough analysis of subsequent offspring immune responses to allergy and vaccination models, including viral challenge and steady state changes to immune cell compartments. RESULTS We demonstrate that maternal schistosomiasis alters CD4+ responses during allergic sensitization and challenge, in a skewed IL-4/B-cell-dominant response to antigenic challenge associated with limited inflammatory response. Beyond that, we uncover previously unidentified alterations to CD8+ T cell responses during immunization, dependent upon vaccine formulation, that have functional impact upon the efficacy of vaccination against viral infection in a murine Hepatitis B virus model. CONCLUSION Alongside steady-state modifications to CD4+ T cell polarization and B cell priming, we trace these modified CD8+ responses to an altered dendritic cell phenotype sustained into adulthood, providing evidence for complex priming effects imparted by infection via fetomaternal crosstalk.","Lacorcia, Matthew; Bhattacharjee, Sonakshi; Laubhahn, Kristina; Alhamdan, Fahd; Ram, Marija; Muschaweckh, Andreas; Potaczek, Daniel P; Kosinska, Anna; Garn, Holger; Protzer, Ulrike; Renz, Harold; Prazeres da Costa, Clarissa",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.02.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684437/,230
113131,Feasibility of transapical cardioscopic surgery in a pig model.,2015,"BACKGROUND Postural hypotension (PH), the reduction in blood pressure when rising from sitting or lying 0to standing, is a risk factor for falls, cognitive decline and mortality. However, it is not often tested for in primary care. PH prevalence varies according to definition, population, care setting and measurement method. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of PH across different care settings and disease subgroups. METHODS Systematic review, meta-analyses and meta-regression. We searched Medline and Embase to October 2019 for studies based in primary, community or institutional care settings reporting PH prevalence. Data and study level demographics were extracted independently by two reviewers. Pooled estimates for mean PH prevalence were compared between care settings and disease subgroups using random effects meta-analyses. Predictors of PH were explored using meta-regression. Quality assessment was undertaken using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS One thousand eight hundred sixteen studies were identified; 61 contributed to analyses. Pooled prevalences for PH using the consensus definition were 17% (95% CI, 14-20%; I2 = 99%) for 34 community cohorts, 19% (15-25%; I2 = 98%) for 23 primary care cohorts and 31% (15-50%; I2 = 0%) for 3 residential care or nursing homes cohorts (P = 0.16 between groups). By condition, prevalences were 20% (16-23%; I2 = 98%) with hypertension (20 cohorts), 21% (16-26%; I2 = 92%) with diabetes (4 cohorts), 25% (18-33%; I2 = 88%) with Parkinson's disease (7 cohorts) and 29% (25-33%, I2 = 0%) with dementia (3 cohorts), compared to 14% (12-17%, I2 = 99%) without these conditions (P < 0.01 between groups). Multivariable meta-regression modelling identified increasing age and diabetes as predictors of PH (P < 0.01, P = 0.13, respectively; R2 = 36%). PH prevalence was not affected by blood pressure measurement device (P = 0.65) or sitting or supine resting position (P = 0.24), however, when the definition of PH did not fulfil the consensus description, but fell within its parameters, prevalence was underestimated (P = 0.01) irrespective of study quality (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS PH prevalence in populations relevant to primary care is substantial and the definition of PH used is important. Our findings emphasise the importance of considering checking for PH, particularly in vulnerable populations, to enable interventions to manage it. These data should contribute to future guidelines relevant to the detection and treatment of PH.

Methods: This study covered the period from January 14 to March 1, 2020. From February 24 on, the supine position method and the protective face screen were used to collect nasopharyngeal swabs, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by sitting position method. All the patients were diagnosed with suspected/confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, who were admitted from February 19 on, before which, the nasopharyngeal swabs were collected outside the hospital. (1) Thirty-four operators meeting the inclusion criteria of the study were recruited in this retrospective cohort study. They were grouped according to the collection method of nasopharyngeal swabs. Sixteen operators of Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who used the supine position method and the protective face screen were included in supine position method+protective face screen group (15 males and 1 female, aged 34-49 years); 18 operators (12 from the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University (the Third Military Medical University), 1 from Wuhan Jiangxia Mobile Cabin Hospital, 5 from the East District of People's Hospital of Wuhan University) who used the traditional sitting position method were included in sitting position method group (2 males and 16 females, aged 25-49 years). In supine position method+protective face screen group, when collecting sample, the patient lay flat and wore a special protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swab sampling, with neck slightly extending and face turning to the opposite side of the operator about 10°. The self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the cooperation, the incidence of nausea, coughing, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, the operation time of single sampling, the fear of operation and the perceived exposure risk of operators of the two groups. (2) Sixty-five patients (22 males and 43 females, aged 25-91 years) admitted to Wuhan Taikang Tongji Hospital who successively received the sitting position method and supine position method+protective face screen for nasopharyngeal swabs sampling and with complete nucleic acid detection results were included. The positive rates of nucleic acid detection by the two sampling methods of nasopharyngeal swabs of the patients were statistically analyzed. (3) Forty-one patients who could express their feelings accurately were selected from the above 65 patients (12 males and 29 females, aged 27-83 years). The comfort of patients in the process of sampling by the two methods was investigated. (4) Thirty-four patients (10 males and 24 females, aged 25-83 years) with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method were selected from the above 65 patients. The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swab of patients by supine position method+protective face screen, i.e. negative to positive rate was statistically analyzed. Data were statistically analyzed with Wilcoxon's sign rank test, t test, and chi-square test. Results: (1) The cooperation score of patients evaluated by the operators in supine position method+protective face screen group was significantly higher than that in sitting position method group (Z=-4.928, P<0.01), the incidence of nausea, choking cough, sneezing, and struggling of patients evaluated by the operators, and the fear of operation score and the perceived exposure risk score of operators were significantly lower than those of sitting position method group (Z=-5.071, -5.046, -4.095, -4.397, -4.174, -5.049, P<0.01), and the operation time of single sampling was significantly longer than that of sitting position method group (t=23.17, P<0.01). (2) The positive rate of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by supine position method+protective face screen was 60.00% (39/65), which was obviously higher than 41.54% (27/65) by sitting position method (χ(2)=4.432, P<0.05). (3) The comfort score of the 41 patients during nasopharyngeal swabs sampling by supine position method+protective face screen was significantly higher than that by sitting position method (Z=-5.319, P<0.01). (4) Of the 34 patients with two or more consecutive negative results of nucleic acid detection of nasopharyngeal swabs by sitting position method, the rate of negative to positive of nucleic acid detection was 26.47% (9/34) after sampling by supine position method+protective face screen. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional sitting position method, detection of 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acids of nasopharyngeal swabs collected by supine method combined with protective face screen is worth promoting, because of its better comfort of patients, low exposure risk for operators, in addition to reducing in the false negative result to some extent, which may help reduce false recurrence of discharged patients.","Ma, S Y; Luo, Y M; Hu, T Y; You, Z C; Sun, J G; Yu, S Y; Yuan, Z Q; Peng, Y Z; Luo, G X; Xu, Z",Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501120-20200312-00153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268456/,230

In this work, we develop a facile, time-saving, and surfactant-assisted method to fabricate a new Z-scheme heterojunction based on TiO2/BiOCl. This photocatalyst is rich in oxygen vacancy defects (TiO2-OV-BiOCl), and displays an excellent photocatalytic degradation performance for imidacloprid (IMD), and a possible degradation pathway of IMD is provided. The surfactant F127 plays an essential role in regulating the oxygen vacancy defects (OVDs) of TiO2-OV-BiOCl, where the OVD mainly exists in 5 layer BiOCl ultrathin nanosheets. Free radical trapping experiments demonstrate that the introduction of an OVD in BiOCl as a 'charge mediator' changes the charge-transfer mode from a type-II mechanism to a Z-scheme mechanism. The formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction leads to an excellent light utilization and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers with a prolonged lifetime compared to those of BiOCl and TiO2/BiOCl. This work highlights the critical role of an OVD in the construction of a Z-scheme heterojunction of TiO2/BiOCl, and it can be applied to construct efficient photocatalytic systems for pesticide degradation.","Yang, Bin; Zheng, Jiliang; Li, Wei; Wang, Rongjie; Li, Danya; Guo, Xuhong; Rodriguez, Raul D; Jia, Xin",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0dt02128h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734976/,230

Numerous reports have indicated that EUS-FNA has high diagnostic performance and safety, which has led to the routine use of EUS-FNA and an increasing number of cases. Thus, while EUS-FNA has a low rate of complications, endoscopists may encounter these complications as the number of cases increases. Infrequent reports have also described life-threatening complications. Therefore, endoscopists should possess a comprehensive understanding of the complications of EUS-FNA, which include hemorrhage, perforation, infection, and acute pancreatitis, as well as their management. This review examines the available evidence regarding the complications associated with EUS-FNA, and the findings will be useful for ensuring that endoscopists perform EUS-FNA safely and appropriately.","Mizuide, Masafumi; Ryozawa, Shomei; Fujita, Akashi; Ogawa, Tomoya; Katsuda, Hiromune; Suzuki, Masahiro; Noguchi, Tatsuya; Tanisaka, Yuki",Diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10110964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213103/,230

To our knowledge, the role of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) as a prognostic factor has never been studied in NET patients. Therefore, we prospectively investigated whether (68)Ga-[1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid]-1-NaI3-octreotide ((68)Ga-DOTANOC) PET SUVmax could be used as an accurate noninvasive marker for disease prognosis. METHODS Forty-seven patients with NETs were studied with (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET. All patients underwent a baseline visit and laboratory and radiologic examinations. Follow-up was performed in all cases. RESULTS SUVmax was significantly higher in patients with pancreatic NET and in those with well-differentiated NETs. Moreover, SUVmax was significantly higher in patients with an elevated expression of 2A-somatostatin receptor. During the follow-up, the disease was stable or presented a partial response in 25 patients, and in 19 cases the disease progressed. The patients with stable disease or a partial response had an SUVmax significantly higher than did those in the progressive disease group, with the best cutoff ranging from 17.9 to 19.3. At univariate and multivariate analysis, the significant positive prognostic factors were well-differentiated NET, an SUVmax of 19.3 or more, and a combined treatment with long-acting somatostatin analogs and radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. CONCLUSION We demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, that (68)Ga-DOTANOC PET SUVmax correlates with the clinical and pathologic features of NETs and is also an accurate prognostic index.","Campana, Davide; Ambrosini, Valentina; Pezzilli, Raffaele; Fanti, Stefano; Labate, Antonio Maria Morselli; Santini, Donatella; Ceccarelli, Claudio; Nori, Francesca; Franchi, Roberto; Corinaldesi, Roberto; Tomassetti, Paola","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.109.066662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20150249/,230

METHODS Medical records of 89 consecutive women who underwent H-RSSM and 131 consecutive women who underwent RSSM were retrospectively reviewed. Patients characteristics and surgical outcomes were evaluated and compared between two groups. RESULTS The H-RSSM group had a significantly reduced operation time (98.7 ± 31.7 vs 141.4 ± 54.4 min, P < .001) and lower estimated blood loss (131.5 ± 78.1 vs 212.3 ± 189.8 mL, P < .001).

Droplet emission occurs during speech, yet few studies document the flow to provide the transport mechanism. This lack of understanding prevents informed public health guidance for risk reduction and mitigation strategies, e.g., the ""6-foot rule."" Here we analyze flows during breathing and speaking, including phonetic features, using orders-of-magnitude estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments. We document the spatiotemporal structure of the expelled airflow. Phonetic characteristics of plosive sounds like ""P"" lead to enhanced directed transport, including jet-like flows that entrain the surrounding air. We highlight three distinct temporal scaling laws for the transport distance of exhaled material including 1) transport over a short distance (<0.5 m) in a fraction of a second, with large angular variations due to the complexity of speech; 2) a longer distance, ∼1 m, where directed transport is driven by individual vortical puffs corresponding to plosive sounds; and 3) a distance out to about 2 m, or even farther, where sequential plosives in a sentence, corresponding effectively to a train of puffs, create conical, jet-like flows. The latter dictates the long-time transport in a conversation. We believe that this work will inform thinking about the role of ventilation, aerosol transport in disease transmission for humans and other animals, and yield a better understanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e., aerophonetics.","Abkarian, Manouk; Mendez, Simon; Xue, Nan; Yang, Fan; Stone, Howard A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012156117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978297/,230
116630,An unusual sidestream capnogram.,2017,"BACKGROUND Military personnel and Veterans are at increased risk for suicide. Theoretical and conceptual arguments have suggested that elevated levels of acquired capability (AC) could be an explanatory factor accounting for this increased risk. However, empirical research utilizing the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS) in military populations has yielded mixed findings. METHODS To better ascertain what factors are associated with AC, and whether methodological limitations may be contributing to mixed findings, a systematic review was conducted. RESULTS A total of 31 articles utilized the ACSS to examine factors associated with AC, including combat history, in United States (U.S.) military personnel and Veterans. Nearly all studies (96.8%) were rated high risk of bias. Use of the ACSS varied, with seven different iterations utilized. Nearly all studies examined correlations between the ACSS and sample characteristics, mental health and clinical factors, Interpersonal Theory of Suicide constructs, and/or suicide-specific variables. Results of higher-level analyses, dominated by cross-sectional designs, often contradicted correlational findings, with inconsistent findings across studies. LIMITATIONS Included studies were non-representative of all U.S. military and Veteran populations and may only generalize to these populations. CONCLUSIONS Due to the high risk of bias, inconsistent use of the ACSS, lack of sample heterogeneity, and variability in factors examined, interpretation of current ACSS empirical data is cautioned. Suggestions for future research, contextualized by these limitations, are discussed.","Kramer, Emily B; Gaeddert, Laurel A; Jackson, Christine L; Harnke, Ben; Nazem, Sarra",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.01.153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217223/,230

Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).","Kruse, Robert L",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22211.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32117569/,230

DQP-1105 inhibited GluN2C- and GluN2D-containing receptors with IC(50) values that were at least 50-fold lower than those for recombinant GluN2A-, GluN2B-, GluA1-, or GluK2-containing receptors. Inhibition was voltage-independent and could not be surmounted by increasing concentrations of either coagonist, glutamate or glycine, consistent with a noncompetitive mechanism of action. DQP-1105 inhibited single-channel currents in excised outside-out patches without significantly changing mean open time or single-channel conductance, suggesting that DQP inhibits a pregating step without changing the stability of the open pore conformation and thus channel closing rate. Evaluation of DQP-1105 inhibition of chimeric NMDA receptors identified two key residues in the lower lobe of the GluN2 agonist binding domain that control the selectivity of DQP-1105. These data suggest a mechanism for this new class of inhibitors and demonstrate that ligands can access, in a subunit-selective manner, a new site located in the lower, membrane-proximal portion of the agonist-binding domain.","Acker, Timothy M; Yuan, Hongjie; Hansen, Kasper B; Vance, Katie M; Ogden, Kevin K; Jensen, Henrik S; Burger, Pieter B; Mullasseril, Praseeda; Snyder, James P; Liotta, Dennis C; Traynelis, Stephen F",Molecular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1124/mol.111.073239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21807990/,230

Objective To assess HER2 protein overexpression in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GGEAC) samples from a single centre in Zambia. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks with GGEAC. Prepared slides were first stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and then evaluated for HER2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. Results A total of 57 gastric tissues were stained and evaluated for HER2 overexpression. Thirteen (23%) showed overexpression, 41/57 (72%) had negative and 3/57 (5%) had equivocal staining. The equivocal cases were excluded from the final analysis. Of the remaining 54 tissues, 28 (52%) were from females, and 26 (48%) were from males. The mean age was 59 years (SD 15 years). HER2 overexpression was highest in moderately differentiated tumours (p=0.0005). Intestinal type tumours had a higher occurrenc of HER2 overexpression than diffuse or mixed sub-types (p=0.0087). HER2 overexpression was not associated with age (p=0.27), sex (p=1.00) or anatomical location (p=1.00). Conclusion The occurrence of GGEAC HER2 overexpression in Zambian patients is similar to proportions reported elsewhere, and it is associated with moderately differentiated tumours of the intestinal type.","Kasochi, Chimwasu; Julius, Peter; Mweemba, Isaac; Kayamba, Violet",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.41; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394249/,230

This phenomenon was labeled 'EVALI' which stands for ""Electronic cigarette (E-cigarette), or Vaping, Product Use-Associated Lung Injury"" and is a life-threatening illness of the lungs associated with E-cigarette use. It is believed to be caused by certain chemicals in E-cigarette cartridges, such as vitamin E acetate, but the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elucidated. Since 2019, the CDC has recorded over 2800 cases in the United States with over 60 deaths. Though many people recover from EVALI, the long-term implications on pulmonary health are unknown. The purpose of this retrospective study was to demonstrate the pulmonary function test (PFT) findings in a group of patients who recovered from a diagnosis of EVALI. We reviewed the cases of 23 adult patients who presented to two major academic hospitals of the Northwell Health System with confirmed EVALI and followed up in our outpatient clinics with PFTs. Most patients had significantly reduced diffusion capacity (DLCO) demonstrating loss of functioning alveolar units. Given that average follow-up was over a month after discharge, this leads us to believe that EVALI can lead to persistent lung damage. However, further follow-up would be necessary to identify the full impact of E-cigarette use on the pulmonary function.","Wei, Xingyu; Iakovou, Annamaria; Makaryus, Mina R; Khanijo, Sameer",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522500/,230
119261,Pharmacotherapeutic considerations for the management of cardiovascular diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.,2020-07-23,"INTRODUCTION Closures and reductions in capacity of select health and social services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have placed people who use drugs (PWUD) at a disproportionately increased risk for experiencing harms, and resulted in critical treatment disruptions. We conducted the current national study among a cohort of PWUD to understand how COVID-19 has affected service access, including any significant impacts PWUD may have experienced. Results will contribute to the evidence base for informing future pandemic and public health policy planning for vulnerable populations. METHODS The project involved qualitative telephone-based interviews with 196 adult (aged 18+) PWUD from across Canada. Eligibility criteria included daily or weekly use of psychoactive substance(s), and/or current enrollment in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Data collection took place between May and July 2020. Data underwent thematic analyses, and common themes informed the results. RESULTS Most participants experienced detrimental service access issues and treatment disruptions during COVID-19, including reduced access to harm reduction services, OAT, withdrawal management and treatment services, medical professionals (e.g., addictions and mental health counseling), shelters/housing, and food banks. Positive impacts included greater access to OAT take-home 'carries' and prescription deliveries. Decreases in service capacity resulted in increased health issues and risky substance use behaviors among PWUD, such as unaccompanied substance use, sharing/re-use of supplies, and overdose events. CONCLUSIONS Reductions in the accessibility of critical services PWUD rely on during COVID-19 has increased existent substance use and health issues among PWUD, while decreasing their ability to mitigate risks related to substance use. Thus, the expansion of the depth and breadth of support options is crucial. Services must remain open and flexible to the unique needs of PWUD during COVID-19, while novel and effective adaptations and interventions should remain available and accessible post-COVID-19.","Russell, Cayley; Ali, Farihah; Nafeh, Frishta; Rehm, Jürgen; LeBlanc, Sean; Elton-Marshall, Tara",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080545/,230
119841,Interpreting sulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin in patients with cyanosis: An overview of patients with M-hemoglobin variants.,2021-06-06,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic stimulated a national lockdown in the UK. The public were advised to avoid unnecessary hospital attendances and health professionals were advised to avoid aerosol-generating procedures wherever possible. The authors hypothesised that these measures would result in a reduction in the number of patients presenting to hospital with acute appendicitis and alter treatment choices. METHODS A multicentred, prospective observational study was undertaken during April 2020 to identify adults treated for acute appendicitis. Searches of operative and radiological records were performed to identify patients treated during April 2018 and April 2019 for comparison. RESULTS A total of 190 patients were treated for acute appendicitis pre-lockdown compared with 64 patients treated during lockdown. Patients treated during the pandemic were more likely to have a higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (p = 0.049) and to have delayed their presentation to hospital (2 versus 3 days, p = 0.03). During the lockdown, the use of computed tomography (CT) increased from 36.3% to 85.9% (p < 0.001), the use of an antibiotic-only approach increased from 6.2% to 40.6% (p < 0.001) and the rate of laparoscopic appendicectomy reduced from 85.3% to 17.2% (p < 0.001). The negative appendicectomy rate decreased from 21.7% to 7.1% during lockdown (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a decreased incidence of acute appendicitis and a significant shift in the management approach. The increased use of CT allows the identification of simple appendicitis for conservative treatment and decreases the negative appendicectomy rate.","Mowbray, N G; Hurt, L; Powell-Chandler, A; Reeves, N; Chandler, S; Walters, E; Cornish, J",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682449/,230

There is no data on COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma or patients with asthma who are treated with monoclonal antibodies. Case Study: Here, we present the case of a severe eosinophilic asthmatic in whom benralizumab treatment, an anti-IL-5R monoclonal antibody, was initiated 2 years ago. Prior to benralizumab treatment, every viral infection had resulted in a prolonged course of oral corticosteroids (OCS). Since initiation of benralizumab, the patient has had good asthma control. Mid-March 2020, the patient developed high fever. Results: A SARS-CoV-2-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) was positive. The patient's symptoms subsided after few days. No OCS was needed. The asthma control questionnaire 6-item scale worsened moderately in the week of the infection and returned to normal levels thereafter. The asthma control test, measuring longer term asthma control, showed no decline. Conclusion: The course of COVID-19 was very mild in this particular patient with severe eosinophilic asthma. So far, there is no evidence that would suggest a more severe course of COVID-19 in patients with asthma. It is worth noting, that prior to the initiation of benralizumab this patient had multiple exacerbations per year triggered by viral infections (4/year), which all required OCS. Whilst only anecdotal, this case study provides the first evidence to support the current recommendation of continuing monoclonal antibodies in patients with severe asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Renner, Andreas; Marth, Katharina; Patocka, Karin; Pohl, Wolfgang",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,https://doi.org/10.1080/02770903.2020.1781165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519921/,230

Technique: This technique is demonstrated in a patient with residual aortic dissection after replacement of the ascending aorta for acute type A aortic dissection. He presented 4 years later with aneurysmal degeneration of the thoracoabdominal aorta and a proximal tear located in the aortic arch. A 2-stage hybrid approach was devised to treat the patient. An axilloaxillary crossover graft (left to right) with plug occlusion of the innominate artery was performed initially. Later, a dual-branched custom-made device was implanted. To avoid an additional LCCA cutdown for retrograde branch access, an 18-F steerable sheath was used through a percutaneous femoral access. Two wires were delivered within the steerable sheath: the first one was directed into the left subclavian artery to stabilize the sheath position in the ascending aorta; the second wire was used to catheterize the first inner branch and the LCCA to deploy the covered bridging stent. Conclusion: Transfemoral access to catheterize antegrade branches for supra-aortic vessels is feasible using a large steerable sheath in branched endovascular arch repair.","Settembrini, Alberto M; Kölbel, Tilo; Rohlffs, Fiona; Eleshra, Ahmed; Debus, E Sebastian; Panuccio, Giuseppe",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602820939936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633652/,230

METHODS An observational, retrospective, descriptive, and population-based study based of children who were hospitalized at the only national pediatric hospital of Costa Rica from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018 and had a confirmed influenza virus infection. RESULTS 336 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 35,6 ± 36,7 months (3,0 ± 3,1 years). The only significant variables at 25% in relation to influenza type A or B virus were: sex, month of diagnosis, fever, vomiting, cough, use of antibiotics and admission to the PICU. The hospitalization rate at our hospital increased between the months of October to December, with a higher percentage of cases in November and December, which reveals that the ""real peak"" in our population begins between 3 to 4 months after the end of the vaccination campaign. Patients with influenza A virus had a 2.5 times greater risk of being admitted to the PICU. Mortality rate was 0.6% and 0% among influenza A and B children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Variables in which a causality was found with type A or B virus were: admission to the PICU, month of diagnosis, and cough. However, influenza B clinical behavior continues to be unpredictable.","Ávila-Morales, Silvia; Ospina-Henao, Sebastián; Ulloa-Gutierrez, Rolando; Ávila-Agüero, María L",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711523/,230

This condition is characterized by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time. METHOD Blood samples from three COVID-19 patients treated in a Hungarian intensive care unit were collected and analyzed with ClotPro® tests. EX-tests, IN-test, FIB-tests, RVV-tests, and TPA-tests were performed. The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients. RESULTS Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a ""shut down"" phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro®. The ClotPro® parameters were consistent with the conventional coagulation tests and corresponded with the criteria of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. CONCLUSION These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy. Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy.

The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding the influence of this intervention in patients undergoing lung resection. METHODS The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. Eight bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for studies comparing postoperative outcomes in adult patients treated within an enhanced-recovery pathway or traditional care. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. RESULTS Six studies fulfilled our selection criteria (1 randomized and 5 nonrandomized studies). All the nonrandomized studies reported shorter length of stay in the intervention group (difference, 1.2-9.1 days), but the randomized study reported no differences. There were no differences between groups in readmissions, overall complications, and mortality rates. Two nonrandomized studies reported reduction in hospital costs in the intervention group. Risk of bias favoring enhanced recovery pathways was high. CONCLUSIONS A small number of low-quality comparative studies have evaluated the influence of enhanced-recovery pathways in patients undergoing lung resection. Some studies suggest that this intervention may reduce length of stay and hospital costs, but they should be interpreted in light of several methodologic limitations. This review highlights the need for well-designed trials to provide conclusive evidence about the role of enhanced-recovery pathways in this patient population.","Fiore, Julio F; Bejjani, Jimmy; Conrad, Kate; Niculiseanu, Petru; Landry, Tara; Lee, Lawrence; Ferri, Lorenzo E; Feldman, Liane S",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.09.112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26553460/,230
121239,De Novo Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis After COVID-19 in a Patient With a Transplanted Kidney From a Donor With a High-risk APOL1 Variant.,2020-08-24,"Heart failure (HF) is a major health-care problem and the prognosis of affected patients is poor. HF often coexists with a number of comorbidities of which declining renal function is of particular importance. A loss of glomerular filtration rate, as in acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), independently predicts mortality and accelerates the overall progression of cardiovascular disease and HF. Importantly, cardiac and renal diseases interact in a complex bidirectional and interdependent manner in both acute and chronic settings. From a pathophysiological perspective, cardiac and renal diseases share a number of common pathways, including inflammatory and direct, cellular immune-mediated mechanisms; stress-mediated and (neuro)hormonal responses; metabolic and nutritional changes including bone and mineral disorder, altered haemodynamic and acid-base or fluid status; and the development of anaemia. In an effort to better understand the important crosstalk between the two organs, classifications such as the cardio-renal syndromes were developed. This classification might lead to a more precise understanding of the complex interdependent pathophysiology of cardiac and renal diseases. In light of exceptionally high mortality associated with coexisting HF and kidney disease, this Review describes important crosstalk between the heart and kidney, with a focus on HF and kidney disease in the acute and chronic settings. Underlying molecular and cellular pathomechanisms in HF, AKI and CKD are discussed in addition to current and future therapeutic approaches.","Schefold, Joerg C; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Hasenfuss, Gerd; Anker, Stefan D; von Haehling, Stephan",Nature reviews.

121326,"Standard ""off-the-shelf"" multibranched thoracoabdominal endograft in urgent and elective patients with single and staged procedures in a multicenter experience.",2018,"BACKGROUND Combining non-contrast CT (NCCT), CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP) imaging (referred to as a CT stroke study, CTSS) provides a rapid evaluation of the cerebrovascular axis during acute ischemic stroke. Iodinated contrast-enhanced CT imaging is not without risk, which includes renal injury. If a patient's CTSS identifies vascular pathology, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is often performed within 24-48 h. Such patients may receive multiple administrations of iodinated contrast material over a short time period. OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients who underwent a CTSS and DSA for evaluation of acute ischemic symptoms or for stroke intervention within a 48 h period between August 2012 and December 2014. METHODS We identified 84 patients for inclusion in the analysis. Patients fell into one of two cohorts: AKI, defined as a rise in the serum creatinine level of ≥0.5 mg/dL from baseline, or non-AKI. Clinical parameters included pre- and post-imaging serum creatinine level, time between CTSS and DSA, and type of angiographic procedure (diagnostic vs intervention) performed. RESULTS Four patients (4.7%) experienced AKI, one of whom had baseline renal dysfunction (defined as baseline serum creatinine level ≥1.5 mg/dL). The mean difference between baseline and peak creatinine values was found to be significantly greater in patients with AKI than in non-AKI patients (1.65 vs -0.09, respectively; p=0.0008). CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary evidence of the safety and feasibility of obtaining CTSS with additional DSA imaging, whether for diagnosis or intervention, to identify possible acute ischemic stroke.","Hall, Shelby L; Munich, Stephan A; Cress, Marshall C; Rangel-Castilla, Leonardo; Levy, Elad I; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26847330/,230

Traditionally, residency and fellowship training program applications involve in-person interviews conducted on-site, with only a minority of programs offering interviews remotely via a virtual platform. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is anticipated that most interviews will be conducted virtually for the 2021 application cycle, and possibly beyond. Therefore, GME training programs need to prepare for the transition to virtual interviews using evidence-based practices. At the University of California, San Francisco, a multidisciplinary task force was convened to review existing literature about virtual interviews and determine best practices. This article summarizes these findings, first discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the virtual interview format and then providing evidence-based best practices for GME training programs. Specifically, the authors make the following recommendations: develop a detailed plan for the interview process, consider using standardized interview questions, recognize and respond to potential biases that may be amplified with the virtual interview format, prepare your own trainees for virtual interviews, develop electronic materials and virtual social events to approximate the interview day, and collect data about virtual interviews at your own institution.

122631,Apoptosis-Induced T Cell Lymphopenia Is Related to COVID-19 Severity.,2020-12-17,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic incisional ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) is often followed by seroma formation, bulging and failure to restore abdominal wall function. These outcomes are risk factors for hernia recurrence, chronic pain and poor quality of life (QoL). We aimed to evaluate whether LIVHR combined with defect closure (hybrid) follows as a diminished seroma formation and thereby has a lower rate of hernia recurrence and chronic pain compared to standard LIVHR. METHODS This study is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. From November 2012 to May 2015, 193 patients undergoing LIVHR for primary incisional hernia with fascial defect size from 2 to 7 cm were recruited in 11 Finnish hospitals. Patients were randomised to either a laparoscopic (LG) or a hybrid (HG) repair group. The main outcome measure was hernia recurrence, evaluated clinically and radiologically at a 1-year follow-up visit. At the same time, chronic pain scores and QoL were also measured. RESULTS At the 1-year-control visit, we found no difference in hernia recurrence between the study groups. Altogether, 11 recurrent hernias were found in ultrasound examination, producing a recurrence rate of 6.4%. Of these recurrences, 6 (6.7%) were in the LG group and 5 (6.1%) were in the HG group (p > 0.90). The visual analogue scores for pain were low in both groups; the mean visual analogue scale (VAS) was 1.5 in LG and 1.4 in HG (p = 0.50). QoL improved significantly comparing preoperative status to 1 year after operation in both groups since the bodily pain score increased by 7.8 points (p < 0.001) and physical functioning by 4.3 points (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION Long-term follow-up is needed to demonstrate the potential advantage of a hybrid operation with fascial defect closure. Both techniques had low hernia recurrence rates 1 year after operation. LIVHR reduces chronic pain and physical impairment and improves QoL.

Our hospital was immediately closed and re-opened after 15 days as a reference Covid Hospital. Among services involved in a process of destruction and rebirth there was also the Vascular Access Team. METHODS We analyzed our Vascular Access Team activity comparing data from the first month (March) in which basically it did not work and data from the following month (April) in which we began to re-build the Team adapting it to the new reality. RESULTS In all patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit a Centrally Inserted Central Catheter multilumen was placed, but in March only 5.5% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit had a catheter different from the short peripheral cannula while in April it was possible to guarantee a more suitable catheter 31.7% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (p < 0.000). In April, compared to March, a significant higher number of Midline were implanted in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (36/139 vs 12/238 p < 0.000) where also a higher number of Centrally Inserted Central Catheter and Femoral Inserted Central Catheter were implanted (8/139 vs 1/238 p = 0.003). This change allowed us to implant more vascular accesses in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit favoring Midline with a longer average duration. Only one patient with Midline developed a catheter vein thrombosis, and in only one patient the device was removed for suspected infection. CONCLUSIONS The experience we gained will allow us to be more prepared in the future and our experience has highlighted that a structured Vascular Access Team is necessary to respond adequately to COVID-19 patients' needs, to ensure the effectiveness of the maneuver, to reduce complications and to avoid the waste of resources, always working in safe condition.","Deganello, Elisa; Gastaldo, Francesco; Masiero, Sonia; Fasson, Milena; Colopi, Riccardo Ivan; Girotto, Luciano; Monticelli, Jacopo; Marcante, Elena; Furlan, Patrizia; Baldo, Vincenzo; Pilerci, Claudio; Realdon, Piero; Montemurro, Domenico; Rigo, Alberto; Benini, Patrizia; Baratto, Fabio",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/11297298211005254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827318/,230

Given the impact of pain assessment on patient outcomes and length of hospital stay, studies have been conducted to validate tools, establish guidelines and cast light on practices relating to pain assessment. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent, range and nature of the evidence around pain assessment practices in adult patients who cannot self-report pain in the intensive care setting and summarise the findings from a heterogenous body of evidence to aid in the planning and the conduct of future research and management of patient care. The specific patient cohort studied was the sedated/ ventilated patient within the intensive care setting. DESIGN A scoping review protocol utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping review checklist (PRISMA-ScR). METHODS The review comprised of five phases: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection, charting the data and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Databases were systematically searched from January to April 2020. Databases included were Scopus, Web of Science, Medline via Ovid, CINAHL COMPLETE via EBSCO host, Health Source and PUBMED. Limits were applied on dates (2000 to current), language (English), subject (human) and age (adult). Key words used were ""pain"", ""assessment"", ""measurement"", ""tools"", ""instruments"", ""practices"", ""sedated"", ""ventilated"", ""adult"". A hand search technique was used to search citations within articles. Database alerts were set to apprise the availability of research articles pertaining to pain assessment practices in the intensive care setting. RESULTS The review uncovered literature categorised under five general themes: behaviour pain assessment tools, pain assessment guidelines, position statements and quality improvement projects, enablers and barriers to pain assessment, and evidence appertaining to actual practices. Behaviour pain assessment tools are the benchmark for pain assessment of sedated and ventilated patients. The reliability and validity of physiologic parameters to assess pain is yet to be determined. Issues of compliance with pain assessment guidelines and tools exist and impact on practices. In some countries like Australia, there is a dearth of information regarding the prevalence and characteristics of patients receiving analgesia, type of analgesia used, pain assessment practices and the process of recording pain management. In general, pain assessment varies across different intensive care settings and lacks consistency. CONCLUSION Research on pain assessment practices requires further investigation to explore the causative mechanisms that contribute to poor compliance with established pain management guidelines.

Epidemiological studies in humans have provided refined estimates of exposure risk with evidence suggesting that risk association with particulate matter <2.5 levels and ASCVD continues at levels well below air quality guidelines in North America and Europe. Mechanistic studies in animals and humans have provided a framework of understanding of the duration and pathways by which air pollution exposure may predispose to atherosclerosis. Although acute exposure to particulate matter <2.5 is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, system transmission of signals from the lungs to extrapulmonary sites may involve direct translocation of components, biologic intermediates, and autonomic nervous system activation. End-organ effector pathways, such as endothelial barrier disruption/dysfunction, thrombosis, vasoconstriction/increased blood pressure, and plaque instability, may contribute to ASCVD. The strength of the association of air pollution with ASCVD offers an opportunity to mitigate its consequences. Although elimination of anthropogenic sources of air pollution with a switch to clean energy provides the ultimate solution, this may not be possible in the interim and may require personal protection efforts and an integrated approach to managing risk posed by air pollution for ASCVD.","Bevan, Graham H; Al-Kindi, Sadeer; Brook, Robert D; Münzel, Thomas; Rajagopalan, Sanjay","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.120.315219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33327745/,230

This case-control study investigates hearing and speech perception both in quiet and with background noise 30-years after CBCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS One-hundred-and-one patients (Cases) who received CBCT for testicular cancer between 1980 and 1994 were assessed with pure-tone audiometry (.125 - 8 kHz) and speech perception tests including hearing in noise test (HINT). Self-reported hearing and tinnitus was scored by participants. Results were compared with 30 age-matched controls. RESULTS The median age of Cases and Controls was 60 (46 - 83) and 61 years (51 - 74), respectively. The median observation time for Cases was 30 years (22 - 37). Compared with Controls, Cases had 8 and 19 dB worse age-adjusted high-frequency hearing at 6 and 8 kHz, respectively (p <.05), while thresholds at lower frequencies did not differ. All but four Cases reached 100% speech perception with basic speech audiometry. There was no difference between Cases and Controls in speech perception neither in quiet nor with both speech and background noise from the front, although the within-group variance was greater among Cases. Cases scored slightly worse with speech from front and noise from either side. Self-reported hearing loss (both hearing loss in general and specifically with background noise), and tinnitus were about three times more common among Cases compared with Controls. CONCLUSIONS Cisplatin causes high-frequency hearing loss, but speech perception tests performed both in quiet and in background noise 30 years post-treatment indicate that the clinical relevance is limited for most patients. Few patients develop severe hearing loss that requires rehabilitation but it is important to identify these patients. Self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus were more common among Cases compared with Controls.","Skalleberg, J; Myhrum, M; Småstuen, M C; Osnes, T A; Fosså, S D; Bunne, M",Acta oncologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2021.1887514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617403/,230

Blocking this interaction shows promise for blocking or ameliorating the virus' pathological effects on the body. By contrast to work focusing on the coronavirus, which has significant potential diversity through possible accumulation of mutations during transmission, targeting the conserved ACE2 protein expressed on human cells offers an attractive alternative route to developing pharmacological prophylactics against viral invasion. In this study, we screened a virtual database of natural peptides in silico, with ACE2 as the target, and performed structural analyses of the interface region in the SARS-COV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. These analyses have identified 15 potentially effective compounds. Analyses of ACE2/polypeptide interactions suggest that these peptides can block viral invasion of cells by stably binding in the ACE2 active site pocket. Molecular simulation results for Complestatin and Valinomycin indicate that they may share this mechanism. The discovery of this probable binding mechanism provides a frame of reference for further optimization, and design of high affinity ACE2 inhibitors that could serve as leads for production of drugs with preventive and therapeutic effects against SARS-COV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Cumulative evidence points to the positive contribution of spiritually on health and wellbeing. However, there is little clarity about what spirituality means. The literature reveals that nurses have ascribed a diversity of interpretations to spirituality. However, no studies have investigated how registered nurses construct their understanding of spirituality using a critical discourse analysis approach. Therefore, the aim of this study was to uncover how registered nurses construct their understanding of spirituality using a critical discourse analysis approach. Twenty registered nurses from a non-denominational public hospital and a faith-based private hospital were interviewed about their understanding of spirituality and practice of spiritual care. A critical discourse analysis approach was used in the examination of the interview texts to uncover underlying social and power features. Links were made between the linguistic features the registered nurses used in their interviews and the broader social context of the study. Three discourses emerged from the interview texts. These include constructing spirituality through personal religious beliefs discourse, holistic discourse and empathetic care discourse. The findings of this study have implications for nurse education and policy makers.","Louise Cooper, Katherine; Luck, Lauretta; Chang, Esther; Dixon, Kathleen",Nursing inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1111/nin.12385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017505/,230
125797,Bleeding complications in patients with coronary stents during non-cardiac surgery.,2014,"OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are to investigate how many advanced cancer patients became unconscious or non-communicative after pharmacological treatment for delirium, and to explore whether existing delirium assessment tools can successfully evaluate its severity at the end of life. METHODS This was a secondary analysis of a registry study that examined the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for advanced cancer patients with delirium. A total of 818 patients were recruited from 39 specialized palliative care services in Japan. The severity of delirium was measured using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale-Palliative care version, the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98), and the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) on Day 3. Data from 302 patients with motor anxiety with an Agitation Distress Scale score ≥2 on Day 0 were analyzed for this study. The patients were categorized into four treatment response groups: complete response (CR: no agitation and fully communicative), partial response (PR: no/mild agitation and partially communicative), unconscious/non-communicative (UC), and no change (NC). RESULTS On Day 3, 29 (10%; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 7-13) and 2 (1%; 95% CI, 0-2) patients became unconscious and non-communicative, respectively. Forty-four patients were categorized as CR, 97 as PR, 31 as UC, and 96 as NC. The scores of the DRS-R-98 and Nu-DESC in the UC group were rated higher than patients in the NC group were. CONCLUSIONS A considerable number of cancer patients with delirium became unconscious or non-communicative. Existing delirium assessment tools may be inappropriate for measuring the severity of delirium in end-of-life. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective of this study was to compare the biomechanical properties of medial and anterolateral plating constructs used to stabilize simulated varus and valgus fracture patterns of the distal tibia. In 16 synthetic tibia models, a 45° oblique cut was made to model an Orthopedic Trauma Association type 43-A1.2 distal tibia fracture in either a varus or valgus injury pattern. Each fracture was then reduced and plated with a precontoured medial or anterolateral distal tibia plate. The specimens were biomechanically tested in axial and torsional loading, cyclic axial loading, and load to failure. For the varus fracture pattern, medial plating showed less fracture site displacement and rotation and was stiffer in both axial and torsional loading (P<.05). For the valgus fracture pattern, there was no statistically significant difference between medial and anterolateral plating. There were no significant differences between the 2 constructs for either fracture pattern with respect to ultimate load, displacement, or energy absorption in load to failure testing. When used to stabilize varus fracture patterns, medial plates showed superior biomechanical performance compared with anterolateral plates. In this application, the medial plates functioned in anti-glide mode. For valgus fracture patterns, no biomechanical differences between anterolateral and medial plating were observed. In clinical practice, surgeons should take this biomechanical evidence into account when devising a treatment strategy for fixation of distal tibia fractures.","Pirolo, Joseph M; Behn, Anthony W; Abrams, Geoffrey D; Bishop, Julius A",Orthopedics,https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20150902-52; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375532/,230

127197,"Letter by Kwan et al Regarding Article, ""Acute Stroke Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Does Confinement Impact Eligibility for Endovascular Therapy?""",2020-11-01,"Background Since there are no certified therapeutics to treat COVID-19 patients, drug repurposing became important. With lack of time to test individual pharmacogenomics markers, population pharmacogenomics could be helpful in predicting a higher risk of developing adverse reactions and treatment failure in COVID-19 patients. Aim of our study was to identify pharmacogenes and pharmacogenomics markers associated with drugs recommended for COVID-19 treatment, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir and ritonavir, in population of Serbia and other world populations. Methods Genotype information of 143 individuals of Serbian origin was extracted from database previously obtained using TruSight One Gene Panel (Illumina). Genotype data of individuals from different world populations were extracted from the 1000 Genome Project. Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of allele frequencies. Results We have identified 11 potential pharmacogenomics markers in 7 pharmacogenes relevant for COVID-19 treatment. Based on high alternative allele frequencies in population and the functional effect of the variants, ABCB1 rs1045642 and rs2032582 could be relevant for reduced clearance of azithromycin, lopinavir and ritonavir drugs and UGT1A7 rs17868323 for hyperbilirubinemia in ritonavir treated COVID-19 patients in Serbian population. SLCO1B1 rs4149056 is a potential marker of lopinavir response, especially in Italian population. Our results confirmed that pharmacogenomics profile of African population is different from the rest of the world. Conclusions Considering population specific pharmacogenomics landscape, preemptive testing for pharmacogenes relevant for drugs used in COVID-19 treatment could contribute to better understanding of the inconsistency in therapy response and could be applied to improve the outcome of the COVID-19 patients.","Stanković, Biljana; Kotur, Nikola; Gašić, Vladimir; Klaassen, Kristel; Ristivojević, Bojan; Stojiljković, Maja; Pavlović, Sonja; Zukić, Branka",Journal of medical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.5937/jomb0-26725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312066/,230

They play a critical role in conducting KT research and practice. Currently, little is known about the usage of TFMs in KT in Chinese healthcare settings. The aim of this scoping review is to identify which TFMs had been used for KT in healthcare settings in China, and how these TFMs were used. METHODS The protocol for this scoping review is in accordance with the Arksey and O'Malley framework and further enhanced by the recommendations suggested by Levac et al. We will search 8 databases (4 Chinese and 4 English) to identify relevant studies. Four reviewers (2 for Chinese, 2 for English) will independently screen studies based on the eligibility criteria. The basic characteristic of studies and the TFMs utilization (i.e., what, why, and how) will be extracted. Methodological quality and reporting quality will be assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) (or Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence, SQUIRE 2.0 for quality improvement studies), respectively. All the retrieved TFMs will be categorized into Nilsen's classifications of TFMs for KT research. We will employ the qualitative content analysis approach to summarize how these TFMs have been used, and the rationale. A consultation will be conducted through a 1-h interactive virtual meeting with an expert panel of knowledge users. DISCUSSION By conducting this scoping review, we expect to gain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of why and how TFMs have been used in KT research and practice in China, and to identify gaps and provide recommendations for more efficient and meaningful use of TFMs in the future.

127936,[Results of decision support system implementation for prescribing anticoagulants to patients with atrial fibrillation in hospital].,2020-09-03,"INTRODUCTION Intracorporeal suturing is time-consuming and could be difficult in certain operative circumstances. Instead of knot tying, specially designed clips have been introduced to anchor and secure the end of a single strand or suture. Although these clips provide a maximal required holding grip (HG), they considerably increase the cost of the procedure. The aim of this in vitro study was to identify the feasibility, and means of achieving the best HG, of commonly used disposable automatic clip appliers (LCAs) over regular strands. METHODS We placed 2-0 PDS (rigid) and 2-0 Vicryl (soft) sutures through fresh gastric wall specimens. Six different commercial-type LCAs, all having large or medium/large clips, were applied at the distal end of each suture. An IMDA manual digital force gauge was used to measure the HG of each clip at 2 positions: the middle clip position and the angle (at the crouch) position. A total of 192 measurements were taken. The results were classified into 3 HG levels measured by Newton units (N): the strongest grip (> 1 N), medium grip (> 0.5 and < 1 N), and weak grip (< 0.5 N). RESULTS The strongest HG was obtained by applying 10 to 12 mm LCAs with large or medium/large clips over PDS at an angle position (HG = 1.1 ± 0.2 to 1.6 ± 0.3 N). The weakest grip was obtained by applying any type of LCA over Vicryl at the middle position (HG = 0.08 ± 0.04 to 0.2 ± 0.06 N, P < 0.001). The latter was associated with clips freely falling off the sutures even before applying any force. In general, more force was needed to dislodge any brand clip from the PDS compared with Vicryl suture (0.8 ± 0.6 vs. 0.4 ± 0.3 N, P < 0.001). The angle position was always stronger than the middle position (0.9 ± 0.6 vs. 0.3 ± 0.2 N, P < 0.001). There was a trend for the 10 to 12 mm LCA to have a better HG than the 5 mm ones (0.65 ± 0.5 vs. 0.51 ± 0.5 N, P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS We propose that 10 to 12 mm LCAs generate enough HG to secure a single strand when clips are placed at the angle position. This is especially true over PDS (hard) strands. The application of 5 mm LCA clips to secure the end of the Vicryl strand is not recommended. Further clinical studies are warranted.","Buchholz, Vered; Sadot, Eran; Spivak, Hadar","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26147048/,230
128063,COVID-19 Continuous-EEG Case Series: A Descriptive Study.,2021-02-16,"PURPOSE The endotracheal tube (ETT) constitutes a significant component of total airway resistance. However, a discrepancy between measured and theoretical values has been reported in airway resistance through ETTs. The causes of the discrepancy were estimated by physical and rheological simulations. METHODS The pressure losses through total lengths of ETTs and slip joints under a volumetric flow rate of 30 L/min were measured, and the pressure losses through the tubular parts of ETTs with internal diameters (IDs) of 6.0-, 6.5-, 7.0-, 7.5-, and 8.0 mm were measured. The Reynolds number of each setting was calculated, and the pressure losses through the total length of the ETT, the tubular part, and the slip joint of each size of tube were estimated. RESULTS The Reynolds numbers were >5000 in all sizes of ETTs. Measured pressure losses were larger in small sized ETTs than in large sized ETTs-520.9 Pascals (Pa) in 6.0-mm ID and 136.4 Pa in 8.0-mm ID tubes. The measured pressure losses through the tubular part were comparable to the predicted values. The measured pressure losses through the slip joints were larger than the predicted values, and they accounted for approximately 25-40% of total pressure losses of the ETTs. CONCLUSION Especially in small sized tubes, the pressure loss through the slip joint accounts for a large percentage of the total pressure loss through the ETT. The pressure loss through the slip joint may play a role in the discrepancy between measured and theoretical pressure losses through ETTs.","Takasugi, Yoshihiro; Futagawa, Koichi; Kazuhara, Kouhei; Morishita, Satoshi; Okuda, Takahiko",Journal of anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-016-2210-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27370893/,230

METHOD Each year a systematic process is carried out to retrieve articles and to select a set of best papers for the CIS section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook of Medical Informatics. The query aiming at identifying relevant publications in the field of CIS was refined by the section editors during the last years. For three years now, the query is stable. It comprises search terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus as well as additional free text search terms from PubMed and Web of Science®. The retrieved articles were categorized in a multi-pass review carried out by the two section editors. The final selection of candidate papers was then peer-reviewed by Yearbook editors and external reviewers. Based on the review results, the best papers were then selected by the IMIA Yearbook editorial board. Text mining, and term co-occurrence mapping techniques were used to get an overview on the content of the retrieved articles. RESULTS The query was carried out in mid-January 2018, yielding a consolidated result set of 2,255 articles which had been published in 939 different journals. Out of them, 15 papers were nominated as candidate best papers and four of them were finally selected as best papers in the CIS section. Again, the content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics which is covered by CIS research. CONCLUSIONS Modern clinical information systems serve as backbone for a very complex, trans-institutional information logistics process. Data that is produced by, documented in, shared via, organized in, presented by, and stored within clinical information systems is more and more reused for multiple purposes. We found a lot of examples showing the benefits of such data reuse with various novel approaches implemented to tackle the challenges of this process. We also found that the patient moves in the focus of interest of CIS research. So the loop of information logistics begins to close: data from the patients is used to produce value for the patients.","Hackl, Werner O; Hoerbst, Alexander",Yearbook of medical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1667076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30157511/,230

We aim to discuss the importance of recognition of viruses both epidemiologically and clinically as causes of lower respiratory tract infection. RECENT FINDINGS With advances of molecular testing it is now possible to identify viruses from clinical specimens which have many implications that range from therapeutics to antibiotic stewardship. Recent studies suggest that most of the cases of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, which corresponds to a paradigm shift for most clinicians. SUMMARY As community-acquired lower respiratory infections are the most common cause of ICU admission in the USA, it is important for medical providers to be aware of the association with viruses, especially in patients with immunosuppression because of solid organ transplant and hematologic malignancies when sometimes diagnosis can be challenging and patients can be exposed to unnecessary antibiotics.","Dominguez, Fernando; Blodget, Emily",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192816/,230

We aimed to assess whether there are differences in clinical manifestations between COVID-19 patients from the East (East and South-East Asian countries including China, South Korea, and Thailand) and the West (North American, European, and Middle East countries, including the United States, Italy, France, and Iran). METHODS For this meta-analysis, we searched for eligible studies about COVID-19 in three databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were divided into two cohorts for analysis: the East and the West. Stata 13·1 software was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS Of the 1527 studies initially identified by the literature search, 169 full-text articles were retrieved and screened for eligibility. Fifty-seven of these, describing 19 353 patients, were deemed eligible for inclusion. Of these, 45 studies with 8 416 patients were from the East while 12 studies with 10 937 patients were from the West. The results indicated that the incidences of cough, headache, dizziness, nasal congestion, and digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients from the East were lower than those in the West. The laboratory data showed that there were no significant differences in the levels of lymphocytes, leukocytes, C-reactive protein, and platelet counts between the two groups. In addition, our results also showed that the incidence of cardiac and kidney injury, as well as increased levels of creatinine, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase, were significantly higher in patients from the West than from the East. CONCLUSION Our meta-analysis indicated that there are differences in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients from the East and the West. COVID-19 patients from the West appear to suffer more severe liver, kidney, and heart damage due to SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright.

PATIENTS AND DESIGN A case-control study of 70 women with POI matched by age and body mass index with 70 controls. MEASUREMENTS All were submitted to whole body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to analyze body composition. In the POI group, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, transaminases and C-reactive protein levels were measured, as well as the thickness of the carotid artery intima-media complex. RESULTS Total mass, fat mass, lean mass (total, percentage and index), and the android/gynoid (A/G) ratio were similar in both groups; however, bone mineral content was lower (p<0.001) in the POI group. Lean and fat mass indexes were 14.19±1.63 and 11.04±3.58, respectively, and the percentage of gynoid to android fat was higher (51.17±6.71% versus 47.74±9.19%; A/G ratio=0.93±0.15) in the POI group. In addition, the increase in total mass correlated positively with glucose and ALT levels and negatively with HDL-cholesterol. Increased A/G ratio was the measurement most frequently associated with cardiovascular risk markers. CONCLUSION The body composition of women with POI using hormone therapy is similar to that of women with normal ovarian function with regard to lean and fat mass content and fat distribution. In women with POI, the higher the A/G ratio, the worse the cardiovascular risk markers.","Freitas, Ata; Giraldo, Aed; Rezende, G P; Yela, D A; Jales, R M; Benetti-Pinto, C L",Clinical endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.14331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939768/,230

Prosthetic joints are unfortunately inherently susceptible to bacterial infection accompanied by biofilm formation. Accurate and rapid diagnosis is vital to increase therapeutic success. Yet, established diagnostic modalities cannot directly detect bacterial biofilms on prostheses. Therefore, the present study was aimed at investigating whether arthroscopic optical imaging can accurately detect bacterial biofilms on prosthetic joints. METHODS Here, we applied a conjugate of the antibiotic vancomycin and the near-infrared fluorophore IRDye800CW, in short vanco-800CW, in combination with arthroscopic optical imaging to target and visualize biofilms on infected prostheses. RESULTS We show in a human post-mortem prosthetic knee infection model that a staphylococcal biofilm is accurately detected in real time and distinguished from sterile sections in high resolution. In addition, we demonstrate that biofilms associated with the clinically most relevant bacterial species can be detected using vanco-800CW. CONCLUSION The presented image-guided arthroscopic approach provides direct visual diagnostic information and facilitates immediate appropriate treatment selection.","Schoenmakers, Jorrit W A; Heuker, Marjolein; López-Álvarez, Marina; Nagengast, Wouter B; van Dam, Gooitzen M; van Dijl, Jan Maarten; Jutte, Paul C; van Oosten, Marleen",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-04982-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901352/,230

Experimental studies suggest that vitamin D and calcium may inhibit these pathways, but their effects on colorectal tissue COX-2 and 15-HPGD expression in humans are unknown. We tested the effects of supplemental vitamin D (1,000 I.U./day) and/or calcium (1,200 mg/day) on COX-2 and 15-HPGD expression in the morphologically-normal rectal mucosa from 62 colorectal adenoma patients in a placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial. We measured biomarker expression using automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis at baseline and 1-year follow-up, and assessed treatment effects using mixed linear models. The primary outcome was the COX-2/15-HPGD expression ratio, since these enzymes function as physiologic antagonists. After 1 year of treatment, the mean COX-2/15-HPGD expression ratio in full-length crypts proportionately decreased 47% in the vitamin D group (P = 0.001), 46% in the calcium group (P = 0.002), and 34% in the calcium + vitamin D group (P = 0.03), relative to the placebo group. Among individuals with the functional vitamin D-binding protein isoform DBP2 (GC rs4588*A), the COX-2/15-HPDG ratio decreased 70% (P = 0.0006), 75% (P = 0.0002), and 60% (P = 0.006) in the vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation groups, respectively, relative to placebo. These results show that vitamin D and calcium favorably modulate the balance of expression of COX-2 and 15-HPGD-biomarkers of inflammation that are strongly linked to colorectal carcinogenesis-in the normal-appearing colorectal mucosa of colorectal adenoma patients (perhaps especially those with the DBP2 isoform).","Gibbs, David Corley; Fedirko, Veronika; Baron, John A; Barry, Elizabeth L; Flanders, W Dana; McCullough, Marjorie L; Yacoub, Rami; Raavi, Tapasya; Rutherford, Robin E; Seabrook, March E; Bostick, Roberd M",Cancer prevention research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.capr-20-0140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917645/,230
131134,Advances in technology and remote cardiac monitoring: Living the future of cardiovascular technology.,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND Approximately a fifth of all total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients suffers from bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip. It is unclear whether mortality risks differ between simultaneous bilateral THA and staged bilateral THA. We investigated mortality after simultaneous THA compared with staged bilateral THA in the largest cohort hitherto reported. METHODS The 42,238 patients reported to have received bilateral primary THA from 1992 to 2012 in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register were included. Tumours and fractures as underlying diagnoses were excluded. The time interval between the first and second THA was divided into four categories or treated as a continuous variable. Unadjusted survival was calculated according to Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox regression models were fitted in order to calculate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of death within different time frames. RESULTS Patients selected for simultaneous bilateral surgery were younger, more often male, and had lower ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class than patients receiving staged procedures. The adjusted 90-day mortality after the second procedure did not differ between the four investigated groups (simultaneous bilateral [HR 1.3, CI 0.5-3.3], surgeries within 6 months [HR 1.1, CI 0.6-2.0], surgeries between 7 and 12 months [HR 0.7, CI 0.4-1.2], with second surgery after >12 months as the reference group). For patients older than 75 years, men, patients with ASA class 3 or above, and for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the 90-day mortality was increased. The unadjusted risk of implant revision of any hip was slightly higher for patients with simultaneous bilateral THA compared to those with staged procedure within one year, but after adjustment for age, gender, diagnosis and implant fixation these differences were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION There were no clinically relevant differences in early postoperative mortality between simultaneous and staged bilateral surgery in healthy patients. Advanced age, RA, a high ASA class and male sex increased the risk of death within 90 days. There may be an issue with enhanced risk of implant revision in patients with simultaneous bilateral THA that needs to be explored further.","Garland, Anne; Rolfson, Ola; Garellick, Göran; Kärrholm, Johan; Hailer, Nils P",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-015-0535-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25887667/,230
131398,Reported quality of life in countries with cases of COVID19: a systematic review.,2020-09-21,"How Wnt signaling is orchestrated in liver regeneration and tumorigenesis remains elusive. Recently, we identified transmembrane protein 9 (TMEM9) as a Wnt signaling amplifier. TMEM9 facilitates v-ATPase assembly for vesicular acidification and lysosomal protein degradation. TMEM9 is highly expressed in regenerating liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. TMEM9 expression is enriched in the hepatocytes around the central vein (CV) and acutely induced by injury. In mice, Tmem9 knockout impairs hepatic regeneration with aberrantly increased Apc and reduced Wnt signaling. Mechanistically, TMEM9 downregulates APC through lysosomal protein degradation via v-ATPase. In HCC, TMEM9 is overexpressed and necessary to maintain β-catenin hyperactivation. TMEM9-upregulated APC binds to and inhibits nuclear translocation of β-catenin, independent of HCC-associated β-catenin mutations. Pharmacological blockade of TMEM9-v-ATPase or lysosomal degradation suppresses Wnt/β-catenin through APC stabilization and β-catenin cytosolic retention. Our results reveal that TMEM9 hyperactivates Wnt signaling for liver regeneration and tumorigenesis via lysosomal degradation of APC.","Jung, Youn-Sang; Stratton, Sabrina A; Lee, Sung Ho; Kim, Moon-Jong; Jun, Sohee; Zhang, Jie; Zheng, Biyun; Cervantes, Christopher L; Cha, Jong-Ho; Barton, Michelle C; Park, Jae-Il",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380568/,230

Herein, we report a case of esophageal carcinoma with four different differentiations. A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of an esophageal tumor detected during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed an elevated lesion accompanied by a slightly depressed lesion in the middle of the esophagus. Examination of the biopsy specimen obtained from the elevated lesion revealed an adenocarcinoma, while that from the depressed lesion revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. Fluorodeoxyglucose-position emission tomography and enhanced computed tomography showed an esophageal carcinoma in the middle of the esophagus with no signs of metastasis. The preoperative diagnosis was adenosquamous cell carcinoma classified as T2N0M0 according to the TNM classification (seventh edition). Thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed. Examination of the resected specimen revealed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine, basaloid, and ciliated glandular differentiation. Although they may be totipotent, an esophageal carcinoma consisting of four components is extremely rare. Moreover, ciliated glandular differentiation is rarely observed in the esophagus, except in individuals with bronchial esophageal duplication cysts and adenocarcinoma arises from a Barrett's esophagus.","Yamasaki, Tomoaki; Ishii, Naomi; Okuno, Takahiro; Suekane, Takehisa; Inoue, Takeshi; Nebiki, Hiroko",Clinical journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12328-020-01267-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079336/,230
131901,Diagnosis options in patients suffering from COVID-19- like symptoms.,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND Pediatric acute respiratory infections (ARIs) represent a significant burden on pediatric Emergency Departments (EDs) and families. Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood, and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use. OBJECTIVES To determine the effect of rapid viral testing in the ED on the rate of precautionary testing, antibiotic use, and length of ED visit. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); EMBASE (1988 to December 2011); MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to November week 4, 2011); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (8 December 2011); HealthStar (1966 to 2009); BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December 2011); CAB Abstracts (1973 to December 2011); CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007); and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality and extract data. We obtained missing data from trial authors. We expressed differences in rate of investigations and antibiotic use as risk ratios (RRs), and expressed difference in ED length of visits as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS We included four trials (three RCTs and one quazi-RCT), with 759 children in the rapid viral testing group and 829 in the control group. Three out of the four studies were comparable in terms of young age of participants, with one study increasing the age of inclusion up to five years of age. All studies included either fever or respiratory symptoms as inclusion criteria (two required both, one required fever or respiratory symptoms, and one required only fever). All studies were comparable in terms of exclusion criteria, intervention, and outcome data. In terms of risk of bias, one study failed to utilize a random sequence generator, one study did not comment on completeness of outcome data, and only one of four studies included allocation concealment as part of the study design. None of the studies definitively blinded participants.Rapid viral testing did not reduce antibiotic use in the ED significantly, neither clinically nor statistically. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group, but no effect on length of ED visits, or blood or urine testing in the ED. No study made mention of any adverse effects related to viral testing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence is insufficient to support routine rapid viral testing as a means to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Results suggest that rapid viral testing may be beneficial in terms of reducing rates of antibiotic usage, urine investigations and blood investigations, but are not statistically significant due to lack of power. Rapid viral testing does reduce the rate of chest X-rays in the ED. A large trial addressing the effect on antibiotic usage is needed.","Doan, Quynh; Enarson, Paul; Kissoon, Niranjan; Klassen, Terry P; Johnson, David W",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006452.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22592711/,230

Higher MeHg concentrations near the base of the food web may result in more MeHg exposure and accumulation in higher trophic organisms. Here, we analyze MeHg in caddisflies, mayflies, lake water, and sediment collected from two temperate lakes and one brook in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada. Overall, caddisfly larvae MeHg (15.38-276.96 ng/g; n = 29) was not significantly correlated with water chemistry. Whereas mayfly naiads MeHg (14.28-166.82 ng/g; n = 31) was positively correlated with water MeHg (rs = 0.43), negatively correlated with pH (rs = -0.49), and positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC; rs = 0.48). Of the mercury in insect tissues, the %MeHg ranged from 56 to 75 % in caddisfly larvae and 38-47 % in mayfly naiads. MeHg bioaccumulation factors (BAF) varied greatly (water to tissue BAFs = 0.145 × 106-1.054 × 106; sediment to tissue BAFs = 0.017 × 106-0.541 × 106).

The citrus flavanone hesperetin (HSP) was previously suggested as a template molecule to develop new anti-arrhythmic drugs, as it blocks slowly-inactivating currents carried by the LQT3-associated hNaV1.5 channel mutant R1623Q. Here we investigated whether HSP also has potentially beneficial effects on another LQT3 hNaV1.5 channel variant, the ΔKPQ, which is associated to lethal ventricular arrhythmias. We used whole-cell patch-clamp to record Na+ currents (INa) in HEK293T cells transiently expressing hNaV1.5 wild type or ΔKPQ mutant channels. HSP blocked peak INa and the late INa carried by ΔKPQ mutant channels with an effective concentration of ≈300 μM. This inhibition was largely voltage-independent and tonic. HSP decreased the rate of inactivation of ΔKPQ channels and, consequently, was relatively weak in reducing the intracellular Na+ load in this mutation. We conclude that, although HSP has potential value for the treatment of the R1623Q LQT3 variant, this compound is inadequate to treat the LQT3 associated to the ΔKPQ genetic variant. Our results underscore the precision medicine rationale of better understanding the basic pathophysiological and pharmacological mechanisms to provide phenotype- genotype-directed individualization of treatment.","Alvarez-Collazo, Julio; López-Requena, Alejandro; Alvarez, Julio L; Talavera, Karel",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10060952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599724/,230

Here, using a live virus neutralization assay (LVNA), we compared neutralization of a non-VOC variant versus the 501Y.V2 variant using plasma collected from adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from two South African infection waves, with the second wave dominated by 501Y.V2 infections. Sequencing demonstrated that infections in first wave plasma donors were with viruses harbouring none of the 501Y.V2-defining mutations, except for one with the E484K mutation in the receptor binding domain. 501Y.V2 virus was effectively neutralized by plasma from second wave infections and first wave virus was effectively neutralized by first wave plasma. In cross-neutralization, 501Y.V2 virus was poorly neutralized by first wave plasma, with a 15.1-fold drop relative to 501Y.V2 neutralization by second wave plasma across participants. In contrast, second wave plasma cross-neutralization of first wave virus was more effective, showing only a 2.3-fold decline relative to first wave plasma neutralization of first wave virus. While we only tested one plasma elicited by E484K alone, this potently neutralized both variants. The observed effective neutralization of first wave virus by 501Y.V2 infection elicited plasma provides preliminary evidence that vaccines based on VOC sequences could retain activity against other circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages.","Cele, Sandile; Gazy, Inbal; Jackson, Laurelle; Hwa, Shi-Hsia; Tegally, Houriiyah; Lustig, Gila; Giandhari, Jennifer; Pillay, Sureshnee; Wilkinson, Eduan; Naidoo, Yeshnee; Karim, Farina; Ganga, Yashica; Khan, Khadija; Bernstein, Mallory; Balazs, Alejandro B; Gosnell, Bernadett I; Hanekom, Willem; Moosa, Mahomed-Yunus S; Lessells, Richard J; de Oliveira, Tulio; Sigal, Alex",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03471-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780970/,230

133267,Anaemia tolerance: bridging with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in a patient with acute post-haemorrhagic anaemia.,2012,"INTRODUCTION Diffusion of hydroxyl ions from intracanal calcium hydroxide (CH) through dentin is used to arrest external inflammatory root resorption. However, long-term and short-term CH placement has been associated with an increased risk of root fracture. Intracanal mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) might provide an alternative to CH as a source of hydroxyl ions. This in vitro study compared the effects of intracanal MTA and CH on hydroxyl ion diffusion through dentin by measuring pH changes over time in simulated root surface resorption defects prepared in matched pairs of teeth; the null hypothesis tested was that there is no difference. METHODS Root surface cavities were prepared 5 mm from the apex in extracted human permanent anterior teeth (21 matched pairs) and 7 additional teeth (controls). Root canals were instrumented to size 50/.04 and filled with either tooth-colored MTA (ProRoot) or CH (UltraCal XS); control teeth were filled with saline. The pH in root surface cavities was measured at 3 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks. RESULTS In controls, pH readings did not differ significantly during the 4 weeks (P > .05, repeated-measures analysis of variance [ANOVA]). For the experimental intragroup effects, significant pH changes occurred over time in the MTA group (P = .005, repeated-measures ANOVA) and the CH group (P < .0001). For the experimental intergroup effects, the overall mean pH was higher in the MTA group (8.66; standard error [SE], 0.07) compared with the CH group (8.46; SE, 0.07) (P = .014, paired t test). At 4 weeks pH was higher in the MTA group (8.30; SE, 0.16) compared with the CH group (7.90; SE, 0.11) (P = .011); at all other time points intergroup differences were insignificant. The null hypothesis was rejected. CONCLUSIONS Intracanal MTA and CH groups differed in their overall effect on pH measured in simulated root surface resorption defects. At 4 weeks intracanal placement of MTA compared with CH resulted in a small but significantly higher pH.","Heward, Sarah; Sedgley, Christine M",Journal of endodontics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2010.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146074/,230

We proposed the flexible traction method (F-trac) which provided an optimal traction using an endoscopic hand-suturing (EHS) and investigated the usefulness of this technique for gastric ESD in-vivo porcine model. METHODS In the F-trac method, a lesion was suspended by pulling proximal side of endoscope which was connected to the contralateral side with a barbed suture using the EHS technique just before starting the submucosal dissection. A single endoscopist performed conventional ESD (C-ESD) and F-trac ESD alternately for a total of ten simulating lesions of 3 cm in diameter in a live porcine stomach. The pig was rotated so that each lesion was positioned in the direction of the gravity. The procedure time, technical accuracy, adverse events, and the number of additional injection to the submucosal layer during dissection were evaluated. RESULTS The total ESD procedure time in the F-trac group was significantly shorter than in C-ESD group (19.0 min vs. 30.6 min, p = 0.039). There were no significant differences between both groups in muscular layer damage, sample damage, perforation, and intraoperative bleeding. The number of additional injection in the F-trac group was significantly fewer than that in C-ESD group (0 times vs. 4.4 times, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS In gastric ESD, F-trac might be useful for shortening the total procedure time. This method can facilitate optimal traction without disturbing the endoscopic visualization and the movement of endoscope.","Higuchi, Kazutoshi; Goto, Osamu; Koizumi, Eriko; Kirita, Kumiko; Noda, Hiroto; Akimoto, Teppei; Omori, Jun; Kaise, Mitsuru; Iwakiri, Katsuhiko",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07850-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32749612/,230

135172,Acute macular neuroretinopathy as the presenting manifestation of COVID-19 infection.,2021-05-12,"Background The pandemic of COVID-19 caused confusion in medical settings because of increased patient load, and caused many infections among medical staff which occurred through exposure to bio-particles discharged from patients. The risk of exposure became maximum at the examination of patients, particularly in the collection of respiratory specimens. Effective interventions to reduce the risk are needed. Methods A one-person booth consisting of curtain walls, frames, and fan-HEPA filter-unit (FFU) was designed. Using the airstream from/to FFU, it has dual functions as a positive/negative pressure machine to prevent pathogens in patient's cough to reach the medical staff inside/outside the booth, respectively. The curtain walls and positioning of the patient and staff were aerodynamically optimized for the best control of the airstream. Results The positive pressure booth is to isolate a staff inside to safely deal with a surge in the number of patients in situations like influenza pandemics. The negative pressure booth is to isolate a patient inside to protect a staff outside from dangerous contagious respiratory infectious diseases including COVID-19. A calculated airflow of the positive pressure machine efficiently pushed back bio-particles discharged from a person outside the booth. The bio-particles of a cough from a person inside the negative pressure booth was sucked into the FFU for filtration immediately after the discharge. The booth needed a short front curtain of a stair-cut shape, and a patient and a staff facing each other needed to be positioned at an angle 45° to the airstream for optimization of the airflow. Conclusions The booth named Barriflow® would prevent the bioparticles of a patient's cough to reach the medical staff due to an aerodynamically designed airstream from the FFU and curtains surrounding it. It could be applied to cases of not only COVID-19 or influenza but also of other dangerous, contagious respiratory diseases.","Nishimura, Hidekazu; Sakata, Soichiro",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33145036/,230
135323,Fractured laryngeal mask.,2015,"BACKGROUND Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) encompass a group of severe, life-threatening diseases with high morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests advanced age is associated with worse outcomes. To date, no large data sets exist describing outcomes in older individuals, and risk factor identification is lacking. METHODS Retrospective data were obtained from the 2015 Medicare 100% sample. Included in the analysis were those aged ≥65 y with a primary diagnosis of an NSTI (gas gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis, cutaneous gangrene, or Fournier's gangrene). Risk factors for in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were examined. Continuous variables were assessed using central tendency, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were assessed using the chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS 1427 patient records were reviewed. 59% of patients were male, and the overall mean age was 75.4±8.6 y. 1385 (97.0%) patients required emergency surgery for their NSTI diagnosis. The overall mortality was 5.3%. Several underlying comorbidities were associated with higher rates of mortality including cancer (OR: 3.50, P = 0.0009), liver disease (OR: 2.97, P = 0.03), and kidney disease (OR: 2.15, P = 0.01). While associated with high in-hospital mortality, these diagnoses were not associated with a difference in the rate of discharge to home compared with skilled nursing or rehab. Overall, patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities or rehab had higher rates of underlying comorbidities than patients who were discharged home (3 or more comorbid illness 84.3% versus 68.6%, P < 0.0001); however, no individual comorbid illness was associated with discharge location. CONCLUSIONS In our Medicare data set, we identified several medical comorbidities that are associated with increased rates of in-hospital mortality. Patients with underlying cancers had the highest odds of increased mortality. The effect on outcomes of the potentially immunosuppressive cancer treatments in these patients is unknown. These data suggest that patients with underlying illnesses, especially cancer, kidney disease, or liver disease have higher mortalities and are more likely to be discharged to skilled nursing facilities or rehab. It is unclear why these illnesses were associated with these worse outcomes while others including diabetes and heart disease were not. These data suggest that these particular comorbid illnesses may have special prognostic implications, although further analysis is necessary to identify the causative factors.","McCarty, Adara R; Villarreal, Michael E; Tamer, Robert; Strassels, Scott A; Schubauer, Kathryn M; Paredes, Anghela Z; Santry, Heena; Wisler, Jon R",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.06.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818779/,230
136233,The effect of tocilizumab on severe COVID-19 infection: Review of current evidence.,2021-03-01,"It is now more than a year since the first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) was diagnosed in China. Current data suggest that pregnancy may not only be a risk factor for the development of severe forms of COVID-19, but that the SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact on common pregnancy complications as well. Healthy pregnant women are likely to be more susceptible to viral infection and therefore are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 because of adaptive changes in their immune and respiratory systems, their altered endothelial cell functions, and modified coagulation responses. However, studies show that most pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 developed mild-to-moderate symptoms and only a few of them have required critical care facilities. In contrast with preeclampsia, preeclampsia-like syndrome can resolve spontaneously following recovery from severe pneumonia and may not be an obstetric indication for delivery. Preeclampsia-like syndrome is one symptom of COVID-19, but its cause is different from obstetric preeclampsia and therefore not connected with placental failure. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare but can probably occur. No evidence has been found that COVID-19 developed during pregnancy leads to unfavourable outcomes in the fetus. Most health authorities indicate that standard procedures should be used when managing pregnancy complications in asymptomatic women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant and lactating individuals who otherwise meet the vaccination criteria.","Nowakowski, Filip; Krajewska, Karolina; Klimek, Katarzyna; Wierzba, Waldemar; Jakimiuk, Artur Jacek",Ginekologia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/gp.a2021.0095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914310/,230

The observational TRoponin ELevation in Acute ischemic Stroke (TRELAS) study revealed that about 25% of all stroke patients with elevated troponin had a coronary angiography-detected culprit lesion affording immediate intervention, and about 50% of all patients did not have any obstructive coronary artery disease. Given the risk of procedure-related complications, the identification of stroke patients in urgent need of invasive coronary angiography is desirable. METHODS TRELAS patients were prospectively enrolled into this sub-study. In addition to conventional coronary angiography, a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T was performed during the in-hospital stay after acute ischemic stroke to compare the diagnostic value of both imaging modalities. RESULTS Nine stroke patients (median age 73 years [range 58-87]; four females; median NIH Stroke Severity score on admission 4 [range 0-6] with elevated hs-cTnT [median 74 ng/L, interquartile range 41-247] on admission) completed cardiac MRI and underwent coronary angiography. The absence of MRI-detected wall motion abnormalities and/or late gadolinium enhancement in 5 stroke patients corresponded with the exclusion of culprit lesions or significant coronary artery disease by coronary angiography. Four patients had abnormal MRI findings, whereof 2 showed evidence of myocardial infarction and in whom coronary angiography demonstrated a >70% stenosis of a coronary artery.

RECENT FINDINGS Several reports from single centers have described increased, decreased, or no difference in outcomes of COVID-19 in PWH. These studies have come from a range of locations, each with different underlying HIV prevalence and access to various antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Differences in healthcare quality, access and policies may also affect reported outcomes in PWH across different locations, making interpretation of results more challenging. Meanwhile, different components of ART have been proposed to protect against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or disease progression. SUMMARY The current review considers 6 months of data across geographic regions with a range of healthcare quality and access and ART regimens to generate a wider view of COVID-19 outcomes in PWH. Taken together, these studies indicate that HIV infection may be associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, but comorbidities appear to play a larger role than HIV-specific variables in outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH. ART does not appear to protect from COVID-19 disease acquisition, progression or death.","Johnston, Rowena",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165007/,230
136894,COVID-19 and Guillain-Barre Syndrome: a systematic review of case reports.,2020,"Background and Purpose- Patient-centered outcomes are important. We aimed to determine predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and develop utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores in thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke patients from both arms of ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study). Methods- ENCHANTED was an international quasi-factorial clinical trial of different doses of intravenous alteplase and intensities of blood pressure control in acute ischemic stroke patients, with outcomes on the 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale and mRS assessed at 90 days post-randomization. Logistic regression models were used to identify baseline predictors of poor HRQoL (≤mean 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale utility scores). Ordinary least squares regression derived utility-weighted mRS scores. Results- In 4016 acute ischemic stroke patients with complete 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale and mRS data, independent predictors of poor HRQoL were older age (odds ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.12-1.27], per 10-year increase), non-Asian ethnicity (1.91 [1.61-2.27]), greater stroke severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (1.11 [1.09-1.12]), diabetes mellitus (1.41 [1.18-1.69]), premorbid disability (mRS score 1 versus 0; 1.62 [1.33-1.97]), large vessel atheromatous pathogenesis (1.32 [1.12-1.54]), and proxy respondent (2.35 [2.01-2.74]). Sensitivity analyses indicate the ethnicity influence on HRQoL was driven by the high proportion of Chinese (62.9% of Asian) participants with better HRQoL compared with non-Chinese or other Asian groups. Derived utility values across mRS scores 0 to 5 were 0.977, 0.885, 0.748, 0.576, 0.194, and -0.174, respectively. Correlations between mRS and 5-Dimensional European Quality of Life Scale scores were stronger in Asians. Conclusions- HRQoL is worse after thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke in the elderly, non-Asians, with greater initial severity, diabetes mellitus, premorbid disability, due to large vessel atheroma, and proxy assessment. The broader significance of better HRQoL in Asians is tempered by Chinese participants dominating analyses. From utility-weighted mRS scores indicating the greatest steps in mRS scores are between 5 and 3, treatments to avoid major disability provide the greatest benefits for patients.

137534,Feasibility of awake craniotomy in the pediatric population.,2020-07-01,"INTRODUCTION In patients on maintenance haemodialysis (HD), intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a clinical problem that nephrologists and dialysis nurses face daily in their clinical routine. Despite the technological advances in the field of HD, the incidence of hypotensive events occurring during a standard dialytic treatment is still very high. Frequently recurring hypotensive episodes during HD sessions expose patients not only to severe immediate complications but also to a higher mortality risk in the medium term. Various strategies aimed at preventing IDH are currently available, but there is lack of conclusive data on more integrated approaches combining different interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a prospective, randomised, open-label, crossover trial (each subject will be used as his/her own control) that will be performed in two distinct phases, each of which is divided into several subphases. In the first phase, 27 HD sessions for each patient will be used, and will be aimed at the validation of a new ultrafiltration (UF) profile, designed with an ascending/descending shape, and a standard dialysate sodium concentration. In the second phase, 33 HD sessions for each patient will be used and will be aimed at evaluating the combination of different UF and sodium profiling strategies through individualised dialysate sodium concentration. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The trial protocol has been reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Ethics Committee (Comitato Etico AVEN, prot. 43391 22.10.19). The results of the trial will be presented at local and international conferences and submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal.

Methods A total of 164 patients confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled from 6 hospitals. All patients were divided into the mild type (136 cases) and the severe type (28 cases) according to their clinical manifestations. The total CT severity score and quantitative CT features were calculated by AI pneumonia detection and evaluation system with correction by radiologists. The clinical and CT imaging features of different types were analyzed. Results It was observed that patients in the severe type group were older than the mild type group. Round lesions, Fan-shaped lesions, crazy-paving pattern, fibrosis, ""white lung"", pleural thickening, pleural indentation, mediastinal lymphadenectasis were more common in the CT images of severe patients than in the mild ones. A higher total lung severity score and scores of each lobe were observed in the severe group, with higher scores in bilateral lower lobes of both groups. Further analysis showed that the volume and number of pneumonia lesions and consolidation lesions in overall lung were higher in the severe group, and showed a wider distribution in the lower lobes of bilateral lung in both groups. Conclusions Chest CT of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia showed more consolidative and progressive lesions. With the assistance of AI, CT could evaluate the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia more precisely and help the early diagnosis and surveillance of the patients.","Hu, Xiaofei; Zeng, Wenbing; Zhang, Yuhan; Zhen, Zhiming; Zheng, Yalan; Cheng, Lin; Wang, Xianqi; Luo, Haoran; Zhang, Shu; Wu, Zifeng; Sun, Zeyu; Li, Xiuli; Cao, Yang; Xu, Ming; Wang, Jian; Chen, Wei",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209367/,230

Furthermore, no other similar tools exist in the Spanish language. The aim of this paper is to adapt and validate User Version of the MARS (uMARS) into the Spanish language. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cross-cultural adaptation, translation, and metric evaluation. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the Spanish version of the uMARS were evaluated using the RadarCovid app. Two hundred and sixteen participants rated the app using the translated scale. The app was then rated again 2 weeks later by 21 of these participants to measure test-retest reliability. RESULTS No major differences were observed between the uMARS original and the Spanish version. Discrimination indices (item-scale correlation) obtained appropriate results for both raters. The Spanish uMARS presented with excellent internal consistency, α = .89 and .67 for objective and subjective quality, respectively, and temporal stability (r > 0.82 for all items and subscales). DISCUSSION The Spanish uMARS is a useful tool for health professionals to recommend high-quality mobile apps to their patients based on the user's perspective and for researchers and app developers to use end-user feedback and evaluation, to help them identify highly appraised and valued components, as well as areas for further development, to continue ensuring the increasing quality and prominence of the area of mHealth. CONCLUSION uMARS Spanish version is an instrument with adequate metric properties to assess the quality of health apps from the user perspective.","Martin-Payo, Ruben; Carrasco-Santos, Sergio; Cuesta, Marcelino; Stoyan, Stoyan; Gonzalez-Mendez, Xana; Fernandez-Alvarez, María Del Mar",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34613400/,230

We describe an adjustment technique, which inserted the anvil and extracted the specimen through transanal pathway. METHODS Between July 2010 and July 2012, 23 patients underwent laparoscopic rectal surgery with transanal anvil insertion and transanal prolapsing specimen extraction. All perioperative data and short-term outcomes were recorded in a database. RESULTS The mean patient age was 61.3 years (range 47-68 years). Of the 23 patients, 17 underwent resection for rectal carcinoma and 6 had tubulovillous adenomas. No intraoperative complications occurred. The mean operative time was 137 minutes (range 118-170 minutes). The distal margins, circumferential resection margins, and lymph node dissections were oncologically adequate for all malignancies. One patient experienced anastomotic leakage (4.3%), treated conservatively. One male patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia suffered from postoperative urinary retention. The average postoperative hospital stay was 11.3 days (range 7-21 days). No patients experienced anal dysfunction. At a median follow-up of 26 months, there were no tumor recurrences. CONCLUSION The technique of transanal prolapsing specimen extraction for laparoscopic low anterior resection of the rectum is feasible and safe for selected patients.","Zhang, Hong; Cong, Jin-Chun; Ling, Yun-Zhi; Cui, Ming-Ming; Zhang, Fang-Yuan; Feng, Yong; Chen, Chun-Sheng",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

139753,"Diagnosis of Pancreatic Solid Lesions, Subepithelial Lesions, and Lymph Nodes Using Endoscopic Ultrasound.",2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND Hartmann procedure consists in a sigmoidectomy followed by a terminal colostomy. However, the stoma is associated with complications and suboptimal quality of life, so the restoration of colonic continuity should be, at least, considered in any case. Open restoration has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality; therefore, many authors have described the advantages of laparoscopic Hartmann reversal. We want to go a step further showing our experience using a combined laparoscopic and transanal approach in an attempt to improve the surgical technique. METHODS Patients with an end colostomy due to an emergency Hartmann procedure are selected for this intervention. This approach is performed simultaneously laparoscopically and transanally, with single-port devices, through the colostomy wound in the first case and trough anal canal in the second one. The previous stapler line is resected transanally and the proximal rectum and mesorectum are dissected until the peritoneal reflexion, where both teams work together to complete the adhesiolysis. Finally an end-to-end anastomosis is performed under laparoscopic control. RESULTS As in patients with rectal cancer, dissection of the stump in Hartmann reversal procedure may be better and associated with shorter operative time. CONCLUSIONS As with any new surgical procedure, it is probably too early to draw conclusions, but nowadays transanal combined with laparoscopic approach seems to be a safe and feasible technique to perform a Hartmann reversal.","Bravo, R; Fernández-Hevia, M; Jiménez-Toscano, M; Flores, L F; de Lacy, B; Quaresima, S; Lacy, A M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4504-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423412/,230

As our technique has evolved, the proportion of patients undergoing RARC has progressively increased. Whilst open radical cystectomy remains the gold standard, several high-volume centres have now demonstrated that RARC is both feasible and safe. RARC comprises three stages: radical cystectomy, extended lymph node dissection and urinary diversion. The majority of centres in the United States currently perform RARC utilizing an extracorporeal approach for the urinary diversion stage, perceiving this to be a more accessible option with a reduced risk of complications. We assess the evidence for this perception, reviewing the literature and reporting the functional outcomes and complication rates for a totally intracorporeal RARC approach. We also describe our technique for both intracorporeal orthotopic neobladder and intracorporeal ileal conduit, identifying the potential hazard steps and the 'tips and tricks' to optimize outcomes.","Collins, J W; Hosseini, A; Sooriakumaran, P; Nyberg, T; Sanchez-Salas, R; Adding, C; Schumacher, Martin C; Wiklund, N P",Current urology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11934-014-0457-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25234190/,230

In past decades, several methods have been developed to predict RNA secondary structure with pseudoknots and the most popular one uses minimum free energy. It is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem. We have proposed an approach based on a metaheuristic algorithm named Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) to solve the RNA pseudoknotted structure prediction problem. The reaction operators of CRO algorithm have been redesigned and used on the generated population to find the structure with the minimum free energy. Besides, we have developed an additional operator called Repair operator which has a great influence on our algorithm in increasing accuracy. It helps to increase the true positive base pairs while decreasing the false positive and false negative base pairs. Four energy models have been applied to calculate the energy. To evaluate the performance, we have used four datasets containing RNA pseudoknotted sequences taken from the RNA STRAND and Pseudobase++ database. We have compared the proposed approach with some existing algorithms and shown that our CRO based model is a better prediction method in terms of accuracy and speed.","Islam, Md Rafiqul; Islam, Md Shahidul; Shakeef, Nazmus",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tcbb.2019.2936570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443047/,230

METHODS Twenty-two participants (4 faculty, 4 senior, and 14 junior residents) were enrolled in a 4-week robotic training curriculum developed at our institution. A set of seven robotic skills were selected based on the manufacturer's exercise primary endpoint. During their pretesting session, participants completed one trial of each of the seven simulated exercises. In two individual sessions over a 2 week period, trainees practiced a different set of exercises that evaluated the same basic robotic skills assessed during pretesting with the objective of reaching an overall score of 80 % on two consecutive attempts. If proficiency was not achieved, then a maximum of six trials per exercise was allowed before advancing to the next skill. During their fourth week of training, participants completed a post-testing session with the same set of exercises used during pretesting. Participants' overall performance and various metrics were recorded in an online database for further analysis. RESULTS A significant skills gain from pre- to post-test was observed for each of the seven basic robotic skills regardless of participant's level of training (p < .001). Interestingly, participants only achieved an overall score of 80 % or more in only five of the seven exercises. No statistical difference in gain of skills was found between groups suggesting robotic skills development is independent of level of prior surgical expertise. CONCLUSION A dedicated virtual reality robotic training curriculum significantly improves the seven basic robotic surgical skills necessary to operate the da Vinci Si surgical console. Six training trials appear to be insufficient to reach proficiency levels on more advanced skills.","Gomez, Pedro Pablo; Willis, Ross E; Van Sickle, Kent R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3914-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25361648/,230

The study recruited 50 male patients, aged 18 and over and was carried out as a double blinded procedure. Twenty-five patients were randomly selected to receive hernia repair by progrip self-fixating mesh and 25 patients were treated with hernia repair with suture fixation method by using prolene grafts, and patients' pain follow-up was performed with face-to-face or telephone interviews with VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) and return to daily routine activities were evaluated with SF-36 (Short Form-36) quality of life scale. Recurrent hernias and emergency cases were excluded. Results The pain scores were lower and a statistically significant difference was achieved in patients in whom progrip self-fixating mesh was used in the early postoperative period. Both methods gave statistically similar results in terms of pain and quality of life. Conclusion In the literature, there are some evidence that the repair applied with progrip self-fixating graft has more positive outcomes compared to the repairs applied with suture fixation.

142329,Isolated sudden onset anosmia in COVID-19 infection. A novel syndrome?,2020-04-02,"BACKGROUND Despite a wide development in aortic leaflets repair techniques, aortic valve annuloplastic procedures are still poorly investigated. We present our aortic valve annuloplastic system consisting of a handmade prosthetic ring with 2 components for reshaping the aortic annulus and sinotubular junction (STJ) and illustrates our surgical approach and clinical results. METHODS Since February 2003, 45 patients with aortic valve regurgitation underwent aortic annuloplasty using the new ring. Mean patient age was 58 ± 16 years (range, 46 to 76 years). The ring has 2 components: a circular ring used to undersize the circumference of the aortoventricular junction and 3-crown-like shape ring used for STJ remodeling. The circular ring was sutured into the left ventricular outflow tract in the aortic subvalvular position and the STJ ring was sutured from the outside of the aortic root just at the level of the STJ. The 3 vertical bands of the STJ ring were fixed to the underlying circular ring to stabilize the continuity between the STJ and nadir of the aortic valve. RESULTS No in-hospital death occurred. Two patients had residual trivial aortic valve regurgitation postoperatively, and 3 patients required treatment for residual aortic regurgitation (more than mild). Mean length of the coaptation surface was 10 ± 2 mm. The mean clinical follow-up (100% complete) was 22 ± 16 months. All patients were free from cardiac and valve-related events, and no complications due to ring implantation occurred. CONCLUSIONS This ring reshapes the functional aortic annulus and stabilizes all components of the native aortic valve stent to improve long-term results of valve repair.","Fattouch, Khalil; Sampognaro, Roberta; Speziale, Giuseppe; Ruvolo, Giovanni",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.12.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21440137/,230

This study describes results of the 2019 NBCUS. METHODS The survey was distributed to all US blood collection centers, all hospitals performing ≥1000 surgeries annually, and a 40% random sample of hospitals performing 100-999 surgeries annually. Weighting and imputation were used to generate national estimates for units of blood and components collected, distributed, transfused, and outdated. RESULTS In 2019, 11,590,000 RBC units were collected (95% confidence interval [CI], 11,151,000-12,029,000 units), a 5.1% decrease compared with 2017, while 10,852,000 RBC units were transfused (95% CI, 10,444-11,259 units), a 2.5% increase from 2017. Between 2017 and 2019, platelet distributions (2,508,000 units; 95% CI, 2,375,000-2,641,000 units) decreased by 2.0%, and plasma distributions (2,679,000 units; 95% CI, 2,525,000-2,833,000 units) decreased by 16.5%. During the same time period, platelet transfusions (2,243,000 units; 95% CI, 1,846,000-2,147,000 units) increased by 15.8% and plasma transfusions (2,185,000 units; 95% CI, 2,068,000-2,301,000 units) decreased by 8.0%. CONCLUSION Utilization of RBC in the United States might have reached a nadir. Between 2017 and 2019, RBC collections declined while RBC transfusions did not significantly change, suggesting a narrowing between blood supply and demand. Monitoring national blood collection and utilization data is integral to understanding trends in blood supply safety and availability.","Jones, Jefferson M; Sapiano, Mathew R P; Mowla, Sanjida; Bota, Dorothy; Berger, James J; Basavaraju, Sridhar V",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165191/,230

We report a comprehensive range of structural and functional phenotypes for the heart and aorta across 26,893 participants, and explore how these phenotypes vary according to sex, age and major cardiovascular risk factors. We extended this analysis with a phenome-wide association study, in which we tested for correlations of a wide range of non-imaging phenotypes of the participants with imaging phenotypes. We further explored the associations of imaging phenotypes with early-life factors, mental health and cognitive function using both observational analysis and Mendelian randomization. Our study illustrates how population-based cardiac and aortic imaging phenotypes can be used to better define cardiovascular disease risks as well as heart-brain health interactions, highlighting new opportunities for studying disease mechanisms and developing image-based biomarkers.","Bai, Wenjia; Suzuki, Hideaki; Huang, Jian; Francis, Catherine; Wang, Shuo; Tarroni, Giacomo; Guitton, Florian; Aung, Nay; Fung, Kenneth; Petersen, Steffen E; Piechnik, Stefan K; Neubauer, Stefan; Evangelou, Evangelos; Dehghan, Abbas; O'Regan, Declan P; Wilkins, Martin R; Guo, Yike; Matthews, Paul M; Rueckert, Daniel",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1009-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839619/,230

143019,Nasopharyngeal airway size selection and its implication in the management of pediatric difficult airway.,2020,"Background Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has many manifestations, including respiratory, thrombotic, neurologic, digestive, and cutaneous ones. Cutaneous manifestations have been classified into 5 clinical patterns: acro-ischemic (pseudo-chilblain), vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular, and livedoid. Oral manifestations have also been reported, but much less frequently. Patients and methods We performed a cross-sectional study in which we examined the oral mucosa of 666 patients with COVID-19 at the IFEMA field hospital in Madrid in April 2020. Results Seventy-eight patients (11.7%) had changes involving the oral mucosa. The most common were transient anterior U-shaped lingual papillitis (11.5%) accompanied or not by tongue swelling (6.6%), aphthous stomatitis (6.9%), a burning sensation in the mouth (5.3%), mucositis (3.9%), glossitis with patchy depapillation (3.9%), white tongue (1.6%), and enanthema (0.5%). Most of the patients also reported taste disturbances. Conclusions COVID-19 also manifests in the oral cavity. The most common manifestations are transient U-shaped lingual papillitis, glossitis with patchy depapillation, and burning mouth syndrome. Mucositis with or without aphthous ulcers or enanthema may also be observed. Any these findings may be key clues to a diagnosis of COVID-19.","Nuño González, A; Magaletskyy, K; Martín Carrillo, P; Lozano Masdemont, B; Mayor Ibarguren, A; Feito Rodríguez, M; Herranz Pinto, P",Actas dermo-sifiliograficas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adengl.2021.05.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994549/,230

143413,Kidney function and the risk of cardiovascular disease.,2009,"The majority of emerging infectious diseases have their source in animals, and emergence occurs at the human-animal interface, when infections in animals breach the species barrier to infect humans, the population in which they are often first identified. The response is often a series of emergency activities to contain and manage the infection in human populations, and at the same time to identify the source of the infection in nature. If an infection is found to have a source in animals, and if animals cause a continuous threat of human infection, culling is often recommended, with severe economic impact. Currently the animal and human medicine sectors are working toward interacting more closely at the animal-human interface through joint surveillance and risk assessment, and research is under way in geographic areas where emergence at the animal-human interface has occurred in the past. The goal of this research is to identify infectious organisms in tropical and other wild animals, to genetically sequence these organisms, and to attempt to predict which organisms have the potential to emerge in human populations. It may be more cost-effective, however, to learn from past emergence events and to shift the paradigm from disease surveillance, detection, and response in humans to prevention of emergence at the source by understanding and mitigating the factors, or determinants, that influence animal infection. These determinants are clearly understood from the study of previous emergence events and include human-induced changes in natural environments, urban areas, and agricultural systems; raising and processing of animal-based foods; and the roles of global trade, migration, and climate change. Better understanding of these factors gained from epidemiological investigation of past and present emergence events, and modeling and study of the cost-effectiveness of interventions that could result in their mitigation, could provide evidence necessary to better address the political and economic barriers to prevention of infections in animals. Such economically convincing arguments for change and mitigation are required because of the basic difference in animal health, driven by the need for profit, and human health, driven by the need to save lives.","Heymann, David L; Dixon, Matthew",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.oh-0011-2012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26184820/,230

In the absence of government mandates, debates over issues such as mask mandates and social distancing activated conflicting moral beliefs, dividing communities. Policy scholars argue that such controversies represent fundamental frame conflicts, which arise from incommensurable worldviews, such as contested notions of ""liberty"" versus ""equity"". This article investigates frames people constructed to make sense of coronavirus and how this affected social behavior in 2020. We conducted an interpretive framing analysis using ethnographic data from a predominately white, conservative, and rural midwestern tourist town in the United States from June to August 2020. We collected semi-structured interviews with 87 community members, observed meetings, events, and daily life. We identified four frames that individuals constructed to make sense of coronavirus: Concern, Crisis, Constraint, and Conspiracy. Concern frames illustrated how some individuals are uniquely affected and thus protect themselves. Crisis frames recognized coronavirus as a pervasive and profound threat requiring unprecedented action. Constraint frames emphasized the coronavirus response as a threat to financial stability and personal growth that should be resisted. Conspiracy frames denied its biological basis and did not compel action. These four conflicting frames demonstrate how social fragmentation, based on conflicting values, led to an incomplete pandemic response in the absence of government mandates at the national, state, and local levels in rural America. These findings provide a social rationale for public health mandates, such as masking, school/business closures, and social distancing, when contested beliefs impede collective action.","Koon, Adam D; Mendenhall, Emily; Eich, Lori; Adams, Abby; Borus, Zach A",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592395/,230

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of patients suddenly changed and telemedicine has been proven to be as effective as outpatient care. We elaborate the experience with Telemedicine of a Tertiary ALS Center from an Italian geographical area with high infectious risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS 19 patients were evaluated in telemedicine by a multidisciplinary team including a neurologist (clinical evaluation, intercurrent events, and drug prescriptions); a dietician (diet and weight monitoring); a psychologist (psychological assessment and support); and a physiotherapist (physiotherapy treatment and device prescription). Telemedicine was performed using the online platform ""IoMT Connected Care Platform (Ticuro Reply)"". RESULTS All patients reported a positive perception of talking face-to-face with healthcare professionals and were satisfied with how the team understood their problems. During video televisits, there were a change in the patient's medication regimen in 11/19; 2/19 required pneumological evaluation and started NIV; 9/16 patients required prescription of devices. The mean monthly decline of ALSFRS-R before televisit was 0.88 (SD 1.17) and during televisit of 0.49 (SD 0.75). Bodyweight and daily caloric content remain stable. Reduction in HADS scores and stability in ALSAQ-40 was observed. DISCUSSION Our study positively reproduced the multidisciplinary approach currently used with ALS patients, trying to stabilize the functional and metabolic status and improving the psychological one.

I examine the use of the cordon sanitaire to mitigate the novel coronavirus in Qatar. I argue that it acts primarily as a boundary to map out zones of political exclusion, splitting those who are entitled to protection from disease from those who are not. Through an analysis of the logic, application, and history of the cordon sanitaire in Qatar and elsewhere, I argue that it is only a more explicit example of the ways that governments have applied public health measures such that they apportion exposure to COVID-19, protecting some while mandating exposure for others. Exposure, or protection from it, has become a means to spatialize power and territorialize the national imaginary, separating full members from those who are excluded and reduced to their economic function.","Iskander, Natsha",Medical anthropology quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1111/maq.12625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274452/,230
144993,Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection-Induced Chilblains: A Brisk Perieccrine Inflammatory Response.,2020-06-30,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in 92 million cases in a span of 1 year. The study focuses on understanding population-specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions particularly in the United States. Rigorous phylogenomic network analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (245) inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d, and e (subtypes e1 and e2). Clade d and subclade e2 were found exclusively comprised of U.S. strains. Clades were distinguished by 10 co-mutational combinations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2, and Nsp6. Our analysis revealed that only 67.46% of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations were at the amino acid level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase protein stability in 238 strains except for 6 strains which were marked as ancestral type, whereas co-mutation (P409L and Y446C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes from the United States highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking highlighted mutation (D614G) caused reduction in binding of spike proteins with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it also showed better interaction with the TMPRSS2 receptor contributing to high transmissibility among U.S. strains. We also found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B, and MYO5C, that had maximum interaction with viral proteins (nucleocapsid [N], spike [S], and membrane [M] proteins). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO5 proteins which could be an effective target for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. The functional annotations of the host-pathogen interaction (HPI) network were found to be closely associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions, confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection. We also screened CpG islands in Nsp1 and N conferring the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger zinc antiviral protein (ZAP) activity inside the host cell.IMPORTANCE In the current study, we presented a global view of mutational pattern observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. This provided a who-infect-whom geographical model since the early pandemic. This is hitherto the most comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of full-length genomes for co-mutations at different geographical regions especially in U.S. strains. Compositional structural biology results suggested that mutations have a balance of opposing forces affecting pathogenicity suggesting that only a few mutations are effective at the translation level. Novel HPI analysis and CpG predictions elucidate the proof of concept of hypoxia and thrombotic conditions in several patients. Thus, the current study focuses the understanding of population-specific variations attributing a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in specific geographical regions which may eventually be vital for the most severely affected countries and regions for sharp development of custom-made vindication strategies.","Gupta, Vipin; Haider, Shazia; Verma, Mansi; Singhvi, Nirjara; Ponnusamy, Kalaisaran; Malik, Md Zubbair; Verma, Helianthous; Kumar, Roshan; Sood, Utkarsh; Hira, Princy; Satija, Shiva; Singh, Yogendra; Lal, Rup",mSystems,https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00030-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622851/,230

This has led to imperative needs for illustration of the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, identification of molecular targets or receptors, and development of antiviral drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. In this study, we investigated the current research progress in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the published research findings, we first elucidated, at the molecular level, SARS-CoV-2 viral structures, potential viral host-cell-invasion and pathogenic mechanisms, main virus-induced immune responses, and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then focused on the main virus- and host-based potential targets, summarized and categorized effective inhibitory molecules based on drug development strategies for COVID-19, that can guide efforts for the identification of new drugs and treatment for this problematic disease. Current research and development of antibodies and vaccines were also introduced and discussed. We concluded that the main virus entry route- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 receptors has played a key role in guiding the development of therapeutic treatments against COVID-19, four main therapeutic strategies may be considered in developing molecular therapeutics, and drug repurposing is likely to be an easy, fast and low-cost approach in such a short period of time with urgent need of antiviral drugs. Additionally, the quick development of antibody and vaccine candidates has yielded promising results, but the wide-scale deployment of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines remains paramount in solving the pandemic crisis. As new variants of the virus begun to emerge, the efficacy of these vaccines and treatments must be closely evaluated. Finally, we discussed the possible challenges of developing molecular therapeutics for COVID-19 and suggested some potential future efforts. Despite the limited availability of literatures, our attempt in this work to provide a relatively comprehensive overview of current SARS-CoV-2 studies can be helpful for quickly acquiring the key information of COVID-19 and further promoting this important research to control and diminish the pandemic.","Abdurrahman, Lama; Fang, Xiaoqian; Zhang, Yonghong",Current molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2174/1566524021666211013121831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645374/,230

Previous research showed that neuropsychological and especially executive functioning deficits could be related to the two most important risk factors for sexual (re-)offending, namely an antisocial lifestyle and deviant sexual interests. Method: By using a quasi-experimental research design, the present study compared the performance of a sample of men convicted of child sexual abuse (CSA) offenses (n = 70) with men convicted of sexual offenses against adults (n = 49), men convicted of nonsexual offenses (n = 54), and nonoffending men (n = 70) in a set of neuropsychological tests assessing different aspects of executive functioning. Results: All three offending groups had a higher prevalence of brain injury and performed worse compared to nonoffending men on almost all neuropsychological tests. Individuals convicted of CSA offenses showed no differences compared to the other two offending groups. Latent class analyses revealed that a small subset of CSA-offending participants showed most pronounced neuropsychological deficits. These persons also exhibited more intense pedosexual interests but not more indicators of antisociality. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that only a certain subset of CSA-offending individuals demonstrates considerable neuropsychological deficits, which seem to correlate with a particularly strong sexual interest in children. This subgroup could also be described as having a particularly high risk concerning sexual reoffending with a sexual abuse offense.

145626,An Overview on the Common Laboratory Parameter Alterations and their Related Molecular Pathways in Screening for COVID-19 Patients.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Emerging research suggests that parents are experiencing heightened stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parental stress is a risk factor for harsh or punitive parenting, and this association may be exacerbated by the use of alcohol. OBJECTIVE We examine whether parental stress is associated with use of punitive parenting, as well as whether this association is modified by drinking pattern. PARTICIPANTS & SETTING We used advertisements and word-of-mouth to recruit 342 parents living in Central Ohio during the initial stay-at-home order for COVID-19. METHODS We used geographic ecological momentary assessment (gEMA) to measure parental stress and punitive parenting during three time periods (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) over a period of fourteen days using an app downloaded to their cellular telephone. Participants also completed a longer baseline survey. We used nested multilevel ordinal regression models, where at-the-moment assessments (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2) to analyze data. RESULTS Higher levels of parental stress [OR = 1.149 (95 % CI = 1.123, 1.176)] and later time of day [OR = 1.255 (95 % CI = 1.146, 1.373)] were positively related to odds of punitive parenting. Drinking pattern was not significantly related to punitive parenting in models with demographic covariates. Parents who drank alcohol both monthly and weekly and had higher levels of stress had greater odds of punitive parenting than parents with high levels of stress who abstain from alcohol. CONCLUSIONS Alcohol may be an accelerant in the use of punitive parenting for parents experiencing stress. As alcohol use increases during COVID-19, children may be at higher risk for punitive parenting.","Wolf, Jennifer Price; Freisthler, Bridget; Chadwick, Caileigh",Child abuse & neglect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2021.105090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975257/,230

SOURCE We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to December 2018 for studies that evaluated BP targets in neurologically deceased organ donors. A two-step review process with three independent reviewers was employed. We assessed the risk of bias and applied Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to evaluate the certainty of the evidence by outcome. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Twelve cohort studies were included in our final analysis. Seven studies showed that hypotension was associated with worse post-transplant graft function or survival, while three studies found no association between hypotension and post-transplant graft function or survival. Two other studies showed no association between hypotension and organs transplanted per donor. Overall, six of the identified studies had serious risk of bias. CONCLUSION A systolic BP less 90 mmHg may be associated with graft dysfunction in kidney recipients, but this is based on very low certainty in evidence. Although an ideal and universal BP target in neurologically deceased organ donors is not clearly identifiable in the literature, this could reflect the complexity of donor hemodynamics and the need for individualized targets for different organs. Further prospective research is required to address these questions.","Basmaji, John; Reed, Christine; Rochwerg, Bram; Ball, Ian M",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01731-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32592108/,230

MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Project's database, patients who underwent hysterectomy for benign indications from 2005 to 2011 were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes and were categorized into total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), total vaginal hysterectomy (TVH), laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). The patients were divided into four subgroups according to body mass index (BMI) (less than 25, 25-29.9, 30-39.9, and 40 or greater). The data were analyzed using Student's t test or χ2 and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS A total of 18,810 patients underwent hysterectomy for benign indications during the study period: 9,852 (52.4%) were TAH, 5,146 (27.4%) TVH, 2,296 (12.2%) LAVH, and 1,516 (8.0%) TLH. The rates of TAH increased from 45.7% in patients with ideal body weight to 62% in morbidly obese patients (P<.001). The rate of TVH and LAVH decreased from 32.7% and 13.3% in patients with ideal body weight to 17.1% and 11.7% in morbidly obese patients, respectively (P<.001 and 0.04). The rate of TLH performed was independent of BMI (P=.61). Higher BMI was associated with longer operative time (P<.001) in all routes of hysterectomy. The rates of superficial and deep wound infections were higher with increasing BMI in patients undergoing TAH (P<.001) but not with TVH (P=.26), LAVH (P=1.0), or TLH (P=.48). CONCLUSION Regarding hysterectomy performed for benign indications, increasing BMI was associated with increased rate of TAH and decreased rate of TVH and LAVH, but not the rate of TLH. Increasing BMI was associated with increased operative time for all subgroups and increased surgical site infection in the TAH group.","Mikhail, Emad; Miladinovic, Branko; Velanovich, Vic; Finan, Michael A; Hart, Stuart; Imudia, Anthony N",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000000733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25751208/,230

Currently, most of the evidence relates to patients in intensive care units; however, there is little information on patients admitted to hospital wards and there is no consensus protocol on thromboprophylaxis during admission and after discharge. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients admitted with COVID-19 and 30 days after discharge. METHOD A prospective observational study was conducted of patients admitted with COVID-19 in which the hospital thromboprophylaxis protocol was applied, classifying the patients as having a standard or high risk of thrombosis. Pharmacists performed a daily follow-up and actively intervened during admission and at discharge. The main outcome measure was the global incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) related to hospitalisation. RESULTS A total of 113 patients were included, 98.23% of whom were admitted to a hospital ward. The incidence of hospital-acquired VTE was 1.77%. In 75.22% of the subjects, thromboprophylaxis was adjusted to the protocol during admission. A total of 23 pharmaceutical interventions were conducted, with an adherence of 52.17%. At discharge, 94.28% of the patients who had no haemorrhage and ≥4 points on the Padua Prediction Score required thromboprophylaxis, aligning with the protocol. The global incidence of haemorrhagic events during the follow-up period was 0.88%. CONCLUSION The incidence of hospital-acquired VTE was lower than that described in the literature. Although it cannot be certain that it is directly related to the instituted protocol, the data can show that the management of prevention of VTE is being optimally performed at the hospital. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the incidence after discharge, as well as to agree on a specific protocol in the COVID-19 population for the prevention of these events during hospitalisation and post-discharge.","Quiros Ambel, Helena; Crespo-Robledo, Paloma; Arribalzaga Juaristi, Karmele; Plo-Seco, Isabel; Martínez Simón, Jose Javier; Pérez Fernández, Elia; Perez Encinas, Monserrat",European journal of hospital pharmacy : science and practice,https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-002877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649964/,230

Seven months later, the ram was reevaluated because of scrotal swelling of 1 month's duration as well as suspected left inguinal hernia. CLINICAL FINDINGS The ram had marked scrotal swelling. Palpation of the left testicle revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasonographic examination revealed heterogenous tissue within the cranial and medial portions of the scrotum with pronounced accumulation of hypoechoic fluid at the scrotal apex. Examination findings indicated left-sided indirect inguinal herniation of omentum. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME To preserve fertility, left inguinal hernioplasty without castration was performed. The ram was anesthetized and placed in dorsal recumbency, and laparoscopic abdominal evaluation revealed omental entrapment within the left inguinal ring. The omentum was removed, and a polypropylene mesh was secured over the internal inguinal ring with an articulating hernia stapler. Following mesh placement, a dorsally based peritoneal flap was elevated and secured over the mesh repair. The ram recovered well from surgery; there was no repeated herniation following the surgical correction, and the ram was able to breed successfully without complication. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Laparoscopic mesh hernioplasty can be successful in rams with inguinal hernias when preservation of fertility is preferred.","Daniel, Alexander J; Easley, Jeremiah T; Holt, Timothy N; Huhn, John C; Hackett, Eileen S",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.246.10.1118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25932938/,230

We further sought to identify variables predictive of these autoregulation end points. METHODS Cerebral autoregulation was monitored continuously with transcranial Doppler in 614 patients during cardiopulmonary bypass enrolled in 3 investigations. A moving Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between cerebral blood flow velocity and mean arterial pressure to generate the variable mean velocity index. Optimal mean arterial pressure was defined as the mean arterial pressure with the lowest mean velocity index indicating the best autoregulation. The lower and upper limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation were defined as the mean arterial pressure at which mean velocity index was increasingly pressure passive (ie, mean velocity index ≥0.4) with declining or increasing blood pressure, respectively. RESULTS The mean (± standard deviation) lower and upper limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation, and optimal mean arterial pressure were 65 ± 12 mm Hg, 84 ± 11 mm Hg, and 78 ± 11 mm Hg, respectively, after adjusting for study enrollment. In 17% of patients, though, the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation was above this optimal mean arterial pressure, whereas in 29% of patients the upper limit of autoregulation was below the population optimal mean arterial pressure. Variables associated with optimal mean arterial pressure based on multivariate regression analysis were nonwhite race (increased 2.7 mm Hg; P = .034), diuretics use (decreased 1.9 mm Hg; P = .049), prior carotid endarterectomy (decreased 5.5 mm Hg; P = .019), and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (decreased 1.28 per 60 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass). The product of the duration and magnitude that mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass was below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation was associated with the risk for stroke (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Real-time monitoring of autoregulation may improve individualizing mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass and improving patient outcomes.","Hori, Daijiro; Nomura, Yohei; Ono, Masahiro; Joshi, Brijen; Mandal, Kaushik; Cameron, Duke; Kocherginsky, Masha; Hogue, Charles W",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.04.091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29042040/,230

Morbidity rates are also higher in these homes with the effects of government-imposed COVID-19 public health directives (e.g., strict social distancing), which have led most residential long-term care homes to adopt strict ""no visitor"" and lockdown policies out of concern for their residents' physical safety. This tragic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights profound stigma-related inequities. Societal assumptions that people living with dementia have no purpose or meaning and perpetuate a deep and pernicious fear of, and disregard for, persons with dementia. This has enabled discriminatory practices such as segregation and confinement to residential long-term care settings that are sorely understaffed and lack a supportive, relational, and enriching environment. With a sense of moral urgency to address this crisis, we forged alliances across the globe to form ""Reimagining Dementia: A Creative Coalition for Justice. "" We are committed to shifting the culture of dementia care from centralized control, safety, isolation, and punitive interventions to a culture of inclusion, creativity, justice, and respect. Drawing on the emancipatory power of the imagination with the arts (e.g., theatre, improvisation, music), and grounded in authentic partnerships with persons living with dementia, we aim to advance this culture shift through education, advocacy, and innovation at every level of society.","Kontos, Pia; Radnofsky, Mary L; Fehr, Phyllis; Belleville, Mike R; Bottenberg, Frances; Fridley, Mary; Massad, Susan; Grigorovich, Alisa; Carson, Jennifer; Rogenski, Kari; Carpenter, Kyrié S; Dupuis, Sherry; Battalen, Jill; McDonagh, David; Fassbender, Kathryne; Whitehouse, Peter",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-210057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646169/,230

We undertook a health services assessment of factors used to evaluate the risk of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.METHODS: Patients with confirmed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results admitted between 1 March and 1 August 2020 were included, alongwith clinician-diagnosed suspected cases. Prognostic factors from the 4C Mortality score and 4C Deterioration scores were extracted from electronic health records and logistic regression was used to quantify the strength of association with 28-day mortality and clinical deterioration using national death registry linkage.RESULTS: Of 2783 patients, 1621 had a confirmed diagnosis, of whom 61% were male and 54% were from Black and Minority Ethnic groups; 26% died within 28 days of admission. Mortality was strongly associated with older age. The 4C mortality score had good stratification of risk with a calibration slope of 1.14 (95% CI 1.01-1.27). It may have under-estimated mortality risk in those with a high respiratory rate or requiring oxygen.CONCLUSION: Patients in this diverse patient cohort had similar mortality associated with prognostic factors to the 4C score derivation sample, but survival might be poorer in those with respiratory failure.","Crocker-Buque, T; Williams, S; Brentnall, A R; Gabe, R; Duffy, S; Prowle, J R; Orkin, C; Kunst, H; Cutino-Moguel, T; Zenner, D; Bloom, B; Melzer, M; de Freitas, S; Darmalingam, M; McCafferty, K; Kapil, V; Pfeffer, P; Martin, J; Gourtsoyannis, Y; Chandran, S; Dhariwal, A; Rachman, R; Milligan, I; Mabayoje, D; Adobah, E; Falconer, J; Nugent, H; Yaqoob, M; Collier, D; Pearse, R; Caulfield, M; Tiberi, S",The international journal of tuberculosis and lung disease : the official journal of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease,https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.20.0926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977903/,230
150327,Late fracture of Groshong ports: A report of the three cases.,2019,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this review was to investigate whether e-cigarette use compared with non-use in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent cigarette smoking. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library databases, and the 2018 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and Society for Behavioural Medicine conference abstracts. STUDY SELECTION All studies of young people (up to age 30 years) with a measure of e-cigarette use prior to smoking and an outcome measure of smoking where an OR could be calculated were included (excluding reviews and animal studies). DATA EXTRACTION Independent extraction was completed by multiple authors using a preprepared extraction form. DATA SYNTHESIS Of 9199 results, 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking (OR: 4.59, 95% CI: 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a random-effects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I2 =88%). CONCLUSIONS Although the association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.","Khouja, Jasmine N; Suddell, Steph F; Peters, Sarah E; Taylor, Amy E; Munafò, Marcus R",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2019-055433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32156694/,230

150637,HDAC4 inhibition disrupts TET2 function in high-risk MDS and AML.,2020-07-29,"Specific genomic functions are dictated by macromolecular complexes (MCs) containing multiple proteins. Affinity purification of these complexes, often using antibodies, followed by mass spectrometry (MS) has revolutionized our ability to identify the composition of MCs. However, conventional immunoprecipitations suffer from contaminating antibody/serum-derived peptides that limit the sensitivity of detection for low-abundant interacting partners using MS. Here, we present AptA-MS (aptamer affinity-mass spectrometry), a robust strategy primarily using a specific, high-affinity RNA aptamer against Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to identify interactors of a GFP-tagged protein of interest by high-resolution MS. Utilizing this approach, we have identified the known molecular chaperones that interact with human Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), and observed an increased association with several proteins upon heat shock, including translation elongation factors and histones. HSF1 is known to be regulated by multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs), and we observe both known and new sites of modifications on HSF1. We show that AptA-MS provides a dramatic target enrichment and detection sensitivity in evolutionarily diverse organisms and allows identification of PTMs without the need for modification-specific enrichments. In combination with the expanding libraries of GFP-tagged cell lines, this strategy offers a general, inexpensive, and high-resolution alternative to conventional approaches for studying MCs.","Ray, Judhajeet; Kruse, Angela; Ozer, Abdullah; Kajitani, Takuya; Johnson, Richard; MacCoss, Michael; Heck, Michelle; Lis, John T",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609809/,230
151254,Variability in practice and factors predictive of total crystalloid administration during abdominal surgery: retrospective two-centre analysis.,2015,"BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus (BE) occurs as consequence of reflux and is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. The current ""gold-standard"" for diagnosing BE is endoscopy which remains prohibitively expensive and impractical as a population screening tool. We aimed to develop a pre-screening tool to aid decision making for diagnostic referrals. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A prospective (training) cohort of 1603 patients attending for endoscopy was used for identification of risk factors to develop a risk prediction model. Factors associated with BE in the univariate analysis were selected to develop prediction models that were validated in an independent, external cohort of 477 non-BE patients referred for endoscopy with symptoms of reflux or dyspepsia. Two prediction models were developed separately for columnar lined epithelium (CLE) of any length and using a stricter definition of intestinal metaplasia (IM) with segments ≥ 2 cm with areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of 0.72 (95%CI: 0.67-0.77) and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.76-0.86), respectively. The two prediction models included demographics (age, sex), symptoms (heartburn, acid reflux, chest pain, abdominal pain) and medication for ""stomach"" symptoms. These two models were validated in the independent cohort with AUCs of 0.61 (95%CI: 0.54-0.68) and 0.64 (95%CI: 0.52-0.77) for CLE and IM ≥ 2 cm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We have identified and validated two prediction models for CLE and IM ≥ 2 cm. Both models have fair prediction accuracies and can select out around 20% of individuals unlikely to benefit from investigation for Barrett's esophagus. Such prediction models have the potential to generate useful cost-savings for BE screening among the symptomatic population.","Liu, Xinxue; Wong, Angela; Kadri, Sudarshan R; Corovic, Andrej; O'Donovan, Maria; Lao-Sirieix, Pierre; Lovat, Laurence B; Burnham, Rodney W; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736597/,230

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this novel coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of 61 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from 5 infected patients hospitalized with severe disease. Among these are 19 antibodies that potently neutralized the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, 9 of which exhibited exquisite potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng/mL. Epitope mapping showed this collection of 19 antibodies to be about equally divided between those directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those to the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody targeting RBD, a second targeting NTD, and a third bridging two separate RBDs revealed recognition of the closed, ""all RBD-down"" conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Liu, Lihong; Wang, Pengfei; Nair, Manoj S; Yu, Jian; Rapp, Micah; Wang, Qian; Luo, Yang; Chan, Jasper F-W; Sahi, Vincent; Figueroa, Amir; Guo, Xinzheng V; Cerutti, Gabriele; Bimela, Jude; Gorman, Jason; Zhou, Tongqing; Chen, Zhiwei; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kwong, Peter D; Sodroski, Joseph G; Yin, Michael T; Sheng, Zizhang; Huang, Yaoxing; Shapiro, Lawrence; Ho, David D",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2571-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698192/,230

This study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of BRAF mutation alone and in combination with microsatellite instability (MSI), in stage III colon cancer. METHODS Curatively resected stage III colon cancers were studied from a 33-year period. Clinicopathological data were collated (adjuvant chemotherapy, age, gender, obstruction, perforation, tumour location, grade, presence of mucin, nodal stage, extramural vascular, and perineural invasion). MSI status was established and molecular testing for BRAF (V600E) was performed. Four mutation categories were examined: ""traditional"" (microsatellite stable [MSS]/BRAF -ve), ""presumed Lynch"" (MSI/BRAF -ve), ""sporadic MSI"" (MSI/BRAF +ve), and ""other BRAF"" (MSS/BRAF +ve). These factors were correlated with cancer-specific survival. RESULTS In total, 686 unselected cases met our inclusion criteria, of which 15.7% had a BRAF mutation and 13.8% showed MSI. In the adjusted analysis, neither BRAF mutation nor MSI mutation were independently prognostic. On univariate analysis, survival in presumed Lynch cancers was similar to traditional cancers (5-year survival: 62% and 61%, respectively). While there was no difference in cancer-specific survival between sporadic MSI and other BRAF, both these tumour group had poorer outcome when compared to traditional or presumed Lynch cancers. Adjusted analysis of the four groups, however, showed that none of the subgroups were independently prognostic. CONCLUSION BRAF-mutated cancers demonstrated a trend toward poorer outcomes, however, when adjusted for clinicopathological factors and chemotherapy, BRAF mutation was not found to be an independent prognostic biomarker in stage III colon cancer, even when combined with MSI.","Chouhan, Hanumant; Sammour, Tarik; L Thomas, Michelle; W Moore, James",Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.13096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30421554/,230

OBJECTIVES We aimed to explore the extent and the reasons of migration among psychiatric trainees and early career psychiatrists in Iran. METHODS Our semi-structured 61-items questionnaire inquired participants' demographics, experiences of short-term mobility (from 3 months to 1 year), long-term migration (more than 1 year) and attitudes towards migration (current and future plans). RESULTS A total of 184 responses were received. Most (73.4 %) participants were female, and within the age range of 25-65 (Mean: 34.9). Only 15.2 % had a short-term mobility experience, mostly due to academic reasons (35.7 %). Most (75 %) stated that this short-term mobility experience influenced them in favor of migration. The majority (83.7 %) had 'ever' considered leaving Iran, and more than half (57.3 %) stated they 'strongly agree' or 'agree' to leaving the country 'now' (at the time of the study). The main reason to migrate from Iran was first political, followed by work, financial, social, religious, academic, and cultural reasons, and the least ranked were personal reasons. In relation to their 5-year plans, 67.3 % saw themselves in the country they currently live in, Iran. The main features reported for an attractive job were 'pleasant work environment' (97.3 %), 'good welfare and social security' (96.7 %) and 'high salary '(96.2 %). CONCLUSIONS This study calls for more support of psychiatric trainees and early career psychiatrists in Iran. Improvements in the political context, work conditions and finances might lower the rate of migratory intention and brain drain.","Eissazade, Negin; Hemmati, Dina; Ahlzadeh, Niloofar; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza; Askari-Diarjani, Adeleh; Mohammadsadeghi, Homa; Pinto da Costa, Mariana",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02926-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551745/,230

155609,Monocytes from depressed patients display an altered pattern of response to endotoxin challenge.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) repair is occasionally used for inguinal hernia repair. Here, we report a case of chronic neuropathic pain after laparoscopic IPOM repair for inguinal hernia, which was treated successfully with laparoscopic selective neurectomy. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 59-year-old man with bilateral inguinal hernia underwent laparoscopic repair. Transabdominal preperitoneal repair was performed on the left side, whereas IPOM repair was performed on the right side due to a peritoneal defect. At postoperative month 1, he presented with severe pain and numbness distributed from the right inguinal region to the inner thigh region. The symptoms had persisted for 1year despite medical treatment. We diagnosed that the symptoms might be due to the entrapment of nerves in the contracted mesh, and performed a second surgery via laparoscopic approach 13 months after the first surgery. On laparoscopic exploration, the lateral side of the mesh was contracted and involved nerve branches. We ligated and cut off these nerve branches. His symptoms resolved immediately after the surgery. At postoperative month 12, he has passed without any pain, numbness, and hernia recurrence. DISCUSSION Laparoscopic exploration would be useful to figure out chronic neuropathic pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic IPOM repair for inguinal hernia should be avoided as much as possible because it may cause chronic neuropathic pain. Laparoscopic selective neurectomy is an option for patients with chronic neuropathic pain after laparoscopic hernia repair.","Hanada, Keita; Narita, Masato; Goto, Kentaro; Okada, Haruka; Okura, Keisuke; Jikihara, Shunpei; Nakanishi, Hiroki; Saji, Masashi; Matsusue, Ryo; Hata, Hiroaki; Yamaguchi, Takashi; Otani, Tetsushi; Ikai, Iwao",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2017.07.044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28763697/,230

156204,Use of a clinical trial screening tool to enhance patient accrual.,2021-02-19,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) that is thought to methylate the ribose 2'-OH of the first transcribed nucleotide (N1) of viral RNA cap structures. This 2'-O-MTase activity is regulated by nsp10. The 2'-O methylation prevents virus detection by cell innate immunity mechanisms and viral translation inhibition by the interferon-stimulated IFIT-1 protein. To unravel the regulation of nsp10/nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity, we used purified MERS-CoV nsp16 and nsp10. First, we showed that nsp16 recruited N7-methylated capped RNA and SAM. The SAM binding promotes the assembly of the enzymatically active nsp10/nsp16 complex that converted 7mGpppG (cap-0) into 7mGpppG2'Om (cap-1) RNA by 2'-OH methylation of N1 in a SAM-dependent manner. The subsequent release of SAH speeds up nsp10/nsp16 dissociation that stimulates the reaction turnover. Alanine mutagenesis and RNA binding assays allowed the identification of the nsp16 residues involved in RNA recognition forming the RNA binding groove (K46, K170, E203, D133, R38, Y47, and Y181) and the cap-0 binding site (Y30, Y132, and H174). Finally, we found that nsp10/nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity is sensitive to known MTase inhibitors, such as sinefungin and cap analogues. This characterization of the MERS-CoV 2'-O-MTase is a preliminary step toward the development of molecules to inhibit cap 2'-O methylation and to restore the host antiviral response. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV codes for a cap 2'-O-methyltransferase that converts cap-0 into cap-1 structure in order to prevent virus detection by cell innate immunity mechanisms. We report the biochemical properties of MERS-CoV 2'O-methyltransferase, which is stimulated by nsp10 acting as an allosteric activator of the nsp16 2'-O-methyltransferase possibly through enhanced RNA binding affinity. In addition, we show that SAM promotes the formation of the active nsp10/nsp16 complex. Conversely, after cap methylation, the reaction turnover is speeded up by cap-1 RNA release and nsp10/nsp16 complex dissociation, at the low intracellular SAH concentration. These results suggest that SAM/SAH balance is a regulator of the 2'-O-methyltransferase activity and raises the possibility that SAH hydrolase inhibitors might interfere with CoV replication cycle. The enzymatic and RNA binding assays developed in this work were also used to identify nsp16 residues involved in cap-0 RNA recognition and to understand the action mode of known methyltransferase inhibitors.","Aouadi, Wahiba; Blanjoie, Alexandre; Vasseur, Jean-Jacques; Debart, Françoise; Canard, Bruno; Decroly, Etienne",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02217-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28031370/,230

Differences in the properties of normal and infected cells, including biophysical, biochemical and physiological characteristics, plays a key role in developing fundamental cellular probing platforms for machine learning applications. Cellular features can be extracted periodically from both the drug treated, infected, and normal cells via image segmentations in order to probe dynamic differences in cell behavior. Cellular segmentation can be evaluated to reflect the levels of drug effect on a distinct cell or group of cells via probability scoring.

METHODS The clinical data and thoracic MSCT volume scanning data were analyzed retrospectively for 102 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College between January 18 and February 26, 2020. According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type. The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. RESULTS Seventy-seven of the patients had common type, 18 had severe type and 7 had critical type of COVID-19. The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea. Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56±4.22 lung segments. Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (P < 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (P < 0.05). The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (P > 0.05).

157533,Intensive preoperative ostomy education for the radical cystectomy patient.,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND In a typical single-payer setting that uses an explicit cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold in its decision-making, the payer aims to maximize the net-monetary-benefit (NMB) given the CE threshold, whilst the manufacturer aims to maximize the expected discounted-cash-flow (DCF) resulting from the sales of that technology. Managed entry agreements (MEAs) are tools that are used to improve access to expensive technologies that would otherwise not be deemed to be cost-effective to payers. While simple discount on the list price is the most commonly applied MEA type, there are different forms, each having a different impact on the cost-effectiveness of the technology, on the lifetime DCF-per-patient and on the decision uncertainty. We aim to analyze the sequential decision-making (SDM) of different MEAs (i.e. simple discount, free treatment initiation, lifetime treatment acquisition cost-capping [LTTACC], performance-based money-back guarantee [MBG]) at the manufacturer and at the payer level, respectively. METHODS We first model the SDM of the manufacturer and the payer as a sequential game and explain the challenges to find an equilibrium analytically. Then we propose a heuristic computational method to follow for each of the MEA types, based on practice. To demonstrate this SDM on a case study, a UK-based cost-utility analysis using a three-state, partitioned-survival-model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib versus best-supportive-care for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The optimal agreement terms that would maximise the lifetime DCF-per-patient for each MEA, whilst remaining below the CE-threshold (£50,000/QALY gained) were obtained in the deterministic base-case. Robustness for each optimized MEA was then assessed using probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses, the value of information (VoI), and HTA-risk analyses. RESULTS As expected, the introduction of all MEAs improved the probabilistic ICER and NMB values to (almost) acceptable levels, compared to the ""no-MEA"" case (ICER ~ £78,000/QALY-gained). The expected DCFs across the explored MEAs were all similar, whilst the payer strategy & uncertainty burden (PSUB) for regorafenib decreased in all MEAs explored. VoI analyses revealed that regorafenib mean-dose-intensity and time-on-treatment (ToT) parameters attributed most to the decision uncertainty. LTTACC provided the smallest PSUB and the most robust NMB estimates under parametric uncertainty. For scenarios assuming increased regorafenib ToT or mean-dose-intensity, LTACC again provided acceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes, whereas for scenarios assuming decreased regorafenib progression-free/overall survival effectiveness, only MBG resulted in plausible ICER values. In scenarios, where the source of uncertainty was not targeted by MEA parameters (e.g. the scenario assuming higher progressed disease resource utilization), all investigated MEA types resulted in unacceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes. CONCLUSION Each MEA type has a different implication. The impact of different MEAs on the NMB is more noteworthy than on the DCF, in relative terms, hence payers will benefit from the early participation of the MEA design rather than leaving this up to the prerogative of the manufacturer. While simple discount might be practical for implementation purposes, other MEAs can provide additional benefits to the payer in terms of increased NMB, reduced decision risk and reduced uncertainty. MEA performance should be investigated not only under parametric uncertainty, but also under-identified structural uncertainty, and the barriers of implementation should be considered thoroughly before choosing the most appropriate MEA type.","Buyukkaramikli, Nasuh C; Wigfield, Peter; Hoang, Men Thi",The European journal of health economics : HEPAC : health economics in prevention and care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-020-01228-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901420/,230

At the turn of the 20th century, China was labeled ""the Sick Man of the Far East"": a once-powerful country that had become burdened by opium addiction, infectious disease, and an ineffective government. In 1911, this weakened China faced an outbreak of pneumonic plague in Manchuria that killed more than 60 000 people. After the 1911 plague, a revolutionized China radically restructured its approach to public health to eliminate the stigma of being ""the Sick Man."" Ironically, given the US mishandling of the COVID pandemic, observers in today's China are now calling the United States ""the Sick Man of the West"": a country burdened by opioid addiction, infectious disease, and an ineffective government. The historical significance of the phrase ""Sick Man""-and its potential to now be associated with the United States-highlights the continued links between epidemic control and international status in a changing world. This historical comparison also reveals that plagues bring not only tragedy but also the opportunity for change. (Am J Public Health.

The objective of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to assess the effect of such predictors. A comprehensive search of the available literature on this topic was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase and PsycInfo. Estimates of the effect of each predictor were extracted and both a narrative and a quantitative synthesis of these estimates was performed. Multiple imputation was employed to take into account the effect of non-significant estimates in case they were not reported by original studies. From a sample of 8322 records, 83 articles were included in the narrative synthesis and 41 studies were employed to perform the meta-analyses. The narrative synthesis showed that evidence about the effect of psychological predictors is heterogeneous, with few expected predictors, such as optimism, mental health and surgical fear, consistently associated with chronic post-surgical pain. In contrast, the meta-analyses showed that state anxiety, trait anxiety, mental health, depression, catastrophizing and, to a lesser extent, kinesiophobia and self-efficacy, have a weak but significant association with chronic post-surgical pain. In conclusion, this study showed that psychological predictors have a significant association with chronic post-surgical pain and that state anxiety is the most explicative one.","Giusti, Emanuele Maria; Lacerenza, Marco; Manzoni, Gian Mauro; Castelnuovo, Gianluca",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32694386/,230

We aimed to describe the consequences of bronchoscopy during lung-protective ventilation in a bench study, and thereby to determine the optimal diameter of the bronchoscope for avoiding disruption of the protective-ventilation strategy during the procedure. Immediately following the insertion of the bronchoscope into the tracheal tube, either minute ventilation decreased significantly, or positive end-expiratory pressure increased substantially, according to the setting of the inspiratory pressure limit. The increase in end-expiratory pressure led to an equivalent increase in the plateau pressure, and lung-protective ventilation was significantly altered during the procedure. We showed that a bronchoscope with an external diameter of 4 mm (or less) would allow safer bronchoscopic interventions in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Nay, M-A; Mankikian, J; Auvet, A; Dequin, P-F; Guillon, A",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.13274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559154/,230

Monthly fills during baseline (August 2014-April 2016), first (May 2016-June 2018), and second FDA warning periods (July 2018-February 2020) were compared by interrupted time series analysis.Results: From 2015 through 2019, total fluoroquinolone fills decreased from 35,616,786 (111.1/1000 persons) to 21,100,050 (64.3/1000 persons) annually (10.8% annually (P=0.001)). Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin fills decreased annually by 10.4% (P=0.001), 11.2% (P<0.001), and 17.7% (P=0.008), respectively. During the baseline period, there was no significant change in monthly fluoroquinolone fills. In May 2016 and during the first warning period, monthly fluoroquinolone fills decreased significantly (P-values<0.001); the trend of decreased fills was significantly greater than that of the baseline period (P=0.02). There was no change in fluoroquinolone fills in July 2018. Monthly fills decreased significantly throughout the second warning period (P<0.001), but the trend did not differ from that of the first warning period. Trends for ciprofloxacin, the most commonly prescribed fluoroquinolone, were similar to those for the class.

Limited occupational health research has focused on their experiences. METHODS We surveyed 100 app-based drivers in Seattle, WA to assess risk perceptions, supports, and controls received from the company that employs them, sources of trust, stress, job satisfaction, COVID-19 infection status, and how the pandemic had changed their work hours. Data were summarized descriptively and with simple regression models. We complemented this with qualitative interviews to better understand controls and policies enacted during COVID-19, and barriers and facilitators to their implementation. RESULTS Drivers expressed very high levels of concern for exposure and infection (86%-97% were ""very concerned"" for all scenarios). Only 31% of drivers reported receiving an appropriate mask from the company for which they drive. Stress (assessed via PSS-4) was significantly higher in drivers who reported having had COVID-19, and also significantly higher in respondents with lower reported job satisfaction. Informants frequently identified supports such as unemployment benefits and peer outreach among the driver community as ways to ensure that drivers could access available benefits during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS App-based drivers received few protections from the company that employed them, and had high fear of exposure and infection at work. There is increased need for health-supportive policies and protections for app-based drivers. The most effective occupational and public health regulations would cover employees who may not have a traditional employer-employee relationship.","Beckman, Kerry L; Monsey, Lily M; Archer, Megan M; Errett, Nicole A; Bostrom, Ann; Baker, Marissa G",American journal of industrial medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajim.23295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34523153/,230

We aimed at evaluating outcome after stroke thrombolysis with regards to the affected hemisphere controlling for stroke lesion volume as a potential confounder. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from a prospective study of patients with acute stroke treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator, based on magnetic resonance imaging criteria within 6 hours of symptom onset. Neurological deficit was assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Lesion volume on acute perfusion imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion imaging/DWI mismatch were measured. Clinical outcome was assessed after 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale, and relation to affected hemisphere was studied by multivariate analysis. RESULTS Of 173 patients, 55 (32%) presented with RHS, whereas 118 (68%) had left HS. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was lower in RHS (11.7 versus 13.6; P=0.031). There were no differences in DWI lesion volume (11.0 versus 17.8 mL; P=0.519), perfusion imaging lesion volume (98.9 versus 118.3 mL; P=0.395), perfusion imaging/DWI mismatch (60 versus 85.05 mL; P=0.283). Clinical outcome was also comparable for both groups (modified Rankin Scale, 0-1; P=0.327). In multivariate analysis, DWI lesion volume (P<0.001) and age were associated with modified Rankin Scale at day 90, whereas affected hemisphere was not. CONCLUSIONS We did not find differences between RHS and left HS with regards to stroke lesions volumes or outcome after thrombolysis. Previously reported hemisphere-related differences in stroke outcome may partly results from imbalances in stroke lesion volume between RHS and left HS.","Golsari, Amir; Cheng, Bastian; Sobesky, Jan; Schellinger, Peter D; Fiehler, Jens; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.007292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25700285/,230
159802,Reducing the Global Burden of Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease: A Blueprint for Action.,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND Current surgical methods for partial gastric full-thickness resections (FTRs) are limited by long operative times and risk of gastric content spillage, especially for lesions located at the posterior wall. We propose a simplified hybrid approach to FTR with reduced risk of spillage. METHODS Resection margins were marked by endoscopic electrocautery to simulate a gastric lesion in the upper third of the posterior wall in eight pigs. A custom-made laparoscopic ""suture passer"" was made of a sharpened bendable dissecting forceps. Full-thickness sutures were alternatively passed from the serosa side with the suture passer through the gastric wall and grabbed endoluminally using an endoscopic grasper and vice versa. These transgastric sutures formed either a purse string (PS; n = 4) or a continuous horizontal mattress (HM; n = 4). Sutures were then fastened from the laparoscopic side, resulting in external outpouching of the lesion. The pouch was transected using 45-mm linear staplers. Operative time, resection margins, and number of staplers were evaluated. RESULTS The combined approach allowed one to precisely place the sutures around the pseudo lesions, despite the inflated stomach, and it included all target markings. PS and HM methods were similar regarding time for transgastric suture (780 s ± 219.1 s vs. 765 s ± 179.2 s, p = .885), resection margins (1.3 ± 1.0 cm vs. 0.8 ± 0.6 cm, p = .248), and number of staplers (3.8 ± 1.0 vs 3.3 ± 0.5, p = .405). Stapling time (600 s ± 189.7 s vs. 330 s ± 24.5 s, p = .028) was significantly shorter in the HM technique. CONCLUSION FTR with laparo-endoscopic transgastric suture application was feasible in the animal model. This technique allows one to achieve accurate resection margins with minimal risk of spillage.","Kong, Seong-Ho; Diana, Michele; Liu, Yu-Yin; Lee, Hyun-Jik; Legner, Andras; Soares, Renato; Swanström, Lee; Dallemagne, Bernard; Yang, Han-Kwang; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4375-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150225/,230
160038,Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Findings in Competitive Athletes Recovering From COVID-19 Infection.,2020-09-11,"INTRODUCTION Routine diabetes care changed during the COVID-19 pandemic due to precautionary measures such as lockdowns, cancellation of in-person visits, and patients' fear of being infected when attending clinics. Because of the pandemic, virtual clinics were implemented to provide diabetes care. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the impact of these virtual clinics on glycaemic control among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS A prospective single-cohort pre-/post telemedicine care intervention study was conducted on 130 patients with type 2 DM attending a virtual integrated care clinic at a chronic Illness center in a family and community medicine department in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 57 years (standard deviation (SD) = 12) and the mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 14 (7) years. Over a period of 4 months, the HbA1c decreased significantly from 9.98 ± 1.33 pre-intervention to 8.32 ± 1.31 post-intervention (mean difference 1.66 ± 1.29; CI = 1.43-1.88; P <0.001). In addition, most in-person care visits were successfully replaced, as most patients (64%) needed only one or two in-person visits during the 4-month period, compared with typically one visit every 1-2 weeks in the integrated care programme before the pandemic for this group of high-risk patients. DISCUSSION The current study found a significant positive impact of telemedicine care on glycaemic control among high-risk patients with DM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it showed that telemedicine could be integrated into diabetic care to successfully replace many of the usual in-person care visits. Consequently, health policy makers need to consider developing comprehensive guidelines in Saudi Arabia for telemedicine care to, ensure the quality of care and address issues such as financial reimbursement and patient information privacy.","M Tourkmani, Ayla; J ALHarbi, Turki; Rsheed, Abdulaziz M Bin; Alrasheedy, Alian A; ALMadani, Wedad; ALJuraisi, Fahad; AlOtaibi, Azzam Fahad; AlHarbi, Mohammed; AlAbood, Abood F; Alshaikh, Abdulaziz A Ibn",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x20985763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525952/,230

The pandemic has forced us to notice deepening inequalities and has generated troubling questions about its causes, and who and what can be sacrificed in a pandemic. The analysis offered in Evelyn de Leeuw's essay ""The rise of the consucrat"" suggests that the particular type of patient advocates she calls consucrats are unlikely to engage in thinking together about these urgent questions. If anything, due to their narrow biomedical focus and alliances with the pharmaceutical industry, they are likely to facilitate catastrophe capitalism. However, within the field of patient advocacy, there is a diversity of ways of thinking, occasionally leading to bitter contention. A number of terms is needed to reflect this diversity. One group of patient advocates who have come to the fore in recent times might be called medical cosmopolitans, or cosmedics, those who are challenging opportunistic catastrophe capitalism during the pandemic and advocating for global access to essential medicines.

METHODS Data were obtained from three school-based cross-sectional studies conducted with 7 to 10 years old children. The total sample was 7264 individuals. Data related to breastfeeding were analyzed descriptively and compared using the chi-square test for heterogeneity or trend. RESULTS In the 10-year period was observed a decrease in the total percentage of schoolchildren who were not breastfed (12.9%-10.5%) and an increase in the percentage of schoolchildren breastfed for >12 months (23.9%-36.7%). In public schools, the increase of breastfeeding for >12 months was independent of maternal age and years of schooling. In private schools, the increase was observed for schoolchildren born to older mothers and to more educated mothers, although the highest percentage was observed for schoolchildren born to less educated mothers. CONCLUSIONS The results confirm the complexity of determining breastfeeding behaviors, and understanding these dynamics is fundamental to develop and improve programs and actions aimed at encouraging, supporting, and protecting breastfeeding.

Despite the need for appropriate treatment, its underlying microbiology remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the microbiology of acute rhinosinusitis in children. STUDY DESIGN Prospective non controlled study. METHODS Thirty-one pediatric acute maxillary sinusitis patients with severe symptoms were assessed. The subjects were 17 males and 14 females aged 5 to 14 years (mean age, 9.1 years). Maxillary sinus aspirates were collected and cultured, with subsequent viral and bacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Bacteria were analyzed using culturing and PCR, and viruses were analyzed using PCR. The PCR kits used identify 18 types of respiratory viruses and 13 types of bacteria. RESULTS At least one pathogen was detected in 30 of 31 aspirates (97%) using PCR, and none of the aspirates contained respiratory viruses alone. Ten aspirates (32%) contained both viruses and bacteria. The most common viruses detected were rhinovirus (13%) and influenza virus (10%). The most common bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (45%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (32%), Moraxella catarrhalis (16%), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (13%). Bacteria were found in 21 of 31 cases (68%) via bacterial culturing. Culturing revealed that H influenzae was the most common pathogen (42%). CONCLUSIONS In pediatric acute maxillary sinusitis, respiratory bacteria were detected in 65% of the sinus aspirates and both bacteria and viruses in 32%. The most common viruses were rhinovirus and influenza virus, and the most common bacteria were H influenzae and S pneumoniae.

PURPOSE The current study characterized the performance fatigability etiology, immediately after exercise cessation, and its relation to the dynamic changes in muscle O2 saturation at different TT phases. METHODS Twelve males performed three separated TTs of different distances, in a crossover counterbalanced design, until the end of the fast-start (FS, 827±135m), even-pace (EP, 3590±66m) or end-spurt (ES, 4000m) TT phases. Performance fatigability was characterized by using isometric maximal voluntary contractions (IMVC), while the maximal voluntary activation (VA) and contractile function of knee extensors [e.g. peak torque of potentiated twitches (TwPt)] were evaluated using electrically-evoked contractions performed before and immediately after each exercise bouts. Muscle O2 saturation (SmO2), power output (PO) and electromyographic (EMG) were also recorded. RESULTS Immediately after the FS phase, there were lower values for IMVC (-23%), VA (-8%) and TwPt (-43%) (all p<0.001) but no further changes were measured after EP (IMVC, -28%; VA, -8%; TwPt, -38%). After the ES phase, the IMVC (-34%) and TwPt (-59%) further decreased compared to the previous phases (p<0.05). There were lower SmO2 and higher EMG/PO values during FS and ES compared to EP phase. CONCLUSION FS and EP phases had similar performance fatigability etiology, but ES showed further impairments in contractile function. This later finding might be due to the abrupt changes in SmO2 and EMG/PO because of the high exercise intensity during the end-spurt, which elicited maximal decline in contractile function at the finish line.","de Almeida Azevedo, Rafael; Milioni, Fabio; Murias, Juan M; Bertuzzi, Romulo; Millet, Guillaume Y",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33300756/,230

The adult population is highly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, infants and children are also not spared. Transmission in the pediatric population appears to be primarily from COVID-19-positive adults, largely from family contacts through droplets, direct contacts, and aerosols. There is also evidence of fecal-oral route of transmission. The incubation period of COVID-19 in children ranges from 2 to 10 days. Most children are asymptomatic. The most common symptoms amongst symptomatic children are fever and cough. Shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, fatigue, and headache are other common symptoms. Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are the common gastrointestinal symptoms that may be present with or without respiratory symptoms. Very few children are likely to develop severe disease.Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. Though data are limited, antiviral therapies such as remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and other drugs like hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine have been used for severe COVID-19 cases, with remdesivir showing the greatest promise. A few children may develop an exaggerated immune response, characterized by exaggerated cytokine release and manifests with features similar to Kawasaki disease. The syndrome has been referred to by many names including pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) and more recently, as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); this life-threatening condition often requires a multidisciplinary team effort and use of immunomodulators.","Rathore, Vinay; Galhotra, Abhiruchi; Pal, Rahul; Sahu, Kamal Kant",The journal of pediatric pharmacology and therapeutics : JPPT : the official journal of PPAG,https://doi.org/10.5863/1551-6776-25.7.574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041712/,230

These symptoms have been treated through pharmacological approaches; however, infected people keep presenting physical limitations. Besides, the COVID-19 damage to the central nervous system has also been related to the presence of some physical impairment, so strategies that focus on diverse brain areas should be encouraged. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-pharmacological tool that could be associated with pharmacological treatments to improve the central nervous system function and decrease the exacerbation of the immune system response. tDCS targeting pain and fatigue-related areas could provide an increase in neuroplasticity and enhancements in physical functions. Moreover, it can be used in infirmaries and clinical centers to treat COVID-19 patients.","Silva Filho, Edson; Moura, Stephanney; Santos, Amilton da Cruz; Brasileiro-Santos, Maria do Socorro; Albuquerque, Jéssica Andrade de",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.67.01.20200671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133701/,230
161420,Stroke prevention with rivaroxaban in higher-risk populations with atrial fibrillation.,2015,"Chronic hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress, activates inflammatory pathways and reduces nerve growth factor (NGF) among diabetic patients, which contribute to development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Tocotrienol-Rich Vitamin E (Tocovid) possesses potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties which are postulated to target these pathogeneses in order to ameliorate DPN. This study aims to evaluate the effects of Tocovid on nerve conduction parameters and serum biomarkers among diabetic patients. This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 80 eligible participants. The intervention group (n = 39) was randomly allocated to receive 200 mg of Tocovid twice a day, and the control group (n = 41) received placebo twice a day. At the end of eight weeks, the nerve conduction parameters, as assessed by nerve conduction study, as well as serum biomarkers (NGF, malondialdehyde, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and thromboxane B2) were compared between the two groups. Compared to placebo, Tocovid significantly improves the nerve conduction velocities of all nerves (+1.25 m/s, interquartile range [IQR] 3.35, p < 0.001, median nerve; +1.60 m/s, IQR 1.80, p < 0.001, sural nerve; +0.75 m/s, IQR 2.25, p < 0.001, tibial nerve). Meanwhile, the levels of serum NGF were significantly higher in the Tocovid group as compared to placebo at eight weeks post-intervention. Participants receiving Tocovid illustrated highly significant improvement in terms of nerve conduction velocities for all nerves tested after eight weeks of supplementation. In addition, Tocovid supplementation elevated the levels of serum NGF, in which its increase is postulated to reflect enhanced neuronal functions. This novel finding suggests that Tocovid could be a disease-modifying agent targeting serum NGF to improve nerve conduction velocities.","Ng, Yeek Tat; Phang, Sonia Chew Wen; Tan, Gerald Chen Jie; Ng, En Yng; Botross Henien, Nevein Philip; M Palanisamy, Uma Devi; Ahmad, Badariah; Abdul Kadir, Khalid",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32456230/,230

Lessons Learned From a Single Center in Middle East.,2020-11-11,"OBJECTIVE To determine the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. METHODS A cohort study was conducted on 56 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 94 healthy pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Two groups were followed until childbirth. Demographic and obstetric information, clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiographic findings of the patients, and maternal and neonatal outcomes of the two groups were gathered by a checklist. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS The two groups were similar in terms of maternal age, gravida, parity, and co-morbidities (P>0.05). The rate of cesarean delivery in the exposed group was higher than that in the control group (P=0.027; relative risk [RR]=2.23). Pre-eclampsia was seen in 19.8% of the exposed group and 7.4% of the control group (P=0.037; RR=2.68). The rate of preterm labor in the exposed group was higher than that in the control group (P=0.003; RR=2.70). Fetal distress was seen in 16.1% of the exposed group and 4.3% of the control group (P=0.016; RR=3.84). CONCLUSION Pregnant women with COVID-19 had an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, and cesarean delivery.

In this study, we reported the recovery of a diabetic elderly woman with a history of asthmafromCOVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION A 61-year-old woman was hospitalized due to dyspnea and low blood O2 saturation and later diagnosed with COVID-19, as confirmed by PCR. The patient had a history of asthma and diabetes and used salbutamol and Atrovent spray. She also had a history of hospitalization at one month prior to the current admission. Despite all these, COVID-19was successfully managed, and she was discharged with a good clinical condition after the improvement of respiratory complications. CONCLUSION Despite having an advanced age and underlying diseases (diabetes and asthma), the recovery of this elderly woman shows that even such patientscandefeatCOVID-19 as long as the disease is not progressed to advanced phases and appropriate therapeutic measures are taken.

METHODS This is a prospective cohort study. All patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between March 14, 2020, and April 28, 2020, were included; hospital and multisystem outcomes were evaluated. Data were collected from electronic records. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio of ≤300 during admission and bilateral radiographic pulmonary opacities. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for available confounders were performed to identify predictors of mortality. RESULTS A total of 235 patients were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 5 (3-8), and the median (IQR) PaO2/FiO2 was 208 (146-300) with 86.4% of patients meeting criteria for ARDS. The median (IQR) follow-up was 92 (86-99) days, and the median ICU length of stay was 16 (8-25) days; 62.1% of patients were proned, 49.8% required neuromuscular blockade, and 3.4% required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The most common complications were shock (88.9%), acute kidney injury (AKI) (69.8%), secondary bacterial pneumonia (70.6%), and pressure ulcers (51.1%). As of July 8, 2020, 175 patients (74.5%) were discharged alive (61.7% to skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility), 58 (24.7%) died in the hospital, and only 2 patients were still hospitalized, but out of the ICU. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.12), higher median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at ICU admission (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.43), elevated creatine kinase of ≥1,000 U/L at hospital admission (OR, 6.64; 95% CI, 1.51-29.17), and severe ARDS (OR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.18-23.29) independently predicted hospital mortality.Comorbidities, steroids, and hydroxychloroquine treatment did not predict mortality.

Cervical cancer is one such type that can be monitored for a sufficiently long period toward invasive cancer phenotype. Herein, we report a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotag (SERS-tag) for the simultaneous detection of p16/K-i67, a dual biomarker persisting in the progression of squamous cell carcinoma of human cervix. A nanoflower-shaped SERS-tag, constituted of hybrid gold nanostar with silver tips to achieve maximum fingerprint enhancement from the incorporated reporter molecule, was further functionalized with the cocktail monoclonal antibodies against p16/K-i67. The recognition by the SERS-tag was first validated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell line SiHa as a foot-step study and subsequently implemented to different grades of clinically confirmed exfoliated cells including normal cell (NC), high-grade intra-epithelial lesion (HC), and squamous cell carcinoma (CC) samples of the cervix. Precise Raman mapped images were constituted based on the average intensity gradient of the signature Raman peaks arising from different grades of exfoliated cells. We observed a distinct intensity hike of around 10-fold in the single dysplastic HC and CC samples in comparison to NC specimen, which clearly justify the prevalence of p16/Ki-67. The synthesized probe is able to map the abnormal cells within 20 min with high reproducibility and stability for 1 mm × 1 mm mapping area with good contrast. Amidst the challenges in Raman image-guided modality, the technique was further complemented with the gold standard immunocytochemistry (ICC) dual staining analysis. Even though both are time-consuming techniques, tedious steps can be avoided and real-time readout can be achieved using the SERS mapping unlike immunocytochemistry technique. Therefore, the newly developed Raman image-guided SERS imaging emphasizes the approach of uplifting of SERS in practical utility with further improvement for clinical applications for cervical cancer detection in future.","Karunakaran, Varsha; Saritha, Valliamma N; Ramya, Adukkadan N; Murali, Vishnu Priya; Raghu, Kozhiparambil G; Sujathan, Kunjuraman; Maiti, Kaustabh Kumar",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01607; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348462/,230

A fully automated framework is proposed for collecting and analyzing online food prices in Poland. This is important, as the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe in 2020 has led many governments to impose lockdowns that have prevented manual price data collection from food outlets. The study primarily addresses whether food price inflation can be accurately measured during the pandemic using only a laptop and Internet connection, without needing to rely on official statistics. Design/methodology/approach: The big data approach was adopted to track food price inflation in Poland. Using the web-scraping technique, daily price information about individual food and non-alcoholic beverage products sold in online stores was gathered. Findings: Based on raw online data, reliable estimates of monthly and annual food inflation were provided about 30 days before final official indexes were published. Originality/value: This is the first paper to focus on measuring inflation in real time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly and annual food price inflation are estimated in real time and updated daily, thereby improving previous forecasting solutions with weekly or monthly indicators. Using daily frequency price data deepens understanding of price developments and enables more timely detection of inflation trends, both of which are useful for policymakers and market participants. This study also provides a review of crucial issues regarding inflation that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Krystian Jaworski.","Jaworski, K.",British Food Journal,https://doi.org/10.1108/bfj-06-2020-0532,230

Therefore, the nose is an important target of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against these viruses. We developed a nasal spray (AM-301, a medical device marketed as Bentrio) to protect against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other viruses. Aims of the study To test the safety and efficacy of AM-301 against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods AM-301 was tested on an in vitro 3D model of primary human nasal airway epithelium. Safety was assessed in assays for tight junction integrity, cytotoxicity and cilia beating frequency. Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in prophylaxis and infection mitigation assays. Results AM-301 did not have any detrimental effect on the nasal epithelium. Prophylactic treatment with AM-301 reduced viral titer significantly vs. controls over 4 days, reaching a maximum reduction of 99%. When treatment with AM-301 was started 24 or 30 h after infection, epithelia that received the formulation had a 12- or 14-fold lower titer than controls. Conclusion AM-301 was found to be safe in vitro, and it significantly decelerated viral titer growth in experimental models of prophylaxis and mitigation. Its physical (non-pharmaceutical) mechanism of action, safety and efficacy pave the way for further investigation of its possible use against a broad spectrum of viruses, allergens and pollutants.","Fais, Fabio; Juskeviciene, Reda; Francardo, Veronica; Mateos, Stéphanie; Constant, Samuel; Borelli, Massimo; Hohenfeld, Ilja P.; Meyer, Thomas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452021,230

The sequence alignment mechanism is one of the most important methods in finding a match between DNA sequences. This mechanism is also used in the mechanism for making vaccines, where the process takes a large portion of the time. Parallel and distributed systems exist to solve this problem. One of them is using the Hadoop platform, which is currently being used for processing biological data. The making of the COVID-19 vaccine is one example of the implementation of using a distributed and parallel system model, so that the manufacturing process can be done in a fairly short time. In this study, we used MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) where one of the algorithms which has a high accuracy value is T-COFFEE (Tree Based Consistency Objective Function for Alignment Evaluation) algorithm.

However, the role of job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic on health behaviors such as sedentary screen time (SST) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between employment status change during the pandemic and change in SST. Methods: A 25-minute online survey was distributed through local and global social media from 5/21/2020-7/01/2020. A subsample of employed adults (n=417;M=38.45y, range: 18-75;74.8.% women) provided complete self-reported pre-and during-COVID-19 employment status (categorized as remained employed and became unemployed), pre-and during-COVID-19 hours of daily SST for non-work-related purposes [low: &lt;5h;high: &gt;5]. Change in daily SST was categorized as low-low (ref), low-high, and high-high. The subsample of participants that changed from high to low SST in the sample was low and were removed from subsequent analyses. Multinomial logistic regression models were conducted to examine the association of change in employment status on change inSST while adjusting for age, gender, education level, body mass index, current minutes of physicalactivity per week, and current typical 24-hour sleep duration. Results: of the 417 participants who were employed prior to the pandemic, 15.6% (n=675).Became Unemployed. The proportion of participants in the low-low, low-high, and high-high changein SST groups were 46.8% (n=195), 25.4% (n=106), and 27.8% (n=116), respectively. Relative toadults who remained employed, adults who became unemployed had a 3.02 greater odds(95%CI:1.51, 6.02) of being in the high-high change in SST group, and had a 2.54 greater odds(95%CI:1.23,5.25) of being in the low-high change in SST group relative to participants who were consistently low in SST. Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study of an international, online sample of adults, becomingunemployed was associated with a greater odds of both maintaining high levels of sedentary screentime, and increasing sedentary screen time to high levels. Action to protect people in the workforce from job loss and employment disruption in times of global economic upheaval may preventincreased adoption of maladaptive lifestyle behaviors, such as high levels of SST.","Mattingly, J.

175675,Decline in Mild Stroke Presentations and Intravenous Thrombolysis During the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology Registry,2021,"Introduction: The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has evoked an exigent need to explicate the association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and oral mucosal lesions. The present systematic review aims to elucidate the recent literature on oral manifestations related to COVID-19 so as to help the dental professionals for better screening and early diagnosis of the disease. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed, Science direct, Scopus, and Embase databases was carried out from December 2019 to March 2021 using keywords 'Coronavirus,' 'COVID-19,' 'SARSCoV-2,' 'Oral mucosal lesions,' and 'Oral manifestation.' Additional information was obtained from Cochrane, World Health Organization, and Medscape. The full text articles of case reports and cross-sectional studies were analyzed and included. The review included 25 articles. Results: Four most common oral manifestations were found: gustatory and olfactory dysfunction, xerostomia, oral mucosal lesions, and salivary gland diseases. Vasculitis, opportunistic infections, drug eruption secondary to administration of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), stress, immunosuppression, and hyperinflammatory immune response secondary to COVID-19 might be some of the relevant predisposing factors responsible for the onset of oral manifestations in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The early detection of oral symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection could help the clinicians to perform a better screening, and in recognizing early manifestations of the disease. However, the oral manifestations might be misdiagnosed due to subsequent challenge of undergoing oral examinations, hence diverse studies should be undertaken by the researchers to gain a better insight into the topic. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Compared to European countries, Asian countries, in general, experienced much fewer COVID-19 cases and deaths. The underlying factors in this difference would include the earlier and more stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions, differences in the age structure, the geographical characteristics in Asia, and the experience of past outbreaks of emerging diseases, though further studies are needed to investigate the exact mechanisms. Still, regarding the aim of developing resilient health?care systems, there remain several lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic experience in Asian countries that could inform more effective management of future pandemics.","Miyawaki, Atsushi Tsugawa Yusuke",Asian Economic Policy Review,https://doi.org/10.1111/aepr.12358,230
177048,Endotracheal Tubes Design: The Role of Tube Bending,2021,"Time-varying pitch is a vital cue for human speech perception. Neural processing of time-varying pitch has been extensively assayed using scalp-recorded frequency-following responses (FFRs), an electrophysiological signal thought to reflect integrated phase-locked neural ensemble activity from subcortical auditory areas. Emerging evidence increasingly points to a putative contribution of auditory cortical ensembles to the scalp-recorded FFRs. However, the properties of cortical FFRs and precise characterization of laminar sources are still unclear. Here we used direct human intracortical recordings as well as extra- and intracranial recordings from macaques and guinea pigs to characterize the properties of cortical sources of FFRs to time-varying pitch patterns. We found robust FFRs in the auditory cortex across all species. We leveraged representational similarity analysis as a translational bridge to characterize similarities between the human and animal models. Laminar recordings in animal models showed FFRs emerging primarily from the thalamorecepient layers of the auditory cortex. FFRs arising from these cortical sources significantly contributed to the scalp-recorded FFRs via volume conduction. Our research paves the way for a wide array of studies to investigate the role of cortical FFRs in auditory perception and plasticity. Significance Statement Frequency following responses (FFRs) to speech are scalp-recorded neural signals that inform the fidelity of sound encoding in the auditory system. FFRs, long believed to arise from brainstem and midbrain, have shaped our understanding of sub-cortical auditory processing and plasticity. Non-invasive studies have shown cortical contributions to the FFRs, however, this is still actively debated. Here we employed direct cortical recordings to trace the cortical contribution to the FFRs and characterize the properties of these cortical FFRs. With extra-cranial and intra-cranial recordings within the same subjects we show that cortical FFRs indeed contribute to the scalp-recorded FFRs, and their response properties differ from the sub-cortical FFRs. The findings provide strong evidence to revisit and reframe the FFR driven theories and models of sub-cortical auditory processing and plasticity with careful characterization of cortical and sub-cortical components in the scalp-recorded FFRs.","Gnanateja, G.

177081,Integrative Metabolomic and Proteomic Signatures Define Clinical Outcomes in Severe COVID-19,2021-07-22,"Graphs that depict numbers of COVID-19 cases often use a linear or logarithmic scale on the y-axis. To examine the effect of scale on how the general public interprets the curves and uses that understanding to infer the urgency of the need for protective actions, we conducted a series of experiments that presented laypeople with the same data plotted on one scale or the other. We found that graphs with a logarithmic, as opposed to a linear, scale resulted in laypeople making less accurate predictions of how fast cases would increase, viewing COVID-19 as less dangerous, and expressing both less support for policy interventions and less intention to take personal actions to combat the disease. Education about the differences between linear and logarithmic graphs reduces but does not eliminate these effects. These results suggest that communications to the general public should mostly use linear graphs. When logarithmic graphs must be used, they should be presented alongside linear graphs of the same data and with guidance on how to interpret the plots. © 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

177229,Characterisation of the blood RNA host response underpinning severity in COVID-19 patients,2021-09-21,"BACKGROUND: We present a systematic review and pooled analysis of clinical studies to date, that (1) specifically compare the protection of natural immunity in the COVID-recovered versus the efficacy of full vaccination in the COVID-naive, and (2) the added benefit of vaccination in the COVID-recovered, for prevention of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using the PRISMA 2020 guidance, we first conducted a systematic review of available literature on PubMed, MedRxIV and FDA briefings to identify clinical studies either comparing COVID vaccination to natural immunity or delineating the benefit of vaccination in recovered individuals. After assessing for eligibility, studies were qualitatively appraised and formally graded using the NOS system for observational, case-control and RCTs. Incidence rates were tabulated for the following groups: never infected (NI) and unvaccinated (UV), NI and vaccinated (V), previously infected (PI) and UV, PI and UV. Pooling was performed by grouping the RCTs and observational studies separately, and then all studies in total. Risk ratios and risk differences are reported for individual studies and pooled groups, in 1) NPI/V vs. PI/UV and 2) PI/UV vs. PI/V analysis. In addition, number needed to treat (NNT) analysis was performed for vaccination in naive and previously infected cohorts. RESULTS: Nine clinical studies were identified including three randomized controlled studies, four retrospective observational cohorts, one prospective observational cohort, and a case-control study. The NOS quality appraisals of these articles ranged from four to nine (out of nine stars). All of the included studies found at least statistical equivalence between the protection of full vaccination and natural immunity; and, three studies found superiority of natural immunity. Four observational studies found a statistically significant incremental benefit to vaccination in the COVID-recovered individuals. In total pooled analysis, incidence in NPI/V trended higher than PI/UV groups (RR=1.86 [95%CI 0.77-4.51], P=0.17). Vaccination in COVID-recovered individuals provided modest protection from reinfection (RR=1.82 [95%CI 1.21-2.73], P=0.004), but the absolute risk difference was extremely small (AR= 0.004 person-years [95% CI 0.001-0.007], P=0.02). The NNT to prevent one annual case of infection in COVID-recovered patients was 218, compared to 6.5 in COVID-naive patients, representing a 33.5-fold difference in benefit between the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: While vaccinations are highly effective at protecting against infection and severe COVID-19 disease, our review demonstrates that natural immunity in COVID-recovered individuals is, at least, equivalent to the protection afforded by full vaccination of COVID-naive populations. There is a modest and incremental relative benefit to vaccination in COVID-recovered individuals; however, the net benefit is marginal on an absolute basis. COVID-recovered individuals represent a distinctly different benefit-risk calculus. Therefore, vaccination of COVID-recovered individuals should be subject to clinical equipoise and individual preference.","Shenai, M.

177528,An open interface in the pre-80S ribosome coordinated by ribosome assembly factors Tsr1 and Dim1 enables temporal regulation of Fap7,2020-10-26,"Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus that causes an acute febrile illness accompanied by arthralgia, similar to chikungunya virus. Increasing urbanization of MAYV outbreaks in the Americas has led to concerns that this virus could further expand its geographic range. Given the potential importance of this pathogen, we sought to fill some critical gaps in knowledge regarding MAYV infectivity and geographic variation. This study describes the cytopathogenicity of MAYV in human dermal fibroblasts, human skeletal muscle satellite cells, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK), peripherally derived human macrophages, and Vero cells. MAYV strain isolated from Bolivia (MAYV-U) infected cells more rapidly compared to MAYV strains isolated in Peru and Brazil (MAYV-P; MAYV-B), with high titers (1×108 pfu/ml) peaking at 37 hours post infection. MAYV-U also caused the most cytopathic effect in a time dependent manner. Furthermore, differently from the other two prototypic strains, MAYV-U harbors unique mutations in the E2 protein, D60G and S205F, likely to interact with the host cell receptor, which may explain the observed differences in infectivity. We further demonstrate that pre-treatment of cells with interferon-β inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these findings advance our understanding of MAYV infection of human target cells and provide initial data regarding MAYV phenotypic variation according to geography. Author Summary Arthropod-borne viruses are of great public health concern, causing epidemics worldwide due to climate change, changes in land use, rapid urbanization, and the expanding geographic ranges of suitable vectors. Among these viruses, Mayaro is an emerging virus for which little is currently known. This study aims to answer fundamental questions of Mayaro virus biology using three geographically distinct viral strains to examine variability in infection kinetics and infectivity in susceptible cell types. We found one geographic isolate to have accelerated infection kinetics and increased cell damage because of infection. To better understand what was unique about this isolate, we compared their envelope protein, which is critical for entry into a cell. We found that the isolate with increased replication kinetics possessed mutations at sites that may promote viral entry, which could explain these findings. Together, these findings further our understanding of Mayaro virus biology and provide insight into factors that contribute to Mayaro transmission and infectivity.","Patel, Aum R.; Dulcey, Melissa; Abid, Nabil; Cash, Melanie N.; Dailey, Jordan; Salemi, Marco; Mavian, Carla; Vittor, Amy Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462323,230

Its dysregulation leads to diseases and is a critical determinant in many viral infections, e.g.COVID-19. Factor H (FH) is the main regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation and could be a therapy to restore homeostasis. However, recombinant FH is not available. Engineered FH versions may present alternative therapeutics. Here, we designed a synthetic protein, MFHR13, as a multitarget complement regulator. It combines the dimerization and C5-regulatory domains of human FH-related protein 1 (FHR1) with the C3-regulatory and cell surface recognition domains of human FH. MFHR13 includes the FH variant I62, which we characterized to induce improved C3b binding and cofactor activity compared to the variant V62. After comparative protein structure modelling, we introduced the SCR FH13, which includes an N-glycosylation site for higher protein stability. In summary, the fusion protein MFHR13 comprises SCRs FHR11-2:FH1-4:FH13:FH19-20. It shows an enhanced heparin binding and protects sheep erythrocytes from complement attack exhibiting 26 and 4-fold the regulatory activity of eculizumab and human FH, respectively. Furthermore, it also blocks the terminal pathway of complement activation and we demonstrate that MFHR13 and FHR1 bind to all proteins forming the membrane attack complex, which contributes to the mechanistic understanding of FHR1. We consider MFHR13 a promising candidate as a therapeutic for complement-associated diseases.","Ruiz-Molina, Natalia; Parsons, Juliana; Müller, Madeleine; Hoernstein, Sebastian N.W; Bohlender, Lennard L.; Pumple, Steffen; Zipfel, Peter F.; Häffner, Karsten; Reski, Ralf; Decker, Eva L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.27.441647,230

Pseudotyped viruses have been widely adopted for studies of virus entry and pharmaceutical development to overcome this restriction. Here we describe a modified protocol to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in high yield. We found that pseudovirions produced with the conventional transient expression system lacked coronavirus Spike protein at their surface as a result of inhibition of parental VSV infection by overexpression of this protein. Establishment of stable cell lines with an optimal expression level of coronavirus Spike protein allowed the efficient production of progeny pseudoviruses decorated with Spike protein. This improved VSV pseudovirus production method should facilitate studies of coronavirus entry and development of antiviral agents.","Fujioka, Yoichiro; Kashiwagi, Sayaka; Yoshida, Aiko; Satoh, Aya O.; Fujioka, Mari; Amano, Maho; Yamauchi, Yohei; Ohba, Yusuke",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454063,230

The method implements a content-driven interpolation. It uses the extracted features to train a machine learning model to infer the curvature points of the Rate-VMAF curves in order to guide a set of initial encodings.

A compelling model, based on indirect evidence, posits that - at high oxygen saturation - the N-term cytosolic domain of AE1 binds to and inhibits glycolytic enzymes, thus diverting metabolic fluxes to the pentose phosphate pathway to generate reducing equivalents. Dysfunction of this mechanism occurs during RBC aging or storage under blood bank conditions, suggesting a role for AE1 in the regulation of blood storage quality and efficacy of transfusion – a life-saving intervention for millions of recipients worldwide. Here we leverage two murine models carrying genetic ablations of AE1 to provide the first direct mechanistic evidence of its role in metabolic regulation and blood storage quality. Observations in mice phenocopied those in a human subject lacking expression of AE11-11 (band 3 Neapolis), while common polymorphisms in the region coding for AE11-56 increased susceptibility to osmotic hemolysis in healthy blood donors. Through thermal proteome profiling and cross-linking proteomics, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the RBC interactome, with a focus on AE11-56 and validate recombinant AE1 interactions with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Finally, we show that incubation with a cell-penetrating AE11-56 peptide can rescue the metabolic defect in glutathione recycling and boost post-transfusion recoveries of stored RBCs from healthy human donors and genetically ablated mice, paving the way for the in vivo metabolic manipulation of RBCs facing oxidant stress – a landmark of many diseases.

The data has been collected from various sources of both official and private institutions for the time period of 2011-2019. Multiple regression analysis of panel data is used to provide greater and more informative observations and reduce the collinearity of the independent variables. The results show that the performance of exports and imports in the three regions in question shows a stagnant trend and is likely to decline in 2019, especially in part of exports performance. In all the regions in question, export performance is influenced by strengthening or weakening of the real effective exchange rate (REER) and the number of manufactured products, while import performance is more influenced by GDP per capita and REER too. Several other independent factors were also studied, but they did not affect all the regions under consideration equally.

Considering epidemiological parameters estimated from data of the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil -- where there is a significant stake of the population making their living in the informal economy and thus prone to not follow self-isolation -- we assert that if the confinement measures are lifted too soon, namely as much as one week of consecutive declining numbers of new cases, it is very likely the appearance of a second peak. Our approach should be valid for any country where the number of people involved in the informal economy is a large proportion of the total labor force. In summary, our results point out the crucial relevance of target policies for supporting people in the informal economy to properly comply with preventive measures during the pandemic.","Pires, Marcelo A.; Crokidakis, Nuno; Cajueiro, Daniel O.; Menezes, Marcio Argollo de; Queir'os, Silvio M.

METHODS: We compared prevalence and levels of AT1R-Ab in COVID-19 cases with mild or severe disease to age and sex matched negative controls. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between cases and controls. However, there were trends toward a higher proportion with AT1R-Ab positivity among severe cases versus controls (32% vs. 11%, p=0.1) and higher levels in those with mild COVID-19 compared to controls (median 9.5U/mL vs. 5.9U/mL, p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AT1R-Ab are not consistently associated with COVID-19 but do not exclude a contribution to endothelial pathology in a subset of people.","Harrington, W.

However, it is hard to find empirical study to examine the online learning’s effect on school pupils’ performance represented by regular exams. This study attempts to fill in this research gap. An intelligent tutoring system, Lexue 100 was utilized in mathematics online instruction during the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak time in a junior high school in Shandong Province China. Supported by this system, the teacher provided the students with differentiated assignments including class assignment, group assignment and individual assignment, as well as error sets. Those assignments could be completed before the class, in the class or after the class. A quasi-experiment was conducted to compare the effect of this online learning supported by the individualized assignment with that of uniform assignment to all students. The treatment group and control group had the statistically not significant difference in the regular school exams before the experiment as the pretest. At the end of the experiment, the treatment group performed better than the control group in the mid-term test as the posttest, reaching a statistically significant advantage 6.83% (p < 0.01) and an effect size 0.381.

Specifically, we use physics-informed machine-learning (PIML) techniques to find the parameters for the efficient transfer of an electron (or photon) to a targeted state in a non-linear dimer. We create a machine learning model containing two variables, $\chi_D$, and $\chi_A$, representing the non-linear terms in the donor and acceptor target system states. We then introduce a data-free physics-informed loss function as $1.0 - P_j$, where $P_j$ is the probability, the electron being in the targeted state, $j$. By minimizing the loss function, we maximize the occupation probability to the targeted state. The method recovers known results in the Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) model, and it is then applied to a more complex system with an additional intermediate state. In this trimer configuration, the PIML approach discovers desired resonant paths from the donor to acceptor units. The proposed PIML method is general and may be used in the chemical design of molecular complexes or engineering design of quantum or photonic systems.","Barmparis, G. D.; Tsironis, G.

In non-cardiac surgery, troponin elevation has previously been shown to be an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events and postoperative mortality; however, a majority of studies have focused on vascular surgery patients. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether troponin elevation is a predictor of major adverse cardiac events and mortality within 30 days and 1 yr after non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in January 2016 according to the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Both interventional and observational studies measuring troponin within the first 4 days after surgery were eligible. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. RESULTS Eleven eligible clinical studies (n=2193) were identified. A postoperative troponin elevation was a predictor of 30 day mortality, odds ratio (OR) 3.52 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.21-5.62; I2=0%], and an independent predictor of 1 yr mortality, adjusted OR 2.53 (95% CI 1.20-5.36; I2=26%). A postoperative troponin elevation was associated with major adverse cardiac events at 30 days, OR 5.92 (95% CI 1.67-20.96; I2=86%), and 1 yr after surgery, adjusted OR 3.00 (95% CI 1.43-6.29; I2=21%). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative myocardial injury is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events and mortality within 30 days and 1 yr after non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery. The meta-analysis provides evidence that supports troponin monitoring as a cardiovascular risk stratification tool.","Ekeloef, S; Alamili, M; Devereaux, P J; Gögenur, I",British journal of anaesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27799170/,230

It is the largest hospital in Israel and was the first to face coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients in the country at the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. OBJECTIVES To describe our experience with the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on our triage method in the emergency department (ED). Our goal was to keep the main hospitalization buildings clean of infection by separating COVID-19 positive patients from COVID-19 negative patients. METHODS We divided our ED into two separate sections: a regular non-COVID-19 ED and an advanced biological ED. We created clear protocols of triage for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. We reviewed the data of patients admitted to our ED during the month of March and analyzed the results of our triage method in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients. RESULTS During the month of March 2020, 7957 patients were referred to our ED. Among them 2004 were referred to the biological ED and 5953 were referred to the regular ED. Of the 2004 patients referred to the biological ED, 1641 (81.8%) were sampled for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction of whom 143 (8.7%) were positive. Only two COVID-19 positive patients unintentionally entered the main clean hospital, making our triage almost full proof. CONCLUSIONS Our triage method was successful in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients and maintained the regular hospital clean of COVID-19 allowing treatment continuation of regular non-COVID-19 patients.","Levy, Yuval; Frenkel Nir, Yael; Ironi, Avinoah; Englard, Hindy; Regev-Yochay, Gili; Rahav, Galia; Afek, Arnon; Grossman, Ehud",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236578/,230

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of xenon on cerebral oxygen saturation with those of propofol during carotid clamping. METHODS After approval of Research Ethics Board and patient informed consent, 74 patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy were enrolled. Patients were not randomized but were well matched by preoperative characteristics. Patients in the Xenon group were the ones scheduled for surgery in the operative theater equipped with the xenon anesthesia system. Anesthesia was started with a target control infusion of propofol and remifentanil. Patients were then divided into the control group (37 patients) with anesthesia maintained with target control infusion propofol and remifentanil and the Xenon group with anesthesia maintained with xenon (target inspired concentration of 60%) and target control infusion remifentanil. Remifentanil and xenon or propofol were stopped at the end of skin closure. RESULTS A cerebral oxygen saturation decrease below 55% was less frequently observed in the Xenon group during carotid cross-clamping (7/37 patients vs 15/37; p=0.01). Compared with values observed before clamping, the decrease in cerebral oxygen saturation during clamping was significantly less important in the Xenon group (12±11% vs 17±14%, p=0.04). Blood pressure and heart rate were not different between groups during carotid clamping. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study suggests that xenon anesthesia may be associated to higher cerebral oxygen saturation values when compared to propofol anesthesia during cross-clamping for carotid endarterectomy.","Godet, G; Couaud, A; Lucas, A; Cardon, A; Beloeil, H; Ecoffey, C",HSR proceedings in intensive care & cardiovascular anesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23888233/,230

195465,Direct comparison of a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods with a statin in hypercholesterolemic participants.,2005,"Despite their high frequency of RNA recombination, the plus-strand coronaviruses have a characteristic, strictly conserved genome organization with the essential genes occurring in the order 5'-polymerase (pol)-S-E-M-N-3'. We have investigated the significance of this remarkable conservation by rearrangement of the murine coronavirus genome through targeted recombination. Thus, viruses were prepared with the following gene order: 5'-pol-S-M-E-N-3', 5'-pol-S-N-E-M-3', 5'-pol-M-S-E-N-3', and 5'-pol-E-M-S-N-3'. All of these viruses were surprisingly viable, and most viruses replicated in cell culture with growth characteristics similar to those of the parental virus. The recombinant virus with the gene order 5'-pol-E-M-S-N-3' was also tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host, the mouse. The results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for replication in vitro and in vivo. Deliberate rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of attenuated coronaviruses, which due to their reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses, would make safer vaccines.","de Haan, Cornelis A M; Volders, Haukeline; Koetzner, Cheri A; Masters, Paul S; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12438575/,230

The most common causes of pneumonia in children are respiratory viruses. In Thailand, the epidemiology of the viruses causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among children is poorly defined. In this cross sectional study we used nasopharyngeal samples collected from hospitalized children diagnosed with severe CAP in accordance with WHO criteria between June 2013 and May 2014 to determine the causes of infection. The samples were analyzed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) types 1,2 and 3, adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza viruses types A and B and coronavirus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of 102 cases of severe CAP, samples were obtained in 91 cases and 48 (52.7%) were positive for respiratory viruses. The most common viruses were RSV (n = 22; 45.8%), rhinovirus (n = 11; 22.9%) and adenovirus (n = 9; 18.7%). Patients were aged 1 month to 4 years 5 months, with a median age of 1 year 1 month. Thirty-seven (77.1%) were male. Asthma was the most common co-morbidity affecting 5 (10.4%) of the 48 cases with an identified virus. The peak prevalence occurred during October (n = 17). All patients required oxygen therapy and 17 (35.4%) required mechanical ventilation. The median length of hospitalization was 11 days. Preterm infants had a significantly higher rate of RSV infection than other respiratory viruses (8 of 21; 38% vs 3 of 27; 11.1%) (p = 0.02). Viruses were most commonly associated with severe CAP among children aged less than 1 year. The peak prevalence occurred during the rainy season. Our findings suggest that young and preterm infants with CAP should be monitored closely due to their high risk for developing serious complications.","Pratheepamornkull, Thitikarn; Ratanakorn, Woranart; Samransamruajkit, Rujipat; Poovorawan, Yong",The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26867384/,230

Invasions by harmful nonnative species are increasing in number and area affected; the damages to ecosystems, economic activity, and human welfare are accumulating. Without improved strategies based on recent scientific advances and increased investments to counter invasions, harm from invasive species is likely to accelerate. Federal leadership, with the cooperation of state and local governments, is required to increase the effectiveness of prevention of invasions, detect and respond quickly to new potentially harmful invasions, control and slow the spread of existing invasions, and provide a national center to ensure that these efforts are coordinated and cost effective. Specifically, the Ecological Society of America recommends that the federal government take the following six actions: (1) Use new information and practices to better manage commercial and other pathways to reduce the transport and release of potentially harmful species; (2) Adopt more quantitative procedures for risk analysis and apply them to every species proposed for importation into the country; (3) Use new cost-effective diagnostic technologies to increase active surveillance and sharing of information about invasive species so that responses to new invasions can be more rapid and effective; (4) Create new legal authority and provide emergency funding to support rapid responses to emerging invasions; (5) Provide funding and incentives for cost-effective programs to slow the spread of existing invasive species in order to protect still uninvaded ecosystems, social and industrial infrastructure, and human welfare; and (6) Establish a National Center for Invasive Species Management (under the existing National Invasive Species Council) to coordinate and lead improvements in federal, state, and international policies on invasive species. Recent scientific and technical advances provide a sound basis for more cost-effective national responses to invasive species. Greater investments in improved technology and management practices would be more than repaid by reduced damages from current and future invasive species.

Whereas several studies have confirmed this association, knowledge about the improvement and recovery of olfactory and gustatory loss is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal dynamics of improvement and recovery from sudden olfactory and gustatory loss in patients with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. METHODS Subjective chemosensory function, symptoms of COVID-19, COVID-19 tests results, demographics and medical history were collected through a questionnaire. RESULTS Among the 109 study participants, 95 had a combined olfactory and gustatory loss, five participants had isolated olfactory loss and nine participants has isolated taste loss. The mean age of participants was 39.4 years and 25% of participants were under the age of 30 years. Young age was not associated with a higher recovery rate. After a mean time of > 30 days since the chemosensory loss, participants reported relatively low recovery and improvement rates. For participants with olfactory loss, only 44% had fully recovered, whereas 28% had not yet experienced any improvement of symptoms. After gustatory loss, 50% had fully recovered, whereas 20% had not yet experienced any improvement. Olfactory and gustatory deficits were predominantly quantitative and mainly included complete loss of both olfactory and gustatory function. CONCLUSIONS Chemosensory loss was frequent in young individuals and persisted beyond a month after symptom onset, often without any improvement during this time.

200282,A first presentation of multiple sclerosis with concurrent COVID-19 infection,2020,"Automotive mechanics are reported to have lower lung function indices. Spray painting is associated with impairment of lung function among spray painters. It is a common practice by auto repairers in Calabar to operate in the vicinity of spray painting shops. Whether such dual exposure to auto repair and spray painting environments worsens the lung function of auto mechanics is not documented. Lung function was evaluated in 300 males divided into three groups: control (group1), auto mechanics in stand-alone auto repair shops (group 2) and auto mechanics working in the vicinity of spray painting shops (group 3). Each group consisted of 100 subjects. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in the first second expressed as percentage of FVC (FEV1%) were assessed using a Vitalograph spirometer. Percentage oxygen saturation was evaluated using a pulse oximeter. Results showed no significant differences in age, weight and height among various groups. FVC was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p< 0.05 and p<0.001 respectively) compared to control but not between groups 2 and 3. FEV1 was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (P <0.001 each) compared with control but not significantly different between groups 2 and 3. FEV1% was significantly lower in groups 2 and 3 (p< 0.001 each) compared with control but not between groups 2 and 3. The PEFR was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p<0.001 each) compared with control but not significantly different between groups 2 and 3. Percentage oxygen saturation was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05 and p<0.001 respectively) and also significantly lower in group 2 compared with group 3 (p<0.01). In conclusion, auto mechanics in auto repair only and auto repair shops shared with spray painters have lower lung function compared with control but no significant difference in lung function between auto mechanics in stand-alone auto repair shops compared with those in auto repair shops shared with spray painters.","Aribo, Ekpe",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084613/,230

Nasal washes were cultured for respiratory viruses, assayed for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antigen, and tested for coronavirus and rhinovirus RNA using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Also evaluated were eosinophil numbers and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in both nasal washes and serum, along with total IgE and specific IgE antibody in serum. Respiratory viruses were detected in 82% (18 of 22) of wheezing infants younger than 2 yr of age and in 83% (40 of 48) of older wheezing children. The predominant pathogens were RSV in infants (detected in 68% of wheezing subjects) and rhinovirus in older wheezing children (71%), and both were strongly associated with wheezing (p < 0.005). RSV was largely limited to wheezing children younger than 24 mo of age, but rhinovirus was detected by RT-PCR in 41% of all infants and in 35% of nonwheezing control subjects older than 2 yr of age. After 2 yr of age the strongest odds for wheezing were observed among those who had a positive RT-PCR test for rhinovirus together with a positive serum radioallergosorbent testing (RAST), nasal eosinophilia, or elevated nasal ECP (odds ratios = 17, 21, and 25, respectively). Results from this study demonstrate that a large majority of emergent wheezing illnesses during childhood (2 to 16 yr of age) can be linked to infection with rhinovirus, and that these wheezing attacks are most likely in those who have rhinovirus together with evidence of atopy or eosinophilic airway inflammation.","Rakes, G P; Arruda, E; Ingram, J M; Hoover, G E; Zambrano, J C; Hayden, F G; Platts-Mills, T A; Heymann, P W",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10051251/,230
201589,COVID-19 and myeloma clinical research - experience from the CARDAMON clinical trial,2020,"AIM To examine neighbourhood income differences in deaths amenable to medical care and public health over a 25-year period after the establishment of universal insurance for doctors and hospital services in Canada. METHODS Data for census metropolitan areas were obtained from the Canadian Mortality Database and population censuses for the years 1971, 1986, 1991 and 1996. Deaths amenable to medical care, amenable to public health, from ischaemic heart disease and from other causes were considered. Data on deaths were grouped into neighbourhood income quintiles on the basis of the census tract percentage of population below Canada's low-income cut-offs. RESULTS From 1971 to 1996, differences between the richest and poorest quintiles in age-standardised expected years of life lost amenable to medical care decreased 60% (p<0.001) in men and 78% (p<0.001) in women, those amenable to public health increased 0.7% (p = 0.94) in men and 20% (p = 0.55) in women, those lost from ischaemic heart disease decreased 58% in men and 38% in women, and from other causes decreased 15% in men and 9% in women. Changes in the age-standardised expected years of life lost difference for deaths amenable to medical care were significantly larger than those for deaths amenable to public health or other causes for both men and women (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Reductions in rates of deaths amenable to medical care made the largest contribution to narrowing socioeconomic mortality disparities. Continuing disparities in mortality from causes amenable to public health suggest that public health initiatives have a potentially important, but yet un-realized, role in further reducing mortality disparities in Canada.","James, Paul D; Wilkins, Russell; Detsky, Allan S; Tugwell, Peter; Manuel, Douglas G",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17372287/,230

The 2 EIAs used the same detecting system, a monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, but used different capture systems including a monoclonal antibody (m-EIA) or a polyclonal antibody (p-EIA). The EIAs were compared with the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and electron microscopy (EM) for the detection of TGEV in intestinal samples of experimentally inoculated gnotobiotic piglets and of conventional diarrheic pigs submitted for diagnosis. In the gnotobiotic piglets experimentally inoculated with TGEV, 81.8% (9/11) were positive for TGEV by p-EIA, and 72.7% (8/11) were positive by m-EIA. In comparison, 81.8% (9/11) were positive by FAT and 27.2% (3/11) were positive by EM. Three noninfected controls were negative by all tests. In the diagnostic samples, 86.0% (43/50) were positive by p-EIA, 68.2% (30/44) were positive by m-EIA, 28.6% (14/49) were positive by IFA, and 38.0% (19/50) were positive by EM.

203173,COVID-19 mortality needs age adjusting for international comparisons,2021,"BACKGROUND: Dental visits are unpleasant; sometimes, patients only seek treatment when they are in intolerable pain. Recently, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for remote communication when patients and dentists cannot meet in person. Gingivitis is very common and characterized by red, swollen, bleeding gums. Gingivitis heals within 10 days of professional care and with daily, thorough oral hygiene practices. If left untreated, however, its progress may lead to teeth becoming mobile or lost. Of the many medical apps currently available, none monitor gingivitis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a characterization and development model of a mobile health (mHealth) app called iGAM, which focuses on periodontal health and improves the information flow between dentists and patients. METHODS: A focus group discussed the potential of an app to monitor gingivitis, and 3 semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted on the use of apps for monitoring gum infections. We used a qualitative design process based on the Agile approach, which incorporated the following 5 steps: (1) user story, (2) use cases, (3) functional requirements, (4) nonfunctional requirements, and (5) Agile software development cycles. In a pilot study with 18 participants aged 18-45 years and with different levels of health literacy, participants were given a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, toothpicks, and dental floss. After installing iGAM, they were asked to photograph their gums weekly for 4 weeks. RESULTS: All participants in the focus group believed in the potential of a mobile app to monitor gingivitis and reduce its severity. Concerns about security and privacy issues were discussed. From the interviews, 2 themes were derived: (1) ""what's in it for me?"" and (2) the need for a take-home message. The 5 cycles of development highlighted the importance of communication between dentists, app developers, and the pilot group. Qualitative analysis of the data from the pilot study showed difficulty with: (1) the camera, which was alleviated with the provision of mouth openers, and (2) the operation of the phone, which was alleviated by changing the app to be fully automated, with a weekly reminder and an instructions document. Final interviews showed satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: iGAM is the first mHealth app for monitoring gingivitis using self-photography. iGAM facilitates the information flow between dentists and patients between checkups and may be useful when face-to-face consultations are not possible (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic).","Tobias, Guy; Spanier, Assaf B",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,230
203290,"Children and adolescents cancer incidence, mortality and survival a population-based study in Midwest of Brazil",2020,"A novel coronavirus related to a condition known as a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was termed as SARS Coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19), which has caused an unprecedented global pandemic. Extensive efforts have been dedicated worldwide towards determining the mechanisms of COVID-19 associated pathogenesis with the goals of devising potential therapeutic approaches to mitigate or overcome comorbidities and mortalities. While the mode of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its structural configuration, and mechanisms of action, including the critical roles of the Spike protein have been substantially explored, elucidation of signaling pathways regulating its cellular responses is yet to be fully determined. Notably, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and its downstream pathway have been exploited among potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, and its activation modulates the release of cytokines such as IL-8. To that end, the current studies were sought to determine the response of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein on PI3K-mediated IL-8 release using relevant and widely used cellular models. Overall, these studies indicate that PI3K signaling does not directly mediate Spike S1 protein-induced IL-8 release in these cellular models.","Borchers, Christina Thyagarajan Anita Rapp Christine M.; Travers, Jeffrey B.; Sahu, Ravi P.",Medical Sciences,,230

We use triangulation of theories, namely deep ecology, legitimacy, and we introduce a new perspective to the stakeholder theory that considers species as a 'stakeholder'. Using Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) regression, we examine a sample of 200 Fortune Global companies over 3 years. Our results indicate significant positive relations between ecologically conscious companies that are accountable for the protection of biodiversity and species extinction and external assurance, environmental performance, partnerships with socially responsible organizations and awards for sustainable activities. Our empirical results appear to be robust in controlling for possible endogeneities. Our findings contribute to the discussion on the concern of species loss and habitat destruction in the context of corporate accountability, especially in responding to the sixth mass extinction event and COVID-19 crisis. Our results can also guide the policymakers and stakeholders of the financial market in better decision making.","Roberts, Lee; Nandy, Monomita; Hassan, Abeer; Lodh, Suman; Elamer, Ahmed A",J Bus Ethics,,230

204254,"Pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome in COVID-19 infection",2020,"CLINICAL QUESTION: What is the role of remdesivir in the treatment of severe covid-19? This guideline was triggered by the ACTT-1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 22 May 2020. CURRENT PRACTICE: Remdesivir has received worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for severe covid-19. After rapid market approval in the US, remdesivir is already being used in clinical practice. RECOMMENDATIONS: The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for the use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 while recommending continuation of active enrolment of patients into ongoing randomised controlled trials examining remdesivir. HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED: An international panel of patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The recommendations are based on a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis. The panel considered an individual patient perspective and allowed contextual factors (such as resources) to be taken into account for countries and healthcare systems. THE EVIDENCE: The linked systematic review (published 31 Jul 2020) identified two randomised trials with 1300 participants, showing low certainty evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing time to clinical improvement and may decrease mortality in patients with severe covid-19. Remdesivir probably has no important effect on need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on hospital length of stay. UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATION: Most patients with severe covid-19 would likely choose treatment with remdesivir given the potential reduction in time to clinical improvement. However, given the low certainty evidence for critical outcomes and the fact that different perspectives, values, and preferences may alter decisions regarding remdesivir, the panel issued a weak recommendation with strong support for continued recruitment in randomised trials.","Rochwerg, Bram; Agarwal, Arnav; Zeng, Linan; Leo, Yee-Sin; Appiah, John Adabie; Agoritsas, Thomas; Bartoszko, Jessica; Brignardello-Petersen, Romina; Ergan, Begum; Ge, Long; Geduld, Heike; Gershengorn, Hayley B; Manai, Hela; Huang, Minhua; Lamontagne, François; Kanda, Seema; Kawano-Dourado, Leticia; Kurian, Linda; Kwizera, Arthur; Murthy, Srinivas; Qadir, Nida; Siemieniuk, Reed; Silvestre, Maria Asuncion; Vandvik, Per Olav; Ye, Zhikang; Zeraatkar, Dena; Guyatt, Gordon",BMJ,,230

205513,Recent endemic coronavirus infection is associated with less severe COVID-19,2020,"Food waste represents a multi-sectoral issue and influences the economy, society and environment. Considering that over 50% of food waste is generated from household consumption, the issue has been included among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, with the aim of halving its quantity by 2030. However, the COVID-19 pandemic imposed several variations in the agri-food industry in terms of food manufacturing, storage and distribution, changing at the same time food access, food consumption and food waste behavior. The present paper, through an online-based questionnaire among 831 respondents from Italy and the application of the cumulative logit model, investigates consumer behavior after the lockdown with reference to unpredictable lifestyles, improvements in smart food delivery and never-experienced time management. Results illustrate that always-at-home consumers (forced to stay at home 24 hours a day) are more likely to perceive food waste and reduce its amount, whereas discontinuous smart working makes food purchase, preparation and consumption activities even more stressful and complex. Furthermore, smart food delivery tends to increase consumers’ awareness of meals, improving buying decisions and indirectly reducing food waste generation. The unjustifiable prevalence of household food waste represents a major barrier to the achievement of food security, health insurance and hunger reduction, but also the most promising entry point to stress in the achievement of private and public benefits. Thus, the active role of education among young generations must be enhanced.","Amicarelli, Vera Lagioia Giovanni Sampietro Stefania Bux Christian",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,230

211663,Delirium: A Frequent Manifestation in COVID-19 Older Patients,2020,"In December 2019, the first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were diagnosed. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. To address this emerging problem, we focused on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease that constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. We have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases. On the basis of these findings, we designed and synthesized a potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor (Ac-Abu-DTyr-Leu-Gln-VS, half-maximal effective concentration of 3.7 µM) and two activity-based probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We visualized active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents and/or diagnostic tests.","Rut, Wioletta; Groborz, Katarzyna; Zhang, Linlin; Sun, Xinyuanyuan; Zmudzinski, Mikolaj; Pawlik, Bartlomiej; Wang, Xinyu; Jochmans, Dirk; Neyts, Johan; Mlynarski, Wojciech; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Drag, Marcin",Nat. chem. biol,,230

214522,Direct COVID-19 infection of enterocytes: The role of hypochlorhydria,2020,"Abstract Aim: This study aimed at understanding determinants of food choices and eating practices of aesthetics and weight class athletes from two countries. Methods: In this qualitative study, through recorded in-depth individual and focal group interviews, gymnasts (n = 16) and martial arts (n = 18) athletes from Brazil and Spain reported their eating practices. Transcripts were analyzed through the Content Analysis method. Results: The main determinants of athletes' eating practices were the quest for a specific body in line with each sports' discipline and cultural food aspects. The everyday eating practices respected the country of origin's food culture; however, some practices, especially aiming at weight loss were similar in both countries and related to the sports discipline. Female Brazilian aesthetics athletes were particularly worried about achieving a thinner body. Martial arts athletes from both countries reported adopting fast weight loss strategies presently or at some point in their sports trajectory. Internal and external pressure to lose weight was a constant factor, especially amongst Brazilians. Conclusions: There is a specific body culture in each sport discipline, which extends beyond country borders. The idealized bodies athletes seek are constructed socially according to their sports. This confers them an identity and promotes beliefs and meanings to foodways. The sports-related eating practices which superimposed national foodways were similar in both countries, suggesting a group identity process, and the existence of a ""sports discipline's food culture"". Understanding athletes' determinants of food choices and eating practices provide insights to address the gap between nutritional recommendations and eating practices.","Juzwiak, Claudia Ridel",Motriz (Online),,230
214673,Compassionate Use of Remdesivir in Children With Severe COVID-19,2021,"Purpose: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China and affected the whole world, has cost the lives of thousands of people. Manual diagnosis is inefficient due to the rapid spread of this virus. For this reason, automatic COVID-19 detection studies are carried out with the support of artificial intelligence algorithms. Methods: In this study, a deep learning model that detects COVID-19 cases with high performance is presented. The proposed method is defined as Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and can automatically classify Computed Tomography (CT) images. Unlike the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained with the transfer learning method, the CSVM model is trained as a scratch. To evaluate the performance of the CSVM method, the dataset is divided into two parts as training (%75) and testing (%25). The CSVM model consists of blocks containing three different numbers of SVM kernels. Results: When the performance of pre-trained CNN networks and CSVM models is assessed, CSVM (7x7, 3x3, 1x1) model shows the highest performance with 94.03% ACC, 96.09% SEN, 92.01% SPE, 92.19% PRE, 94.10% F1-Score, 88.15% MCC and 88.07% Kappa metric values. Conclusion: The proposed method is more effective than other methods. It has proven in experiments performed to be an inspiration for combating COVID and for future studies.","Ozkaya, Umut; Ozturk, cSaban; Budak, Serkan; Melgani, Farid; Polat, Kemal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05746v1.pdf,230

This study aimed to examine the usability and test performance of a point of care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of SARS-COV2 (POCKITTM Central) in care homes. METHODS: POCKITTM Central was evaluated in a purposeful sample of four UK care homes. Test agreement with laboratory real-time PCR and usability and use errors were assessed. RESULTS: No significant usability-related hazards emerged, and the sources of error identified were found to be amendable with minor changes in training or test workflow. POCKITTM Central has acceptable sensitivity and specificity based on RT-PCR as the reference standard, especially for symptomatic cases.Asymptomatic specimens showed 83.3% (95% CI: 35.9%-99.6%) positive agreement and 98.7% negative agreement (95% CI: 96.2%-99.7%), with overall prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) of 0.965 (95% CI: 0.932- 0.999). Symptomatic specimens showed 100% (95% CI: 2.5%-100%) positive agreement and 100% negative agreement (95% CI: 85.8%-100%), with overall PABAK of 1.Recommendations are provided to mitigate the frequency of occurrence of the residual use errors observed. Integration pathways were discussed to identify opportunities and limitations of adopting POCKIT&#8482; Central for screening and diagnostic testing purposes. CONCLUSION: Point-of-care PCR testing in care homes can be considered with appropriate preparatory steps and safeguards. Further diagnostic accuracy evaluations and in-service evaluation studies should be conducted, if the test is to be implemented more widely, to build greater certainty on this initial exploratory analysis.","Micocci, Massimo; Gordon, Adam L; Seo, Mikyung Kelly; Allen, A Joy; Davies, Kerrie; Lasserson, Dan; Thompson, Carl; Spilsbury, Karen; Akrill, Cyd; Heath, Ros; Astle, Anita; Sharpe, Claire; Perera, Rafael; Hayward, Gail; Buckle, Peter",Age ageing,,230
215287,Is Nutrition the Forgotten Risk Factor in COVID19 Infection?,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 in vitro transcribed RNA reference materials (RM), UME RM 2019 and UME RM 2020, were produced by Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), National Metrology Institute (UME), to be used as a quality control material for SARS-CoV-2 measurements, in liquid-frozen and lyophilized forms, respectively. These RNA RMs include ten internationally recommended SARS-CoV-2 target gene fragments (Pasteur-RdRp-IP2, Pasteur-RdRp-IP4, Charite-E, Charite-RdRp, CDC-N1, CDC-N2, China CDC-ORF1ab, China CDC-N, Hong Kong-ORF1b, and Hong Kong-N) for virus detection and one human gene fragment (RNase P) as an internal control. Two different platforms, RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR, were used to characterize UME RM 2019 (UME RM 2020 was only characterized with RT-qPCR). The homogeneity studies were evaluated by RT-qPCR. According to these results, it has been shown that both reference materials are homogeneous for intended use. Short-term studies were also conducted similarly for mimicking transport conditions and UME RM 2020, which is produced in lyophilized form, unlike other reference materials available in the market, provides convenience for users by ensuring that the reference material remains stable for 17 days even at 45 °C temperature. The lyophilized formulation of the reference material had greater stability which would allow it to be shipped without cooling items. The development of such RNA reference materials provides quality control for existing and newly designed RNA-based virus detection tests and it helps the prevention and control of epidemics.","Akyurek, Sema; Demirci, Sumeyra Nur Sanal; Bayrak, Zeynep; Isleyen, Alper; Akgoz, Muslum",Anal. bioanal. chem,,230

U-Net networks have previously been used in the audio processing area for source separation problems because of their ability to reproduce the finest details of audio signals, but to our knowledge, this is the first time they have been used for acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). The U-Net hyperparameters have been optimized to obtain the best AEC performance, but using a reduced number of parameters to meet a latency restriction of 40 ms. The training and testing of our model have been carried out within the framework of the 'ICASSP 2021 AEC Challenge' organized by Microsoft. We have trained the optimized U-Net model with a synthetic dataset only (S-U-Net) and with a synthetic dataset and the single-talk set of a real dataset (SR-U-Net), both datasets were released for the challenge. The S-U-Net model presented better results for double-talk scenarios, thus their inferred near-end signals from the blind testset were submitted to the challenge.

In this study, we aim to identify patient and treatment-specific factors that may significantly contribute to this phenomenon and translate these characteristics into a predictive model for expected percent free flap volume loss in a given patient. METHODS: Patients with a history of oral cavity and/or oropharyngeal cancer who underwent nonosseous free flap reconstruction were reviewed between January 2009 and November 2018 at a tertiary care center. Demographics/characteristics, total radiation dose, radiation fractionation (RF), and pre/postradiation free flap volume as evaluated by computed tomography imaging were collected. Free flap volume was measured by a fellowship-trained neuroradiologist in all cases. Only patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy with available pre/postradiation imaging were included. Multivariable linear regression modeling for prediction of free flap volume loss was performed with optimization via stepwise elimination. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included for analysis. Mean flap volume loss was 42.7% ± 17.4%. The model predicted flap volume loss in a significant fashion (P = .004, R2 = 0.49) with a mean magnitude of error of 9.8% ± 7.5%. Age (ß = 0.01, P = .003) and RF (ß = -0.01, P = .009) were individual predictors of flap volume loss. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predicts percent free flap volume loss in a significant fashion. Age and RF are individual predictors of free flap volume loss, the latter being a novel finding that is also modifiable through hyperfractionation radiotherapy schedules.","Razavi, Christopher R; Hostetter, Jason; Shukla, Aishwarya; Cheng, Zhi; Aygun, Nafi; Boahene, Kofi; Byrne, Patrick J; Richmon, Jeremy; Quon, Harry; Desai, Shaun C",Ear Nose Throat J,,230
216998,Continuous tracking of COVID-19 patients' immune status,2020,"BACKGROUND: There lacks an ideal model for accurately predicting clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). This study aimed at developing a nomogram with high accuracy in predicting CR-POPF after PD. METHODS: A total of 1182 patients undergoing PD in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (FAHSYSU, n = 762) and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC, n = 420) between January 2010 and May 2018 were enrolled. The patients from FAHSYSU were assigned as testing cohort, and those from FUSCC were used as external validation cohort. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors for CR-POPF. Nomogram was developed on the basis of significant predictors. The performance of nomogram was evaluated by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: In testing cohort, 87 out of 762 patients developed CR-POPF. Three predictors were significantly associated with CR-POPF, including body mass index &#8805;24.0 kg/m2, pancreatic duct diameter <3 mm, and drainage fluid amylase on postoperative day 1 &#8805;2484 units/L (all p &#8804; 0.001). Prediction of nomogram was accurate with AUC of 0.934 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.914-0.950) in testing cohort and 0.744 (95% CI: 0.699-0.785) in external validation cohort. The predictive accuracy of nomogram was better than that of previously proposed fistula risk scores both in testing and external validation cohort (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The novel nomogram based on three easily available parameters could accurately predict CR-POPF after PD. It would have high clinical value due to its accuracy and convenience.","Huang, Xi-Tai; Huang, Chen-Song; Liu, Chen; Chen, Wei; Cai, Jian-Peng; Cheng, He; Jiang, Xing-Xing; Liang, Li-Jian; Yu, Xian-Jun; Yin, Xiao-Yu",World j. sur,,230

We assessed saliva-based specimens for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in the community setting and compared three different collection methods. This prospective study was conducted in three primary care centers. RT-PCR was performed on paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples collected from outpatients with a broad clinical spectrum of illness. To assess differences in collection methods, saliva specimens were obtained in a different way in each of the participating centers: supervised collection (SVC), oropharyngeal washing (OPW), and self-collection (SC). Pairs of NPS and saliva samples from 577 patients (median age, 39 years; 44% men; 42% asymptomatic) were collected and tested, and 120 (20.8%) gave positive results. The overall agreement with NPS results and kappa coefficients (&#954;) for saliva samples obtained by SVC, OPW, and SC were 95% (&#954; = 0.85), 93.4% (&#954; = 0.76), and 93.3% (&#954; = 0.76), respectively. The sensitivities (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) of the saliva specimens ranged from 86% (72.6% to 93.7%) for SVC to 66.7% (50.4% to 80%) for SC samples. Sensitivity was higher for samples with lower cycle threshold (CT ) values. The best RT-PCR performance was observed for SVC, with sensitivities (95% CI) of 100% (85.9% to 100%) in symptomatic individuals and 88.9% (50.7% to 99.4%) in asymptomatic individuals at CT values of &#8804;30. We conclude that saliva is an acceptable specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the community setting. Specimens collected under supervision perform comparably to NPS and can effectively identify individuals at higher risk of transmission under real-life conditions.","Fernández-González, Marta; Agulló, Vanesa; de la Rica, Alba; Infante, Ana; Carvajal, Mar; García, José Alberto; Gonzalo-Jiménez, Nieves; Cuartero, Claudio; Ruiz-García, Montserrat; de Gregorio, Carlos; Sánchez, Manuel; Masiá, Mar; Gutiérrez, Félix",J. clin. microbiol,,230

The current COVID 19 pandemic impact on health services mandated an utmost readiness to implement telemedicine which in part is dependent on health care providers willingness to adopt such platforms. AIM: The aim of this cross sectional study was to assess knowledge and attitude toward telemedicine Egyptian dermatologists amidst the COVID 19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study was designed and data were collected using structured self-administered online questionnaires. RESULTS: Dermatologists had a good knowledge about telemedicine (mean 4.17 ± 1.63; p < .05). Of those completing the questionnaire, 193 (68.9%) were familiar with the term 'telemedicine' and 164 (58.6%) were familiar with tools like teleconferencing. The majority of responding dermatologists 227 (81.1%) were confident that the COVID 19 pandemic is a good opportunity to start applying telemedicine protocols however the majority 234 (83.6%) preferred using it on trial basis at first before full implementation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion an overall good attitude toward telemedicine was reported with a mean of 3.39 (p < .05). Further large scale studies are required to verify such findings.","Elsaie, Mohamed L; Shehata, Hany A; Hanafi, Noha S; Ibrahim, Shady M; Ibrahim, Hany S; Abdelmaksoud, Ayman",J Dermatolog Treat,,230

219361,A pilot study for treatment of COVID-19 patients in moderate stage using intravenous administration of ozonized saline as an adjuvant treatment-registered clinical trial,2021,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have become an increasingly popular approach for demonstrating polygenic influences on complex traits and for establishing common polygenic signals between different traits. PRSs are typically constructed using pruning and thresholding (P+T), but the best choice of parameters is uncertain; thus multiple settings are used and the best is chosen. Optimization can lead to inflated Type I error. Permutation procedures can correct this, but they can be computationally intensive. Alternatively, a single parameter setting can be chosen a priori for the PRS, but choosing suboptimal settings results in loss of power. We propose computing PRSs under a range of parameter settings, performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the resulting set of PRSs, and using the first PRS-PC in association tests. The first PC reweights the variants included in the PRS to achieve maximum variation over all PRS settings used. Using simulations and a real data application to study PRS association with bipolar disorder and psychosis in bipolar disorder, we compare the performance of the proposed PRS-PCA approach with a permutation test and an a priori selected p-value threshold. The PRS-PCA approach is simple to implement, outperforms the other strategies in most scenarios, and provides an unbiased estimate of prediction performance.","Coombes, Brandon J; Ploner, Alexander; Bergen, Sarah E; Biernacka, Joanna M",Genetic epidemiology,,230

But Stock markets are wealth creators for long term investors, can be a small player like a trader or a big player like HNIs. Margin money is supplied by almost all the Stockbrokers including discount brokers in India to enable the intraday traders with a high level of leverage in the stock market with the small capital available with the traders. Margin money opportunity can be treated as a double-edged sword which can be used to win over the rival else it can kill ourselves if not used properly. Hence, the trader should have enough knowledge or strategy to use the margin money to gain from the opportunities that arise in real-time markets. The researcher has developed a strategy and back tested with past data. One of the prominent Doji based intraday strategies can be applied in stock markets to extract opportunities. The present study is an attempt to prove that stock markets can create wealth for the short-term investors as well. The objective of this study is to back-test the strategy for a short period and tests the results using the combination of algorithmic and statistical methods to decide on its consistency & future scope for implementation. During the Covid-19 many stocks have been affected due to uncertainty prevailed in both Domestic and Global markets. Especially the core sectors like Banking, IT, Steel, Chemical, and Pharma also affected due to the volatility in stock markets.

222940,CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 variants influence the risk and outcome of COVID-19 infection among rheumatoid arthritis patients maintained on hydroxychloroquine,2021,"ABSTRACT: It is recommended that every patient with a new third nerve palsy undergo urgent neuroimaging (computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography) to exclude a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Because of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, our institution noted a significant decline in the number of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage presenting to the hospital. We report one such example of a patient who developed new-onset severe headache and vomiting and did not seek medical attention because of COVID-19. Two months later, she was noted to have ptosis during a routine follow-up and was found to have a complete, pupil-involving third nerve palsy. Computed tomography angiography was performed and revealed an irregular bilobed saccular aneurysm (7 × 9 × 5 mm) of the right posterior communicating (PComm) artery, but no acute hemorrhage was visible on CT. On MRI, immediately adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a small subacute hematoma in the right medial temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema. This case had a fortunate and unique outcome as she had a contained hematoma adjacent to the ruptured PComm aneurysm and did not experience severe morbidity from the subarachnoid hemorrhage nor did she rebleed in the interval in which she did not seek care. This case highlights the importance of providing neuro-ophthalmic care even during a pandemic.","Dhoot, Arjan S; Guest, William C; Bharatha, Aditya; Micieli, Jonathan A",J. neuro-ophthalmol,,230

Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) can detect SARS-CoV-2 more rapidly than RT-PCR. Saliva is non-invasive specimen suitable for mass-screening, but data comparing utility of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and saliva in RT-LAMP test are lacking and it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by direct processing of samples without the need for prior RNA extraction saliva. In this study, we compared utility of saliva and NPS samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a novel RT-fluorescence LAMP (RT-fLAMP). The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-fLAMP with RNA extraction were 97% and 100%, respectively, with equivalent utility of NPS and saliva. However, sensitivity was decreased to 71% and 47% in NPS and saliva samples without RNA extraction, respectively, suggesting that RNA extraction process may be critical for the virus detection by RT-fLAMP.","Taki, Keisuke; Yokota, Isao; Fukumoto, Tatsuya; Iwasaki, Sumio; Fujisawa, Shinichi; Takahashi, Masayoshi; Negishi, Saeki; Hayasaka, Kasumi; Sato, Kaori; Oguri, Satoshi; Nishida, Mutsumi; Sugita, Junichi; Konno, Satoshi; Saito, Tomoya; Teshima, Takanori",J. infect. chemother,,230
223157,Gastrointestinal Symptoms Predict the Outcomes From COVID-19 Infection,2021,"PURPOSE: To discuss the different characteristics of clinical, laboratory, and chest computed tomography (CT) in pediatric patients from adults with 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital. RESULTS: Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%). CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric patients which were different from adults. It is suggested that underlying coinfection may be more common in pediatrics, and the consolidation with surrounding halo sign which is considered as a typical sign in pediatric patients.","Xia, Wei; Shao, Jianbo; Guo, Yu; Peng, Xuehua; Li, Zhen; Hu, Daoyu",Pediatr Pulmonol,,230
223204,"Correction to: Neurological manifestations of COVID­19, SARS and MERS",2020,"Genome-wide analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains is essential to better understand infectivity and virulence and to track coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and outbreaks. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 27 SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated between January 2020 and April 2020. A total of 54 mutations in different genomic regions was found. The D614G mutation, first detected in March 2020, was identified in 18 strains and was more likely associated with a lower cycle threshold (<25) in real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests than the original D614 (prevalence ratio = 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-6.38). The integration of sequencing and epidemiological data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 transmission in both quarantine areas and in the community in Vietnam occur at the beginning of the epidemic although the country implemented strict quarantine quite early, with strict contact tracing, and testing. These findings provide insights into the nature of the epidemic, as well as shape strategies for COVID-19 prevention and control in Vietnam.","Dao, Manh H; Phan, Lan T; Cao, Thang M; Luong, Quang C; Pham, Hang T T; Vu, Nhung H P; Khuu, Nghia V; Nguyen, Thinh V; Nguyen, Long T; Nguyen, Hieu T; Nguyen, Anh H; Huynh, Loan Kim Thi; Huynh, Thao P; Nguyen, Quan H; Truong, Hieu C; Nguyen, Hang Minh; Trinh, Tung Xuan; Nguyen, Dung T; Nguyen, Trieu B; Do, Hung T; Pham, Quang D; Nguyen, Thuong V",J. med. virol,,230

223626,COVID-19 mortality in hospitalized cancer patients is not significantly affected by chemotherapy or other anti-cancer treatments,2020,"Although the incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is on the decline, management of patients who present with STEMI continues to require significant health care resources. Earlier hospital discharge in low-risk patients who present with STEMI has been an area of focus in an attempt to reduce health care costs. As a result, discharge within 48-72 hours after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention has increasingly become routine practice. Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to enormous pressure on health care systems to find ways to increase bed capacity, preserve resources, and reduce the risk of exposure to patients and health care workers. In response to this goal, the Ottawa Heart Institute has developed and implemented a novel Very Early Hospital Discharge (VEHD) protocol. The VEHD protocol is a simple, 4-step algorithm designed to accurately and efficiently identify low-risk STEMI patients who can be safely discharged between 20 and 36 hours after successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention. When deemed eligible for VEHD predischarge tasks are completed by the treating medical and nursing team and the patient is discharged home. Follow-up is completed remotely via virtual care (48 hours, 7 days, 30 days), and in the outpatient cardiology clinic (4-6 weeks). Amid a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we believe the VEHD protocol is a crucial step in maintaining exceptional quality of care, in terms of patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, while concurrently decreasing the risk of nosocomial infections, and reducing resource utilization.","Marbach, Jeffrey A; Alhassani, Saad; Chong, Aun-Yeong; MacPhee, Erika; Le May, Michel",Can. j. cardiol,,230
224020,Strong policies control the spread of COVID-19 in China,2020,"Background: Given the dynamism and heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission patterns, determining the most effective yet timely strategies for specific regions remains a severe challenge for public health decision-makers. Methods: In this work, we proposed a spatiotemporal connectivity analysis method for discovering transmission patterns across geographic locations and age-groups throughout different COVID-19 outbreak phases. First, we constructed the transmission networks of the confirmed cases during different phases by considering the spatiotemporal connectivity of any two cases. Then, for each case and those cases immediately pointed from it, we characterized the corresponding cross-district/population transmission pattern by counting their district-to-district and age-to-age occurrences. By summating the cross-district/population transmission patterns of all cases during a given period, we obtained the aggregated cross-district and cross-population transmission patterns. Findings: We conducted a region-wide comprehensive retrospective study in Hong Kong based on the complete data report of COVID-19 cases, covering all 18 districts between January 23, 2020, and January 8, 2021 (https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent). The spatiotemporal connectivity analysis clearly unveiled the quantitative differences among various outbreak waves in their transmission scales, durations, and patterns. Moreover, for the statistically similar waves, their cross-district/population transmission patterns could be quite different (e.g., the cross-district transmission of the fourth wave was more diverse than that of the third wave, while the transmission over age-groups of the fourth wave was more concentrated than that of the third wave). At an overall level, super-spreader individuals (highly connected cases in the transmission networks) were usually concentrated in only a few districts (2 out of 18 in our study) or age-groups (3 out of 11 in our study). Interpretation: With the discovered cross-district or cross-population transmission patterns, all of the waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong can be systematically scrutinized. Among all districts, quite a few (e.g., the Yau Tsim Mong district) were instrumental in spreading the virus throughout the pandemic. Aside from being exceptionally densely populated, these districts were also social-economic centers. With a variety of situated public venues, such as restaurants and singing/dancing clubs, these districts played host to all kinds of social gathering events, thereby providing opportunities for widespread and rapid transmission of the virus. Thus, these districts should be given the highest priority when deploying district-specific social distancing or intervention strategies, such as lockdown and stringent mandatory coronavirus testing for identifying and obstructing the chain of transmission. We also observed that most of the reported cases and the highly connected cases were middle-aged and elderly people (40- to 69-year-olds). People in these age-groups were active in various public places and social activities, and thus had high chances of being infected by or infecting others.

It is considered a defense mechanism against extensive lipid peroxidation, a complex process that may disrupt the membrane integrity, eventually leading to toxic cellular injury. Ferroptosis is controlled by iron, reactive oxygen species, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Accumulating evidence has addressed that ferroptosis plays an unneglectable role in regulating the development and progression of multiple pathologies of the liver, including hepatocellular carcinoma, liver fibrosis, nonalcoholic steatosis, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, and liver failure. This review may increase our understating of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver disease progression and establish the foundation of strategies for pharmacological intervention.","Kim, Kyu Min; Cho, Sam Seok; Ki, Sung Hwan",Arch. pharm. res,,230

The inelastic scattering of low-energy electrons (<10â¯keV) was calculated by dielectric theory. The optical energy-loss functions of viral proteins and RNA were derived from an empirical method in the energy-loss range <40â¯eV and the calculation of optical parameters of the biomolecules. The densities and distributions of energy deposition and ionization were calculated from the stopping power and inelastic cross-sections in the electron-cascade simulation. Electrons with primary energies of approximately 1-3â¯keV produced significant energy deposition and ionization in the target coronavirus. More energetic electrons were less effective due to the larger electron range and fewer scattering events in the coronavirus.","Zhang, Xiaqi; Wang, Fang; Weng, Ming; Cao, Meng",Radiat Phys Chem Oxf Engl 1993,,230

COVID-19 is plaguing people not only physically but also psychologically, and cancer patients are particularly exposed to this emotional threat. Herein, we describe the psychological threats posed by COVID-19 to cancer patients. Our analysis is based on the concerns of our patients during our daily clinical interactions in both outpatient and inpatient settings. We have summarized the patients' psychological issues: logistic overload, loneliness, fear, oxymoronic thoughts, helplessness, frustration, and emotional siege. We describe these psychological threats, provide clinical context for them, and offer practical suggestions for managing them, for the benefit of patients, their caregivers, and clinicians. Our hope is that, by sharing our clinical experience, we can help other oncologists increase their awareness of the psychological impact of the pandemic on cancer patients and implement solutions. Managing these challenges now should translate into improved standards of care when this infective storm is over. Paradoxically, COVID-19 could be an opportunity to learn how to better manage cancer care.","Garutti, Mattia; Cortiula, Francesco; Puglisi, Fabio",Front Oncol,,230

In this retrospective multicentre observational study, we report clinical characteristics and outcomes in 36 pregnant women requiring hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared to a propensity-matched cohort of non-pregnant women. Pregnant women had a lower haemoglobin and higher lymphocyte counts but no differences in other haematological or biochemical parameters on admission compared to non-pregnant women. There was no significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation; median two days (1-77) for pregnant versus eight days (1-49) for non-pregnant women. A higher proportion of non-pregnant women required mechanical ventilation [11/36 (31%) vs 3/36 (8%), P = 0·03] and received thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) within 24 h of admission [25/36 (69%) vs 15 /36(42%), P = 0·03] compared to pregnant women. One pregnant woman required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The rate of thrombosis was similar in both groups (one in each group). No women developed major bleeding or died. Data suggest that although non-pregnant women had a severe clinical course, overall outcomes were not different between women with or without pregnancy. The use of thromboprophylaxis was inconsistent, demonstrating a need for establishing evidence-based guidance for COVID-19 during pregnancy.","Crossette-Thambiah, Christina; Nicolson, Phillip; Rajakaruna, Indika; Langridge, Alexander; Sayar, Zara; Perelta, Maria R; Essex, Sarah; Oakes, Roderick; Mounter, Philip; Lewis, Sarah; Dutt, Tina; Scott, Ian; Aung, Nini; Shapiro, Susie; Laffan, Mike; Arachchillage, Deepa R J",Br. j. haematol,,230

The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood yet, but the availability of sensitive and specific serological assays will be crucial for the early diagnosis of infection, for epidemiological studies and for defining the presence of neutralizing antibodies in response to a possible vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested and compared the performances of one chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). RESULTS: The ECLIA serological assay performed best and may be a valid screening method for SARS-COV-2 infection. The IgA detected by the ELISA assay might be a more reliable and stable early serological marker than IgM. Instead, IgGs, as expected, showed stable level after 10 days from symptoms onset. CONCLUSION: The ECLIA method could be used as screening test, considering both the excellent performance and the cost per single test; while ELISA assay for IgG and IgA, which are present at a higher level than IgM and last longer, might be used as confirmatory test.","Pieri, Massimo; Ciotti, Marco; Carlozzi, Nicoletta; Frassanito, Maria Loredana; Meloni, Arianna; Cistera, Alessandro; Turchetti, Giordano; Niscola, Silvia; Labate, Giuseppe; Calugi, Graziella; Bernardini, Sergio",Clin Chim Acta,,230

In April 2020, Austrian adults (N = 286, age M = 31.0 years) completed a 21-day experience sampling phase in which they reported their emotional well-being (i.e., happiness), whether they were indoors or outdoors, and loneliness at three random time-points each day, as well as their daily screen-time. Results indicated that being outdoors was associated with higher emotional well-being, whereas greater loneliness and greater daily screen-time were associated with poorer well-being. Additionally, the impact of loneliness on well-being was weaker when participants were outdoors than indoors. These results have health policy implications for the promotion of population well-being during pandemics.","Stieger, Stefan; Lewetz, David; Swami, Viren",J Happiness Stud,,230

Os resultados revelaram que o aumento de recursos investidos no programa em um cenário otimizado pode proporcionar ampla capilarização dos benefícios. Identificou-se que o PAA é estratégico para o enfrentamento aos efeitos negativos da COVID-19 porque escoa os produtos da agricultura familiar, o que promove estruturação de cadeias produtivas, acesso a novos mercados e indução ao dinamismo econômico, além de atuar no combate à fome e à miséria de famílias que vivem em situação de vulnerabilidade. O programa não só apresenta condições de operacionalização durante a pandemia da COVID-19, como tem se adaptado à realidade atual, seguindo protocolos estabelecidos pelas autoridades de saúde. Concluiu-se que o PAA pode minimizar as crises sanitária e econômica, principalmente para a população mais vulnerável, apresentando ações que vão ao encontro das demandas da sociedade civil organizada e de recomendações de organismos nacionais e internacionais especializados, visando à redução dos impactos econômicos e sociais da pandemia causada pelo novo coronavírus.","Sambuichi, Regina Helena Rosa; Almeida, Ana Flávia Cordeiro Souza de; Perin, Gabriela; Spínola, Paulo Asafe Campos; Pella, Antônio Fernando Costa",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,230
232075,COVID-19 and gastrointestinal symptoms: the dust has not settled yet,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an occupational health risk to food system workers including farmers/producers, grocery store workers, emergency food system staff and volunteers (e.g., food pantry workers), and others. These food system workers have been pushed to the front-line of this pandemic, providing essential services that support food consumption for all Americans. Food system workers are some of the most economically vulnerable populations and are at risk of further financial disparities and contraction of COVID-19 during this pandemic. As we continue to grapple with the best strategies to support the food system and mitigate concerns around the spread of COVID-19, appropriate measures must be considered to better protect and support front-line food system workers that safeguard food access for all Americans.","Parks, Courtney A; Nugent, Nadine Budd; Fleischhacker, Sheila E; Yaroch, Amy L",J Nutr,,230
232076,COVID-19 and gastrointestinal symptoms: the dust has not settled yet,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the association between nursing home (NH) characteristics and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevalence among NH staff. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 database for US NHs between March and August 2020, linked to NH facility characteristics (LTCFocus database) and local COVID-19 prevalence (USA Facts). METHODS: We estimated the associations between NH characteristics, local infection rates, and other regional characteristics and COVID-19 cases among NH staff (nursing staff, clinical staff, aides, and other facility personnel) measured per 100 beds, controlling for the hospital referral regions in which NHs were located to account for local infection control practices and other unobserved characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 11,858 NHs in our sample, 78.6% reported at least 1 staff case of COVID-19. After accounting for local COVID-19 prevalence, NHs in the highest quartile of confirmed resident cases (413.5 to 920.0 cases per 1000 residents) reported 18.9 more staff cases per 100 beds compared with NHs that had no resident cases. Large NHs (150 or more beds) reported 2.6 fewer staff cases per 100 beds compared with small NHs (<50 beds) and for-profit NHs reported 0.8 fewer staff cases per 100 beds compared with nonprofit NHs. Higher occupancy and more direct-care hours per day were associated with more staff cases (0.4 more cases per 100 beds for a 10% increase in occupancy, and 0.7 more cases per 100 beds for an increase in direct-care staffing of 1 hour per resident day, respectively). Estimates associated with resident demographics, payer mix, or regional socioeconomic characteristics were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings highlight the urgent need to support facilities with emergency resources such as back-up staff and protocols to reduce resident density within the facility, which may help stem outbreaks.","Ryskina, Kira L; Yun, Hyunkyung; Wang, Hannah; Chen, Angela T; Jung, Hye-Young",J.

232222,Susoctocog-alfa (Obizur®) in the treatment of nine elderly patients with acquired haemophilia A: an Italian multicentre real world experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is typically associated with a respiratory syndrome, but gastrointestinal symptoms have been described in early reports from China. However, data from European centres are scarce. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterise the gastrointestinal manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their disease course. METHODS: Patients admitted at our centre between March and April 2020 with diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Asymptomatic patients or those without symptom information were excluded. Clinical features, laboratory data and disease severity (mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission or death) were analysed. RESULTS: Two-hundred one patients were included (median age 71 years; 56.2% male). Digestive symptoms were reported by 60 (29.9%) patients during the disease course, being part of the disease presentation in 34 (16.9%). The most frequent were diarrhoea in 36 patients (17.9%). Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were younger (P = 0.032), had higher haemoglobin levels (P = 0.002) and lower C-reactive protein (P = 0.045) and potassium levels (P = 0.004). Patients with digestive symptoms had less severe disease (28.3 vs. 44.0%; P = 0.038). Regarding liver damage, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was elevated in 65.2% of patients and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 62.7%, but these patients did not present a more severe disease (elevated AST P = 0.062; elevated ALT P = 0.276). CONCLUSION: A significant portion of COVID-19 patients have digestive symptoms, mostly at presentation. This should be taken into account in order to keep a high level of suspicion to reach an early diagnosis and setup infection control measures to control the transmission rate. This subgroup of patients appears to have a less severe disease course.","Leal, Tiago; Costa, Emanuel; Arroja, Bruno; Gonçalves, Raquel; Alves, Joana",Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,,230

India has also witnessed a rising number of infections since March 2020. The Indian government imposed lockdowns in the nation to control the movement of its citizens thereby confining the spread of the virus. Tweeters resorted to usage of social media platform to express their mind. AIM: Through this article, an attempt has been made to understand the mind-set of Indian people using Python and R statistical software, during the recent lockdown 2.0 (15 April 2020 to 3 May 2020) and lockdown 3.0 (4 May 2020 to 17 May 2020) through their tweets on the social media platform Twitter. Also, opinion on e-commerce during this pandemic has been analysed. METHOD: Analysis has been performed using Python and R statistical software. Also, recent articles related to COVID-19 have been considered and reviewed. RESULT: Although the country had a positive approach in lockdown 2.0 with only few instances of sadness, disgust and others, the majority of the people had a negative approach in lockdown 3.0. CONCLUSION: This analysis can help the health specialists to understand people's mind-set, the authorities to take further corresponding measures in washing out the virus and the e-commerce stakeholders to adapt to the changing attitudes by adjusting demand and supply plans accordingly.","Chehal, Dimple; Gupta, Parul; Gulati, Payal",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,230

Ivermectin binds with LEU492, GLN493, GLY496, and TRY505 residues in the spike protein through hydrogen bonds and levosalbutamol binds with TYR453 and TYR505 residues. Using density functional theory (DFT) studies, we have calculated the binding energies between ivermectin and levosalbutamol with residues in spike protein which favor their binding are - 22.4 kcal/mol and - 21.08 kcal/mol, respectively. The natural bond orbital (NBO) charge analysis has been performed to estimate the amount of charge transfer that occurred by two drugs during interaction with residues. Molecular dynamics (MD) study confirms the stability of spike protein bound with ivermectin through RMSD and RMSF analyses.

234454,COVID-19 Screening with Chest CT in Acute Stroke Imaging: A Clinical Decision Model,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The longevity of antibody levels against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the duration of immunity are current topics of major scientific interest. Antibody kinetics during the acute phase are well studied, whereas the long-term kinetics are yet to be determined, with contradictory results from the studies to date. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis of the serological responses to a SARS-CoV-2 infection following convalescence and the association with post-COVID syndrome (PCS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 237 serum samples were prospectively collected from 61 participants who had had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For each participant, anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike subunit 1 receptor binding domain (RBD/S1) immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were regularly determined over a period of 8 months. COVID-19-associated symptoms were assessed using a standardized questionnaire at study entry and again after 6 months. RESULTS: Antibodies were detectable in 56 of the 61 participants. No substantial decline in anti-SARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig levels was observed for the duration of the follow-up period. Antibody levels correlated positively with the disease severity, body mass index, fever, and smoking status. It was found that 46.8% of the participants suffered from PCS, with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions being the most commonly reported symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate stable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and thus may indicate a long-lasting immunity. The results are in line with recently published data and provide further insight concerning asymptomatic to mildly-affected patients, the association with clinical features, and the frequency of PCS.","Gerhards, Catharina; Thiaucourt, Margot; Kittel, Maximilian; Becker, Celine; Ast, Volker; Hetjens, Michael; Neumaier, Michael; Haselmann, Verena",Int J Infect Dis,,230
234595,Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia As Initial Presentation of COVID-19 Infection,2020,"Population-based seroprevalence studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in low- and middle-income countries are lacking. We investigated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in Sergipe state, Northeast Brazil, using rapid IgM-IgG antibody test and fluorescence immunoassay. The seroprevalence was 9.3% (95% CI 8.5-10.1), 10.2% (95% CI 9.2-11.3) for women and 7.9% (IC 95% 6.8-9.1) for men (P = 0.004). We found a decline in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age, but the differences were not statistically significant: 0-19 years (9.9%; 95% CI 7.8-12.5), 20-59 years (9.3%; 95% CI 8.4-10.3) and &#8805;60 years (9.0%; 95% CI 7.5-10.8) (P = 0.517). The metropolitan area had a higher seroprevalence (11.7%, 95% CI 10.3-13.2) than outside municipalities (8.0%, 95% CI 7.2-8.9) (P < 0.001). These findings highlight the importance of serosurveillance to estimate the real impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and thereby provide data to better understand the spread of the virus, as well as providing information to guide stay-at-home measures and other policies. In addition, these results may be useful as basic data to follow the progress of COVID-19 outbreak as social restriction initiatives start to be relaxed in Brazil.","de Souza Araújo, Adriano Antunes; Quintans-Júnior, Lucindo José; Heimfarth, Luana; Schimieguel, Dulce Marta; Corrêa, Cristiane Bani; de Moura, Tatiana Rodrigues; Cavalcante, Rafael Ciro Marques; Rodrigues Bomfim, Rangel; Grespan, Renata; Santana Rodrigues, Lorranny; Dos Santos, Danillo Menezes; de Sá Resende, Ayane; de Lima Silva, Nathanielly; da Silva Santos, Anna Clara Ramos; Dantas Araújo, Jéssica Maria; de Souza, Mércia Feitosa; de Oliveira Góes, Marco Aurélio; Santana Santos, Victor; Martins-Filho, Paulo Ricardo",Epidemiol Infect,,230

Participants (n = 25) were adults, with overweight/obesity and elevated BP, and performed seated desk work for 7.5 h. BP and PWV were measured in seated and supine postures at baseline (7:15 a.m.), midday (12:05 p.m.), and afternoon (4:45 p.m.). Generalized linear mixed models evaluated the effects of prolonged sitting on BP and PWV within each posture and interactions by posture and sex. In the recommended postures, seated BP and supine carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and carotid-ankle pulse wave velocity (caPWV), but not carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV), significantly increased over the simulated seated workday (all p < 0.05; effect sizes [d] ranged from 0.25 to 0.44). Whilst no posture-by-time interactions were observed (p > 0.05), BP, caPWV, and crPWV were higher when seated versus supine (main effects of posture p < 0.05; d ranged from 0.30 to 1.04). Exploratory analysis revealed that females had greater seated BP responses (p for interaction <0.05); seated PWV and supine BP and PWV responses were similar by sex (p for interaction >0.05). A simulated workday of prolonged sitting increased seated BP and supine cfPWV and caPWV, and posture minimally influenced these responses. These results add to the evidence suggesting a deleterious effect of prolonged sitting on cardiovascular health.","Alansare, Abdullah Bandar; Kowalsky, Robert J; Jones, Melissa A; Perdomo, Sophy J; Stoner, Lee; Gibbs, Bethany Barone",J Vasc Res,,230
236936,Pulmonary Fibrosis After COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak has manifested into a major public health concern across the globe, affecting particularly the most vulnerable population groups. Currently, there are various clinical trials being conducted to develop effective treatments. It is estimated that it could take one or more years before these drugs pass all safety tests and concrete results with regard to their effectiveness become available. In addition, despite the recent development of vaccines (licensed for use under conditional licenses) and the commencement of COVID-19 vaccination programs in several countries, there is still a need for safe and novel strategies that may reduce the symptomatology and/or prevent the severe complications associated with COVID-19. Natural compounds previously shown to have antiviral potential should be thoroughly considered and investigated for use in prophylactic treatment of COVID-19 due to their availability and safety. RECENT FINDINGS: The current narrative review investigates whether there is evidence in the literature that supplementation with dietary minerals and vitamins may have a role in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 or in reducing COVID-19 symptomatology and disease progression. The current evidence from the literature supports that zinc and vitamin C have a potential in reducing the inflammatory response associated with SARS-CoV-2 while folate and vitamin D may have a role in antagonizing the entry of SARs-CoV-2 virus in host calls. Thus, further research should be conducted that could lead to the development of nutritional supplements involving natural and widely available compounds such as zinc, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin D. The latter could be an effective, safe, and inexpensive way to either prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or lessen the burden of COVID-19 disease.","Pinnawala, Nathan Ushmantha; Thrastardottir, Tinna Osk; Constantinou, Constantina",Curr. nutr. rep,,230

This paper applies a mixed-method approach to map the post-COVID-19 SDGs targets on a fuzzy action priority surface at the country level in Iran, as a developing country, by taking the following four main steps: (1) using a modified Delphi method to make a list of the SDGs targets influenced by COVID-19; (2) using the best-worst method, as a multi-criteria decision-making tool, to weight the COVID-19 effects on the SDGs targets achievement; also (3) to weight the impact of the SDGs targets on the sustainable development implementation; and finally (4) designing a fuzzy inference system to calculate the action priority scores of the SDGs targets. As a result, reduction of poor people proportion by half (SDG 1.2), development-oriented policies for supporting creativity and job creation (SDG 8.3), end the pandemics and other epidemics (SDG 3.3), reduction of deaths and economic loss caused by disasters (SDG 11.5), and financial support for small-scale enterprises (SDG 9.3) were identified as the highest priorities for action, respectively, in the recovery agenda for sustainable development post COVID-19. The provided fuzzy action priority surface supports the UN's SDGs achievement and implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Iran. It also serves as a guideline to help the government, stakeholders, and policy-makers better analyze the long-term effects of the pandemic on the SDGs and their associated targets and mitigate its adverse economic, social, and environmental consequences.","Ranjbari, Meisam; Shams Esfandabadi, Zahra; Scagnelli, Simone Domenico; Siebers, Peer-Olaf; Quatraro, Francesco",Environ Dev Sustain,,230

While the country-level scale of emissions changes can be estimated in near real time, the more detailed, gridded emissions estimates that are required to run general circulation models (GCMs) of the climate will take longer to collect. In this paper we use recorded and projected country-and-sector activity levels to modify gridded predictions from the MESSAGE-GLOBIOM SSP2-4.5 scenario. We provide updated projections for concentrations of greenhouse gases, emissions fields for aerosols, and precursors and the ozone and optical properties that result from this. The code base to perform similar modifications to other scenarios is also provided.We outline the means by which these results may be used in a model intercomparison project (CovidMIP) to investigate the impact of national lockdown measures on climate, including regional temperature, precipitation, and circulation changes. This includes three strands: an assessment of short-term effects (5-year period) and of longer-term effects (30 years) and an investigation into the separate effects of changes in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. This last strand supports the possible attribution of observed changes in the climate system;hence these simulations will also form part of the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP).","Lamboll, Robin D.; Jones, Chris D.; Skeie, Ragnhild B.; Fiedler, Stephanie Samset Bjørn H.; Gillett, Nathan P.; Rogelj, Joeri Forster Piers M.",Geoscientific Model Development,,230

Since patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) often exhibit motor disability and receive disease-modifying therapy (DMT), which has an immunosuppressive effect, it is plausible that this will affect the susceptibility of MS patients to COVID-19, as well as the course of this disease. However, current data indicate that the use of DMT does not cause negative prognosis in COVID-19 sufferers, but the motor disability progression associated with MS does. In this study, we present the case reports of 4 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, who developed COVID-19, and despite the use of DMT the course of the disease was mild. Two patients were treated with dimethyl fumarate, one with Interferon ß1b and one with glatiramer acetate. One of the patients using dimethyl fumarate had lymphopenia. All patients had symptoms of COVID-19 from the nervous system, the most frequent being headache, which occurred in all patients. The aim of this article is to present a case series of four patients with MS and COVID-19, and to discuss the available literature on COVID-19 in patients with MS, with particular consideration of the impact of DMT.","Adamczyk-Sowa, Monika; Mado, Hubert; Kubicka-Baczyk, Katarzyna; Jaroszewicz, Jerzy; Sobala-Szczygiel, Barbara; Bartman, Wojciech; Sowa, Pawel",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,230

The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a management tool for continuous improvement of a business's products or processes. It can be applied to standardize nursing management and thus improve the nursing quality and increase the survival rate of patients. This study assessed the value of the PDCA cycle in standardizing nursing management in an intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: The status quo of the ICU was analyzed, and the relevant issues and countermeasures were proposed. The PDCA cycle was applied to standardize the nursing management in the ICU. RESULTS: Nine measures were proposed and applied to improve the management of the COVID-19 ICU: defining the clean or contaminated areas, use of self-designed shoe storage cabinets, defining staff roles and responsibilities, establishing the staffing structure, staff training, placing items at fixed locations, improving shift handover, use of bulletin boards for listing key points, and use of reserved drugs cabinets. The virus contamination awareness, professional skills, awareness of duties and responsibilities, and quality and performance of nursing were remarkably improved 2 weeks after the implementation of the above countermeasures. CONCLUSIONS: The PDCA cycle helps to standardize nursing management in COVID-19 ICU by developing and applying effective nursing management approaches.","Chen, Yihong; Zheng, Jili; Wu, Dingyun; Zhang, Yuxia; Lin, Ying",Ann Palliat Med,,230

We aimed to conduct a rapid review of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Methods: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and preprint articles up to March 2020. We included studies relevant to transmission through milk and respiratory droplets during breastfeeding of mothers with COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Results: A total of 4,481 records were identified in our literature search. Six studies (five case reports and one case series) involving 58 mothers (16 mothers with COVID-19, 42 mothers with influenza) and their infants proved eligible. Five case reports showed that the viral nucleic acid tests for all thirteen collected samples of breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 were negative. A case series of 42 influenza infected postpartum mothers taking precautions (hand hygiene and wearing masks) before breastfeeding showed that no neonates were infected with influenza during one-month of follow-up. Conclusions: The current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid has not been detected in breast milk. The benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants. Mothers with COVID-19 should take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of transmission via droplets and close contact during breastfeeding.","Yang, Nan; Che, Siyi; Zhang, Jingyi; Wang, Xia; Tang, Yuyi; Wang, Jianjian; Huang, Liping; Wang, Chenglin; Zhang, Hairong; Baskota, Muna; Ma, Yanfang; Zhou, Qi; Luo, Xufei; Yang, Shu; Feng, Xixi; Li, Weiguo; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong",Ann.

242125,Acute Stroke Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Does Confinement Impact Eligibility for Endovascular Therapy?,2020,"This paper presents a multivariate functional data statistical approach, for spatiotemporal prediction of COVID-19 mortality counts. Specifically, spatial heterogeneous nonlinear parametric functional regression trend model fitting is first implemented. Classical and Bayesian infinite-dimensional log-Gaussian linear residual correlation analysis is then applied. The nonlinear regression predictor of the mortality risk is combined with the plug-in predictor of the multiplicative error term. An empirical model ranking, based on random K-fold validation, is established for COVID-19 mortality risk forecasting and assessment, involving Machine Learning (ML) models, and the adopted Classical and Bayesian semilinear estimation approach. This empirical analysis also determines the ML models favored by the spatial multivariate Functional Data Analysis (FDA) framework. The results could be extrapolated to other countries.","Torres-Signes, A.; Fr'ias, M. P.; Ruiz-Medina, M. D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06344v1.pdf,230

The secondary aim was to investigate demographic and medical factors associated with the recorded outcomes. METHODS: The present study included individuals treated with HSCT and previously referred to physical therapy. The data were collected by interviews with the participants on the phone. Supportive care needs were assessed using the Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form 29TR. Compliance with the exercise program was recorded as the number of patients regularly performed strengthening and stretching exercises and the ratio of the walking duration to the recommended duration. The European Cancer Research and Treatment Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cancer30 was used to assess the QOL. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-I and the Visual Analogue Scale were used to assess anxiety level. RESULTS: The present study included 101 individuals treated with HSCT. The psychological and physical supportive care needs were predominant in participants. Compliance with exercise program was low. General anxiety level was low, yet anxiety about COVID-19 was moderate level in participants. Supportive care needs were related to female gender, performance level, time since HSCT, and QOL level (p Ë 0.05). Anxiety level was correlated with supportive care needs, COVID-19-related anxiety, and QOL (p Ë 0.05). Compliance with exercise program was associated with age, performance level, and QOL (p Ë 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results offer that supportive telehealth interventions should be considered during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals treated with HSCT to decrease unmet supportive care needs and isolation-related physical inactivity.","Yildiz Kabak, Vesile; Atasavun Uysal, Songul; Duger, Tulin",Support. care cancer,,230

OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to describe a possible solution to address weak surveillance systems and document the outcomes of the deployment of the Auto-Visual Acute Flaccid Paralysis Detection and Reporting (AVADAR) project. METHODS: This intervention was implemented in 99 targeted high-risk districts with concerns for silent polio circulation from eight countries in Africa between August 1, 2017, and July 31, 2018. A total of 6954 persons (5390 community informants and 1564 health workers) were trained and equipped with a smartphone on which the AVADAR app was configured to allow community informants to send alerts on suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and allow health worker to use electronic checklists for investigation of such alerts. The AVADAR and Open Data Kit ONA servers were at the center of the entire process. A dashboard system and coordination teams for monitoring and supervision were put in place at all levels. RESULTS: Overall, 96.44% (24,142/25,032) of potential AFP case alerts were investigated by surveillance personnel, yielding 1414 true AFP cases. This number (n=1414) reported through AVADAR was higher than the 238 AFP cases expected during the study period in the AVADAR districts and the 491 true AFP cases reported by the traditional surveillance system. A total of 203 out of the 1414 true AFP cases reported were from special population settings, such as refugee camps and insecure areas. There was an improvement in reporting in silent health areas in all the countries using the AVADAR system. Finally, there were 23,473 reports for other diseases, such as measles, diarrhea, and cerebrospinal meningitis, using the AVADAR platform. CONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates the added value of AVADAR to rapidly improve surveillance sensitivity. AVADAR is capable of supporting countries to improve surveillance sensitivity within a short interval before and beyond polio-free certification.","Ticha, Johnson Muluh; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Paige, Lara Mf; Senouci, Kamel; Stein, Andrew; Briand, Patrick; Tuma, Jude; Oyaole, Daniel Rasheed; Ngofa, Reuben; Maleghemi, Sylvester; Touray, Kebba; Salihu, Abdullahi Ahmed; Diallo, Mamadou; Tegegne, Sisay Gashu; Bello, Isah Mohammed; Idris, Umar Kabo; Maduka, Omosivie; Manengu, Casimir; Shuaib, Faisal; Galway, Michael; Mkanda, Pascal",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,230

Group testing strategies to increase capacity facilitate mass population testing but do not prioritize turnaround time, an important consideration for HCW screening. We propose a nonadaptive combinatorial (NAC) group testing strategy to increase throughput while facilitating rapid turnaround. NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350, and 250. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1% to 10%. NAC matrices were compared versus Dorfman sequential (DS) group testing approaches. NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels, with an average of 97% of samples resolved after a single round of testing via the n = 700 matrix at a prevalence of 1%. In simulations of low to medium (0.1% to 3%) prevalence, all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%), the DS matrix was marginally superior, although both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximizes the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs. This methodology may allow laboratories to adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy.","McDermott, John H; Stoddard, Duncan; Woolf, Peter J; Ellingford, Jamie M; Gokhale, David; Taylor, Algy; Demain, Leigh A M; Newman, William G; Black, Graeme",J. mol. diagn,,230

247746,Infections as Novel Risk Factors of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases: Pathophysiological Links and Therapeutic Implications,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Initially, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was considered primarily a respiratory pathogen. However, with time it has behaved as a virus with the potential to cause multi-system involvement, including neurological manifestations. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) has increasingly been reported in association with coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we have shed light upon CVT and its possible mechanisms in the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this review, data were collected from PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, until March 30, 2021, using pre-specified searching strategies. The search strategy consisted of a variation of keywords of relevant medical subject headings and keywords, including ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""coronavirus"", and ""cerebral venous sinus thrombosis"". RESULTS: COVID-19 has a causal association with a plethora of neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychological effects. CVT has gained particular importance in this regard. The known hypercoagulable state in SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be the main mechanism in COVID-19 related CVT. Other plausible mechanisms may include vascular endothelial dysfunction and altered flow dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no specific clinical characteristics, insidious or acute onset headache, seizures, stroke-like, or encephalopathy symptoms in a patient with, or who has suffered COVID-19, should prompt the attending physician to investigate for CVT. The treatment of COVID-19 associated CVT does not differ radically from the therapy of CVT without the infection, i.e. urgent initiation of parenteral unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by conventional or mostly newer oral anticoagulants.","Ghosh, Ritwik; Roy, Dipayan; Mandal, Arpan; Pal, Shyamal Kanti; Chandra Swaika, Bikash; Naga, Dinabandhu; Pandit, Alak; Ray, Biman Kanti; Benito-León, Julián",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,230

248228,Exaggerated information and COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Gene regulatory network inference is essential to uncover complex relationships among gene pathways and inform downstream experiments, ultimately enabling regulatory network re-engineering. Network inference from transcriptional time-series data requires accurate, interpretable, and efficient determination of causal relationships among thousands of genes. Here, we develop Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series (BETS), a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time-series data. BETS uses elastic net regression and stability selection from bootstrapped samples to infer causal relationships among genes. BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance and additionally infers whether causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time-series data of differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2768 genes and 31,945 directed edges (FDR &#8804; 0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: Overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project. BETS is available as an open source software package at https://github.com/lujonathanh/BETS.","Lu, Jonathan; Dumitrascu, Bianca; McDowell, Ian C; Jo, Brian; Barrera, Alejandro; Hong, Linda K; Leichter, Sarah M; Reddy, Timothy E; Engelhardt, Barbara E",PLoS Comput Biol,,230
248958,Cardiovascular diseases burden in COVID-19: About a Moroccan experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: Quarantine with social distancing has reduced transmission of COVID-19; however, fear of the disease and these remedial measures cause anxiety and stress. It is not known whether these events have impacted the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and disorders of brain-gut interaction (DGBI). METHODS: An online platform evaluated the prevalence of GI symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection utilized validated questionnaires and was fully anonymized. Findings were compared with identical data acquired in 2019. The association of results with stress and anxiety was analyzed. RESULTS: Data were collected from 1896 subjects May - August 2019 to 980 non-identical subjects May - June 2020. GI symptoms were reported by 68.9% during the COVID-19 lockdown compared with 56.0% the previous year (p < 0.001). The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (26.3% vs. 20.0%; p < 0.001), functional dyspepsia (18.3% vs. 12.7%; p < 0.001), heartburn (31.7% vs. 26.2%, p = 0.002), and self-reported milk intolerance (43.5% vs. 37.8% p = 0.004) was higher during the pandemic. Many individuals reported multiple symptoms. Anxiety was associated with presence of all GI symptoms. High levels of stress impacted functional dyspepsia (p = 0.045) and abdominal pain (p = 0.013). The presence of DGBI (p < 0.001; OR 22.99), self-reported milk intolerance (p < 0.001; OR 2.50), and anxiety (p < 0.001; OR 2.18) was independently associated with increased GI symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of GI symptoms was significantly higher during the COVID-19 lockdown than under normal circumstances the previous year. This increase was attributable to increased numbers of patients with DGBI, an effect that was associated with anxiety.","Nakov, Radislav; Dimitrova-Yurukova, Desislava; Snegarova, Violeta; Nakov, Ventsislav; Fox, Mark; Heinrich, Henriette",Neurogastroenterol Motil,,230

Although cells share numerous autoAgs, each cell type gives rise to unique COVID-altered autoAg candidates, which may explain the wide range of symptoms experienced by patients with autoimmune sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the unifying property of affinity between autoantigens (autoAgs) and the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS), this paper reports 140 candidate autoAgs identified from proteome extracts of human Jurkat T-cells, of which at least 105 (75%) are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with currently available multi-omic COVID-19 data shows that 125 (89%) of DS-affinity proteins are altered at protein and/or RNA levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells or patients, with at least 94 being known autoAgs in a wide spectrum of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Protein alterations by ubiquitination and phosphorylation in the viral infection are major contributors of autoAgs. The autoAg protein network is significantly associated with cellular response to stress, apoptosis, RNA metabolism, mRNA processing and translation, protein folding and processing, chromosome organization, cell cycle, and muscle contraction. The autoAgs include clusters of histones, CCT/TriC chaperonin, DNA replication licensing factors, proteasome and ribosome proteins, heat shock proteins, serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, 14-3-3 proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. AutoAgs such as LCP1 and NACA that are altered in the T cells of COVID patients may provide insight into T-cell responses in the viral infection and merit further study. The autoantigen-ome from this study contributes to a comprehensive molecular map for investigating acute, subacute, and chronic autoimmune disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Wang, Julia Y.; Zhang, Wei; Roehrl, Michael W.; Roehrl, Victor B.; Roehrl, Michael H.",,,230

In this paper, impacts on transit operations of the physical distancing measures deployed to slow the spread of the virus are analyzed and recommendations are provided. At first, two social distancing optimization solutions are provided in order to keep riders at a safe distance. The first is a discrete optimization that can be used in buses with fixed seats, while the second is a continuous optimization that can be used to distribute riders on a grid and be applied on a bus or subway platform. Assuming that the ridership will eventually go back to its level before the pandemic, the second objective of this research is to address the transit operation parameters that need to be changed in order to serve the pre-COVID ridership level, while respecting the social distancing measures. An O-D distribution has been developed in this paper for New York City (NYC) subway line 1, based on the 2018 NYC Travel Survey conducted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Five scenarios of physical distancing are simulated and analyzed in this paper: 3ft, 4ft, 5ft, 5.4ft, and 6ft of separation between passengers. The results show the number of additional trains required to accommodate the hypothetical pre-COVID ridership demand while maintaining social distancing. An interesting key finding is that, by decreasing the minimum distance from 6ft to 5.4ft, the number of additional trains required to serve the transit demand drastically decreases and hence more resources are saved.","Kamga, Camille Tchamna Rodrigue Vicuna Patricio Mudigonda Sandeep Moghimi Bahman",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,,230

Methods: The data were collected from the various electronic databases like Google scholar, Springel publication, Journal of travel medicine,WHO guidelines, etc. Result: This review indicated that lapses of various countries like China, Iran, Italy, Spain etc.That caused the spread of this coronavirus and how India worked strategically on the desire to actively pre-empt not only prevent. Conclusion: The study concludes the various mistakes that China and Italy made are most leading cause of worldwide spread of this crisis. The big mistake of Europe and US is that people aren't wearing the masks, since masks prevent the droplets that carry infectious virus from infecting others. The other major mistake in US was limited lockdowns which made it worse, since the coronavirus transmits so silently, due to which the total actual scale of problem was not able to be captured, and people moved to less restricted part of the US and they have unknowingly taken the virus with them. Early preventive measures would have prevented this outbreak. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

253009,"SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 status in HIV-positive patients: A systematic review",2021,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to ascertain the trends of injury mortality during the COVID-19 period in southern China. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective analysis to compare the mortality changes of all-cause injury and transport injuries, poisoning, falls, fire/heat/hot substances, drowning, self-harm and interpersonal violence, which were further stratified by sex and age. Comparisons were made between the COVID-19 period (between January 2020 and June 2020) and control period (between January 2019 and June 2019) in Guangdong province. We used the negative binomial models to explore the associations of deaths during the COVID-19 period, according to the different sex and age strata. RESULTS: The all-cause injury mortality in Guangdong province decreased significantly from 28.65 per 100 000 population during the control period to 23.24 per 100 000 population during COVID-19 pandemic period. Similar results were found in specific injury categories. Mortality of self-harm increased by 139.26% in the 10-14 year group during the COVID-19 period as compared with the control period. Although mortality changes in some groups were not statistically significant, some increases were noteworthy during the COVID-19 period (ie, self-harm, transport injury and falls) in the 70-79 year group. The corresponding increase in mortality rate was 16.83%, 3.32% and 4.92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality of all-cause injury, transport injury and drowning during the COVID-19 pandemic was consistently decreased. However, the increase in mortality associated with falls, fire/heat/hot substance injury and self-harm in specific age populations warrant the targeted control and prevention measures for the population at risk.","Zheng, Xue-Yan; Tang, Si-Li; Ma, Shu-Li; Guan, Wei-Jie; Xu, Xiaojun; Xu, Haofeng; Xu, Ying-Shan; Xu, Yan-Jun; Lin, Li-Feng",BMJ Open,,230

253614,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology Divisions in Italy: A national survey,2020,"Background: Currently, the number of patients with SARS-COV-2 infection has increased rapidly in Iran, but the risk and mortality of SARS-COV-2 infection in Iranian patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) still not clear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 in these patients. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, SciELO, and other databases to identify all relevant studies published up to 10 January, 2020. The proportion and mortality in the patients were assessed by odd ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Results: A total of ten case-series including 11,755 cases with SARS-COV-2 infection and 942 deaths were selected. Among them, there were total of 791 DM patients with 186 deaths, 225 CKD patients with 45 deaths, 790 hypertension cases with 86 deaths, and 471 CVDs cases with 60 deaths. Pooled data revealed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in the patients with hypertension, DM, CVDs and CKD were 21.1 %, 16.3 %, 14.0 % and 5.0 %, respectively. Moreover, the SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with an increased risk of mortality in DM (OR = 0.549, CI 95 % 0.448-0.671, p &#8804; 0.001) and CKD (OR = 0.552, 95 % CI 0.367-0.829, p = 0.004) patients, but not hypertension and CVDs. There was no publication bias. Conclusions: Our pooled data showed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection was the highest in the Iranian patients with hypertension (21.1 %) followed by DM (16.3 %), CVDs (14.0 %) and CKD (5.0 %). Moreover, DM and CKD in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with a 0.549 and 0.552-fold increase in mortality, respectively. Clinicians in Iran should be aware of these findings, to identifying patients at higher risk and inform interventions to reduce the risk of death. Moreover, well-designed, large-scale and multicenter studies are needed to improve and validate our findings.","Mirjalili, Hamid; Dastgheib, Seyed Alireza; Shaker, Seyed Hossein; Bahrami, Reza; Mazaheri, Mahta; Sadr-Bafghi, Seyed Mohamad Hossein; Sadeghizadeh-Yazdi, Jalal; Neamatzadeh, Hossein",J Diabetes Metab Disord,,230

254451,"Prognostic value of baseline clinical and HRCT findings in 101 patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, with considerable public health and socio-economic impacts that are seriously affecting health and safety of workers, as well as their employment stability. Italy was the first of many other western countries to implement extended containment measures. Health workers and others employed in essential sectors have continued their activity, reporting high infection rate with many fatalities. The epidemiological trend highlighted the importance of work as a substantial factor to consider both when implementing strategies aimed at containing the pandemic and shaping the lockdown mitigation strategy required for sustained economic recovery. To support the decision-making process, we have developed a strategy to predict the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace based on the analysis of the working process and proximity between employees; risk of infection connected to the type of activity; involvement of third parties in the working processes and risk of social aggregation. We applied this approach to outline a risk index for each economic activity sector, with different levels of detail, also considering the impact on mobility of the working population. This method was implemented into the national epidemiological surveillance model in order to estimate the impact of re-activation of specific activities on the reproduction number. It has also been adopted by the national scientific committee set up by the Italian Government for action-oriented policy advice on the COVID-19 emergency in the post lockdown phase. This approach may play a key role for public health if associated with measures for risk mitigation in enterprises through strategies of business process re-engineering. Furthermore, it will make a contribution to reconsidering the organization of work, including also innovation and fostering the integration with the national occupational safety and health (OSH) system.","Iavicoli, Sergio; Boccuni, Fabio; Buresti, Giuliana; Gagliardi, Diana; Persechino, Benedetta; Valenti, Antonio; Rondinone, Bruna Maria",PLoS One,,230
254484,"Short-term developmental outcomes in neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 from Wuhan, China",2021,"CONTEXT: Systematic data on the care of people dying with COVID-19 are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To understand the response of and challenges faced by palliative care services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify associated factors. METHODS: We surveyed palliative care and hospice services, contacted via relevant organizations. Multivariable logistic regression identified associations with challenges. Content analysis explored free text responses. RESULTS: A total of 458 services responded; 277 UK, 85 rest of Europe, 95 rest of the world; 81% cared for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, 77% had staff with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; 48% reported shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 40% staff shortages, 24% medicines shortages, 14% shortages of other equipment. Services provided direct care and education in symptom management and communication; 91% changed how they worked. Care often shifted to increased community and hospital care, with fewer admissions to inpatient palliative care units. Factors associated with increased odds of PPE shortages were: charity rather than public management (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.81-5.20), inpatient palliative care unit rather than other settings (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.46-3.75). Being outside the UK was associated with lower odds of staff shortages (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.76). Staff described increased workload, concerns for their colleagues who were ill, whilst expending time struggling to get essential equipment and medicines, perceiving they were not a front-line service. CONCLUSION: Palliative care services were often overwhelmed, yet felt ignored in the COVID-19 response. Palliative care needs better integration with health care systems when planning and responding to future epidemics/pandemics.","Oluyase, Adejoke O; Hocaoglu, Mevhibe; Cripps, Rachel L; Maddocks, Matthew; Walshe, Catherine; Fraser, Lorna K; Preston, Nancy; Dunleavy, Lesley; Bradshaw, Andy; Murtagh, Fliss E M; Bajwah, Sabrina; Sleeman, Katherine E; Higginson, Irene J",J. pain symptom manage,,230
254560,Resuming liver transplantation amid the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The striking difference in severity of SARS CoV2 infection among global population is partly attributed to viral factors. With the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) are the most immunogenic subunits, genetic diversity and antigenicity of S and N are key players in virulence and in vaccine development. AIM: This paper aims at identifying immunogenic targets for better vaccine development and/or immunotherapy of COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS: 18 complete genomes of SARS CoV2 (n=14), SARS CoV (n=2) and MERS CoV (n=2) were examined. Bioinformatics of viral genetics and protein folding allowed functional tuning of NH2 Terminal Domain (NTD) of S protein and development of epitope maps for B and T cell responses. CONCLUSION: A deletion of amino acid residues Y144 and G107 were discovered in NTD of S protein derived from Indian and French isolates resulting in altered pocket structure exclusively located in NTD and reduced affinity of NTD binding to endogenous nAbs and disrupted NTD mediated cell entry. We therefore, proposed a set of B and T cell epitopes based on Immune Epitope Database, homologous epitopes for nAbs in convalescent plasma post SARS CoV infection and functional domains of S (NTD, Receptor Binding domain and the unique polybasic Furin cleavage site at S1/S2 junction). Nevertheless, laboratory data are required to develop vaccine and immunotherapeutics.","Dawood, Reham M; El-Meguid, Mai A; Salum, Ghada M; El-Wakeel, Khaled; Shemis, Mohamed; El Awady, Mostafa K",J Infect Public Health,,230

The situation is affecting not only uro-oncological patients but also patients with benign and disabling conditions who are suffering delays in medical attention that impact their quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To propose, based on expert advice and current evidence where available, a strategy to reorganize female and functional urological (FFU) activity (diagnosis and treatment). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The present document is based on a narrative review of the limited data available in the urological literature on SARS-Cov-2 and the experience of FFU experts from several countries around the world. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: In all the treatment schemes proposed in the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic, FFU surgery is not adequately covered and usually grouped into the category that is not urgent or can be delayed, but in a sustained pandemic scenario there are cases that cannot be delayed that should be considered for surgery as a priority. The aim of this document is to provide a detailed management plan for noninvasive and invasive FFU consultations, investigations, and operations. A classification of FFU surgical activity by indication and urgency is proposed, as well as recommendations adopted from the literature for good surgical practice and by surgical approach in FFU in the COVID-19 era. CONCLUSIONS: Functional, benign, and pelvic floor conditions have often been considered suitable for delay in challenging times. The long-term implications of this reduction in functional urology clinical activity are currently unknown. This document will help functional urology departments to reorganize their activity to best serve their patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: Many patients will suffer delays in urology treatment because of COVID-19, with consequent impairment of their physical and psychological health and deterioration of their quality of life. Efforts should be made to minimize the burden for this patient group, without endangering patients and health care workers.","López-Fando, Luis; Bueno, Paulina; Carracedo, David; Averbeck, Marcio; Castro-Díaz, David M; Chartier-Kastler, Emmanuel; Cruz, Francisco; Dmochowski, Roger; Finazzi-Agrò, Enrico; Hajebrahimi, Sakineh; Heesakkers, John; Kasyan, George; Tarcan, Tufan; Peyronnet, Benoit; Plata, Mauricio; Padilla-Fernández, Bárbara; Van Der Aa, Frank; Arlandis, Salvador; Hashim, Hashim",Eur Urol Focus,,230

However, the pathophysiology, extent of myocardial injury and clinical significance remains unclear. METHODS: COVID-HEART is a UK, multicentre, prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and elevated troponin (sex-specific > 99th centile). Baseline assessment will be whilst recovering in-hospital or recently discharged, and include cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, quality of life (QoL) assessments, electrocardiogram (ECG), serum biomarkers and genetics. Assessment at 6-months includes repeat CMR, QoL assessments and 6-min walk test (6MWT). The CMR protocol includes cine imaging, T1/T2 mapping, aortic distensibility, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and adenosine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in selected patients. The main objectives of the study are to: (1) characterise the extent and nature of myocardial involvement in COVID-19 patients with an elevated troponin, (2) assess how cardiac involvement and clinical outcome associate with recognised risk factors for mortality (age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities) and genetic factors, (3) evaluate if differences in myocardial recovery at 6 months are dependent on demographics, genetics and comorbidities, (4) understand the impact of recovery status at 6 months on patient-reported QoL and functional capacity. DISCUSSION: COVID-HEART will provide detailed characterisation of cardiac involvement, and its repair and recovery in relation to comorbidity, genetics, patient-reported QoL measures and functional capacity.

Although SARS-CoV-2 causes primarily respiratory problems, concurrent cardiac injury cannot be ignored since it may be an independent predictor for adverse outcomes. Cardiac arrhythmias are often observed in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe cases, and more likely contribute to the high risk of adverse outcomes. Arrhythmias should be regarded as one of the main complications of COVID-19. Mechanistically, a number of ion channels can be adversely affected in COVID-19, leading to alterations in cardiac conduction and/or repolarization properties, as well as calcium handling, which can predispose to cardiac arrhythmogenesis. In addition, several antimicrobials that are currently used as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have uncertain benefit, and yet may induce electrocardiographic QT prolongation with potential ventricular pro-arrhythmic effects. Continuous electrocardiogram monitoring, accurate and prompt recognition of arrhythmias are important. The present review focuses on cardiac arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19, its underlying mechanisms, and proposed preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Wang, Yueying; Wang, Zhaojia; Tse, Gary; Zhang, Lin; Wan, Elaine Y.; Guo, Yutao; Lip, Gregory Y.

258705,Racial Disparities in Ischemic Stroke among Patients with COVID-19 in the United States,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Recently, two influential articles that reported the association of (hydroxy)chloroquine or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality were retracted due to significant methodological issues. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers. RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and relevant cohort studies, we found out that (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Lee, K H; Kim, J S; Hong, S H; Seong, D; Choi, Y R; Ahn, Y T; Kim, K S; Kim, S E; Lee, S; Sim, W; Kim, D; Jun, B; Yang, J W; Yon, D K; Lee, S W; Kim, M S; Dragioti, E; Li, H; Jacob, L; Koyanagi, A; Abou Ghayda, R; Shin, J I; Smith, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,230

COVID-19 spread rapidly affecting over 30 million worldwide. To manage trauma presentations the Department of Trauma & Orthopaedic Surgery reorganised service delivery. AIM: To assess the impact of service reorganisation and Virtual Clinics on patients in a Regional Unit in Ireland. METHODS: A retrospective review of trauma activity following introduction of Virtual Fracture Clinics and Theatre COVID Pathways for a 10 week period in comparison with the same 2019 period. All patients underwent both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs PCR testing prior to operations. Theatre and outpatient activity were evaluated. Clinic data were accumulated using the Integrated Patient Management System. RESULTS: Theatre Activity: 242 patients underwent surgery in our trauma unit (mean 2.98 per list) during the COVID- 19 period. 29 cases were performed in repurposed elective hospital giving a total of 271 during the 2020 study period. 371 cases were performed in the same 2019 period (mean 4.58 per list). Outpatient Activity: We noted a 25.86% fracture clinic referral reduction during the COVID 19 period compared to 2019. There was a 150.77% increase in patients managed through Trauma Assessment Clinic. 639 patients were managed through the Virtual Fracture Clinic Pathway during COVID 19 period. CONCLUSIONS: Over one in four fracture clinic patients can be managed virtually. A new dedicated Acute Fracture Unit within our institution permitted streamlining of care and social distancing. The ""Non-COVID"" pathway for ambulatory trauma was essential in managing the growing presentations of these injuries.","Stanley, Ciaran; Kelly, Martin; Elzaki, Mohamed; Butler, Audrey; Condon, Finbarr; Lenehan, Brian",Surg.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 88 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized due to symptomatic pneumonia between April 15 2020 and August 15 2020. The patients were divided into two groups as survived patients and non-survived patients. Both groups were compared according to demographic features, comorbid conditions and measurement of the PTX-3 and other laboratory parameters of the patients. RESULTS: Of 88 patients with COVID-19, 59 (67%) were discharged with complete cure and 29 (33%) resulted in death. 46 (52.3%) of the patients were men. PTX-3 median value [IQR] was 3.66 ng/mL (0.9-27.9) in all patients, 3.3 ng/mL (0.9-27.9) in survivors and 3.91 ng/mL (1.9-23.2) in non-survivors which was significantly higher (p= 0.045). As a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis the cut-off value of PTX-3 for predicting mortality in patients was 3.73 with 65% sensitivity and 65% specificity (AUC: 0.646, 95% CI: 0.525-0.767, P= 0.045). Also, we found significant cut-off values with respect to D-Dimer, D-Dimer/ PTX-3, high-sensitivity troponin, high-sensitivity troponin/ PTX-3, lymphocyte, PTX-3/ lymphocyte, procalcitonin, procalcitonin/ PTX-3, CRP, and CRP/ PTX-3 (P<0.05).

By pooling data from multiple parallel studies that are similar, we can increase the effective sample size and achieve enough statistical power to determine effectiveness more quickly through meta-analysis. A scoping review of registered clinical trials of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 was conducted to assess the feasibility of performing a rapid and timely meta-analysis that will support accelerated review for approval and implementation. ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched April 23, 2020. Trials were included if they utilized convalescent plasma to treat or prevent COVID-19. Forty-eight registered trials (projected to enroll more than 5000 subjects) of convalescent plasma were identified and included for analysis. The majority of studies (33 studies with 4440 projected enrolment) will address the treatment of severe and/or critical cases of COVID-19. Twenty-nine studies are controlled and 17 of these are reported as actively recruiting. The combined enrolment of patients from similar studies should be sufficient to determine meaningful improvements in mortality, rates of admission to intensive care and need for mechanical ventilation by the end of 2020-sooner than any individual study could determine effectiveness. Accessing supplemental outcome data from investigators may be needed; however, to align reporting of some outcomes from these studies. Heterogeneity in product potency due to different antibody titers is anticipated and studies using conventional treatment as controls instead of placebo may complicate our understanding of efficacy. Convalescent plasma is being tested in ongoing controlled studies, largely to treat severe and/or critical cases of COVID-19. Sufficient combined power to detect clinically important reductions in multiple outcomes, including mortality, is expected by September 2020.

However, questions have been raised about the role and reliability of models. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of combining probabilistic forecasts from multiple models for forecasts of incident and cumulative COVID mortalities. MethodsWe considered 95% interval and point forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative COVID-19 mortality between 16 May 2020 and 8 May 2021 in multiple locations in the United States. We compared the accuracy of simple and more complex combining methods, as well as individual models. ResultsThe average of the forecasts from the individual models was consistently more accurate than the average performance of these models, which provides a fundamental motivation for combining. Weighted combining performed well for both incident and cumulative mortalities, and for both interval and point forecasting. Inverse score with tuning was the most accurate method overall. The median combination was a leading method in the last quarter for both mortalities, and it was consistently more accurate than the mean combination for point forecasting of both mortalities. For interval forecasts of cumulative mortality, the mean performed better than the median. The leading individual models were most competitive for point forecasts of incident mortality. ConclusionsWe recommend that harnessing the wisdom of the crowd can improve the contribution of probabilistic forecasting of epidemics to health policy decision making and, when there are historical data on forecast accuracy, weighted combining provides the best method.","Taylor, Kathryn S; Taylor, James W",,,230

266243,[80-year-old patient with jaundice after a severe Covid-19 infection],2021,"BACKGROUND: The ability of transplant (Tx)-patients to generate a protective antiviral response under immunosuppression is pivotal in COVID-19 infection. However, analysis of immunity against SARS-COV-2 is currently lacking. METHODS: Here, we analyzed T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike-, membrane-, and nucleocapsid-protein by flow cytometry and spike-specific neutralizing antibodies in ten Tx in comparison to 26 nonimmunosuppressed (non-Tx) COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Tx-patients (seven renal, one lung, and two combined pancreas-kidney transplants) were recruited in this study during the acute phase of COVID-19 with a median time after SARS-CoV-2-positivity of 3 and 4 days for non-Tx- and Tx-patients, respectively. Despite immunosuppression, we detected antiviral CD4 T cell-response in 90% of Tx-patients. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells produced multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating their potential protective capacity. Neutralizing antibody-titers did not differ between groups. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells targeting membrane- and spike-protein were lower in Tx-patients, albeit without statistical significance. However, frequencies of anti-nucleocapsid-protein-reactive, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyfunctional CD8 T cells, were similar between patient cohorts. Tx-patients showed features of a prematurely aged adaptive immune system, but equal frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a polyfunctional T cell immunity directed against SARS-CoV-2-proteins as well as neutralizing antibodies can be generated in Tx-patients despite immunosuppression. In comparison to nonimmunosuppressed-patients, no differences in humoral and cellular antiviral-immunity were found. Our data presenting the ability to generate SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in immunosuppressed patients has implications for the handling of SARS-CoV-2-infected Tx patients and raises hopes for effective vaccination in this cohort.Supplemental Visual Abstract; http://links.lww.com/TP/C186.","Thieme, Constantin J; Anft, Moritz; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Blazquez-Navarro, Arturo; Doevelaar, Adrian; Seibert, Felix S; Hoelzer, Bodo; Konik, Margarethe Justine; Meister, Toni L; Pfaender, Stephanie; Steinmann, Eike; Berger, Marc Moritz; Brenner, Thorsten; Kölsch, Uwe; Dolff, Sebastian; Roch, Toralf; Witzke, Oliver; Schenker, Peter; Viebahn, Richard; Stervbo, Ulrik; Westhoff, Timm H; Babel, Nina",Transplantation,,230

267425,The Emerging Role of Telemedicine in Gastroenterology during the Covid-19 Pandemic: a Study on Its Feasibility and Patients' Trust,2021,"Recently, [8] has proposed that heterogeneity of infectiousness (and susceptibility) across individuals in infectious diseases, plays a major role in affecting the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT). Such heterogeneity has been observed in COVID-19 and is recognized as overdispersion (or""super-spreading""). The model of [8] suggests that super-spreaders contribute significantly to the effective reproduction factor, R, and that they are likely to get infected and immune early in the process. Consequently, under R_0 = 3 (attributed to COVID-19), the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) is as low as 5%, in contrast to 67% according to the traditional models [1, 2, 4, 10]. This work follows up on [8] and proposes that heterogeneity of infectiousness (susceptibility) has two""faces""whose mix affects dramatically the HIT: (1) Personal-Trait-, and (2) Event-Based- Infectiousness (Susceptibility). The former is a personal trait of specific individuals (super-spreaders) and is nullified once those individuals are immune (as in [8]). The latter is event-based (e.g cultural super-spreading events) and remains effective throughout the process, even after the super-spreaders immune. We extend [8]'s model to account for these two factors, analyze it and conclude that the HIT is very sensitive to the mix between (1) and (2), and under R_0 = 3 it can vary between 5% and 67%. Preliminary data from COVID-19 suggests that herd immunity is not reached at 5%. We address operational aspects and analyze the effects of lockdown strategies on the spread of a disease. We find that herd immunity (and HIT) is very sensitive to the lockdown type. While some lockdowns affect positively the disease blocking and increase herd immunity, others have adverse effects and reduce the herd immunity.","Tavori, Jhonatan; Levy, Hanoch",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09188v1.pdf,230

268408,Immunocytometric analysis of COVID patients: A contribution to personalized therapy?,2020,"Accurate forecasts for COVID-19 are necessary for better preparedness and resource management. Specifically, deciding the response over months or several months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder accurate long-term forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases. While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests need to be conducted for more reliable results. To identify the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take an epidemiology data-driven approach. We show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual cases as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension of our prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating unreported/asymptomatic cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated only from a certain time period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct an algorithm called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable bound on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this ratio and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our approaches to identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to reported cases for New York City and several US states. Our results demonstrate with high confidence that the actual number of cases cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times in Illinois, 38 times in Massachusetts and 29 times in New Jersey, than the reported cases.","Srivastava, Ajitesh; Prasanna, Viktor K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02127v4.pdf,230

As the natural history and variety of clinical presentations of this disease unfolds, extrapulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 have emerged, especially in the digestive system. While the respiratory mode of transmission is well known and is probably the principal mode of transmission of this disease, a possibility of the fecal-oral route of transmission has also emerged in various case series and clinical scenarios. In this review article, we summarize four different aspects in published studies to date: (a) gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19; (b) microbiological and virological investigations; (c) the role of fecal-oral transmission; and (d) prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the digestive endoscopy room. A timely understanding of the relationship between the disease and the digestive system and implementing effective preventive measures are of great importance for a favorable outcome of the disease and can help climnicians to mitigate further transmission by taking appropriate measures.","Li, Lian Yong; Wu, Wei; Chen, Sheng; Gu, Jian Wen; Li, Xin Lou; Song, Hai Jing; Du, Feng; Wang, Gang; Zhong, Chang Qing; Wang, Xiao Ying; Chen, Yan; Shah, Rushikesh; Yang, He Ming; Cai, Qiang",J Dig Dis,,230

METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted on 203 pregnant women between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, undergoing gestational diabetes screening test with 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT). Fasting serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured during the week after GCT assessment. Information on the participants' pre-pregnancy weight, demographic/reproductive characteristics, and height and blood pressure (BP) measurements were documented at baseline entry into the study. Metabolic syndrome was defined as the co-existence of 3 or more of the following criteria: Body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy &#8805; 30 kg/m2, BP &#8805; 130/85 mmHg, GCT &#8805; 140 mg/dl, TG &#8805; 150 mg/dl, and HDL-C &#8804; 50 mg/dl. All participants were followed through routine prenatal care, up to delivery. Any deliveries or rupture of membranes of less than 37 weeks of pregnancy were considered preterm delivery and PPROM, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS V.20, and p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: MetS was detected in 10 (4.9%) of participants. Logistic regression analysis showed HDL-C levels, and hypertension were associated with spontaneous preterm delivery [(OR 0.952, 95% CI 0.910-0.995), (OR 1.629, 95% CI 1.554-1.709) respectively], but no statistically significant results were found for PPROM. CONCLUSIONS: Low HDL-C levels and hypertension in mid-pregnancy are associated with the occurrence of spontaneous preterm deliveries, indicating that MetS and its components should be monitored more closely in pregnancy.","Niyaty, Shiva; Moghaddam-Banaem, Lida; Sourinejad, Hadis; Mokhlesi, Samira",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,230

The aim of this paper was to document policy decisions made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic from January to August 2020. We reviewed policy documents from the Public Health Institute of Malawi, the Malawi Gazette, the Malawi Ministry of Health and Population and the University of Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. We found that the Malawi response to the COVID-19 pandemic was multisectoral and implemented through 15 focused working groups termed clusters. Each cluster was charged with providing policy direction in their own area of focus. All clusters then fed into one central committee for major decisions and reporting to head of state. Key policies identified during the review include international travel ban, school closures at all levels, cancellation of public events, decongesting workplaces and public transport, and mandatory face coverings and a testing policy covering symptomatic people. Supportive interventions included risk communication and community engagement in multiple languages and over a variety of mediums, efforts to improve access to water, sanitation, nutrition and unconditional social-cash transfers for poor urban and rural households.","Mzumara, Grace W; Chawani, Marlen; Sakala, Melody; Mwandira, Lily; Phiri, Elias; Milanzi, Edith; Phiri, Mphatso Dennis; Kazanga, Isabel; O039,; Byrne, Thomasena; Zulu, Eliya M; Divala, Titus; Iroh Tam, Pui-Ying; Mitambo, Collins; Squire, Bertie",,,230

Can defibrotide have a role in the early phases of coagulation disorders?,2020,"Despite the fact that medical responses are crucial for saving precious lives during any humanitarian crisis (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), healthcare infrastructure in many communities are partially covered or are not covered yet. In order to strengthen the health system response to such crisis, especially in low- to middle-income communities, this paper extends a novel multi-objective model for designing a health service network under uncertainty which simultaneously considers efficiency, social responsibility, and network cost. For efficiency, a modified data envelopment analysis model is introduced and inserted into the proposed model to decrease the inefficiency of healthcare facilities belonging to the different tiers of the health system. For social responsibility, two measures of job creation and balanced development are incorporated into the extended model. This is not only considered to cope with the increased numbers of patients and disaster victims to healthcare facilities but also to deal with the challenge of the economy and the livelihoods of people during the crisis. Moreover, a novel mixed possibilistic-flexible robust programming (MPFRP) approach is developed to protect the considered network against uncertainty. To show the applicability of the extended model, a real-world case study is presented. The results reveal that contrary to fuzzy programming models, the MPFRP performs well in terms of social responsibility (72%), cost (8%), and efficiency (28%) and is able to make a trade-off between these three measures. In this study, the resilience level of the designed network is not addressed while disregarding any short-term stoppage owing to internal or external sources of disruption in designing may bring about a considerable loss.","Haeri, Abdorrrahman; Hosseini-Motlagh, Seyyed-Mahdi; Samani, Mohammad Reza Ghatreh; Rezaei, Marziehsadat",Ann Oper Res,,230

Unconscious bias, gendered expectations, and overt hostility minimize the contributions of women in academic medicine to the detriment of all. The current environment of heightened stress and new socially distant forms of communication may be exacerbating these well-recognized obstacles to women contributing to the field. Of note, none of these actions requires ill intent; all they require is the activation of unconscious biases and almost instinctive preferences and behaviors that favor the comfortable and familiar leadershp of men in a time of extreme stress. The authors argue that it is time to investigate the frequency of behaviors that limit both the recognition and the very exercise of women's leadership during this pandemic, which is unprecedented but nevertheless may recur in the future. Leaders in health care must pay attention to equity, diversity, and inclusion given increases in undermining and harassing behaviors towards women during this crisis. The longer-term consequences of marginalizing women may hamper efforts to combat the next pandemic, so the time to flatten the rising gender bias curve in academic medicine is now.","Lewiss, Resa E; Jagsi, Reshma",Acad. med,,230

We show that an early lockdown shifts the epidemic in time, while that beyond a critical value of the lockdown strength, the epidemic tend to restart after lifting the restrictions. As a consequence, specific mitigation strategies must be introduced. We characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects. Our model is general, and while it does not analyze specific mitigation strategies, it highlights the relevance of some key parameters on non-pharmaceutical mitigation mechanisms for the epidemics.","Scala, Antonio; Flori, Andrea; Spelta, Alessandro; Brugnoli, Emanuele; Cinelli, Matteo; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Pammolli, Fabio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04608v3.pdf,230
273186,Evaluation of the QT Interval in Patients with Drug-induced QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes,2020,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 25% of the general population carries at least one Îµ4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE Îµ4), the strongest genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Beyond its association with late-onset dementia, the association between APOE Îµ4 and change in cognition over the adult life course remains uncertain. This study aims to examine whether the association between Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 zygosity and cognition function is modified between midlife and old age. METHODS: A cohort study of 5561 participants (mean age 55.5 (SD = 5.9) years, 27.1% women) with APOE genotyping and repeated cognitive tests for reasoning, memory, and semantic and phonemic fluency, during a mean (SD) follow-up of 20.2 (2.8) years (the Whitehall II study). We used joint models to examine the association of APOE genotype with cognitive function trajectories between 45 and 85 years taking drop-out, dementia, and death into account and Fine and Gray models to examine associations with dementia. RESULTS: Compared to non-carriers, heterozygote (prevalence 25%) and homozygote (prevalence 2%) APOE Îµ4 carriers had increased risk of dementia, sub-distribution hazard ratios 2.19 (95% CI 1.73, 2.77) and 5.97 (95% CI 3.85, 9.28) respectively. Using data spanning 45-85 years with non-Îµ4 carriers as the reference, Îµ4 homozygotes had poorer global cognitive score starting from 65 years; Îµ4 heterozygotes had better scores between 45 and 55 years, then no difference until poorer cognitive scores from 75 years onwards. In analysis of individual cognitive tests, better cognitive performance in the younger Îµ4 heterozygotes was primarily attributable to executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Both heterozygous and homozygous Îµ4 carriers had poorer cognition and greater risk of dementia at older ages. Our findings show some support for a complex antagonist pleiotropic effect of APOE Îµ4 heterozygosity over the adult life course, characterized by cognitive advantage in midlife.","Gharbi-Meliani, Amin; Dugravot, Aline; Sabia, Séverine; Regy, Melina; Fayosse, Aurore; Schnitzler, Alexis; Kivimäki, Mika; Singh-Manoux, Archana; Dumurgier, Julien",Alzheimers Res Ther,,230

However, the development of such immunogens is often complicated by inefficiencies in their production. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N-linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. The respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer-stabilized in the prefusion conformation and fused with SpyCatcher-could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. Notably, murine vaccination with 0.08 µg of SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticle elicited similar neutralizing responses as 2.0 µg of spike, which was ~ 25-fold higher on a weight-per-weight basis. The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric viral antigens, with SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticles inducing particularly potent neutralizing responses.","Zhang, Baoshan; Chao, Cara W; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Abiona, Olubukola M; Hutchinson, Geoffrey B; Moliva, Juan I; Olia, Adam S; Pegu, Amarendra; Phung, Emily; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume B E; Verardi, Raffaello; Wang, Lingshu; Wang, Shuishu; Werner, Anne; Yang, Eun Sung; Yap, Christina; Zhou, Tongqing; Mascola, John R; Sullivan, Nancy J; Graham, Barney S; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Kwong, Peter D",Sci Rep,,230

Tweeting practices differed considerably between jurisdictions with varying burdens of COVID-19. Going forward, Tweets authored by public health accounts that promote behaviour change and community-building ought to be utilized whenever risks to health are high to reflect an increase in disease transmission requiring intervention.

While many understand the importance of trading personal privacy for the public good, others have been alarmed at the potential for surveillance via measures enabled through location tracking on smartphones. In our research, we analyzed massive yet atomic individual-level location data containing over 22 billion records from ten Blue (Democratic) and ten Red (Republican) cities in the U.S., based on which we present, herein, some of the first evidence of how Americans responded to the increasing concerns that government authorities, the private sector, and public health experts might use individual-level location data to track the COVID-19 spread. First, we found a significant decreasing trend of mobile-app location-sharing opt-out. Whereas areas with more Democrats were more privacy-concerned than areas with more Republicans before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the overall opt-out rates after COVID-19, and this effect was more salient among Democratic than Republican cities. Second, people who practiced social distancing (i.e., those who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic) were also less likely to opt-out, whereas the converse was true for people who practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among Democratic than Republican cities. Third, high-income populations and males, compared with low-income populations and females, were more privacy-conscientious and more likely to opt-out of location tracking.","Ghose, Anindya; Li, Beibei; Macha, Meghanath; Sun, Chenshuo; Foutz, Natasha Ying Zhang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05859v1.pdf,230

Our qualitative analysis, using content and thematic coding, revealed that initially SMS was the most popular 'second factor' and the main usability issue with 2FA was the getting the authenticator app to work; this result was unexpected by the IT team and led to a change in how the technology was subsequently rolled out to make the authenticator app the default primary second factor. Several lessons were learnt about the information users needed; this included how to use the technology in different scenarios and also a wider appreciation of why the technology was beneficial to a user and the organisation. The case study also highlighted a positive impact on the security posture of the organisation which was measure using IT service request metrics.","Tetlay, Abideen; Treharne, Helen; Ascroft, Tom; Moschoyiannis, Sotiris",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02901v1.pdf,230

282120,Using COVID-19 cycle threshold and other lab values as predictors of hospitalization need,2021,"Recently, during the pandemic infection of the novel SARS-CoV-2, some cases of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) have been reported. We want to summarize the main features of patients with MFS and COVID-19. A PubMed search was performed on 8 October to identify references reporting cases with MFS associated with COVID-19 from the first report of COVID-19 to 8 October 2020 using the following keywords: ""Miller Fisher syndrome"" AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"". A systematic review from the first report of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to 8 October 2020 revealed 7 cases with Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) associated with COVID-19. The 7 cases came from 5 countries but most of these patients were from Europe (85.7%), especially Spain. There are 5 cases of MFS diagnosed after the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean onset time of MFS-associated neurological symptoms was 14.75 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the two remaining cases presented initially with MFS-associated neurological symptoms followed by the diagnosis of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19-associated MFS were perioral paresthesias (57.1%), ataxia (57.1%), blurred vision (42.9), ophthalmoplegia (42.9), and generalized areflexia (42.9). However, more cohort and case-control studies are required to establish the epidemiological linkage.","Li, Zheng; Li, Xingye; Shen, Jianxiong; Chan, Matthew T V; Wu, William Ka Kei",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,230

282722,Are patients with Down syndrome vulnerable to life-threatening COVID-19?,2020,"Malignant glioma constitutes one of the fatal primary brain tumors in adults. Such poor prognosis calls for a better understanding of cancer-related signaling pathways of this disease. Here we elucidate a MYC-miRNA-MXI1 feedback loop that regulates proliferation and tumorigenesis in glioma. MYC suppressed MXI1 expression via microRNA-155 (miR-155) and the microRNA-23a~27a~24-2 cluster (miR-23a cluster), whereas MXI1, in turn, inhibited MYC expression by binding to its promoter. Overexpression of miR-155 and the miR-23a cluster promoted tumorigenesis in U87 glioma cells. Furthermore, FTO, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA demethylase, regulated the loop by targeting MYC. The ethyl ester form of meclofenamic acid (MA2) inhibited FTO and enhanced the effect of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ) on suppressing proliferation of glioma cells and negatively regulated the loop. These data collectively highlight a key regulatory circuit in glioma and provide potential targets for clinical treatment.","Xiao, Li; Li, Xiaodi; Mu, Zekun; Zhou, Jianwen; Zhou, Peng; Xie, Chen; Jiang, Songshan",Cancer res,,230
282730,Survival study of hospitalised patients with concurrent COVID-19 and haematological malignancies,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is important to measure the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. METHODS: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""quarantine"") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. RESULTS: Popular unigrams included ""virus,"" ""lockdown,"" and ""quarantine."" Popular bigrams included ""COVID-19,"" ""stay home,"" ""corona virus,"" ""social distancing,"" and ""new cases."" We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning. Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, Chengda; Su, Yue; Zhu, Tingshao",J Med Internet Res,,230

METHODS: Revision of a patient's clinical charts with COVID-19 admitted at INMI L. Spallanzani Hospital RESULTS: Two oropharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were performed at admission (17 days from symptoms onset) and a day apart and were found negative. BAL fluid collected 19 days after symptoms onset was positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: This case highlights importance of clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in diagnosis and infectivity assessment. We suggest collection of BAL fluid when consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs are negative, to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia.

285704,Epidemiology and clinical features of common community human coronavirus disease,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease infection (COVID-19) outbreak that was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 had led to an internationally variable but concerning incidence of COVID-associated acute kidney injury (AKI), with prevalence reported as high as 46% in large cohorts of hospitalized patients. Variability in AKI may be explained by differences in traditional risk factors for AKI, heterogeneity among patient cohorts, and differences in racial and ethnic groups. Further, AKI requiring kidney replacement therapies (KRT) has been associated with increased mortality. Proposed mechanisms of kidney injury include direct viral-induced tubular or glomerular injury, sepsis-associated AKI, and thrombotic disease. Kidney pathology include acute tubular injury, glomerular fibrin thrombi, pigmented tubular casts, and collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. ""Viral-like"" particles have been observed in renal samples at electron microscopy and viral RNA has been identified in both glomerular and tubular compartments of kidney specimens, but the link between viral presence and injury remain unclear. Though the link between AKI and poor outcomes is clear, prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease has not yet been reported. In patients on immunosuppression like those with kidney transplants or glomerular disease, COVID-19 has presented a management dilemma. Herein, we review the existing literature on kidney disease in COVID-19 and discuss what remains to be learned.","Farouk, Samira S; Fiaccadori, Enrico; Cravedi, Paolo; Campbell, Kirk N",J. nephrol,,230

This is a case series performed at 4 academic tertiary care centers in Paris of all the children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with shock, fever and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 15th and April 27th, 2020. Results: 20 critically ill children admitted for shock had an acute myocarditis (left ventricular ejection fraction, 35% (25–55); troponin, 269 ng/mL (31–4607)), and arterial hypotension with mainly vasoplegic clinical presentation. The first symptoms before PICU admission were intense abdominal pain and fever for 6 days (1–10). All children had highly elevated C-reactive protein (&gt; 94 mg/L) and procalcitonin (&gt; 1.6 ng/mL) without microbial cause. At least one feature of Kawasaki disease was found in all children (fever, n = 20, skin rash, n = 10; conjunctivitis, n = 6; cheilitis, n = 5; adenitis, n = 2), but none had the typical form. SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were positive for 10 and 15 children, respectively. One child had both negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology, but had a typical SARS-CoV-2 chest tomography scan. All children but one needed an inotropic/vasoactive drug support (epinephrine, n = 12; milrinone, n = 10; dobutamine, n = 6, norepinephrine, n = 4) and 8 were intubated. All children received intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g per kilogram) with adjuvant corticosteroids (n = 2), IL 1 receptor antagonist (n = 1) or a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor (n = 1). All children survived and were afebrile with a full left ventricular function recovery at PICU discharge. Conclusions: Acute myocarditis with intense systemic inflammation and atypical Kawasaki disease is an emerging severe pediatric disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early recognition of this disease is needed and referral to an expert center is recommended. A delayed and inappropriate host immunological response is suspected. While underlying mechanisms remain unclear, further investigations are required to target an optimal treatment.","Grimaud, Marion; Starck, Julie; Levy, Michael; Marais, Clémence; Chareyre, Judith; Khraiche, Diala; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Quartier, Pierre; Léger, Pierre Louis; Geslain, Guillaume; Semaan, Nada; Moulin, Florence; Bendavid, Matthieu; Jean, Sandrine; Poncelet, Géraldine; Renolleau, Sylvain; Oualha, Mehdi",Ann.

These tests (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] and antigen) are intrusive, can take significant time to process, and can give deleterious false negative and false positive results. Alternative methods for COVID-19 testing and screening are being studied, including the use of trained scent detection dogs to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with the COVID virus. In August 2020 and October 2020, the first author (T.D.) searched MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and additional news articles using keyword phrases including ""COVID scent dogs,"" ""COVID sniffer dogs,"" and ""COVID detection dog,"" returning a total of 13 articles, nine of which were duplicates. Four remaining peer-reviewed studies dedicated to determining the feasibility and efficacy of detecting and screening individuals who may be infected by the COVID-19 virus with scent detection dogs were then examined. In this narrative review, the authors describe the methodologies and results of the remaining four studies, which demonstrated that the sensitivity, specificity, and overall success rates reported by the summarized scent detection studies are comparable to or better than the standard RT-PCR and antigen testing procedures, meaning that scent detection dogs can likely be effectively employed to nonintrusively screen and identify individuals infected with the COVID-19 virus in hospitals, senior care facilities, schools, universities, airports, and even large public gatherings for sporting events and concerts.","Dickey, Tommy; Junqueira, Heather",J Osteopath Med,,230

The 40 Health Systems, Covid-19 (40HS.C-19) Study aimed to investigate relationships between governments' capacity to respond (CTR), their response stringency, scope of COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Data to April 2020 were extracted for 40 national health systems on pre-pandemic government capacity to respond (CTR) (Global Competitiveness Index), stringency measures (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker Stringency Index), approach to COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 cases and deaths (Our-World-in-Data). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis were applied to examine latent dimensions and visualise country similarities and dissimilarities. Outcomes were tested using multivariate and one-way analyses of variances and Kruskal-Wallis H tests. RESULTS: The MDS model found three dimensions explaining 91% of the variance and cluster analysis identified five national groupings. There was no association between national governments' pre-pandemic CTR and the adoption of early stringent public health measures or approach to COVID-19 testing. Two national clusters applied early stringency measures and reported significantly lower cumulative deaths. The best performing national cluster (comprising Australia, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan) adopted relatively early stringency measures but broader testing earlier than others which was associated with a change in disease trajectory and the lowest COVID-19 death rates. Two clusters (one with high CTR and one low) both adopted late stringency measures and narrow testing and performed least well in COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSION: Early stringency measures and intrinsic national capacities to deal with a pandemic are insufficient. Extended stringency measures, important in the short-term, are not economically sustainable. Broad-based testing is key to managing COVID-19.","Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Tran, Yvonne; Ellis, Louise A; Westbrook, Johanna",Int. j. qual. health care,,230

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and mortality-related risk factors for those who undergoing hemodialysis with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective study. A total of 49 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (Group 1) and 74 uninfected patients (Group 2) were included. For patients in Group 1, we found the median age was 62 years (36-89 years), 59.3% were male, and the median dialysis vintage was 26 months. Twenty-eight patients (57%) had three or more comorbidities and two patients (4%) died. The most common symptoms were fever (32.7%) and dry cough (46.9%), while nine patients (18.4%) were asymptomatic. Blood routine tests indicated lymphocytopenia, the proportion of lymphocyte subsets was generally reduced, and chest CT scans showed ground-glass opacity (45.8%) and patchy shadowing (35.4%). However, these findings were not specific to hemodialysis patients with COVID-19, and similar manifestations could be found in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19, lymphocytopenia and ground-glass opacities or patchy opacities were common but not specific to them, early active treatment and interventions against nosocomial infection can significantly reduce the mortality and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tian, Ming; Li, Hua; Yan, Ting; Dai, Yujie; Dong, Liping; Wei, Honglan; Song, Xiaohong; Dong, Junwu; Cheng, Fangxiong; Li, Wenzhou",Sem. dial,,230

Meanwhile in the community, many other contained patients could only use self-care strategies, especially in countries that have set up a long and strict containment such as France. The study aimed to compare coping strategies deployed by patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS; a poorly recognised syndrome) to those with better known and referenced chronic conditions. An online flash survey was conducted during the containment period in partnership with French Patients Organizations including ME/CFS national association. Therefore, 'Brief COPE' version of Lazarus and Folkman's Ways of Coping Check List has been adapted to the specificity of the containment. The survey was e-distributed in France from 15 April to 11 May 2020. Differences of coping strategies were analyzed using Wilcoxon-Mann-Withney test. Amongst 637 responses, 192 were complete, presenting a wide variety of diseases, including 93 ME/CFS. The latter have significantly different coping strategies than recognised diagnosed diseases patients: similar uses of emotion focused coping but less uses of seek social support and problem-focused copings. In conclusion, coping strategies are different for those who deal with the daily experience of ME/CFS, highly disabling chronic condition with diagnostic ambiguity, low degree of medical and social recognition and without treatment. Better understanding of those strategies is needed to provide the means for health promotion researchers, managers and clinicians, to accompany those patients.","Moncorps, Florence; Jouet, Emmanuelle; Bayen, Sabine; Fornasieri, Isabelle; Renet, Sophie; Las-Vergnas, Olivier; Messaadi, Nassir",Heal. soc. care community,,230

RESULTS: Of 73 patients aged11-82 years, 12 (16.4%), 28 (38.4%), 25 (34.2%) and 8 (11.0%)were &#8804; 30, 31-50, 51-70,and &#8805; 71 years old, respectively. Thirty-four (46.6%) patients were male. Most individuals had mild symptoms, and no patient died during treatment. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputum and nasopharyngeal samples, and 40 (54.8%) were also tested positive in stool. Nine(12.3%) patients were re-positivefor SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) after discharge. Sixty-five (89.0%) patients had IgM or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.Among the four age groups, there was no difference in IgG antibody production (P = 0.664).CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 cell counts between the antibody producing and non-producing groups showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05).The antibodies disappeared within two months in four patients. Lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, IL-6, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine and D-Dimer levels were similar in the three groups (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients after recovery from COVID-19 can be tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.Some patients may produce antibodies only for a short time, or even no antibodies at all.","Lu, Yong; Li, Yongyan; Wang, Yiping; Luo, Jianping; Yu, Wanjun",Int Immunopharmacol,,230

Eye movements of 41 children (21 amblyopes and 20 controls) were compared to eye movements of 55 adults (18 amblyopes and 37 controls). Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a 'standard' target, with a uniform color intensity, or a 'noisy' target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target. However, in the case of a blurry target, either in control participants with a noisy target or in amblyopic participants with a standard target, the effect of visual information was larger in children.","Hemptinne, Coralie; Deravet, Nicolas; Orban de Xivry, Jean-Jacques; Lefèvre, Philippe; Yüksel, Demet",J. comput. neurosci,,230
295702,The key comorbidities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A narrative review,2021,"Public discussion of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic has reproduced several recurrent and interrelated topics in discourses on sustainability and the Anthropocene. First, there is an ambiguous concern—sometimes ominous, sometimes hopeful—that the pandemic will precipitate radical social transformation or even collapse. Second, there is widespread reflection over the risks of economic globalization, which increases vulnerability and undermines local food security. Third, the pandemic is frequently imagined as nature’s revenge on humankind. This metaphor reflects a fundamental conceptual dualism separating nature and society that continues to constrain our efforts to understand the challenges of sustainability. To help transcend the epistemological and ontological dichotomy of nature versus society, the article proposes an epidemiological approach to all-purpose money. Conventional money is an artifact with far-reaching repercussions for global society as well as the biosphere. To approach it as the source of behavioral algorithms with severely detrimental consequences for both social and ecological systems might provide a middle ground for natural and social science.","Hornborg, Alf",Sustainability,,230

However, evidence on vertical transmission and natural passive immunity among the newborns exposed to COVID-19 is scanty and varies. This poses a challenge on preventive interventions for the newborns. We conducted a systematic review to first, determine the likelihood of vertical transmission among COVID-19 exposed infants and second, determine whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated among COVID-19 vertically exposed but negative infants. This review registered in PROSPERO searched evidence from PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar, among others. About 517 studies were pooled, where 33 articles (5.8%) met the inclusion criteria such as infection prevention and control measures at birth. A total of 205 infants born to COVID-19 positive mothers were studied. Overall, 6.3% (13/205; 95% CI: 3.0%-9.7%) of the infants tested positive for COVID-19 virus at birth. Of 33 eligible studies, six studies (18.8%) reported about immunoglobulin G/M (IgG/IgM) against SARS-CoV-2. IgG/IgM were detected in 90% infants (10/11; 95% CI: 73.9%-107.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 virus. The median antibody levels detected were 75.49 AU/ml (range, 7.25-140.32 AU/ml) and 3.79 AU/ml (range, 0.16-45.83 AU/ml), p = .0041 for IgG and IgM, respectively. In conclusion, the current evidence revealed a low possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected among vertically exposed but negative infants. Further studies on transplacental transmission and the magnitude of natural passive immunity in infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are warranted.","Bwire, George M; Njiro, Belinda J; Mwakawanga, Dorkasi L; Sabas, Deodatus; Sunguya, Bruno F",J Med Virol,,230

Thirteen phenotypes/traits were associated with the severe COVID-19-associated loci at the genome-wide significance threshold, including monocyte counts, fat metabolism traits, and fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In addition, we identified tissue and immune subtype-specific eQTL associations affecting 48 genes, including several that may directly impact host immune responses, colocalized with the severe COVID-19 GWAS associations, and showed altered expression in single-cell transcriptomes. Collectively, our work demonstrates that host genetic variations associated with multiple genes and traits show genetic pleiotropy with severe COVID-19 and may inform disease etiology.","Moon, Chang; Schilder, Brian M; Raj, Towfique; Huang, Kuan-Lin",iScience,,230

Although azoles are present throughout the natural environment, their interactions with NP are not well known. We investigated the effects of polystyrene (PS) NP on the toxicity of ketoconazole (KCZ) and fluconazole (FCZ) in zebrafish embryos using the developmental toxicity, oxidative-stress-related biochemical parameters, and expression of genes related to neurotoxicity (ache), cardiotoxicity (gata4, bmp4), inflammation (il1b), oxidative stress (sod1, sod2, cyp1a), and apoptosis (bax, bcl2). Co-exposure to NP (1 mg/L) and KCZ/FCZ (1 mg/L) for 96 h reduced the hatching rate, survival rate, and heart rate and increased the malformation rate and catalase activity. The bax/bcl2 ratio, an apoptosis indicator, was higher after NP, KCZ, or FCZ treatment. However, the bax/bcl2 ratio after exposure to NP + KCZ or NP + FCZ was much higher than that after single exposure. Overall, the results indicated that NP aggravated the toxicity of azole by significantly increasing the reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and altering the expression of oxidative-stress- and apoptosis-related genes. The interactive toxicity of PS NP with KCZ/FCZ reported in this study emphasises the need for caution in the release of azole fungicides in the environment.","Bhagat, Jacky; Zang, Liqing; Nakayama, Hiroko; Nishimura, Norihiro; Shimada, Yasuhito",Sci Total Environ,,230

METHODS: Based on systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct up to April 22, 2020, a total of 52 eligible articles with 6,320 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cohorts were included. Pairwise comparison between severe versus mild disease, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus general ward admission and expired versus survivors were performed for 36 laboratory parameters. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird method/random effects model and converted to the Odds ratio (OR). The decision tree algorithm was employed to identify the key risk factor(s) attributed to severe COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Cohorts with elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs) (OR = 1.75), neutrophil count (OR = 2.62), D-dimer (OR = 3.97), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR = 1.82), fibrinogen (OR = 3.14), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR = 1.60), procalcitonin (OR = 4.76), IL-6 (OR = 2.10), and IL-10 (OR = 4.93) had higher odds of progression to severe phenotype. Decision tree model (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 81%) showed the high performance of neutrophil count at a cut-off value of more than 3.74x109/L for identifying patients at high risk of severe COVID-19. Likewise, ICU admission was associated with higher levels of WBCs (OR = 5.21), neutrophils (OR = 6.25), D-dimer (OR = 4.19), and prolonged PT (OR = 2.18). Patients with high IL-6 (OR = 13.87), CRP (OR = 7.09), D-dimer (OR = 6.36), and neutrophils (OR = 6.25) had the highest likelihood of mortality.

The aim of this study was to measure the association between history of bariatric surgery and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Data source included PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and pre-print servers between January and November 1, 2020. Literature was screened and selected to extract the relevant data. The two outcomes of this meta-analysis were the difference in mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without history of bariatric surgery. Random-effect models were used to estimate the pooled effects. RESULTS: The systematic review yielded 3 retrospective studies on 9022 patients. The risk of mortality without previous bariatric surgery was 133 per 1000 cases and its risk with previous bariatric surgery was 33 per 1000 (summary OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.19-0.26). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I2 = 0%, P = 0.98 for heterogeneity). In the pooled analysis, the hospitalization rate in patients without previous bariatric surgery was 412 per 1000 cases and its rate in patients with previous bariatric surgery was 164 per 1000 (summary OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.65). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I2 = 0%, P = 0.71 for heterogeneity). There was a substantial risk of bias across the studies for confounding and selection bias. CONCLUSION: Findings of this meta-analysis of observational studies suggest that prior bariatric surgery is associated with a lower rate of mortality and hospital admission in patients with obesity who become infected with SARS-CoV-2. Confirmation of these findings will require larger studies with better quality data.","Aminian, Ali; Tu, Chao",Obes. surg,,230

The data for the study was collected by the Government of the region of Aragon (Spain) through a survey of a non-randomly selected sample of firms located in the region. In addition to prospects and intended actions, firms were asked whether or not they had applied for ERTE aid (the Spanish job retention scheme to contain the pandemic crisis). We find that firms participating (voluntarily and anonymously) in the survey anticipated rather well the severity of the effects of the pandemic in the following months. The ERTE aid helped firms to maintain the jobs of their inactive employees, while firms that did not ask for aid responded by laying off employees. Further, the ERTE aid helped to maintain the jobs of furloughed employees, but the firms receiving ERTE aid expected to lay off the same proportion of employees as firms without that aid, controlling for the different anticipated effects of the pandemic in the two groups of firms.","Laborda, Juan; Rivera-Torres, Pilar; Salas-Fumas, Vicente; Suárez, Cristina",PLoS One,,230

For decades, antibodies and antibody fragments have occupied a significant body of the treatment approaches against infectious diseases. Because of their high affinity, they can be designed and engineered against a variety of purposes, mainly since antibody fragments such as scFv, nanobody, diabody, and bispecific antibody have emerged owing to their small size and interesting properties.

Methods: Inclusion of patients with RA, AxSpA and PsA from the SCQM using a smartphone app (mySCQM) to record information between March and December 2020. Outcomes of interest were self-reported SARS-CoV2 testing, symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during the previous month and confirmed COVID-19 through PCR nasopharyngeal swab. Outcomes were compared between diseases groups, using logistic regression. We also evaluated the association of baseline treatment (TNF-inhibitors, b/tsDMARDs with other modes of action, no b/tsDMARDs) on the odds of symptoms and testing and the association of the number of symptoms (0-9) on the odds of testing. The analyses of SARS-CoV2 testing and COVID-19 symptoms were additionally adjusted for age, gender, glucocorticoids and csDMARDs. Confirmed cases were not adjusted for treatment and other covariates considering the low number of events. Results: We included 927 patients with RA, 805 with AxSpa and 453 with PsA. 1010 patients reported COVID-19-like symptoms (mostly fever, runny nose and cough), but only 455 of them (45%) reported being tested. 151 patients were tested without symptoms. In between March and December 2020, 7.6% of RA, 8.5% of AxSpA and 10.5% of PsA patients were tested positive for COVID-19 (p = 0.678). The odds of testing, symptoms and confirmed COVID-19 were similar between diseases and not associated with treatment for testing and. The number of symptoms was associated with the odds of testing (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.37- 1.50 by symptom). Conclusion: Prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms and confirmed cases was similar between diseases, and for symptoms, was not associated with treatment. Despite strong advice from health authorities, less than 50% of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 symptoms were tested. This proportion was not significantly different between diseases and not influenced by type of treatment.

In this study, six strains of type 2 MRV (MRV2) were isolated from 7 diarrhea piglets from a farm that had an outbreak of diarrhea in piglets in 2018, which tested negative for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and porcine group A rotavirus (RAV). The MRV2 isolate infected neonatal piglets, in which it induced severe diarrhea, while the virus was detected in multiple organs of piglets. Moreover, the complete genome of an MRV2 isolate was obtained, which was a novel reassortant MRV strain of human MRV, porcine MRV, chamois MRV, bat MRV, and mink MRV based on the nucleotide identity and phylogenetic tree. The S1 gene of isolate had eight unique amino acid mutations compared with available MRV2 S1 in the GenBank. To investigate the prevalence of this MRV2, 78 samples of diarrhea feces were collected from 10 pig farms in seven regions of Sichuan province. The obtained results showed that the positive rate of samples was 14% (11/78), and positive rate of farms was 60% (6/10), while the amplified fragments shared the identical amino acid mutations with the isolated strain, thus suggesting that this MRV2 strain was already prevalent in Sichuan province. The present study was first to isolate a pig-derived type 2 MRV strain in China, obtaining the complete genome of this strain, which furthers our understanding of the MRV2 epidemic and evolution.","Luo, Yingying; Fei, Lei; Yue, Hua; Li, Siyi; Ma, Huiqiang; Tang, Cheng",Infect Genet Evol,,230
303406,Imaging Profile of the COVID-19 Infection: Radiologic Findings and Literature Review,2020,"As a respiratory tract virus, SARS-CoV-2 infected people through contacting with the upper respiratory tract first. Previous studies indicated that microbiota could modulate immune response against pathogen infection. In the present study, we performed metagenomic sequencing of pharyngeal swabs from eleven patients with COVID-19 and eleven Non-COVID-19 patients who had similar symptoms such as fever and cough. Through metagenomic analysis of the above two groups and a healthy group from the public data, there are 6502 species identified in the samples. Specifically, the Pielou index indicated a lower evenness of the microbiota in the COVID-19 group than that in the Non-COVID-19 group. Combined with the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the generalized linear model, eighty-one bacterial species were found with increased abundance in the COVID-19 group, where 51 species were enriched more than 8 folds. The top three enriched genera were Streptococcus, Prevotella and Campylobacter containing some opportunistic pathogens. More interestingly, through experiments, we found that two Streptococcus strains, S. suis and S. agalactiae, could stimulate the expression of ACE2 of Vero cells in vitro, which may promote SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, these enriched pathogens in the pharynxes of COVID-19 patients may involve in the virus-host interactions to affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and cause potential secondary bacterial infections through changing the expression of the viral receptor ACE2 and/or modulate the host's immune system.","Xiong, Dongyan; Muema, Caroline; Zhang, Xiaoxu; Pan, Xinming; Xiong, Jin; Yang, Hang; Yu, Junping; Wei, Hongping",Virol. sin.

Our general-purpose framework integrates into a single computational platform a multi-purpose compartmental disease propagation model, a human behavior network, a resource logistics model, and a stochastic queueing model for vaccination operations. We apply the modeling framework to the current COVID-19 pandemic and derive an optimal trigger for switching from a prioritized vaccination strategy to a non-prioritized strategy so as to minimize the overall attack rate and mortality rate. When vaccine supply is limited, such a mixed vaccination strategy is broadly effective. Our analysis suggests that delays in vaccine supply and inefficiencies in vaccination delivery can substantially impede the containment effort. Employing an optimal mixed strategy can significantly reduce the attack and mortality rates. The more infectious the virus, the earlier it helps to open the vaccine to the public. As vaccine efficacy decreases, the attack and mortality rates rapidly increase by multiples;this highlights the importance of early vaccination to reduce spreading as quickly as possible to lower the chances for further mutations to evolve and to reduce the excessive healthcare burden. To maximize the protective effect of available vaccines, of equal importance are determining the optimal mixed strategy and implementing effective on-the-ground dispensing. The optimal mixed strategy is quite robust against variations in model parameters and can be implemented readily in practice. Studies with our holistic modeling framework strongly support the urgent need for early vaccination in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Our framework permits rapid custom modeling in practice. Additionally, it is generalizable for different types of infectious disease outbreaks, whereby a user may determine for a given type the effects of different interventions including the optimal switch trigger.","Lee, E.

As there have been no prior studies on the acceptance of telemedicine by pregnant women, we conducted this survey to investigate the same. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous questionnaire survey of pregnant women who underwent telemedicine check-ups from March 4 to June 30, 2020, using a mobile fetal heart rate monitor and video call system through the Hokkaido University Hospital. RESULTS: Out of the 77 individuals who received prenatal telemedicine check-ups, 54 individuals (70%) had complications, and 64 individuals (83%) consented for the questionnaire survey. In the video call system, 18 individuals (28%) were found to be unwell and 17 individuals (27%) experienced difficulty using the mobile fetal heart rate monitoring device. Assuming scores for face-to-face consultations were five out of 10, the mean score for satisfaction was 4.2, but 19 (30%) women felt equal or greater satisfaction with face-to-face consultations. If not for the threat of COVID-19, only four individuals (6%) proactively expressed a desire for telemedicine, with a significantly less demand observed among primiparous women than multiparous women. The permissible additional financial burden enabling telemedicine was $10 or less for 80% of subjects. CONCLUSION: In this small preliminary study, 30% of the pregnant women felt equal or greater satisfaction with telemedicine than face-to-face consultations. A stronger demand for telemedicine was exhibited by multiparous women than primiparous women. Thus, a system that would be advantages by limiting subjects and enabling low-cost examinations is required for making perinatal telemedicine more popular.","Nakagawa, Kinuko; Umazume, Takeshi; Mayama, Michinori; Chiba, Kentaro; Saito, Yoshihiro; Noshiro, Kiwamu; Morikawa, Mamoru; Yoshino, Masanori; Watari, Hidemichi",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,,230

Weekly telehealth visits declined when COVID-19 cases were decreasing and plateaued as cases were increasing. Health centers in the South and in rural areas consistently reported the lowest average percentage of weekly telehealth visits over the 20 weeks, compared with health centers in other regions and urban areas.

METHODS: We measured FPG at 11.9 ±1.8 weeks in 2006 women from a prospective cohort study. Women with FPG &#8805;5.6mmol/l (19) received treatment and were excluded from further analyses. 1838 women with FPG <5.6mmol/l received a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. RESULTS: Of all participants, 78 (4.2%) had FPG 5.1-5.5mmol/l in early pregnancy, of which 49 had a normal OGTT later in pregnancy [high fasting normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group]. Compared to the NGT group with FPG <5.1 mmol/l in early pregnancy (low fasting NGT group, n=1560), the high fasting NGT group had a higher BMI, higher insulin resistance with more impaired insulin secretion and higher FPG and 30 min glucose levels on the OGTT. The admission rate to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was significantly higher in the high fasting NGT group compared to the low fasting NGT group [20.4% (10) vs. 9.3% (143), p=0.009], with no difference in duration (7.0±8.6 vs. 8.4±14.3 days, p= 0.849) or indication for NICU admission between both groups. The admission rate to NICU remained significantly higher [OR 2.47 (95% CI 1.18-5.19), p=0.017] after adjustment for age, BMI and glucose levels at the OGTT. CONCLUSIONS: When provision of an OGTT is limited such as in the Covid-19 pandemic, using FPG in early pregnancy could be an easy alternative to determine who is at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.","Benhalima, Katrien; Van Crombrugge, Paul; Moyson, Carolien; Verhaeghe, Johan; Vandeginste, Sofie; Verlaenen, Hilde; Vercammen, Chris; Maes, Toon; Dufraimont, Els; De Block, Christophe; Jacquemyn, Yves; Mekahli, Farah; De Clippel, Katrien; Van Den Bruel, Annick; Loccufier, Anne; Laenen, Annouschka; Minschart, Caro; Devlieger, Roland; Mathieu, Chantal",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,230

This forced students on a core Emergency Medicine rotation at McMaster University to immediately cease all in person activities. An urgent need for a virtual curriculum emerged. Methods: A virtual curriculum consisting of asynchronous case-based learning on Slack, ask-me-anything webinars and online e-modules was created to fill the need. We describe a program evaluation using the RE-AIM framework and a social networking analysis of participants. Results: Medical students (n=23) and 11 facilitators (5 residents, 6 faculty members) participated in this pilot study. Faculty members sent an average of 115 messages (n=6, SD=117), average message counts for students and residents were 49.96 (n=23, SD= 25), and 39 (n=5, SD=38), respectively. Total of 62,237 words were written by the participants, with an average of 1831 per person. Each message consisted of an average 25 words (SD=29). Students rapidly acquitted themselves to digital technology. Using the RE-AIM framework we highlight the feasibility of a virtual curriculum, discuss demands on faculty time and reflect on strategies to engage learners. Conclusions: The use of asynchronous digital curricula creates opportunities for faculty-resident interaction and engagement.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is a relation between handedness and the depth of the olfactory sulcus (OS) and reinvestigate whether there is a lateralization of OS depth. METHODS: Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean age 24.1 years; 23 right-handed and 19 left-handed) participated. The subjects' brains were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging to assess OS depth. Normal olfactory function was ascertained using the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in OS depth between right- and left-handed participants (right-handed mean: right OS depth = 11.3 mm, left OS = 10.6 mm; left-handed mean: right OS = 11.3 mm, left OS = 11.0 mm). Across all subjects, OS depth was significantly larger on the right side compared to the left. CONCLUSION: Handedness has no major influence on OS depth. The present study confirmed that the right OS is deeper compared to the left OS, possibly indicating a right-sided lateralization of the olfactory system. IMPLICATIONS: The depth of the right OS is larger than that of the left OS. No major effect of handedness was observed.","Zang, Yunpeng; Whitcroft, Katie L; Glöckler, Carmina; Hummel, Thomas",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,,230

To assess the effect of imprudent consumption of ABS during the COVID-19 pandemic, we compare the 2020 prevalence of antidrug resistance (ADR) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) with a similar survey carried out in 2018 in Ahmedabad, India using SARS-CoV-2 gene detection as a marker of ABS usage. We found a significant ADR increase for in 2020 compared to 2018 in ambient water bodies, harbouring a higher incidence of ADR E.Coli towards non-fluoroquinolone drugs. Effective SARS-CoV-2 genome copies were found to be associated with the ADR prevalence. The prevalence of ADR depends on the efficiency of WWTPs (Wastewater Treatment Plants) and the catchment area in its vicinity. In year 2018 study, prevalence of ADR was discretely distributed, and the maximum ADR prevalence recorded was ~60%;against the current homogenous ADR increase, and up to 85% of maximum ADR among the incubated E.coli isolated from the river (Sabarmati) and lake (Chandola and Kankaria) samples. Furthermore, wastewater treatment plants showed less increase in comparison to the ambient waters, which eventually imply that although SARS-CoV-2 genes and faecal pollution may be diluted in the ambient waters, as indicated by low Ct-value and E.coli count, the danger of related aftermath like ADR increase cannot be nullified. Also, Non-fluoroquinolone drugs exhibited overall more resistance than the quinolone drugs. Overall, this is probably the first ever study that traces the COVID-19 pandemic imprints on the prevalence of antidrug resistance (ADR) through wastewater surveillance and hints at monitoring escalation of other environmental health parameters. This study will make public and policyholders concerned about the optimum use of antibiotics during any kind of treatment.","Kumar, Manish Dhangar Kiran Thakur Alok Kumar Ram Bhagwana Chaminda Tushara Sharma Pradeep Kumar Abhay Raval Nirav Srivastava Vaibhab Rinklebe Jörg Kuroda Keisuke Sonne Christian Barcelo Damia",Journal of Hazardous Materials,,230

310747,Serious Concerns About the RCT Study Quality of Traditional Chinese Medicine Injections for Treating Cardiovascular Diseases and COVID-19,2020,"In many applications, data and/or parameters are supported on non-Euclidean manifolds. It is important to take into account the geometric structure of manifolds in statistical analysis to avoid misleading results. Although there has been a considerable focus on simple and specific manifolds, there is a lack of general and easy-to-implement statistical methods for density estimation and modeling on manifolds. In this article, we consider a very broad class of manifolds: non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces. For this class, we provide a very general mathematical result for easily calculating volume changes of the exponential and logarithm map between the tangent space and the manifold. This allows one to define statistical models on the tangent space, push these models forward onto the manifold, and easily calculate induced distributions by Jacobians. To illustrate the statistical utility of this theoretical result, we provide a general method to construct distributions on symmetric spaces. In particular, we define the log-Gaussian distribution as an analogue of the multivariate Gaussian distribution in Euclidean space. With these new kernels on symmetric spaces, we also consider the problem of density estimation. Our proposed approach can use any existing density estimation approach designed for Euclidean spaces and push it forward to the manifold with an easy-to-calculate adjustment. We provide theorems showing that the induced density estimators on the manifold inherit the statistical optimality properties of the parent Euclidean density estimator; this holds for both frequentist and Bayesian nonparametric methods. We illustrate the theory and practical utility of the proposed approach on the space of positive definite matrices.","Li, Didong; Lu, Yulong; Chevallier, Emmanuel; Dunson, David B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01983v3.pdf,230

However, end-users are playing a key role in their operation and response to disturbances via demand response and distributed energy resources. Therefore, due to the critical role of active and passive end-users and the intermittency of renewable energy, smart grids must be planned and operated by considering the computational social aspects in addition to the technical aspects. The level of cooperation, flexibility, and other social features of the various stakeholders, including consumers, prosumers, and microgrids, affect the system efficiency, reliability, and resilience. In this paper, we design an artificial society simulating the interaction between power systems and the social communities that they serve via agent-based modeling inspired by Barsade's theory on the emotional spread. The simulation results show a decline in the consumers' and prosumers' satisfaction levels induced by a shortage of electricity. It also shows the effects of social diffusion via the Internet and mass media on the satisfaction level. In view of the importance of computational social science for power system applications and the limited number of publications devoted to it, we provide a list of research topics that need to be achieved to enhance the reliability and resilience of power systems' operation and planning.","Valinejad, Jaber; Mili, Lamine; Wal, Natalie van der",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08064v1.pdf,230

To initiate infection, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes attachment to the host cell surface and fusion of the viral and host membranes. Prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of vaccine design. However, its limited stability and conformational dynamics are limiting factors for developing countermeasures against this virus. We report here the design of a construct corresponding to the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, covalently stabilized by a disulfide bond in the closed conformation. Structural and antigenicity analyses show we successfully shut S in the closed state without otherwise altering its architecture. We demonstrate that this strategy is applicable to other ß-coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and might become an important tool for structural biology, serology, vaccine design and immunology studies.","McCallum, Matthew; Walls, Alexandra C; Bowen, John E; Corti, Davide; Veesler, David",Nat Struct Mol Biol,,230
315413,Response letter: Handling of COVID-19 positive lung cancer patients during the pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Due to overcome the hardness of the vaccine design, computational vaccinology is emerging widely. Prediction of T cell and B cell epitopes, antigen processing analysis, antigenicity analysis, population coverage, conservancy analysis, allergenicity assessment, toxicity prediction, and protein-peptide docking are important steps in the process of designing and developing potent vaccines against various viruses and cancers. In order to perform all of the analyses, several bioinformatics tools and online web servers have been developed. Scientists must take the decision to apply more suitable and precise servers for each part based on their accuracy. AREAS COVERED: In this review, a wide-range list of different bioinformatics tools and online web servers has been provided. Moreover, some studies were proposed to show the importance of various bioinformatics tools for predicting and developing efficient vaccines against different pathogens including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi as well as cancer. EXPERT OPINION: Immunoinformatics is the best way to find potential vaccine candidates against different pathogens. Thus, the selection of the most accurate tools is necessary to predict and develop potent preventive and therapeutic vaccines. To further evaluation of the computational and in silico vaccine design, in vitro/in vivo analyses are required to develop vaccine candidates.","Kardani, Kimia; Bolhassani, Azam; Namvar, Ali",Expert Rev Vaccines,,230
315472,COVID-19: patients with stroke or risk of stroke,2020,"PURPOSE: To provide pharmacy residents' perspective on how the department of pharmacy at a large academic medical center prepared and managed the surge in admissions of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to describe how residents were trained for intensive care unit (ICU) staffing, and to provide recommendations on how residency programs nationally could navigate a second wave of COVID-19 admissions or other disaster response situations. SUMMARY: The majority of postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residents at the institution were trained for ICU staffing and deployed throughout the hospital to ICU units converted to dedicated COVID-19 ICUs to assist in patient care. The training process included live videoconference lectures about relevant ICU topics and on-site experiences with critical care clinical pharmacists. Based on their experience in training for and participating in ICU care of patients with COVID-19, the pharmacy residents recommend considering additional cross-training of residents, integration of additional clinical education, creation of opportunities for resident involvement in telehealth, advancement of residents' roles in emergency responses, building robust mental health services, and continued advocacy for the advancement of pharmacists' and pharmacy residents' scope of practice. CONCLUSION: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the institution to reevaluate the allocation of resources, and the department of pharmacy elected to deploy PGY1 pharmacy residents with previous ICU experience to assist in caring for an ICU patient census that had doubled. This experience will be valuable in preparing for another potential wave of COVID-19 cases and a surge in admissions of other groups of patients who deferred care due to the pandemic.","Uchida, Emma; Long-Fazio, Bianca; Marshall, John; Fortier, Christopher",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,230

Whole DNA was extracted from the roots of maize plants cultivated with organic fertilizer, inorganic fertilizer and maize planted without any fertilizer at different planting sites in an experimental field and sequenced using shotgun metagenomics. Our results using the Subsystem database revealed a total of 28 phyla and different nutrient pathways in all the samples. The major phyla observed were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, Tenericutes, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, and Chlorobi. Bacteroidetes dominated maize from organic fertilizer sites, Firmicutes dominated the no fertilizers site while Proteobacteria dominated Inorganic fertilizer. The diversity analysis showed that the abundance of endophytic bacteria in all the sites is in the order organic fertilizer (FK) > no fertilizer (CK) > inorganic fertilizer (NK). Furthermore, the major nutrient cycling pathways identified are linked with nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism which were higher in FK samples. Going by the results obtained, this study suggests that organic fertilizer could be a boost to sustainable agricultural practices and should be encouraged. Also, a lot of novel endophytic bacteria groups were identified in maize. Mapping out strategies to isolate and purify this novel endophytic bacteria could help in promoting sustainable agriculture alongside biotechnological applications in future.","Fadiji, Ayomide Emmanuel; Ayangbenro, Ayansina Segun; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti",Antonie leeuwenhoek,,230

This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID­19 outbreak between January and March 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 0-3). The chi-squared &#967;² test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender. RESULTS Study questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff. The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours. Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID­19 infection. The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID­19 provided psychological benefit. CONCLUSIONS The COVID­19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province. Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID­19 infection should be recognized as factors that may encourage medical staff to work during future epidemics.","Cai, Haozheng; Tu, Baoren; Ma, Jing; Chen, Limin; Fu, Lei; Jiang, Yongfang; Zhuang, Quan",Med Sci Monit,,230
317279,Acute peritoneal dialysis in COVID-19,2020,"The outbreak of COVID 19 has increased the anxiety and stress among teachers and students. This has increased the need for gamified learning systems (GLS) to make the educational process more attractive and increase the engagement as well as the participation of all stakeholders. The use of GLS in teaching and learning has not been deployed effectively in the educational systems in developing countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictors of using GLS in Iraqi smart schools. Building on the literature, a framework of GLS is proposed. Data used in this study were collected from 394 teachers and managerial staff in Iraqi smart schools and analysed using Partial Least Square. The findings showed that individuals and organizations are important predictors of using GLS, and their effects on BI are mediated by satisfaction. Readiness and performance expectancy are critical for adopting and using GLS by smart schools. In addition, the findings showed that gamification and self-efficacy are moderating variables. Important implications of the predictability of GLS using a combination of theories as well as the practical suggestions for decision makers to enhance the adoption of GLS among smart schools in Iraq are discussed. In the time of COVID-19, decision makers have suggested increasing gamification features of teaching and learning to reduce anxiety and achieve a better learning process.","Alsamawi, Farazdaq Nahedh; Kurnaz, Sefer",Appl Nanosci,,230

320064,Two cases of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) with transient viral elevation using semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and symptom relapse after completion of 10 days of favipiravir treatment,2020,"Kinases are a group of therapeutic targets involved in the progression of numerous diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and viral infections. The majority of approved antiviral agents are inhibitors of virus-specific targets that are encoded by individual viruses. These inhibitors are narrow-spectrum agents that can cause resistance development. Viruses are dependent on host cellular proteins, including kinases, for progression of their life-cycle. Thus, targeting kinases is an important therapeutic approach to discovering broad-spectrum antiviral agents. As there are a large number of FDA approved kinase inhibitors for various indications, their repurposing for viral infections is an attractive and time-sparing strategy. Many kinase inhibitors, including baricitinib, ruxolitinib, imatinib, tofacitinib, pacritinib, zanubrutinib, and ibrutinib, are under clinical investigation for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss FDA approved kinase inhibitors, along with a repertoire of clinical/preclinical stage kinase inhibitors that possess antiviral activity or are useful in the management of viral infections.","Raghuvanshi, Rinky; Bharate, Sandip B",J. med. chem,,230

Important efforts are being organized worldwide to implement sewage-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 that can be used for preventive or early warning purposes, informing preparedness and response measures. However, its successful implementation requires important and iterative methodological improvements, as well as the establishment of standardized methods. The aim of this study was to develop a continuous monitoring protocol for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, that could be used to model virus circulation within the communities, complementing the current clinical surveillance. Specific objectives included (1) optimization and validation of a method for virus quantification;(2) monitoring the time-evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the city of Porto, Portugal. Untreated wastewater samples were collected weekly from the two WWTPs between May 2020 and March 2021, encompassing two COVID-19 incidence peaks in the region (mid-November 2020 and mid-January 2021). In the first stage of this study, we compared, optimized and selected a sampling and analysis protocol that included virus concentration through centrifugation, RNA extraction from both liquid and solid fractions and quantification by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). In the second stage, we used the selected methodology to track SARS-CoV-2 in the collected wastewater over time. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 39 and 37 out of 48 liquid and solid fraction samples of untreated wastewater, respectively. The copy numbers varied throughout the study between 0 and 0.15 copies/ng RNA and a good fit was observed between the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the untreated wastewater and the COVID-19 temporal trends in the study region. We also analyzed eight samples from the treated effluent and found no SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection after tertiary treatment and UV disinfection. In agreement with the recent literature, the results from this study support the use of wastewater-based surveillance to complement clinical testing and evaluate temporal and spatial trends of the current pandemic.","Tomasino, Maria Paola Semedo Miguel Vieira Pedro Ferraz Elza Rocha Adelaide Carvalho Maria F.; Magalhães, Catarina Mucha Ana P.",Science of The Total Environment,,230

322196,"The ""Infodemic"" of COVID-19",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for countries and health professionals worldwide. Viral entry by ACE-2 receptor and an excessive activation of the immune system are key to understand both incidence and severity of disease. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) represents a special condition associated with an inordinate response of the immune system to external agents. IBD treatments have been associated to an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections. This has raised the question of possible higher incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection in IBD patients. Several papers have been published during this year of pandemic to answer that question. Moreover, COVID-19 vaccination offers great promise in controlling infection in patients with IBD. Based on current evidence, patients with IBD do not have a higher incidence of COVID-19 than the general population, and they do not have worse disease evolution. Advanced age and presence of a greater number of comorbidities have been associated with worse outcomes, similar to the general population. Corticosteroids are associated to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, higher hospitalization rate and higher risk of severe COVID-19. 5-ASA / Sulfasalazine and Thiopurines have a possible increased risk of severe COVID-19, although studies are lacking. On the other hand, Anti-TNF may have a possible protective effect. It is recommended to maintain the treatment. Anti-IL-12/23, anti-integrins and tofacitinib have results comparable to anti-TNF. Based on the efficacy, expert recommendations, and the absence of other evidence, it is recommended that patients with IBD be vaccinated.","Suria, Carles; Bosca-Watts, Marta M; Navarro, Pablo; Tosca, Joan; Anton, Rosario; Sanahuja, Ana; Revaliente, Marta; Miguel Minguez, M",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

However, more evidence is needed to understand the population-level impact of the US vaccination rollout in the face of the changing landscape of COVID-19 pandemic in the US, including variants with higher transmissibility and immune escape. ObjectiveTo quantify the population-level impact of the US vaccination campaign in averting cases, hospitalizations and deaths from December 12, 2020 to June 28, 2021. DesignAge-stratified agent-based model which included transmission dynamics of the Alpha, Gamma and Delta variants in addition to the original Wuhan-1 variant. SettingOur model was calibrated to COVID-19 outbreak and vaccine rollout in the US. Model predictions were made at the country level. ParticipantsSimulated age-stratified population representing US demographics. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCases, hospitalizations and deaths averted by vaccination against COVID-19 in the US, compared to the counterfactuals of no vaccination and vaccination administered at half the actual pace. ResultsThe swift vaccine rollout in the US curbed a potential resurgence of cases in April 2021, which would have been otherwise fuelled by the Alpha variant. Compared to the scenario without vaccines, we estimated that the actual vaccination program averted more than 26 million cases, 1.2 million hospitalizations and saved 279,000 lives. A vaccination campaign with half the actual rollout rate would have led to an additional 460,000 hospitalizations and 121,000 deaths. Conclusions and RelevanceThe COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US has had an extraordinary impact on reducing disease burden despite the emergence of highly transmissible variants. These findings highlight that the pace of vaccination was essential for mitigating COVID-19 in the US, and underscore the urgent need to close the vaccine coverage gaps in communities across the country.

322395,COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancies: Considering the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors,2021,"The D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein emerged in early 2020 and quickly became the dominant circulating strain in Europe and its environs. The variant was characterized by the higher viral load, which is not associated with disease severity, higher incorporation into the virion, and high cell entry via ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. Previous strains of the coronavirus and the current SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the selection of mutations as a mechanism of escaping immune responses. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energy analysis to provide insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and describe the neutralization mechanism of this variant. Our results show that the D614G S-protein adopts distinct conformational dynamics which is skewed towards the open-state conformation more than the closed-state conformation of the wild-type S-protein. Residue-specific variation of amino acid flexibility and domain-specific RMSD suggest that the mutation causes an allosteric conformational change in the RBD. Evaluation of the interaction energies between the S-protein and neutralizing antibodies show that the mutation may enhance, reduce or not affect the neutralizing interactions depending on the neutralizing antibody, especially if it targets the RBD. The results of this study have shed insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and provided a glimpse of the neutralization mechanism of this variant.","Kwarteng, Alexander; Asiedu, Ebenezer; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; Larbi, Amma; Sakyi, Samuel Asamoah; Asiedu, Samuel Opoku",Infect Genet Evol,,230

Although the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown by pooled analyses from randomized controlled trials, elderly patients still receive adjuvant chemotherapy less frequently than younger patients. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients based on observational studies in which the elderly patients would likely be representative of those encountered in real-world clinical settings. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Observational studies that investigated the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection in elderly patients (age &#8805; 70 years) with colon or rectal cancer were included. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and OS were assessed. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: Eleven studies in elderly patients with colon cancer were included. No relevant study was identified for rectal cancer. Elderly patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly higher 5-year OS rate than those who did not (risk ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.29-1.76, P < 0.001). There was also a significant improvement in OS in elderly patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.66, P < 0.001). The overall risk of bias was judged to be critical for both outcomes. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy provides a survival benefit for elderly patients with colon cancer, although the quality of evidence is low.","Hoshino, Nobuaki; Aoyama, Ryuhei; Hida, Koya",Int. j. clin. oncol,,230

While we have been willingly moving towards open societies and reducing movement barriers, there is a need to be prepared for minimizing the openness of society on occasions such as large pandemics, which are low probability events with massive impacts. Certainly, similar to many phenomena, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us its own geography presenting its emergence and evolving patterns as well as taking advantage of our geographical settings for escalating its spread. Hence, this study aims at presenting a data-driven approach for exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of the pandemic over a regional scale, i.e., Europe and a country scale, i.e., Denmark, and also what geographical variables potentially contribute to expediting its spread. We used official regional infection rates, points of interest, temperature and air pollution data for monitoring the pandemic's spread across Europe and also applied geospatial methods such as spatial autocorrelation and space-time autocorrelation to extract relevant indicators that could explain the dynamics of the pandemic. Furthermore, we applied statistical methods, e.g., ordinary least squares, geographically weighted regression, as well as machine learning methods, e.g., random forest for exploring the potential correlation between the chosen underlying factors and the pandemic spread. Our findings indicate that population density, amenities such as cafes and bars, and pollution levels are the most influential explanatory variables while pollution levels can be explicitly used to monitor lockdown measures and infection rates at country level. The choice of data and methods used in this study along with the achieved results and presented discussions can empower health authorities and decision makers with an interactive decision support tool, which can be useful for imposing geographically varying lockdowns and protectives measures using historical data.","Hass, Frederik Seeup; Jokar Arsanjani, Jamal",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,230

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic time lag between infection and death. In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al 2020, Report #13, Imperial College London] to include (a) population saturation effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more balanced prior on intervention effects and (d) partial pooling of the lockdown intervention covariate.

324287,Balloon embolization of distal left anterior descending artery perforation in a patient with COVID-19,2021,"We have applied nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy based plasma phenotyping to reveal diagnostic molecular signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection via combined diffusional and relaxation editing (DIRE). We compared plasma from healthy age-matched controls (n = 26) with SARS-CoV-2 negative non-hospitalized respiratory patients and hospitalized respiratory patients (n = 23 and 11 respectively) with SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR positive respiratory patients (n = 17, with longitudinal sampling time-points). DIRE data were modelled using principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA), with statistical cross-validation indices indicating excellent model generalization for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 positivity for all comparator groups (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve = 1). DIRE spectra show biomarker signal combinations conferred by differential concentrations of metabolites with selected molecular mobility properties. These comprise the following: (a) composite N-acetyl signals from &#945;-1-acid glycoprotein and other glycoproteins (designated GlycA and GlycB) that were elevated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients [p = 2.52 × 10-10 (GlycA) and 1.25 × 10-9 (GlycB) vs controls], (b) two diagnostic supramolecular phospholipid composite signals that were identified (SPC-A and SPC-B) from the -+N-(CH3)3 choline headgroups of lysophosphatidylcholines carried on plasma glycoproteins and from phospholipids in high-density lipoprotein subfractions (SPC-A) together with a phospholipid component of low-density lipoprotein (SPC-B). The integrals of the summed SPC signals (SPCtotal) were reduced in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients relative to both controls (p = 1.40 × 10-7) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p = 4.52 × 10-8) but were not significantly different between controls and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. The identity of the SPC signal components was determined using one and two dimensional diffusional, relaxation, and statistical spectroscopic experiments. The SPCtotal/GlycA ratios were also significantly different for control versus SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (p = 1.23 × 10-10) and for SARS-CoV-2 negatives versus positives (p = 1.60 × 10-9). Thus, plasma SPCtotal and SPCtotal/GlycA are proposed as sensitive molecular markers for SARS-CoV-2 positivity that could effectively augment current COVID-19 diagnostics and may have value in functional assessment of the disease recovery process in patients with long-term symptoms.","Lodge, Samantha; Nitschke, Philipp; Kimhofer, Torben; Wist, Julien; Bong, Sze-How; Loo, Ruey Leng; Masuda, Reika; Begum, Sofina; Richards, Toby; Lindon, John C; Bermel, Wolfgang; Reinsperger, Tony; Schaefer, Hartmut; Spraul, Manfred; Holmes, Elaine; Nicholson, Jeremy K",Anal Chem,,230
324288,Balloon embolization of distal left anterior descending artery perforation in a patient with COVID-19,2021,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the most common symptom displayed by patients has been a fever, leading to the use of temperature scanning as a preemptive measure to detect potential carriers of the virus. Human employees with handheld thermometers have been used to fulfill this task, however this puts them at risk as they cannot be physically distanced and the sequential nature of this method leads to great inconveniences and inefficiency. The proposed solution is an autonomously navigating robot capable of conversing and scanning people's temperature to detect fevers and help screen for COVID-19. To satisfy this objective, the robot must be able to (1) navigate autonomously, (2) detect and track people, and (3) get individuals' temperature reading and converse with them if it exceeds 38{\deg}C. An autonomously navigating mobile robot is used with a manipulator controlled using a face tracking algorithm, and an end effector consisting of a thermal camera, smartphone, and chatbot. The goal is to develop a functioning solution that performs the above tasks. In addition, technical challenges encountered and their engineering solutions will be presented, and recommendations will be made for enhancements that could be incorporated when approaching commercialization.","Kim, Ryan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09894v1.pdf,230

This review expounds on lessons learned for ICU preparedness during the pandemic and for future mass casualty events. RECENT FINDINGS: In the 21st century, there have already been several outbreaks of infectious diseases that have led to mass casualties creating ICU strain, providing multiple opportunities for hospitals and hospital systems to prepare their ICUs for future events. Unfortunately, the sheer scale and rapidity of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to overwhelming strain on every aspect of ICU disaster preparedness. Yet, by analyzing experiences of hospitals throughout the first 7 months of the current pandemic in the areas of infection control, equipment preparedness, staffing strategies, ICU spatial logistics as well as acute and postacute treatment, various important lessons have already emerged that will prove critical for successful future ICU preparedness. SUMMARY: Preemptive planning, beginning with the early identification of staffing resources, supply chains and alternative equipment sources, coupled with strong infection control practices that also provide for the flexibility for evolving evidence is of utmost importance. However, there is no single approach that can be applied to every health system.","Harris, Gavin; Adalja, Amesh",Curr Opin Pulm Med,,230

It is not known whether the stress of the pandemic is associated with an increase in the incidence of stress cardiomyopathy. Objective: To determine the incidence and outcomes of stress cardiomyopathy during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study at cardiac catheterization laboratories with primary percutaneous coronary intervention capability at 2 hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic health system in Northeast Ohio examined the incidence of stress cardiomyopathy (also known as Takotsubo syndrome) in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome who underwent coronary arteriography. Patients presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic, between March 1 and April 30, 2020, were compared with 4 control groups of patients with acute coronary syndrome presenting prior to the pandemic across 4 distinct timelines: March to April 2018, January to February 2019, March to April 2019, and January to February 2020. Data were analyzed in May 2020. Exposures: Patients were divided into 5 groups based on the date of their clinical presentation in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of stress cardiomyopathy. Results: Among 1914 patient presenting with acute coronary syndrome, 1656 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 67 [59-74]; 1094 [66.1%] men) presented during the pre-COVID-19 period (390 patients in March-April 2018, 309 patients in January-February 2019, 679 patients in March-April 2019, and 278 patients in January-February 2020), and 258 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 67 [57-75]; 175 [67.8%] men) presented during the COVID-19 pandemic period (ie, March-April 2020). There was a significant increase in the incidence of stress cardiomyopathy during the COVID-19 period, with a total of 20 patients with stress cardiomyopathy (incidence proportion, 7.8%), compared with prepandemic timelines, which ranged from 5 to 12 patients with stress cardiomyopathy (incidence proportion range, 1.5%-1.8%). The rate ratio comparing the COVID-19 pandemic period to the combined prepandemic period was 4.58 (95% CI, 4.11-5.11; P < .001). All patients during the COVID-19 pandemic had negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results for COVID-19. Patients with stress cardiomyopathy during the COVID-19 pandemic had a longer median (interquartile range) hospital length of stay compared with those hospitalized in the prepandemic period (COVID-19 period: 8 [6-9] days; March-April 2018: 4 [3-4] days; January-February 2019: 5 [3-6] days; March-April 2019: 4 [4-8] days; January-February: 5 [4-5] days; P = .006). There were no significant differences between the COVID-19 period and the overall pre-COVID-19 period in mortality (1 patient [5.0%] vs 1 patient [3.6%], respectively; P = .81) or 30-day rehospitalization (4 patients [22.2%] vs 6 patients [21.4%], respectively; P = .90).

Maintaining the ability to work of all employees has become an important topic in research although some evidence suggests that some groups of workers need greater attention than others. Healthcare workers (x¯ = 54.46 ± 5.64 years) attending routine occupational health checkups completed their work ability, occupational risk and sociodemographic measures. An analysis examined whether work ability differed according to gender, age and professional category. Mediation of these relationships by occupational risk variables, such as work-family conflict, was examined. Females and older adults had worse work ability than their counterparts. Professional group was not independently associated. Gender-related differences were mediated by current and historic ergonomic risk, psychosocial risk and work-family conflict. Age-related differences were mediated by violence/discrimination at work. All job risk variables, apart from current ergonomic risk, mediated associations between professional category and work ability. The present study identified the importance of risk variables for the work ability of health workers according to gender, age and professional job type. Perceptions of work-family conflict and violence-discrimination seem particularly important and should be considered when targeting improvements in work ability.","Mateo-Rodríguez, Inmaculada; Knox, Emily Caitlin Lily; Oliver-Hernández, Coral; Daponte-Codina, Antonio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,230

After adjustment for the competing risk of death, the cumulative incidence of arterial and venous thromboembolic events (VTE) reached 8.5% after 60 days follow-up. Of note, 8 of 12 VTE were seen in ET. Interestingly, at COVID-19 diagnosis, MPN patients had significantly lower platelet count (p < 0.0001) than in the pre-COVID last follow-up.This decline was remarkably higher in ET (-23.3%, p < 0.0001) than in PV (-16.4%, p = 0.1730) and was associated with higher mortality rate (p = 0.0010) for pneumonia. The effects of possible predictors of thrombosis, selected from those clinically relevant and statistically significant in univariate analysis, were examined in a multivariate model.

Practice-based resources can help overcome implementation challenges. Methods: In 2015, the IGNITE (Implementing GeNomics In pracTicE) Network created an online genomic medicine implementation resource toolbox that was expanded in 2017 to incorporate the ability for users to create targeted implementation guides. This expansion was led by a multidisciplinary team that developed an evidence-based, structured framework for the guides, oversaw the technical process/build, and pilot tested the first guide, CYP2C19-Clopidogrel Testing Implementation. Results: Sixty-five resources were collected from 12 institutions and categorized according to a seven-step implementation framework for the pilot CYP2C19-Clopidogrel Testing Implementation Guide. Five months after its launch, 96 CYP2C19-Clopidogrel Testing Implementation Guides had been created. Eighty percent of the resources most frequently selected by users were created by IGNITE to fill an identified resource gap. Resources most often included in guides were from the test reimbursement (22%), Implementation support gathering (22%), EHR integration (17%), and genetic testing workflow steps (17%). Conclusion: Lessons learned from this implementation guide development process provide insight for prioritizing development of future resources and support the value of collaborative efforts to create resources for genomic medicine implementation.","Duong, Benjamin Q; Arwood, Meghan J; Hicks, J Kevin; Beitelshees, Amber L; Franchi, Francesco; Houder, John T; Limdi, Nita A; Cook, Kelsey J; Owusu Obeng, Aniwaa; Petry, Natasha; Tuteja, Sony; Elsey, Amanda R; Cavallari, Larisa H; Wiisanen, Kristin",Pharmgenomics Pers Med,,230

Transit bipartition with sleeve gastrectomy is derived from biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch and might improve weight loss control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two series of 71 primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and transit bipartition (TB) with a body mass index &#8805; 50 kg/m2 were retrospectively compared after 2 years. Postoperative course, side effects, nutritional status, and weight outcomes were reviewed. Weight was expressed as BMI, percentage of excess BMI lost (%EBMIL), and percentage of total weight lost (%TWL). RESULTS: The 2 groups were comparable for age and BMI of 51.9 ± 1.8 for RYGB and 51.6 ± 5 for TB. TB was longer to perform (92 vs 74 min, p &#8804; 0.001) with a 30-day complication rate of 4.2% and 5.6%, but there was 1 death after RYGB. Weight loss was greater after TB compared with RYGB with %EBMIL of 85.3 ± 15.8% vs 73.9 ± 17.2% (p = 0.0002). One TB patient suffered from protein malnutrition but none after RYGB. After TB, 7% of the patients experienced > 3 stools a day and 1 patient required revision, while 3 patients had diarrhea after RYGB. Late reoperations were required for 7 and 1 patients after RYGB and TB. Comorbidity improvement was similar. CONCLUSION: In a superobese population, TB appeared relatively safer compared with RYGB.

330954,Risk of COVID-19 in Patients with Cancer Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,2021,"The global prevalence of COVID-19 disease and the overwhelming increase in death toll urge scientists to discover new effective drugs. Although the drug discovery process is a challenging and time-consuming, fortunately, the plant kingdom was found to have many active therapeutics possessing broad-spectrum antiviral activity including those candidates active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV). Herein, nine traditional Chinese medicinal plant constituents from different origins (Glycyrrhizin 1, Lycorine 2, Puerarin 3, Daidzein 4, Daidzin 5, Salvianolic acid B 6, Dihydrotanshinone I 7, Tanshinone I 8, Tanshinone IIa 9) previously reported to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV were virtually screened in silico (molecular docking) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The tested medicinal plant compounds were in silico screened for their activity against two key SARS-CoV-2 target proteins;3CLpro, and Spike binding-domain proteins. Among the tested medicinal plant compounds, Salvianolic acid B 6 (Sal-B) showed promising binding affinities against the two specified SARS-CoV-2 target proteins compared to the reference standards used. Hence molecular dynamics simulations followed by calculating the free-binding energy were carried out for Sal-B providing information on its affinity, stability, and thermodynamic behavior within the two SARS-CoV-2 target proteins as well as key ligand-protein binding aspects. Besides, the quantum mechanical calculations showed that Sal-B can adopt different conformations due to the existence of various rotatable bonds. Therefore, the enhanced antiviral activity of Sal-B among other studied compounds can be also attributed to the structural flexibility of Sal-B. Our study gives an explanation of the structure activity relationship required for targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and Spike proteins and also facilitates the future design and synthesis of new potential drugs exhibiting better affinity and specificity. Besides, an ADME study was carried out on screened compounds and reference controls revealing their pharmacokinetics properties.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.","Elmaaty, A. A.; Darwish, K.

The prolonged lockdown deemed to prevent the spreading of the virus also reduced the circulation of money, and hence tax revenues, thus it will ultimately result in fewer finances available for social security and Public Health (3).

PURPOSE: To examine the burden of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV on HCWs and risk factors for infection, using rapid and living review methods. DATA SOURCES: Multiple electronic databases, including the WHO database of publications on coronavirus disease and the medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020), and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections. New evidence will be incorporated on an ongoing basis by using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; verification was done by a second reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: 64 studies met inclusion criteria; 43 studies addressed burden of HCW infections (15 on SARS-CoV-2), and 34 studies addressed risk factors (3 on SARS-CoV-2). Health care workers accounted for a significant proportion of coronavirus infections and may experience particularly high infection incidence after unprotected exposures. Illness severity was lower than in non-HCWs. Depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were common in HCWs during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The strongest evidence on risk factors was on PPE use and decreased infection risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, eye protection, and handwashing; evidence suggested a dose-response relationship. No study evaluated PPE reuse. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Infection control training was associated with decreased risk. LIMITATION: There were few studies on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, the studies had methodological limitations, and streamlined rapid review methods were used. CONCLUSION: Health care workers experience significant burdens from coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2.

To do this, we first prepared a sample of 1040 Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals in Tehran, Rasht, and Bojnord. Then, through the non-parametric statistical runs test, we show that the sample was randomly selected, and it is possible to generalize the result of tests on the sample to the community of hospitalized Covid-19 patients. In continuation, we examined the hypothesis that the smoking prevalence among Covid-19 patients admitted to hospitals is equal to the prevalence rate of smoking in Iranian society. For this purpose, we used the non-parametric chi-square test, and it was observed that this hypothesis is rejected. The data show a significant difference in the prevalence of smoking between critically ill Covid-19 patients and the whole of Iranian society. Additionally, we examined this hypothesis in some subpopulations, and the results were the same.","Bagheri-Nezhad, Sina; Mozayani, Nasser; Abdi, Elham; Rostami, Setareh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13599v3.pdf,230

In this study, we aimed to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of COVID-19 and to identify the role of mean platelet volume (MPV) in predicting the prognosis in children. A single-center retrospective study, including 251 confirmed and 65 suspected COVID-19 cases, was conducted between March 11, 2020, and December 11, 2020. In the confirmed COVID-19 group, 48 (19.1%) patients were asymptomatic, 183 (72.9%) mild, 16 (6.4%) moderate, 1 (0.4%) severe, and 3 were (1.2%) critically ill. Confirmed COVID-19 patients had significantly lower mean values of white blood cell (WBC), absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, platelet, and hemoglobin (p < .001). However, there was no significant difference in MPV levels between the two groups (p = .894). C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, fibrinogen, and NT-pro-BNP mean values were significantly lower in confirmed COVID-19 cases than suspected cases (p < .001). A total of 55 (21.9%) patients required hospitalization due to COVID-19, and MPV, WBC, CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and NT-pro-BNP were statistically higher in hospitalized patients than those in outpatients. The multivariate analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the severity of disease showed that lymphopenia and higher levels of fibrinogen significantly associated with severe clinical symptoms. Decision tree analysis showed that the most powerful predictor of hospitalization due to COVID-19 was the D-dimer (p < .001). MPV values are not associated with COVID-19 disease severity. However, MPV can be used with other parameters such as WBC, CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and NT-pro-BNP to predict hospitalization.","Guner Ozenen, Gizem; Sahbudak Bal, Zumrut; Umit, Zuhal; Bilen, Nimet Melis; Yildirim Arslan, Sema; Yurtseven, Ali; Saz, Eylem Ulas; Burcu, Barutcuoglu; Sertoz, Ruchan; Kurugol, Zafer; Ozkinay, Ferda",J Med Virol,,230

Self-injectors in Malawi and Uganda are currently instructed to store used units in containers and return them to health workers for disposal. However, this may not be feasible in low-resource settings, especially for younger or covert self-injectors. We describe adolescent (15-19 years) and adult (20-49 years) self-injectors' disposal experiences in Uganda and Malawi. When possible, we compare covert and overt users' experiences. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional qualitative studies in 2019 with 50 self-injectors in Uganda and 60 in Malawi. We purposively selected approximately half adolescents and included those trained by clinic-based providers and community health workers. We conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic data analysis and compared the findings across settings. RESULTS: Just under half of both samples were adolescents, substantially more of whom were covert users in Uganda (68%) than Malawi (~ 10%). Most participants reported being told to store used units in a container and return them to health workers. About two-thirds of Uganda participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, most commonly returning them to health workers. Over one-third of Malawi participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, slightly more disposed into latrines compared to returning to health workers. Participants in both settings reported compliance with health workers' disposal instructions as a primary reason for their disposal method. One-fifth of Uganda participants, mostly adolescent covert users, and one-quarter in Malawi said they were told they could dispose into latrines, and often did so. The majority in both settings said they would prefer to dispose units in latrines because they worried about needlestick injuries to others and because it was convenient. Some Uganda adolescent covert users felt returning units to health workers was challenging due to privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: While most self-injectors disposed of used units as instructed, findings from both studies suggest that returning units to health workers is not preferred and may not be feasible for some adolescent covert users. More convenient disposal solutions should be identified.","Burke, Holly M; Packer, Catherine; Wando, Laura; Wandiembe, Symon Peter; Muwereza, Nelson; Pradhan, Subarna; Zingani, Akuzike; Ngwira, Bagrey",Reprod Health,,230

Limited information exists on the virology of ARI in LTCFs, where virological testing is reactive. We report on findings of a surveillance feasibility substudy from a larger prospective trial of introducing rapid influenza diagnostic testing (RIDT) at 10 Wisconsin LTCFs. Any resident with symptoms consistent with ARI had a nasal swab specimen collected for RIDT by staff. Following RIDT, the residual swab was placed into viral transport medium and tested for influenza using Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and for 20 pathogens using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction respiratory pathogen panel. Numbers of viruses in each of 7 categories (influenza A, influenza B, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) across the 3 years were compared using χ2. Totals of 160, 215, and 122 specimens were collected during 2016‒2017, 2017‒2018, and 2018‒2019, respectively. Respiratory pathogen panel identified viruses in 54.8% of tested specimens. Influenza A (19.2%), influenza B (12.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%), and human metapneumovirus (20.9%) accounted for 69% of all detections, whereas coronaviruses (17.2%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (10.5%) and parainfluenza (3.8%) were less common. The distribution of viruses varied significantly across the 3 years (χ2= 71.663; df = 12; P &lt;.001). Surveillance in LTCFs using nasal swabs collected for RIDT is highly feasible and yields high virus identification rates. Significant differences in virus composition occurred across the 3 study years. Simple approaches to surveillance may provide a more comprehensive assessment of respiratory viruses in LTCF settings.","Checovich, Mary M.; Barlow, Shari; Shult, Peter; Reisdorf, Erik; Temte, Jonathan L.",J.

We find the percentage of females in both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than that of the general Twitter user population. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we investigate the opinions expressed towards the hoarding behavior by categorizing these topics according to demographic and geographic groups. We also calculate the anxiety scores for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related tweets using a lexical approach. By comparing their anxiety scores with the baseline Twitter anxiety score, we reveal further insights. The LIWC anxiety mean for the hoarding-related tweets is significantly higher than the baseline Twitter anxiety mean. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated anxiety score compared to other hoarded items mentioned in the tweets.","Zhang, Xupin; Lyu, Hanjia; Luo, Jiebo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07845v2.pdf,230

The aim of this research was to determine the mental health impacts of COVID-19 outbreak and associated drivers among university students in Bangladesh. METHODS: Across-sectional study was performed among 368 participants from Khulna University (Khulna-9208) in Bangladesh. Data were collected through an online self-reported questionnaire including demographic and selected characteristics of the participants, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale to measure the prevalence of anxiety and 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale to measure the prevalence of depression. The ordered logit model was used to determine the associated drivers of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence rates of anxiety were 87%, among them 29.3%, 33.7%, and 23.9% had mild, moderate and severe, respectively. Accordingly, the estimated prevalence rates of depression were 81.5%, among them 25%, 23.9%, 20.1%, and 12.5% had mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe, respectively. The likelihood of anxiety and depression among participants has been mostly derived by residing urban area, not having stable family income, living with parents, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19, being worried about academic delays, and with the disruption of daily-life. CONCLUSIONS: University students are experienced a higher level of anxiety and depressive symptoms in Bangladesh. As the majority of students spend their time in social media during the quarantine, the implications of COVID-19 on mental health in this population can be reduced by means of online consultancy, campaigns and other awareness initiatives.","Khan, A.; Kabir, K.

Here, we proposed to assess the relationship between IL-6 and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our cohort consisted of 46 adult patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in a COVID-19 ward of the Hospital de Braga (HB) from April 7 to May 7, 2020, whose IL-6 levels were followed over time. We found that IL-6 levels were significantly different between the disease stages. Also, we found a significant negative correlation between IL-6 levels during stages IIb and III, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), showing that IL-6 correlates with respiratory failure. Compared to the inflammatory markers available in the clinic routine, we found a positive correlation between IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, when we assessed the predictive value of these two markers, IL-6 behaves as a better predictor of disease progression. In a binary logistic regression, IL-6 level was the most significant predictor of the non-survivors group, when compared to age and CRP. Herein, we present IL-6 as a relevant tool for prognostic evaluation, mainly as a predictor of outcome.","Santa Cruz, André; Mendes-Frias, Ana; Oliveira, Ana Isabel; Dias, Luís; Matos, Ana Rita; Carvalho, Alexandre; Capela, Carlos; Pedrosa, Jorge; Castro, António Gil; Silvestre, Ricardo",Front Immunol,,230

The recent development of even shorter-wavelength UV-C lamps, such as the Krypton-Chloride, 222-nm lamp, has led to greater concerns about the UV-C generation of ozone. It is well known that wavelengths below 240 nm more readily generate ozone. However, there is a great misunderstanding with regard to the actual generation and dissipation of ozone molecules by UV-C lamps. A review of this subject is much warranted.

Little is known, however, about the individuals considering acquiring firearms during the pandemic. Recent research has highlighted that individuals considering acquiring firearms may be motivated by exaggerated threat expectancies. In a sample of 3,500 Americans matched to 2010 United States Census data, we compared individuals intending to buy firearms in the coming 12 months (assessed in late June and early July 2020) to those undecided or not planning to acquire firearms on a range of demographic, anxiety, and firearm ownership variables. Our results indicated that those intending to acquire a firearm in the next twelve months are less tolerant of uncertainty, endorse exaggerated threat expectancies, and are experiencing more severe COVID-19 specific fears. Individuals intending to purchase firearms were also more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation in the past year, to have worked in law enforcement, and to have been considered essential workers during COVID-19. Furthermore, such individuals were more likely to already own firearms and to have purchased firearms during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those intending to purchase firearms did not endorse lower perceived neighborhood safety, however, indicating that their intent to purchase firearms is unlikely to be driven by tangible threats in their immediate environment. These findings highlight that exaggerated fears may be motivating individuals to purchase firearms to diminish anxiety and that this trend may be particularly common among individuals who already own firearms.","Anestis, Michael D; Bryan, Craig J",J Psychiatr Res,,230

A global pandemic like COVID19 poses some serious questions and challenges in the minds of practicing pediatricians as what support to offer our children, theirparents and carers-alleviating their anxiety about their child's diet and nutrition, that is critical at this time of crisis. Although the evidence for pediatric nutrition and COVID19 is not strong, this article aims to critically look into pediatric nutrition during COVID19 pandemic and bring the most recent evidence into limelight and making the right choices with pediatric nutrition. METHODS: We performed a search on recent literature using the search terms ""Covid19"" + ""Children"" + ""Nutrition"" to analyze the current evidence supporting nutrition as a stimulant for covid19. A review article based on the above search results was written to highlight the importance of nutrition during this pandemic. RESULTS: Strong recommendations remain unchanged for breast feeding, healthy complimentary feeding, use of supplemental formula where appropriate, Oral nutritional supplements, Zinc, n-3& n- 6 fatty acids, probiotics all have a certain role to play as a stimulant for Covid19 in children. CONCLUSION: Current evidence emphasizes the use of additional nutritional supplements especially in the ""at risk"" groups, low socio-economic status and children with chronic medical problems. Paediatric nutrition should never be overlooked and ""one size does not fit all"" as every child is different and their individual nutritional needs vary. This review points at the importance nutrition as a stimulant to covid19 in the pediatric population.","Kesavelu, Dhanasekhar; Franklyn, Nithya; Sreedharan, Lekha",Rev Recent Clin Trials,,230

This commentary reviews the concepts related to scientific integrity at a time when science faces important challenges related to the increase number of articles produced regarding research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has ignited another parallel viral pandemic, with science ranging from robust studies to dishonest studies being conducted, posted, and shared at an unprecedented rate. A balance is needed between the benefits of the rapid access to new scientific data and the threat of causing panic or erroneous clinical decisions based on mistakes or misconduct. The truth is that the “scientific research has changed the world” but now, and more than ever, “it needs to change itself”.

We described the application of the Korean response system in one province and outlined the epidemiological features of COVID-19 in the cohort. METHODS: A Rapid Response Team tracked the patients' activities and identified close contacts. A Patient Management Team made decisions regarding the severity of illness, hospital allocation depending on severity, and time of discharge. A national medical center with 155 beds and 4 university-affiliated hospitals with 48 negative-pressure isolation rooms were dedicated for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: As of April 15, 17 400 residents were tested, of whom 111 were confirmed positive cases. Of the 111 patients, 78 were cured and discharged, 2 recovered after mechanical ventilation, and none died. One healthcare worker at the national center tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 412 staff members at the center were tested, but there were no additional infections. Cough (30.0 %) was the most common initial symptom, whereas anosmia and ageusia were the first symptoms in 14.7% and 15.7% of the patients, respectively. Overall, 25 patients (22.5%) reported having no symptoms at admission and 7 (6.3%) remained asymptomatic at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A response system that enabled the early detection of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases, and timely quarantine of these patients and their contacts, along with efficient allocation of medical resources, was the key to curbing the COVID-19 outbreak in Gyeongsangnam-do Province.","Wi, Yu Mi; Lim, Su Jin; Kim, Si-Ho; Lim, Seungjin; Lee, Su Jin; Ryu, Byung-Han; Hong, Sun In; Cho, Oh-Hyun; Moon, Kyunglan; Hong, Kyung-Wook; Kim, Sunjoo; Bae, In-Gyu",Clin. infect. dis,,230

This case report aims to introduce the use of hyperthermia, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of unresectable gastric cancer in a patient implanted with a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS). CASE REPORT A 55-year-old man with dermatomyositis, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in situ and double synchronous gastric cancer was found to have unresectable gastric disease during surgery despite neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Postoperatively, he received chemotherapy with RF hyperthermia. The patient had a VNS implant to treat epileptic seizures. VNS failure due to RF hyperthermia was an area of significant concern, and the procedures were completed with a full preparation to manage epileptic seizures in the event of its anticipated occurrence. Twenty-one thermotherapies were performed over 21 weeks. After 3 courses of S-1 chemotherapy (12 weeks) with RF hyperthermia without any adverse events, the regimen was changed to S-1+ CDDP combination chemotherapy (SP) and RF hyperthermia. The patient continued to receive treatment with a decrease in the size of the primary gastric tumors as well as lymph node metastases, without major adverse events, until he died due to disseminated disease. CONCLUSIONS We report the first case of unresectable gastric cancer with VNS implants in which chemo-hyperthermal therapy was safe and successful. This case report highlights the importance of providing a multidisciplinary treatment with appropriate measures for patients with intractable cancer who have received special treatments for underlying comorbidities.","Sawai, Hirozumi; Ueno, Shuhei; Yamaguchi, Yoshimi; Suzuki, Yuka; Murata, Akemi; Suganuma, Enami; Yamamoto, Kazuya; Kuzuya, Hiromasa; Koide, Shuji; Kurimoto, Masaaki; Yanagi, Takeshi; Koide, Hajime; Kamiya, Atsushi",Am J Case Rep,,230

This study aimed to investigate clinicopathologic characteristics of colorectal NECs and elucidate genomic differences and similarities between colorectal NECs and colorectal adenocarcinomas (ACs). A total of 30 colorectal NECs were screened for frequently identified CRC oncogenic driver genes by targeted next-generation sequencing of 382 genes. The median age of the patients was 67 years (range, 44 to 88 years). NECs occurred predominantly in the rectum (47%) and exhibited multiple adverse prognostic pathologic factors, including frequent lymphatic and vascular invasions, high rates of lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis and advanced TNM stage. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates of NEC patients were 46.7%, 36.4%, and 32.7%, respectively, with a median overall survival period of 11.5 months. In a molecular analysis, NECs showed high rates of BRAF mutation (23%), predominantly p.V600E (71%), and alterations in RB1 (47%), particularly deletion (57%). The frequencies and distributions of other genes, such as KRAS, APC, SMAD4, and PIK3CA, and microsatellite instability status were similar to those of ACs. These findings provide beneficial information for selecting therapeutic options, including targeted therapy, and a better understanding of the histogenesis of this tumour.","Lee, Sun Mi; Sung, Chang Ohk",Sci Rep,,230

358757,A complex COVID-19 case with rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a sense of urgency in the research community in their bid to contribute to the evidence required for healthcare policy decisions. With such urgency, researchers experience methodological challenges to maintain the rigour and transparency of their work. With this in mind, we offer reflections on our recent experience of undertaking a rapid Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis (QES). METHODS: This process paper, using a reflexive approach, describes a rapid QES prepared during, and in response to, the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: This paper reports the methodological decisions we made and the process we undertook. We place our decisions in the context of guidance offered in relation to rapid reviews and previously conducted QESs. We highlight some of the challenges we encountered in finding the balance between the time needed for thoughtfulness and comprehensiveness whilst providing a rapid response to an urgent request for evidence. CONCLUSION: The need for more guidance on rapid QES remains, but such guidance needs to be based on actual worked examples and case studies. This paper and the reflections offered may provide a useful framework for others to use and further develop.","Biesty, Linda; Meskell, Pauline; Glenton, Claire; Delaney, Hannah; Smalle, Mike; Booth, Andrew; Chan, Xin Hui S; Devane, Declan; Houghton, Catherine",Syst Rev,,230
358886,An Analysis on the Use of Twitter Pertaining to COVID Gastrointestinal Symptoms,2020,"TOPIC: Systematic review of risk factors for non-adherence and non-persistence to intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection therapy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Lack of adherence (non-adherence) or under-treatment (non-persistence) with respect to evidence from clinical trials remains a significant barrier to optimizing real-world outcomes for patients with nAMD. Contributing factors and strategies to address this are poorly understood. METHODS: Studies that reported factors for non-adherence and/or non-persistence to anti-VEGF therapy as well as studies examining strategies to improve this were included. Trial eligibility and data extraction were conducted according to Cochrane review methods. Risk of bias was assessed using the Mixed Method Assessment Tool and certainty of evidence evaluated according to the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) tool. Data were collated descriptively. RESULTS: Of the 1284 abstract results screened, 124 articles were assessed in full and 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. Definitions of non-adherence and non-persistence varied or were not reported. Non-persistence occurred early with up to 50% of patients stopping treatment by 24 months. High rates of non-adherence were similarly reported, occurring in 32 - 95% of patients. Certainty of this finding was downgraded to moderate level due to heterogeneity in definitions used across studies. Multiple factors determine non-adherence and non-persistence, including at condition, therapy, patient, social/economic and health systems/health-care team level. Moderate quality evidence points to lower baseline vision and poorer response to treatment as condition-related variables. The effects of other factors were of lower certainty, predominantly due to small numbers and potential biases in retrospective assessment. Although many factors are non-modifiable (e.g., patient co-morbidity), other factors are potentially correctable (e.g., lack of transport or mismatched patient expectations). Evidence on strategies to improve adherence and persistence is limited, but where available, these have proven effective. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of factors related to poor patient adherence and persistence in nAMD could help identify at-risk populations and improve real world outcomes. Further work is required to develop uniform definitions as well as establishing high quality evidence on interventions that can be easily implemented.","Okada, Mali; Mitchell, Paul; Finger, Robert P; Eldem, Bora; Talks, S James; Hirst, Ceri; Paladini, Luciano; Barratt, Jane; Wong, Tien Yin; Loewenstein, Anat",Ophthalmology,,230
358995,COVID-19 and ABO blood groups,2020,"The public sector primary care facilities in Cape Town serve a large number of patients with chronic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Prior to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, stable patients with chronic conditions attended the facility or support groups to obtain their medication. During the COVID-19 epidemic, these patients would be put at risk if they had to travel and gather in groups to receive medication. The Metropolitan Health Services, therefore, decided to offer home delivery of medication. A system of home delivery was rapidly established by linking the existing chronic dispensing unit system with the emerging approach to community-orientated primary care in the Metro. Medication was delivered as usual to primary care pharmacies, but then a variety of means were used to disseminate the parcels to local non-profit organisations, where they could be delivered by a city-wide network of community health workers (CHWs). Innovations included various ways of delivering the parcels, including via Uber, bicycles and electric scooters, as well as Google forms to monitor the success of the initiative. It was estimated that up to 200 000 parcels per month could be delivered in this way via 2500 CHWs. The new system was established throughout the Metropole, and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats are further discussed. The initiative may prevent COVID-19 amongst people with comorbidities who would be at risk of more severe diseases. It may also have de-congested primary care facilities ahead of the expected surge in COVID-19 cases.","Brey, Zameer; Mash, Robert; Goliath, Charlyn; Roman, Darrin",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,,230
358996,COVID-19 and ABO blood groups,2020,"The objective of this review was to identify the most significant studies reporting on COVID-19 during pregnancy and to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and perinatal outcomes. Eligibility criteria included all reports, reviews; case series with more than 100 individuals and that reported at least three of the following: maternal characteristics, maternal COVID-19 clinical presentation, pregnancy outcomes, maternal outcomes and/or neonatal/perinatal outcomes. We included eight studies that met the inclusion criteria, representing 10,966 cases distributed in 15 countries around the world until July 20, 2020. The results of our review demonstrate that the maternal characteristics, clinical symptoms, maternal and neonatal outcomes almost 11,000 cases of COVID-19 and pregnancy described in 15 different countries are not worse or different from the general population. We suggest that pregnant women are not more affected by the respiratory complications of COVID-19, when compared to the outcomes described in the general population. We also suggest that the important gestational shift Th1-Th2 immune response, known as a potential contributor to the severity in cases of viral infections during pregnancy, are counter-regulated by the enhanced-pregnancy-induced ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis. Moreover, the relatively small number of reported cases during pregnancy does not allow us to affirm that COVID-19 is more aggressive during pregnancy. Conversely, we also suggest, that down-regulation of ACE2 receptors induced by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry might have been detrimental in subjects with pre-existing ACE2 deficiency associated with pregnancy. This association might explain the worse perinatal outcomes described in the literature.","Figueiro-Filho, Ernesto Antonio; Yudin, Mark; Farine, Dan",J Perinat Med,,230
359894,Association of ABO blood group type with cardiovascular events in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted pharmacy practice. Little research has been done to assess how COVID-19 has affected pharmacists' employment, workload, and feelings of burnout. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists' employment status, workload, and feelings of burnout, as well as to examine emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. METHODS: Wisconsin pharmacists were surveyed using an online instrument between August 25, 2020, and September 22, 2020. The data analysis, performed in December 2020, examined employment status, 3 common burnout risk factors (workload, rewards, and social depersonalization), and emotional health concerns related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1300 pharmacists, 439 completed the survey (33.8%). The study analysis included pharmacists in community (n = 127) and hospital or health system (n = 107) settings. With regard to employment changes and workload, hospital pharmacists (36%) were more likely to have their hours reduced than community pharmacists (13%) (P < 0.01), and, conversely, community pharmacists (19%) were more likely to have their hours increased than hospital pharmacists (8%) (P = 0.01). For the burnout domain of workload, 45% of the pharmacists reported increased feelings of physical exhaustion at work, and 53% reported increased feelings of emotional exhaustion at work, with no difference between settings. Regarding the burnout domain of rewards, 6% of the hospital pharmacists and 1% of the community pharmacists experienced a reduction in hourly wages or salaries as a result of COVID-19. For the burnout domain of depersonalization, 25% of the pharmacists reported that their ability to connect with colleagues and patients decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional emotional health concerns reported by the pharmacists included 40% experiencing more anxiety and 25% experiencing more sadness or depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no difference between settings. CONCLUSION: This study found that the burnout domains related to workload, rewards, and depersonalization were negatively affected by COVID-19. Pharmacy managers need to proactively combat burnout as well as be reactive when employees show signs of burnout to maintain their workforce and meet the COVID-19-associated challenges.","Bakken, Brianne K; Winn, Aaron N",,,230

360292,Significance of Sjögren's syndrome and anti-cN1A antibody in myositis patients,2021,"The novel SARS-CoV-2 is expanding internationally. While the current focus is on limiting its transmission from direct contact with infected patients and surfaces during the pandemic, the secondary transmission potential via sewage should not be underestimated, especially in low-income and developing countries with weak wastewater treatment technologies. Recent studies have indicated SARS-CoV-2 positivity also be detected in the feces of patients. Therefore, the risk of transmission and infection can be increased into sewage by the fecal-oral way, mainly in some parts of the globe with a high amount of open defecation. This review collected scattered data and recent studies about the direct and indirect effects of coronavirus in the water cycle. The direct impacts of COVID-19 on wastewater are related to the presence of the coronavirus and suitable viral removal methods in different phases of treatment in wastewater treatment plants. The indirect effects of COVID-19 on wastewater are related to the overuse of cleaning and disinfecting products to protect against viral infection and the overuse of certain drugs to protect against virus or novel mental problems and panic to COVID-19 and consequently their presence in wastewater. This unexpected situation leads to changes in the quality of wastewater and brings adverse and harmful effects for the human, aquatic organisms, and the environment. Therefore, applying effective wastewater treatment technologies with low toxic by-products in wastewater treatment plants will be helpful to prevent the increasing occurrence of these extra contaminants in the environment.","Teymoorian, Termeh Teymourian Targol Kowsari Elaheh Ramakrishna Seeram",Journal of Water Process Engineering,,230

Our work is inspired by the observation that epidemics can be controlled through decentralized disease-control strategies such as quarantining, sheltering in place, social distancing, etc., where individuals actively modify their contact rates with others in response to observations of infection levels in the population. Accounting for a time lag in observations and categorizing individuals into distinct sub-populations based on their risk profiles, we show that the actSIS model manifests qualitatively different features as compared with the SIS model. In a homogeneous population of risk-averters, the endemic equilibrium is always reduced, although the transient infection level can exhibit overshoot or undershoot. In a homogeneous population of risk-tolerating individuals, the system exhibits bistability, which can also lead to reduced infection. For a heterogeneous population comprised of risk-tolerators and risk-averters, we prove conditions on model parameters for the existence of a Hopf bifurcation and sustained oscillations in the infected population.","Zhou, Yunxiu; Levin, Simon A.; Leonard, Naomi E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01424v1.pdf,230
362037,Ventilación mecánica simultánea con un solo ventilador a varios pacientes,2020,"Recently, several genetic variants have been associated with increased or decreased risks of becoming infected and/or seriously ill with COVID-19-not only offering important potential medical benefits but also posing critical ethical questions. These genetic factors, some of which are associated with blood type, may account for variations in observed responses to COVID-19. Hence, assessments of these genetic differences and blood type could provide possible benefits in gauging patients' risks of disease acquisition and prioritising allocation of interventions or vaccines, if supplies are limited. The media has widely reported these findings, and people online are now discussing their blood type and its possible effects on their COVID-19 risks, but several ethical concerns arise. Individuals possessing genetic variants or blood types associated with lower risk may engage in 'risk compensation', erroneously assuming that they can protect themselves less, and hence less frequently wearing masks or washing hands. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many physicians, hospitals, patients, policymakers, members of the public, testing companies and others may well consider these factors in making critical prevention/treatment decisions. Researchers, providers and others should thus begin to address these concerns. Increased awareness and education aimed at providers, patients, family members, public health officials, political leaders and the public-at-large are critical. Attitudinal research is vital to examine how providers, patients and the public understand these findings. Ethical frameworks and guidelines are needed, addressing whether such genetic information should be incorporated into decisions regarding allocation of scarce resources-including hospital and ICU beds, ventilators, medications (eg, remdesivir) and vaccines-and if so, how.","Klitzman, Robert",J. med. ethics,,230

In this sensing system, an intelligent multi-signal readout interface (MSRI) with multidimensional response-ability to thermal stimulus was developed and utilized as a sensing element. A bio-bar-code photothermal probe peptides@H2N-HCNTs acted as a target associated photothermal agent anchored on MSRI via competitive reaction. The multi-signal assay of target was realized under the driven of 808 nm laser, photo-to-thermal conversion effect of photothermal probe caused dramatically thermal energy increase on MSRI. As a result, the competitive recognition events were translated into several detectable signals on MSRI, including a local temperature elevation, a visual color change from blue to green as well as weight loss on MSRI, all of these signals were proportional to the target concentration. This assay has been successfully applied in field work for detecting zearalenone (ZEN), a common mycotoxin in grain food, with linear ranger from 10-7 ng/mL to 10-1 ng/mL and detection limits of 1.06 × 10-7 ng/mL. Combination of the different signal principles was expected to result in more reliable and precise results. Accordingly, this creatively designed MSR-system not only provided a platform for sensitive monitor of mycotoxin but also offered new method for reliable and affordable personal assays in daily life and low-resource setting.","Chen, Yanjie; Zhang, Shupei; Huang, Yitian; Lv, Liang; Dai, Hong; Lin, Yanyu",Biosens Bioelectron,,230

The objective of this study was to assess the craving and withdrawal coping mechanisms used by patients with SUDs as a result of disruption in availability of substances and medications due to sudden lockdown in response to coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A survey was administered via telephone from June 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020, to patients who had previously attended the substance use clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India from January 1, 2020, to March 21, 2020 (up to the time of lockdown). Sociodemographic and clinical details were obtained from case record files. A 16-item questionnaire was developed to collect information on coping with craving and withdrawal symptoms. A total of 215 patients were registered in the substance use clinic during this period for the treatment of SUDs, and of those, 43 could not be contacted due to various reasons such as wrong contact numbers, patient expired (not related to substance withdrawal), or not willing to talk. The mean age of the subjects was 37.05 (SD = 13.22) years, and men outnumbered women. The remaining 172 patients were contacted via telephone, and responses were gathered regarding withdrawal symptoms and coping with craving. RESULTS: More than two-thirds of the patients were still maintaining abstinence from their primary substance of abuse during lockdown. A large number of patients (n = 41, 43.2%) reported difficulty in obtaining prescribed medication for detoxification without renewal of their prescription. More than 66% of patients reported that they were able to control their craving, and many kept themselves busy with household activities. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who had completed the acute phase of withdrawals were able to maintain abstinence in the absence of renewal of prescribed medication and substance of abuse due to sudden disruption in supply.

367662,Characterizing the Anticancer Treatment Trajectory and Pattern in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer Using Harmonized Observational Databases: Retrospective Study,2021,"Many plants produce secondary metabolites (PSMs) with antiviral activities. Among the antiviral PSMs, lipophilic terpenoids in essential oils can disturb the lipid envelope of viruses. Phenols and polyphenols (flavonoids, rosmarinic acid and tannins) attack viral proteins present in the viral membrane or inside the virus particle. Both phenolics and essential oils are active against free viral particles but not-or to a lesser degree-after a virus has entered a host cell. Another group of PSMs is directed against DNA or RNA. These are DNA intercalators such as sanguinarine, berberine, emetine and other isoquinoline alkaloids, ss-carboline, and quinoline alkaloids such as quinine, cinchonine, dictamine and skimmianine. The DNA intercalators stabilize double-stranded nucleic acids and inhibit the replication, transcription, and translation of genetic material. These alkaloids can inhibit viral development and viral replication in cells, as shown for SARS-CoV-1 and other viruses. Since chloroquine (which is also a DNA intercalator and a chemical derivative of the alkaloid quinine) is apparently clinically helpful against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, it is assumed that intercalating alkaloids, or the medicinal plants producing them, may be interesting candidates for the development of new antiviral drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Wink, Michael",Diversity,,230

368069,Severe COVID-19 disease in two pediatric oncology patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic since March 11th, 2020. Despite emerging reports and literature covering a broad spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations, facets of COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated. To the authors' concern, sinus bradycardia as a manifestation of COVID-19-induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) has never been reported before. CASE PRESENTATION: In this paper, we report a case of a 59-year-old male patient with confirmed COVID-19 initially presented with presyncope. Further investigations reveal sinus bradycardia related to COVID-19-induced SIADH. This case highlights the possibility of immuno-neuroendocrino-cardiovascular crosstalk resulting in an atypical manifestation of COVID-19: near syncope due to sinus bradycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Another possible cause of sinus bradycardia in COVID-19 is electrolyte imbalance due to COVID-19-related SIADH.","Amir, Muzakkir; Renata, Andi; Ratana, Levina Tri",BMC Infect Dis,,230
368760,Post-Mortem Investigations for the Diagnosis of Sepsis: A Review of Literature,2020,"A severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was identified in December 2019 (COVID-19), spread rapidly and has become a world-wide public health challenge. About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.","Fu, Binqing; Xu, Xiaoling; Wei, Haiming",J Transl Med,,230
369167,CT imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia: initial experience from Turkey,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been having a severe and catastrophic effect on humankind and is being considered the most crucial health calamity of the century. One of the best methods of detecting COVID-19 is from radiological images, namely X-rays and Computed Tomography or CT scan images. Many companies and educational organizations have come together during this crisis and created various Deep Learning models for the effective diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest radiography images. For example, the University of Waterloo, along with Darwin AI, has designed its Deep Learning model COVID-Net and created a dataset called COVIDx, consisting of 13,975 images. In this study, COGNEXs Deep Learning Software-VisionPro Deep Learning is used to classify these Chest X-rays from the COVIDx dataset. The results are compared with the results of COVID-Net and various other state of the art Deep Learning models from the open-source community. Deep Learning tools are often referred to as black boxes because humans cannot interpret how or why a model is classifying an image into a particular class. This problem is addressed by testing VisionPro Deep Learning with two settings, firstly by selecting the entire image, that is, selecting the entire image as the Region of Interest-ROI, and secondly by segmenting the lungs in the first step, and then doing the classification step on the segmented lungs only, instead of using the entire image. VisionPro Deep Learning results-on the entire image as the ROI it achieves an overall F-score of 94.0 percent, and on the segmented lungs, it gets an F-score of 95.3 percent, which is at par or better than COVID-Net and other state of the art open-source Deep Learning models.","Sarkar, Arjun; Vandenhirtz, Joerg; Nagy, Jozsef; Bacsa, David; Riley, Mitchell",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00597v2.pdf,230

BACKGROUND: Oral health care needs for older people are increasing. Remote interventions using e-Health can ensure oral care is provided despite physical hindrances or situations where dental appointments are limited such as has happened more widely during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mixed-method nested study within a pilot trial. Dental patients (n = 150) at an outreach primary dental care centre, &#8805; 65 years old, were recruited and randomly allocated to e-Oral health text messages or leaflet intervention arms. Post-intervention (6 months), participants responded to open and closed-ended two-way survey phone texts. Survey questions investigated: (a) whether they would recommend the intervention, (b) intervention helpfulness and (c) OPEN feedback. Average helpfulness scores (Scale:1= Very Helpful to 5= Not Helpful at All) were compared for each arm using Independent Sample t-test. Percentage of participants providing positive recommendations in each arm were compared using chi-squared tests. Qualitative findings were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: N = 68 (45%) responded. Mean helpfulness scores in text group M = 2.2, SD=1.1) and leaflet group M = 2.3, SD=1.9, P = .29. Amongst the text arm respondents, 89% compared with 68.2% in leaflet arm; P = .005 would recommend the intervention. Four qualitative themes were outlined: intervention approach, content, behavioural impact and recommendations. CONCLUSION: e-Oral Health text interventions are acceptable and helpful to older people, but these messages need to be tailored.","Wanyonyi, Kristina; Couch, Courtney; John, Jeyanthi; Louca, Chris",Gerodontology,,230

371449,Management of hospitalized patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and COVID-19 infection,2020,"'Bentong' ginger is the most popular variety of Zingiber officinale in Malaysia. It is vegetatively propagated and requires a high proportion of rhizomes as starting planting materials. Besides, ginger vegetative propagation using its rhizomes is accompanied by several types of soil-borne diseases. Plant tissue culture techniques have been applied in many plant species to produce their disease-free planting materials. As 'Bentong' ginger is less known for its micropropagation, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of Clorox (5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)) on explant surface sterilization, effects of plant growth regulators, and basal media on shoots' multiplication and rooting. The secondary metabolites and antioxidant activities of the micropropagated plants were evaluated in comparison with conventionally propagated plants. Rhizome sprouted buds were effectively sterilized in 70% Clorox for 30 min by obtaining 75% contamination-free explants. Murashige and Skoog (MS) supplemented with 10 µM of zeatin was the suitable medium for shoot multiplication, which resulted in the highest number of shoots per explant (4.28). MS medium supplemented with 7.5 µM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) resulted in the highest number of roots per plantlet. The in vitro-rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized with a 95% survival rate in the ex vitro conditions. The phytochemical analysis showed that total phenolic acid and total flavonoid content and antioxidant activities of the micropropagated plants were not significantly different from the conventionally propagated plants of 'Bentong' ginger. In conclusion, the present study's outcome can be adopted for large-scale propagation of disease-free planting materials of 'Bentong' ginger.","Zahid, Nisar Ahmad; Jaafar, Hawa Z E; Hakiman, Mansor",,,230

Thus, our objective was to compare incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in students and staff in Massachusetts public schools among districts with different physical distancing requirements. State guidance mandates masking for all school staff and for students in grades 2 and higher; the majority of districts required universal masking. METHODS: Community incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 cases among students in grades K-12 and staff participating in-person learning, and district infection control plans were linked. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) for students and staff members in districts with &#8805;3 versus &#8805;6 feet of physical distancing were estimated using log-binomial regression; models adjusted for community incidence are also reported. RESULTS: Among 251 eligible school districts, 537,336 students and 99,390 staff attended in-person instruction during the 16-week study period, representing 6,400,175 student learning weeks and 1,342,574 staff learning weeks. Student case rates were similar in the 242 districts with &#8805;3 feet versus &#8805;6 feet of physical distancing between students (IRR, 0.891, 95% CI, 0.594-1.335); results were similar after adjusting for community incidence (adjusted IRR, 0.904, 95% CI, 0.616-1.325).

Simply stated, telehealth is a tool to provide health care from a distance. Jefferson Health has leveraged its acute care telehealth platform to screen, order testing, and manage patients with COVID-19-related concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the expansion and results of using a telehealth program to increase access to care while minimizing additional potential exposures during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Screening algorithms for patients with SARS-CoV-2-related complaints were created, and 150 new clinicians were trained within 72 hours to address increased patient demand. Simultaneously, Jefferson Health created mobile testing sites throughout eastern Pennsylvania and the southern New Jersey region. Visit volume, the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests ordered, and the number of positive tests were evaluated, and the volume was compared with preceding time periods. RESULTS: From March 8, 2020, to April 11, 2020, 4663 patients were screened using telehealth, representing a surge in visit volume. There were 1521 patients sent to mobile testing sites, and they received a telephone call from a centralized call center for results. Of the patients who were tested, nearly 20% (n=301) had a positive result. CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrates how using telehealth for a referral to central testing sites can increase access to community-based care, decrease clinician exposure, and minimize the demand for personal protective equipment. The scaling of this innovation may allow health care systems to focus on preparing for and delivering hospital-based care needs.","Joshi, Aditi U; Lewiss, Resa E; Aini, Maria; Babula, Bracken; Henwood, Patricia C",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,230

Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the patient at each presentation as part of routine surveillance. Nucleic acid amplification testing was performed on the two samples to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, and serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Comparative genome analysis with whole-genome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the two episodes of COVID-19. The first COVID-19 episode was in March 2020, and the second was in January 2021. Both SARS-CoV-2 infections presented with mild symptoms, and seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 IgG was documented. Genomic analysis showed that the viral genome from the first infection belonged to the lineage B.1.1.74, while that from the second infection to the lineage B.1.177. Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the healthcare worker met the qualifications for ""best evidence"" for reinfection.

To explore a CT visual severity score in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with attention to temporal changes in the score and the role of the score in a model for predicting in-hospital complications. Methods. This retrospective study included 161 inpatients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in China who underwent serial chest CT scans during hospitalization. CT examinations were evaluated using a visual severity scoring system. The temporal pattern of the CT visual severity score across serial CT examinations during hospitalization was characterized using a generalized spline regression model. A prognostic model to predict major complications, including in-hospital mortality, was created using the CT visual severity score and clinical variables. External model validation was performed in a cohort of 135 patients from a different hospital, evaluated by two independent radiologists. Results. The cohort included 91 survivors with non-severe disease, 55 survivors with severe disease, and 15 patients who died during hospitalization. Median CT visual lung severity score in the first week of hospitalization was 2.0 in survivors with non-severe disease, 4.0 in survivors with severe disease, and 11.0 in non-survivors. CT visual severity score peaked on hospitalization day 9 and 12 in survivors with non-severe and severe disease, respectively, and progressively decreased in subsequent hospitalization weeks in both groups. In the prognostic model, in-hospital complications were independently associated with a severe CT score (odds ratio [OR] 31.28), moderate CT score (OR 5.86), age (OR 1.09 per year increase), and lymphocyte count (OR 0.03 per 1*10^9/L increase). In the validation cohort, the two readers achieved C-index of 0.92-0.95, accuracy 85.2%-86.7%, sensitivity 70.7%-75.6%, and specificity 91.4%-91.5% for predicting in-hospital complications. Conclusion. A CT visual severity score is associated with clinical disease severity and evolves in a characteristic fashion during hospitalization for COVID-19. A prognostic model based on the CT visual severity score and clinical variables has strong performance in predicting in-hospital complications. Clinical Impact. The prognostic model using the CT visual severity score may help identify patients at highest risk of poor outcomes and guide early intervention.","Wang, Xiaofeng; Hu, Xingxing; Tan, Weijun; Mazzone, Peter; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Han, Xiao-Zhen; Huang, Pingyue; Hu, Weihua; Dweik, Raed; Cheng, Zhenshun",,,230
377135,Effect of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer care in England,2021,"Covid-19 is primarily spread through contact with the virus which may survive on surfaces with lifespan of more than hours. To curb its spread, it is hence of vital importance to detect and quarantine those who have been in contact with the virus for sustained period of time, the so-called close contacts. In this work, we study, for the first time, automatic contact detection when the virus has a lifespan. Leveraging upon the ubiquity of WiFi signals, we propose a novel, private, and fully distributed WiFi-based approach called vContact. Users installing an app continuously scan WiFi and store its hashed IDs. Given a confirmed case, the signals of the major places he/she visited are then uploaded to a server and matched with the stored signals of users to detect contact. vContact is not based on phone pairing, and no information of any other users is stored locally. The confirmed case does not need to have installed the app for it to work properly. As WiFi data are sampled sporadically, we propose efficient signal processing approaches and similarity metric to align and match signals of any time. We conduct extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to evaluate the performance of vContact. Our results demonstrate that vContact is efficient and robust for contact detection. The precision and recall of contact detection are high (in the range of 50-90%) for close contact proximity (2m). Its performance is robust with respect to signal lengths (AP numbers) and phone heterogeneity. By implementing vContact as an app, we present a case study to demonstrate the validity of our design in notifying its users their exposure to virus with lifespan.","Li, Guanyao; Hu, Siyan; Zhong, Shuhan; Chan, S.-H.

377661,Recent Clinical and Preclinical Studies of Hydroxychloroquine on RNA Viruses and Chronic Diseases: A Systematic Review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Kidney involvement is a feature of COVID-19 and it can be severe in Black patients. Previous research linked increased susceptibility to collapsing glomerulopathy, including in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy, to apo L1 (APOL1) variants that are more common in those of African descent. METHODS: To investigate genetic, histopathologic, and molecular features in six Black patients with COVID-19 presenting with AKI and de novo nephrotic-range proteinuria, we obtained biopsied kidney tissue, which was examined by in situ hybridization for viral detection and by NanoString for COVID-19 and acute tubular injury-associated genes. We also collected peripheral blood for APOL1 genotyping. RESULTS: This case series included six Black patients with COVID-19 (four men, two women), mean age 55 years. At biopsy day, mean serum creatinine was 6.5 mg/dl and mean urine protein-creatinine ratio was 11.5 g. Kidney biopsy specimens showed collapsing glomerulopathy, extensive foot process effacement, and focal/diffuse acute tubular injury. Three patients had endothelial reticular aggregates. We found no evidence of viral particles or SARS-CoV-2 RNA. NanoString showed elevated chemokine gene expression and changes in expression of genes associated with acute tubular injury compared with controls. All six patients had an APOL1 high-risk genotype. Five patients needed dialysis (two of whom died); one partially recovered without dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Collapsing glomerulopathy in Black patients with COVID-19 was associated with high-risk APOL1 variants. We found no direct viral infection in the kidneys, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism: a ""two-hit"" combination of genetic predisposition and cytokine-mediated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given this entity's resemblance with HIV-associated nephropathy, we propose the term COVID-19-associated nephropathy to describe it.","Wu, Huijuan; Larsen, Christopher P; Hernandez-Arroyo, Cesar F; Mohamed, Muner M B; Caza, Tiffany; Sharshir, Moh039; Chughtai, Asim; Xie, Liping; Gimenez, Juan M; Sandow, Tyler A; Lusco, Mark A; Yang, Haichun; Acheampong, Ellen; Rosales, Ivy A; Colvin, Robert B; Fogo, Agnes B; Velez, Juan Carlos Q",J Am Soc Nephrol,,230

378223,MRI appearance of anaplastic extraventricular ependymoma,2021,"Online meeting tools like Zoom and Google Meet have become central to our professional, educational, and personal lives. This has opened up new opportunities for large scale harassment. In particular, a phenomenon known as zoombombing has emerged, in which aggressors join online meetings with the goal of disrupting them and harassing their participants. In this paper, we conduct the first data-driven analysis of calls for zoombombing attacks on social media. We identify ten popular online meeting tools and extract posts containing meeting invitations to these platforms on a mainstream social network, Twitter, and on a fringe community known for organizing coordinated attacks against online users, 4chan. We then perform manual annotation to identify posts that are calling for zoombombing attacks, and apply thematic analysis to develop a codebook to better characterize the discussion surrounding calls for zoombombing. During the first seven months of 2020, we identify over 200 calls for zoombombing between Twitter and 4chan, and analyze these calls both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings indicate that the vast majority of calls for zoombombing are not made by attackers stumbling upon meeting invitations or bruteforcing their meeting ID, but rather by insiders who have legitimate access to these meetings, particularly students in high school and college classes. This has important security implications, because it makes common protections against zoombombing, such as password protection, ineffective. We also find instances of insiders instructing attackers to adopt the names of legitimate participants in the class to avoid detection, making countermeasures like setting up a waiting room and vetting participants less effective. Based on these observations, we argue that the only effective defense against zoombombing is creating unique join links for each participant.","Ling, Chen; Balci, Utkucan; Blackburn, Jeremy; Stringhini, Gianluca",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03822v1.pdf,230
378225,Chest CT Severity Score: An Imaging Tool for Assessing Severe COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: High levels of IL-22 are present in serum and synovial fluid of patients with RA. As both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles for IL-22 have been described in studies using animal models of RA, its exact function in arthritis remains poorly defined. With this study we aimed to further unravel the mechanism by which IL-22 exerts its effects and to decipher its therapeutic potential by overexpression of IL-22 either locally or systemically during experimental arthritis. METHODS: CIA was induced in DBA-1 mice by immunization and booster injection with type II collagen (col II). Before arthritis onset, IL-22 was overexpressed either locally by intra-articular injection or systemically by i.v. injection using an adenoviral vector and clinical arthritis was scored for a period of 10 days. Subsequently, joints were isolated for histological analysis of arthritis severity and mRNA and protein expression of various inflammatory mediators was determined in the synovium, spleen and serum. RESULTS: Local IL-22 overexpression did not alter arthritis pathology, whereas systemic overexpression of IL-22 potently reduced disease incidence, severity and pathology during CIA. Mice systemically overexpressing IL-22 showed strongly reduced serum cytokine levels of TNF-&#945; and macrophage inflammatory protein 1&#945; that correlated significantly with the enhanced expression of the negative immune regulator SOCS3 in the spleen. CONCLUSION: With this study, we revealed clear anti-inflammatory effects of systemic IL-22 overexpression during CIA. Additionally, we are the first to show that the protective effect of systemic IL-22 during experimental arthritis is likely orchestrated via upregulation of the negative regulator SOCS3.","Aarts, Joyce; Roeleveld, Debbie M; Helsen, Monique M; Walgreen, Birgitte; Vitters, Elly L; Kolls, Jay; van de Loo, Fons A; van Lent, Peter L; van der Kraan, Peter M; Koenders, Marije I",Rheumatology (Oxford),,230

380078,Preliminary experience in the treatment of severe COVID-19,2020,"Novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is almost affected all over the world, and daily, thousands of peoples are getting infected and died due to this virus. All the existing methods to test coronavirus infections are taking a long time to give results and giving low sensitivity and specificity. This necessitates artificial intelligence (AI) in the detection of COVID-19 infected patients. Various deep learning and image processing techniques are available to recognize patterns from the X-ray and the computed tomography (CT) image and giving higher testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on a large dataset. In this research, we adapted the Bayesian inference approach and proposed a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) with an orthogonal normalization technique (ONT) for automatic detection of the COVID-19, pneumonia, and no-infection (Normal) from CT images. To verify the strength of the model, the data is randomly split up into different training, validation, and testing set combinations. With the proposed model on (training%_validation%_testing%) 70_10_20 split up, we achieved 99.91% testing accuracy with 99.91% F1 score and 100% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We also achieved 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity on COVID-19 prediction, 100% sensitivity, 99.97% specificity on normal prediction, and 100% sensitivity, 99.91% specificity on the pneumonia prediction. The higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of this model would be extremely useful for the accurate and rapid screening of the COVID-19 and pneumonia. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Jariwala, R.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective institutional review board-approved study included 74 patients (mean age 61±18 years, male:female 34:40) with COVID-19 pneumonia in two countries (one with 68 patients, and the other with six patients) who underwent DECT-PA on either dual-source (DS) or single-source (SS) multidetector CT machines. Images from DS-DECT-PA were processed to obtain virtual mono-energetic 40 keV (Mono40), material decomposition iodine (MDI) images and quantitative perfusion statistics (QPS). Two thoracic radiologists determined CT severity scores based on type and extent of pulmonary opacities, assessed presence of PE, and pulmonary parenchymal perfusion on MDI images. The QPS were calculated from the CT Lung Isolation prototype (Siemens). The correlated clinical outcomes included duration of hospital stay, intubation, SpO2 and death. The significance of association was determined by receiver operating characteristics and analysis of variance. RESULTS: One-fifth (20.2%, 15/74 patients) had pulmonary arterial filling defects; most filling defects were occlusive (28/44) located in the segmental and sub-segmental arteries. The parenchymal opacities were more extensive and denser (CT severity score 24±4) in patients with arterial filling defects than without filling defects (20±8; p=0.028). Ground-glass opacities demonstrated increased iodine distribution; mixed and consolidative opacities had reduced iodine on DS-DECT-PA but increased or heterogeneous iodine content on SS-DECT-PA. QPS were significantly lower in patients with low SpO2 (p=0.003), intubation (p=0.006), and pulmonary arterial filling defects (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: DECT-PA QPS correlated with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Arru, C D; Digumarthy, S R; Hansen, J V; Lyhne, M D; Singh, R; Rosovsky, R; Nielsen-Kudsk, J E; Kabrhel, C; Saba, L; Kalra, M K",Clin Radiol,,230

384407,Epigenome-wide association study of COVID-19 severity with respiratory failure,2021,"Recent scientific evidence has indicated that the elderly have increased risk of COVID-19 infections, with over 70s and 80s being hardest hit - especially residents of care homes and in clinical settings, ethnic minorities, people who work indoors and those who are overweight and obese. Other potential risk factors include lack of exposure to sunlight, darker skin pigmentation, co-morbidities, poor diet, certain medications, disadvantaged social and economic status, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. A key question is to understand how and why certain groups of people are more susceptible to COVID-19, whether they have weakened immune systems and what the roles of good nutrition and specific micronutrients are in supporting immune functions. A varied and balanced diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables and the essential nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin A, B vitamins (folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12), vitamin C and the minerals, Fe, Cu, Se and Zn are all known to contribute to the normal functions of the immune system. Avoidance of deficiencies and identification of suboptimal intakes of these micronutrients in targeted groups of patients and in distinct and highly sensitive populations could help to strengthen the resilience of people to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to highlight evidence-based public health messages, to prevent false and misleading claims about the benefits of foods and food supplements and to communicate clearly that the extent of knowledge between micronutrients and COVID-19 infection is still being explored and that no diet will prevent or cure COVID-19 infection. Frequent handwashing and social distancing will be critical to reduce transmission.","Richardson, David P; Lovegrove, Julie A",Br J Nutr,,230

Among all the sources of noise pollution, the noise generated by road vehicle traffic significantly affects the quality of urban environments. Concerning the recent imposition of COVID-19 societal lockdown, this study attempts to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on the changes in noise pollution levels before, during, and after lockdown phase in different residential, commercial, industrial, and silence zones of the city of Kanpur, India. Utilizing data collected from portable environmental sensors, the average noise levels before lockdown and during lockdown were found to be in the range of 44.85 dB to 79.57 dB and 38.55 dB to 57.79 dB, respectively, for different zones. Although a significant reduction in the noise levels was observed during lockdown, except for commercial zone, all other monitoring stations had reported sound levels quite higher than the recommended noise limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. Results further indicated that the impact of road traffic noise on risk of high annoyance and sleep disturbance was found to be lower during lockdown as compared to that of pre-lockdown and unlock phase. While the annoyance level in residential (86.23%), industrial (87.44%), and silence (84.47%) was higher in pre-lockdown period, it reduced to 41.25, 50.28, and 43.07% in the lockdown phase. Even the risk of sleep disturbance in the residential zone was found to reduce from 37.96% during pre-lockdown to 14.72% during lockdown phase. Several noise mitigation strategies are also proposed, which may indeed pave the way for devising noise control measures in the local and regional level.","Mishra, Anirudh; Das, Sanhita; Singh, Deepesh; Maurya, Akhilesh Kumar",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

This review aimed at examining the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Systematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticle, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure until October 14, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180309). RESULTS: A total of 106,713 people exposed to the trauma resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak were identified in the 76 articles, of which 33,810 were reported with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak was 28.34%, with a 95% confidence interval of 23.03-34.32%. Subgroup analysis indicated that older age, male and bigger sample size were associated with higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. After controlling for other factors, the results of meta-regression showed that the influence of gender and sample size on prevalence is no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. Further research is needed to explore more possible risk factors for post-traumatic stress symptoms and identify effective strategies for preventing PTSD-related symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.","Qiu, Dan; Li, Yilu; Li, Ling; He, Jun; Ouyang, Feiyun; Xiao, Shuiyuan",Eur Psychiatry,,230

These are based on the fact that ACE2 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion via binding of a viral spike protein to ACE2. However, the effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs and other drugs on ACE2 is unclear and all theories are based on conflicting evidence mainly from animal studies. Therefore, clinical evidence is urgently needed. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between use of these drugs on clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19.

In rhesus monkey, SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS primarily via the olfactory bulb. Thereafter, viruses rapidly spread to functional areas of the central nervous system, such as hippocampus, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 induces the inflammation possibly by targeting neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 infects neuro-derived SK-N-SH, glial-derived U251, and brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro.

After discussing the main changes induced by the Covid19 outbreak in various dimensions of food security, as identified by the preliminary literature on the topic, the note presents the dynamic estimates (GMM) of the recent determinants of food security, measured through the prevalence of undernourishment (SDG indicator 2.1.1), using a sample of 84 developing countries observed over the period 2000-2017. Since the rate of economic growth turns out to be a relevant determinant, the analysis quantifies the potential consequences that the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may have on the short- and long-run achievements of SDG 2 if proper counterbalancing measures will not be implemented. Such consequences in the short run would consist of millions of new undernourished people, while in the long run the progress made towards the 'Zero Hunger' goal are at risk of being completely reversed in the majority of countries. The note concludes by suggesting some directions for future research.","Saccone, Donatella",Eur J Health Econ,,230

A New Jersey grade 9-12 boarding school with 520 full-time resident students, 255 commuter students, and 405 faculty and staff members implemented a comprehensive mitigation strategy that included universal masking, testing, upgraded air-handling equipment to improve ventilation, physical distancing of &#8805;6 ft, contact tracing, and quarantine and isolation protocols to prevent and control transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among students, faculty, and staff members. Mandatory twice-weekly screening using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of all students and staff members during August 20-November 27, 2020, resulted in the testing of 21,449 specimens. A total of 19 (5%) of 405 faculty and staff members and eight (1%) of 775 students received positive test results; only two identified cases were plausibly caused by secondary transmission on campus. Comprehensive mitigation approaches including frequent testing and universal masking can help prevent outbreaks in in-person high school settings even when community transmission is ongoing.","Volpp, Kevin G; Kraut, Bruce H; Ghosh, Smita; Neatherlin, John",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,230

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the antinflammatory effects of pLMWH could translate in lower rate of clinical progression in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients admitted to a COVID-hospital in Rome with SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild/moderate pneumonia were retrospectively evaluated. The primary endpoint was the time from hospital admission to orotracheal intubation/death (OTI/death). A total of 449 patients were included: 39% female, median age 63 (IQR, 50-77) years. The estimated probability of OTI/death for patients receiving pLMWH was: 9.5% (95% CI 3.2-26.4) by day 20 in those not receiving pLMWH vs. 10.4% (6.7-15.9) in those exposed to pLMWH; p-value = 0.144. This risk associated with the use of pLMWH appeared to vary by PaO2/FiO2 ratio: aHR 1.40 (95% CI 0.51-3.79) for patients with an admission PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 300 mmHg and 0.27 (0.03-2.18) for those with PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg; p-value at interaction test 0.16. pLMWH does not seem to reduce the risk of OTI/death mild/moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, especially when respiratory function had already significantly deteriorated.

Due to the easy spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus when in direct contact with the patients, health care workers are at an increased risk of infection. Nurses and auxiliary staff, as well as medical doctors, were most frequently infected. The prevalence of infection depends on the adopted reporting method, including the diagnostic test used to recognize the infection, the nature of the work performed, but also on the gender, knowledge, and individual behavior of employees while performing their professional duties. It ranges from 5-30% depending on the country and the occupational group, and the highest rates were recorded in the initial phase of the pandemic. A review of the literature shows the lack of a uniform, transparent system of reporting infections in health care workers, which makes a reliable assessment of the epidemiological situation in this area difficult.","Wojczyk, Marek; Kowalska, Malgorzata",Przegl Epidemiol,,230

Since then, many different institutions from across the world have been discussing ways and means to make online education effective, via various means, such as webinars, talks and short workshops. However, a general observation has been that there is a lack of data on online education, particularly in the Indian context. Anticipating this, we decided to conduct a pan-IIT survey on online education and compiled two sets of questionnaires (one each for faculty members and students) in discussion with the members of the pan-IIT group on Online Pedagogy (https://www.paniit-onlinepedagogy-researchgroup.net/), that has been formed for conducting research on the broad area of online education. The current survey has been steered by IIT Dharwad and IIT Jammu along with the members of the pan-IIT group on online pedagogy. The survey data was collected from 5th May 2020 to 25th May 2020. We received about 11,890 and 840 responses from students and faculty members, respectively. About 82% and 86% of the respondents were males among the students and faculty surveys, respectively. In the following, we present and discuss the survey responses pertaining to various aspects of online education. An infographic representation of the survey responses may be found in Appendix.

However, the differences regarding the training loads and implementation between synchronous and asynchronous types are not yet known. The purpose of this study was to compare the implementation and training load between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs in individuals with spinal cord injury. METHODS: Forty individuals with spinal cord injury were recruited and stratified into tetraplegia and paraplegia groups. All subjects performed 3 weeks of both the synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs, after two weeks of familiarization with the exercises, remote connection tools and methods to record information. The primary outcomes were training load (average daily workload and average and total weekly training load) and implementation (adherence and successful exercise recording). Demographic characteristics were obtained from participants' electronic medical records. RESULTS: Weekly mean workload, total workload, adherence and successful exercise recording presented significantly higher values in the synchronous compared to asynchronous tele-exercises. Average daily workload did not present significant differences between the tele-exercises. DISCUSSION: The training load for each training session presented no differences between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercises. Both adherence and successful data recording showed more favourable implementation values for synchronous training, thus allowing greater weekly training loads (total and average).","Costa, Rodrigo Rodrigues Gomes; Dorneles, Jefferson R; Veloso, João Hcl; Gonçalves, Carlos Wp; Neto, Frederico Ribeiro",J Telemed Telecare,,230

We found green spaces at the county level have a significant negative association with infection rates. Among all types of green spaces, forest yields the most consistent and strongest negative association. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the negative association of forest across five urbanicity levels, and the strength of the association increases as disease incidence increases across five time periods. Although forest located in moderately urbanized counties yields the strongest association, the negative pattern of significant associations holds across all five urbanicity levels. A population-weighted analysis revealed that proximity to forest within a moderate walking distance ([≤] 1.0-1.4 km) may provide the greatest protection against the risk of infection.","Jiang, Bin; Yang, Yuwen; Chen, Long; Liu, Xueming; Wu, Xueying; Chen, Bin; Webster, Chris; Sullivan, William C.; Wang, Jingjing; Lu, Yi",,,230

Inter-personal variation was the strongest factor explaining > 75% of the microbial variation, irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 status. No significant effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the nasopharyngeal microbial community was observed using multiple analysis methods. These results indicate that unlike some other viruses, for which an effect on the microbial composition was noted, SARS-CoV-2 does not have a strong effect on the nasopharynx microbial habitants.","Braun, Tzipi; Halevi, Shiraz; Hadar, Rotem; Efroni, Gilate; Glick Saar, Efrat; Keller, Natahan; Amir, Amnon; Amit, Sharon; Haberman, Yael",Sci Rep,,230

Enclosed spaces, such as public transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination efforts.","Shoghri, Ahmad El; Liebig, Jessica; Jurdak, Raja; Gardner, Lauren; Science, Salil S.

401854,Risk factors associated with development and persistence of long COVID,2021,"Understanding and interpretation of acid-base disorders is an important clinical skill that is applicable to the majority of physicians. Although this topic is taught early in medical school, acid-base disturbances have been described as challenging by postgraduate trainees. We describe the use of Twitter, an online microblogging platform, to augment education in acid-base disturbances by using polls in which the user is shown laboratory values and then asked to select the most likely etiology of the disorder. The answer and a brief explanation are then shared in a subsequent tweet. Both polling questions and answers are shared from the account for the online, mobile-optimized, nephrology teaching tool NephSIM (https://www.nephsim.com/). An anonymous survey was administered to assess attitudes toward these polls. Using Twitter as an approach to enhance teaching of acid-base disturbances was both feasible and an engaging way to teach a challenging topic for trainees and physicians. Moreover, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of incorporating virtual learning opportunities in all levels of medical education.","Rein, Joshua L; Sparks, Matthew A; Hilburg, Rachel; Farouk, Samira S",Adv Physiol Educ,,230

402056,Initial remedial action to coronavirus in India: A study,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Herbal medicines, as a treatment method, have received a great deal of attention. The effects of two herbal medicines namely Zingiber officinale and Echinacea on alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate of suspected COVID-19 outpatients were examined. METHODS: A clinical trial with 100 suspected COVID-19 outpatients as participants was conducted. The participants were allocated randomly to two groups of 50 members. The intervention group received concurrent Zingiber officinale (Tablet Vomigone 500 mg II tds) and Echinacea (Tablet Rucoldup I tds) for seven days in addition to the standard treatment. The control group only received the standard treatment (Hydroxychloroquine). After seven days, alleviation of clinical symptoms and hospitalization rate were examined. In addition, 14 days after treatment, the hospitalization was assessed again by telephone follow up. RESULTS: The two groups were identical in terms of basic characteristics. Improvement level as to coughing, dyspnea, and muscle pain was higher in the intervention group (p value <0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the other symptoms. In addition, the hospitalization rate in the intervention and control groups were 2 and 6% respectively, which are not significantly different (p value >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the efficiency and trivial side-effects of Zingiber officinale and Echinacea, using them for alleviation and control of the clinical symptoms in COVID-19 outpatients is recommended.","Mesri, Mehdi; Esmaeili Saber, Seied Saeid; Godazi, Mohammadreza; Roustaei Shirdel, Aboulfazl; Montazer, Reza; Koohestani, Hamid Reza; Baghcheghi, Nayereh; Karimy, Mahmood; Azizi, Nemat",J. complement. integr. med,,230

For researchers interested in bugs, tangled commits mean that they actually study not only bugs, but also other concerns irrelevant for the study of bugs. Objective: We want to improve our understanding of the prevalence of tangling and the types of changes that are tangled within bug fixing commits. Methods: We use a crowd sourcing approach for manual labeling to validate which changes contribute to bug fixes for each line in bug fixing commits. Each line is labeled by four participants. If at least three participants agree on the same label, we have consensus. Results: We estimate that between 17% and 32% of all changes in bug fixing commits modify the source code to fix the underlying problem. However, when we only consider changes to the production code files this ratio increases to 66% to 87%. We find that about 11% of lines are hard to label leading to active disagreements between participants. Due to confirmed tangling and the uncertainty in our data, we estimate that 3% to 47% of data is noisy without manual untangling, depending on the use case. Conclusion: Tangled commits have a high prevalence in bug fixes and can lead to a large amount of noise in the data. Prior research indicates that this noise may alter results. As researchers, we should be skeptics and assume that unvalidated data is likely very noisy, until proven otherwise.","Herbold, Steffen; Trautsch, Alexander; Ledel, Benjamin; Aghamohammadi, Alireza; Ghaleb, Taher Ahmed; Chahal, Kuljit Kaur; Bossenmaier, Tim; Nagaria, Bhaveet; Makedonski, Philip; Ahmadabadi, Matin Nili; Szabados, Kristof; Spieker, Helge; Madeja, Matej; Hoy, Nathaniel; Lenarduzzi, Valentina; Wang, Shangwen; Rodr'iguez-P'erez, Gema; Colomo-Palacios, Ricardo; Verdecchia, Roberto; Singh, Paramvir; Qin, Yihao; Chakroborti, Debasish; Davis, Willard; Walunj, Vijay; Wu, Hongjun; Marcilio, Diego; Alam, Omar; Aldaeej, Abdullah; Amit, Idan; Turhan, Burak; Eismann, Simon; Wickert, Anna-Katharina; Malavolta, Ivano; Sulir, Matus; Fard, Fatemeh; Henley, Austin Z.; Kourtzanidis, Stratos; Tuzun, Eray; Treude, Christoph; Shamasbi, Simin Maleki; Pashchenko, Ivan; Wyrich, Marvin; Davis, James; Serebrenik, Alexander; Albrecht, Ella; Aktas, Ethem Utku; Struber, Daniel; Erbel, Johannes",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06244v4.pdf,230

In this study, we aimed to determine the differences between COVID-19 disease and Influenza. METHODS: This retrospective study included 164 children with COVID-19, as well as 46 children with Influenza. The two groups were compared with respect to clinical and laboratory parameters and the rates of intensive care and mechanical ventilation requirement. RESULTS: In both groups, the most common admission complaints were fever and cough. As compared to the COVID-19 group, the Influenza group had significantly higher rates of cough (37 [80.4%] and 38 [23.2%]), fever (31 [67.4%] and 34 [20.7%]), muscle pain (34 [73.9%] and 31 [18.9%]), vomiting (13 [28.9%] and 8 [4.9%]) and tachypnea (32 [69.6%] and 3 [1.8%]) (P < .01 for all comparisons). The mean WBC count (7.10 ± 1.08 vs. 10.90 ± 1.82), mean neutrophil count (3.19 ± 0.58 vs. 6.04 ± 0.97), APTT, CRP, procalcitonin, ALT, and LDH levels were significantly lower in the COVID-19 group compared to the Influenza group (P < .05 for all comparisons). There was, however, no significant difference between the mean lymphocyte counts of both groups. The Influenza group had significantly higher rates of intensive care requirement (19 [41.3%] vs. 3 [1.8%]) and mechanical ventilation requirement (16 [34.8%] vs. 2 [1.2%]) as well as a significantly higher mortality rate (7 [15.2%] vs. 2 [1.2%]) than the COVID-19 group (P < .01). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and Influenza may share similar clinical features. According to our findings, however, we believe that COVID-19 disease has a milder clinical and laboratory course than Influenza in children.","Yilmaz, Kamil; Sen, Velat; Aktar, Fesih; Onder, Cihan; Yilmaz, Engin Deniz; Yilmaz, Zulfikar",Int J Clin Pract,,230

MethodsWe determine the kinetics of IgM against the nucleocapsid (N) and IgG against the spike (S) and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 860 health professionals (healthy and infected) in northern Barcelona. We model the kinetics of IgG and IgM at nine time points over 13.5 months from infection, using non-linear mixed models by sex and clinical disease severity. ResultsOf the 781 participants who were followed up, 478 (61.2%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Significant differences were found for the three antibodies by disease severity and sex. At day 270 after diagnosis, median IgM(N) levels were already below the positivity threshold in patients with asymptomatic and mild-moderate disease, while IgG(N, S) levels remained positive to days 360 and 270, respectively. Kinetic modelling showed a general rise in both IgM(N) and IgG(N) levels up to day 30, followed by a decay whose rate depended on disease severity. IgG(S) levels increased at day 15 and remained relatively constant over time. ConclusionsWe describe kinetic models of IgM(N) and IgG(N, S) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 13.5 months from infection and disease spectrum. Our analyses delineate differences in the kinetics of IgM and IgG over a year and differences in the levels of IgM and IgG as early as 15 days from symptoms onset in severe cases. These results can inform public health policies around vaccination criteria.

405825,Could we predict the prognosis of the COVID-19 disease?,2021,"Depression has become a big problem in our society today. It is also a major reason for suicide, especially among teenagers. In the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the affected countries have recommended social distancing and lockdown measures. Resulting in interpersonal isolation, these measures have raised serious concerns for mental health and depression. Generally, clinical psychologists diagnose depressed people via face-to-face interviews following the clinical depression criteria. However, often patients tend to not consult doctors in their early stages of depression. Nowadays, people are increasingly using social media to express their moods. In this article, we aim to predict depressed users as well as estimate their depression intensity via leveraging social media (Twitter) data, in order to aid in raising an alarm. We model this problem as a supervised learning task. We start with weakly labeling the Twitter data in a self-supervised manner. A rich set of features, including emotional, topical, behavioral, user level, and depression-related n-gram features, are extracted to represent each user. Using these features, we train a small long short-term memory (LSTM) network using Swish as an activation function, to predict the depression intensities. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We outperform the baseline models for depression intensity estimation by achieving the lowest mean squared error of 1.42 and also outperform the existing state-of-the-art binary classification method by more than 2&#x0025;of accuracy. We found that the depressed users frequently use negative words such as stress and sad, mostly post during late nights, highly use personal pronouns and sometimes also share personal events.

406279,Bizarre Bariatric Complication With Small Bowel Obstruction in a COVID-19 Patient With Acute Abdomen,2020,"The coffee berry borer (CBB) is one of the main coffee pests in the world including Colombia. This pest is difficult to manage because of its cryptic habits and the continuous availability of coffee fruits. Among the new management strategies being tested is the use of volatile compounds as insect repellents. In this work, the behavioral response of female adult CBBs to terpenes previously identified in the CBB-repellent plant species Lantana camara was evaluated. &#945;-Terpinene, (R)-limonene, farnesene and ß-caryophyllene terpenes were tested via a Y-tube olfactometer in which ripe coffee fruits were accompanied by terpenes at concentrations between 25 and 200 ppm. Only ß-caryophyllene induced a significant and consistent CBB repellent effect at all tested doses. The protective effect of microencapsulated ß-caryophyllene was then determined under laboratory conditions by incorporating the terpene in a colloidosome-gel system at 2.8 × 105 ng/h in the middle of coffee fruits with adult CBBs. The coffee fruits in turn presented a decrease in fruit infestation. Furthermore, the protection of coffee fruits when ß-caryophyllene gels were hung in coffee trees was evaluated in the field; infestations were artificially induced by the use of raisins (CBB-infested old coffee fruits) placed on the ground. Compared with unprotected trees, the trees treated with caryophyllene gels exhibited a 33 to 45% lower degree of infestation. Taken together, the results show that ß-caryophyllene is a promising compound for an integrated pest management (IPM) program in commercial coffee plantations.","Góngora, Carmenza E; Tapias, Johanna; Jaramillo, Jorge; Medina, Ruben; Gonzalez, Sebastian; Casanova, Herley; Ortiz, Aristófeles; Benavides, Pablo",J. chem. ecol,,230

In addition, uncertainties in knowledge must be named transparently; irrational fears and rumours must be refuted. Success factors for risk communication are the participation of citizens as well as the continuous recording of risk perception and risk competence in population groups. The current COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) pandemic poses specific challenges for risk communication.The state of knowledge on many important aspects concerning COVID-19 was and is often uncertain or preliminary, e.g. on transmission, symptoms, long-term effects and immunity. Communication is characterised by scientific language and an array of figures and statistics, which can render the content difficult to understand. Alongside the official announcements and statements by experts, COVID-19 is widely communicated on social media, spreading misinformation and speculation; this ""infodemic"" can complicate risk communication.Various national and international scientific projects will help tailor risk communication on COVID-19 to target groups and thereby render it more effective. These projects include explorative studies on how people deal with COVID-19-related information; the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) project, a regularly conducted online survey on risk perception and protective behaviour; and an interdisciplinary qualitative study that compares the design, implementation and effectiveness of risk communication strategies in four countries.","Loss, Julika; Boklage, Evgeniya; Jordan, Susanne; Jenny, Mirjam A; Weishaar, Heide; El Bcheraoui, Charbel",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,230

This study assesses the relationship between visible fractures on the top and bottom of core samples and the resulting hydraulic and mass transport properties of the core. We hypothesized that more visible fractures would indicate the presence of a well-connected fracture network, leading to greater hydraulic conductivity (K) values and earlier chemical breakthrough times. To test this hypothesis, water flow and bromide (Br-) tracer experiments were performed on ten, 16-cm diameter, 16-cm-tall samples of fractured Dows Formation till from central Iowa. Visually identifiable fractures were present on the top and bottom of every sample. Results indicate that the visual identification of fractures does not predict a connected fracture network, as some samples produced breakthrough curves showing rapid first arrival times and shapes characteristic of solute transport in a fractured medium, while others appeared similar to an unfractured medium. No correlation was found between the number of visible fractures and K (Pearson's r = 0.25), or Br- first arrival time (r = -0.33), but a strong negative correlation between K and first arrival time (r = -0.92). Results indicate that the sample volume was not large enough to reliably contain a connected fracture network. Thus, testing large volumes of till at the field scale coupled with fracture-flow modeling likely represents the best approach for estimating hydraulic and mass transport properties for fractured till.

DESIGN: Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they had cohort, case-control or case series designs and provided sufficient details on clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and asymptomatic patients. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were electronically searched to identify related studies published between 1 January 2020 and 16 March 2020. Three reviewers independently examined the literature, extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of publication bias before including the studies in the meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: The confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 55 unique retrospective studies involving 8697 patients with COVID-19 were identified. Meta-analysis showed that a higher proportion of infected patients were male (53.3%), and the two major symptoms observed were fever (78.4%) and cough (58.3%). Other common symptoms included fatigue (34%), myalgia (21.9%), expectoration (23.7%), anorexia (22.9%), chest tightness (22.9%) and dyspnoea (20.6%). Minor symptoms included nausea and vomiting (6.6%), diarrhoea (8.2%), headache (11.3%), pharyngalgia (11.6%), shivering (15.2%) and rhinorrhea (7.3%). About 5.4% of the patients were asymptomatic. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts (64.7%) and elevated C reactive protein levels (65.9%). Lymphopaenia was observed in about 47.6% of the infected patients, along with abnormal levels of myocardial enzymes (49.4%) and liver function (26.4%). Other findings included leucopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leucocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%) and abnormal renal function (10.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly experienced symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough. Myalgia, anorexia, chest tightness and dyspnoea were found in some patients. A relatively small percentage of patients were asymptomatic and could act as carriers of the disease. Most patients showed normal leucocyte counts, elevated levels of C reactive protein and lymphopaenia, confirming the viral origin of the disease.","Zhu, Jieyun; Zhong, Zhimei; Ji, Pan; Li, Hongyuan; Li, Bocheng; Pang, Jielong; Zhang, Jianfeng; Zhao, Chunling",,,230

408827,Impact of COVID-19 on Acute Stroke Presentation at a Comprehensive Stroke Center,2020,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is devastating health systems and economies worldwide. Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of all variants into human cells is susceptible to blockade by the entry inhibitors soluble ACE2, Camostat, EK-1, and EK-1-C4. In contrast, entry of the B.1.351 and P.1 variant was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, entry of these variants was less efficiently inhibited by plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients and sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may escape neutralizing antibody responses, which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic.","Hoffmann, Markus; Arora, Prerna; Groß, Rüdiger; Seidel, Alina; Hörnich, Bojan F; Hahn, Alexander S; Krüger, Nadine; Graichen, Luise; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Kempf, Amy; Winkler, Martin S; Schulz, Sebastian; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Müller, Martin; Kleger, Alexander; Münch, Jan; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Cell,,230

To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search and evaluation of new treatment modalities and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. METHODS: We included 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Denmark between April 3rd and July 9th 2020, at least 14 days after COVID-19 symptom recovery. The participants had experienced a range of disease severities from asymptomatic to severe. We collected plasma, serum and PBMC's for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response by Meso Scale analysis including other coronavirus strains, ACE2 competition, IgA ELISA, pseudovirus neutralization capacity, and dextramer flow cytometry analysis of CD8+ T cells. The immunological outcomes were compared amongst severity groups within the cohort, and 10 pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. FINDINGS: We report broad serological profiles within the cohort, detecting antibody binding to other human coronaviruses. 202(>99%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 193(95%) individuals. A significant positive correlation (r=0.7804) between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. Further, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 95 of 106(90%) HLA-A2+ individuals. INTERPRETATION: The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T-cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of their disease severity.

Early detection of COVID-19 infection is helpful for treatment and quarantine. Therefore, many researchers have designed a deep learning model for the early diagnosis of COVID-19-infected patients. However, deep learning models suffer from overfitting and hyperparameter-tuning issues. To overcome these issues, in this paper, a metaheuristic-based deep COVID-19 screening model is proposed for X-ray images. The modified AlexNet architecture is used for feature extraction and classification of the input images. Strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-II (SPEA-II) is used to tune the hyperparameters of modified AlexNet. The proposed model is tested on a four-class (i.e., COVID-19, tuberculosis, pneumonia, or healthy) dataset. Finally, the comparisons are drawn among the existing and the proposed models.","Kaur, Manjit; Kumar, Vijay; Yadav, Vaishali; Singh, Dilbag; Kumar, Naresh; Das, Nripendra Narayan",J Healthc Eng,,230

410764,High aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio on admission as risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients,2020,"The prevalence of prostate cancer (PCa) is increasing. As the prognosis of PCa continues to improve, the increasing follow-up requirements after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy puts significant pressure on health care systems. Follow-up is typically conducted by treating urologists, specialized nurses, or general practitioners. Despite the increase in patient numbers, resources are not likely to increase in proportion. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in our thinking towards telehealth solutions, primarily to avoid or limit physical contact and to spare resources. Here we report our novel telehealth solution for PCa follow-up, called Mobile PSA. Currently, more than 4500 PCa patients have been using Mobile PSA follow-up in our center. Mobile PSA can increase follow-up accuracy, as all biochemical relapses will be detected in a timely manner, can significantly reduce delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen results to patients, and can significantly reduce costs. Patient summary: We assessed a new telehealth information system for prostate cancer follow-up that does not use an app. More than 4500 prostate cancer patients in our center have used this system, called Mobile PSA, for follow-up. The system significantly reduces delays in reporting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test results to patients, increases the accuracy of detecting recurrence of elevated PSA, and reduces costs. © 2021 The Authors","Bergroth, R.; Matikainen, M.; Rannikko, A.",European Urology Open Science,,230

411281,A Case of Suspected Radiation Recall Pneumonitis After a COVID-19 Infection,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Childhood anxiety is common, causes significant functional impairment and may lead to psychosocial problems by adulthood. Although cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective for treating anxiety, its availability is limited by the lack of trained CBT therapists and easily accessible local services. To address the challenges in both recognition and treatment, this study combines systematic anxiety screening in the general population with a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on internet-assisted CBT (ICBT) with telephone coaching. Child, family and intervention-related factors are studied as possible predictors or moderators, together with the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is an open two-parallel group RCT, stratified by sex, that compares ICBT with telephone coaching to an education control. Children aged 10-13 are screened at yearly school healthcare check-ups using five items from the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) Questionnaire. The families of children who screen positive for anxiety are contacted to assess the family's eligibility for the RCT. The inclusion criteria include scoring at least 22 points in the 41-item SCARED Questionnaire. The primary outcome is the SCARED child and parent reports. The secondary outcomes include the impact of anxiety, quality of life, comorbidity, peer relationships, perceptions of school, parental well-being and service use. Additional measures include demographics and life events, anxiety disorder diagnoses, as well as therapeutic partnerships, the use of the programme and general satisfaction among the intervention group. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the research ethics board of the Hospital District of South West Finland and local authorities. Participation is voluntary and based on informed consent. The anonymity of the participants will be protected and the results will be published in a scientific journal and disseminated to healthcare professionals and the general public.

The goal of this investigation was to study the differential impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Arab countries. A questionnaire including measures of COVID-19 traumatic stress, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and cumulative stressors and trauma was distributed anonymously online in seven Arab countries (Egypt (N = 255), Kuwait (N = 442), Jordan (N = 216), Saudi Arabia (N = 212, Algeria (N = 110), Iraq and Palestine (N = 139)). We used ANOVA and stepwise regression to analyze the data. For each country, regression, PTSD, depression, and anxiety were dependent variables; we entered in the first-step, gender, age, religion, education, and income. In the second step, we entered ""cumulative stressors and traumas."" In the third step, we entered COVID-19 traumatic stress. The ANOVA results indicated that the differences in COVID19 traumatic stress, PTSD, depression, and anxiety between the countries were significant. Post-hoc analysis indicated that Egypt is significantly higher than all the other Arab countries in COVID-19 traumatic stress, PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The subsample from Palestine and Iraq had a significantly higher cumulative trauma load than the other Arab countries but did not have higher levels of COVID-19 traumatic stress or PTSD. Stepwise regression indicated that COVID-19 traumatic stress accounted for significant variance above and beyond the variance accounted for by previous cumulative stressors and traumas for anxiety in all countries and PTSD and depression in all countries except for Algeria.

Male sex, advanced age, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity have been identified as risk factors for the COVID-19 severity. Presumably, as these three cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a high prevalence of multiorgan damage. In the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome (acute cardiac injury/COVID cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias) and post-COVID-19 sequelae. Preliminary data shows that the cause of acute cardiovascular syndrome may be multifactorial and involve direct viral invasion of the heart and vascular system, as well as through the immune and inflammation-mediated systemic cytokine storm. COVID-19 survivors may also show persistently elevated blood pressure and sinus tachycardia at rest. Furthermore, poor diabetic control, persistent renal damage and cerebral sequelae, such as persistent cognitive and neuropsychiatric alterations are also frequently reported. A particular attention should be paid towards cardiovascular protection in COVID-19 patients who develop acute cardiovascular syndromes during hospitalization, and/or permanent/semipermanent sequelae after recovery from COVID-19. These conditions may require careful clinical assessment, treatment and close follow-up to avoid short-term and long-term complications.","Saeed, Sahrai; Tadic, Marijana; Larsen, Terje H; Grassi, Guido; Mancia, Giuseppe",J Hypertens,,230

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a user embracement protocol (SPIKES protocol) for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) immediately before intra-articular injection (IAI) relative to procedure tolerance and its effectiveness in the immediate, short and medium terms. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial. Patients received IAIs with triamcinolone hexacetonide (40 mg) preceded or not by the SPIKES protocol. The outcomes measured were: visual analogue scale for pain at rest, pain on movement and joint swelling; morning stiffness; Western Ontario McMaster Universities Index Functional Questionnaire (WOMAC); pain catastrophizing scale; McGill pain questionnaire; SF-36 questionnaire on quality of life; Trace State Anxiety Inventory (IDATE); and a Timed Up and Go functional test. RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomized in the user embracement group (n = 50) or the control group (n = 50); 89% were women and 60% white, mean age was 67.1 (±7.3) years, and mean disease time was 6.3 (±6.2) years. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for any variables at pre-procedure time, nor did the groups differ in their tolerance to the procedure or during the 12 weeks of follow up for any evaluated variables. CONCLUSIONS: No benefit was identified by applying a user embracement protocol to patients with knee OA prior to IAI with corticosteroid, neither to tolerance at the time of the procedure nor to its effectiveness in the immediate, short, and medium terms.","Toffolo, Sandra Regina; Natour, Jamil; Boni, Reginaldo Carlos; Nunes-Tamashiro, Jose Carlos; Furtado, Rita Nely Vilar",Knee,,230

This tool can contribute to public health surveillance at both community (wastewater treatment system) and institutional (e.g., colleges, prisons, and nursing homes) scales. This paper explores the successes, challenges, and lessons learned from initial wastewater surveillance efforts at colleges and university systems to inform future research, development and implementation. We present the experiences of 25 college and university systems in the United States that monitored campus wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 during the fall 2020 academic period. We describe the broad range of approaches, findings, resources, and impacts from these initial efforts. These institutions range in size, social and political geographies, and include both public and private institutions. Our analysis suggests that wastewater monitoring at colleges requires consideration of local information needs, sewage infrastructure, resources for sampling and analysis, college and community dynamics, approaches to interpretation and communication of results, and follow-up actions. Most colleges reported that a learning process of experimentation, evaluation, and adaptation was key to progress. This process requires ongoing collaboration among diverse stakeholders including decision-makers, researchers, faculty, facilities staff, students, and community members.","Harris-Lovett, Sasha; Nelson, Kara L; Beamer, Paloma; Bischel, Heather N; Bivins, Aaron; Bruder, Andrea; Butler, Caitlyn; Camenisch, Todd D; De Long, Susan K; Karthikeyan, Smruthi; Larsen, David A; Meierdiercks, Katherine; Mouser, Paula J; Pagsuyoin, Sheree; Prasek, Sarah M; Radniecki, Tyler S; Ram, Jeffrey L; Roper, D Keith; Safford, Hannah; Sherchan, Samendra P; Shuster, William; Stalder, Thibault; Wheeler, Robert T; Korfmacher, Katrina Smith",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,230

In its wake, it has left no life unaffected. Having earned the world's attention, social media platforms have served as a vehicle for the global conversation about COVID-19. In particular, many people have used these sites in order to express their feelings, experiences, and observations about the pandemic. We provide a multi-faceted analysis of critical properties exhibited by these conversations on social media regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic. We present a framework for analysis, mining, and tracking the critical content and characteristics of social media conversations around the pandemic. Focusing on Twitter and Reddit, we have gathered a large-scale dataset on COVID-19 social media conversations. Our analyses cover tracking potential reports on virus acquisition, symptoms, conversation topics, and language complexity measures through time and by region across the United States. We also present a BERT-based model for recognizing instances of hateful tweets in COVID-19 conversations, which achieves a lower error-rate than the state-of-the-art performance. Our results provide empirical validation for the effectiveness of our proposed framework and further demonstrate that social media data can be efficiently leveraged to provide public health experts with inexpensive but thorough insight over the course of an outbreak.","Fazeli, Shayan; Zamanzadeh, Davina; Ovalle, Anaelia; Nguyen, Thu; Gee, Gilbert; Sarrafzadeh, Majid",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10807v1.pdf,230

Research indicates a possible impact on health by reducing poverty, fostering health-promoting behaviour and ameliorating biopsychosocial pathways to health. This novel case for UBI as a public health measure is starting to receive attention from a range of political positions and organisations. However, discussion of the ethical underpinnings of UBI as a public health policy is sparse. This is depriving policymakers of clear perspectives about the reasons for, restrictions to and potential for the policy's design and implementation. In this article, we note prospective pathways to impact on health in order to assess fit with Rawlsian, capabilities and perfectionist approaches to public health policy. We suggest that Raz' pluralist perfectionist approach may fit most comfortably with the prospective pathways to impact, which has implications for allocation of resources.","Johnson, Matthew Thomas; Johnson, Elliott Aidan",J. med. ethics,,230
424043,Feasibility of collecting and processing of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda,2021,"Augmenting ground-level communications with flying networks, such as the high-altitude platform system (HAPS), is among the major innovative initiatives of the next generation of wireless systems (6G). Given HAPS quasi-static positioning at the stratosphere, HAPS-to-ground and HAPS-to-air connectivity frameworks are expected to be prolific in terms of data acquisition and computing, especially given the mild weather and quasi-constant wind speed characteristics of the stratospheric layer. This paper explores the opportunities stemming from the realization of cloud-enabled HAPS in the context of telecommunications applications and services. The paper first advocates for the potential physical advantages of deploying HAPS as flying data-centers, also known as super-macro base stations. The paper then describes various cloud services that can be offered from the HAPS and the merits that can be achieved by this integration, such as enhancing the quality, speed, and range of the offered services. The proposed services span a wide range of fields, including satellites, Internet of Things (IoT), ad hoc networks (such as sensor; vehicular; and aerial networks), gaming, and social networks. For each service, the paper illustrates the methods that would be used by cloud providers to offload the service data to the HAPS and enable the cloud customers to consume the service. The paper further sheds light on the challenges that need to be addressed for realizing practical cloud-enabled HAPS, mainly, those related to high energy, processing power, quality of service (QoS), and security considerations. Finally, the paper discusses some open issues on the topic, namely, HAPS mobility and message routing, HAPS security via blockchain and machine learning, artificial intelligence-based resource allocation in cloud-enabled HAPS, and integration with vertical heterogeneous networks.","Mershad, Khaleel; Dahrouj, Hayssam; Sarieddeen, Hadi; Shihada, Basem; Al-Naffouri, Tareq; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02006v2.pdf,230

In the present study, 192 Asian Indian international students completed a survey to understand how colorblind racial ideology and sense of belonging impacted their racism-related stress. We also examined this relationship based on gender and level of education. Our results suggest that colorblind racial ideology, sense of belonging, gender, and level of education significantly explained 32.3% of the variance in racism-related stress. In general, students who identified as men and undergraduate students (versus graduate students) reported higher levels of racism-related stress. Our findings suggests that in addition to the acculturation barriers international students face, Asian Indian international students deal with barriers related to racism. These findings have implications for educators and counselors in higher education institutions that Asian Indian international students have multifaceted identities that impact how they interpret racism.","Aggarwal, Aashna; Çiftçi, Ayse",Psychol Rep,,230

This study aims to explore household medication practices by and for this population, identify practices that benefit or jeopardise medication safety and develop best practice guidance about household medication safety practices during a pandemic, grounded in individual experiences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a descriptive qualitative study using semistructured interviews, by telephone or video call. People who have been advised to 'cocoon'/'shield' and/or are aged 70 years or over and using at least one long-term medication, or their caregivers, will be eligible for inclusion. We will recruit 100 patient/carer participants: 50 from the UK and 50 from Ireland. Recruitment will be supported by our patient and public involvement (PPI) partners, personal networks and social media. Individual participant consent will be sought, and interviews audio/video recorded and/or detailed notes made. A constructivist interpretivist approach to data analysis will involve use of the constant comparative method to organise the data, along with inductive analysis. From this, we will iteratively develop best practice guidance about household medication safety practices during a pandemic from the patient's/carer's perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick and University College London ethics approvals. We plan to disseminate our findings via presentations at relevant patient/public, professional, academic and scientific meetings, and for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Here, by employing direct numerical simulations, we study the mechanical displacement ventilation with the realistic range of air changes per hour (ACH) from 1 to 10. For this ventilation scheme, a cool lower zone is established beneath the warm upper zone with the interface height h depending on ACH. For weak ventilation, we find the scalings relation of the interface height h ~ ACH^{3/5}, as suggested by Hunt&Linden (Build. Environ., vol. 34, 1999, pp. 707-720). Also, the CO2 concentration decreases with ACH within this regime. However, for too strong ventilation, the interface height h becomes insensitive to ACH, and the CO2 concentration remains unchanged. Our results are in contrast to the general belief that stronger flow is more helpful to remove contaminants. We work out the physical mechanism governing the transition between the low ACH and the high ACH regimes. It is determined by the relative strength of the kinetic energy from the inflow, potential energy from the stably-stratified layers, and energy loss due to drag. Our findings provide a physics-based guideline to optimize displacement ventilation.","Yang, Rui; Ng, Chong Shen; Chong, Kai Leong; Verzicco, Roberto; Lohse, Detlef",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03363v1.pdf,230

The impact of surgical training has been described as 'severe' by most ophthalmology residents worldwide due to their duties in COVID-19 wards, disruption of outpatient and camp services. Methods: Ophthalmic surgery demands utmost accuracy and meticulousness. Fine motor proficiencies, stereoscopic skills and hand-eye coordination required can only be achieved by practice. So, a multileveled structured wet-lab teaching schedule was prepared for the residents and implemented to bridge this gap between theory and practice at our tertiary care institute. A semester-wise training schedule was made with the proper distribution of wet-lab and simulator training. Surgeries like phacoemulsification, scleral buckling, pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy, trabeculectomy and intravitreal injections were practised by the residents on the goat eyes. Simulator training was provided for phacoemulsification and vitrectomy to increase the hand-eye coordination of the residents. Results: Residents noticed improvement in their surgical skills and ambidexterity post wet-lab and simulator training . It also increased their confidence and provided essential surgical skills required to be used in the operation theater later. Conclusion: It is imperative that wet-lab training be included in the residency training programme in this COVID-19 era.","Gupta, Parul Chawla; Singh, Ramandeep; Khurana, Surbhi; Behera, Ranjan Kumar; Thattaruthody, Faisal; Pandav, Surinder Singh; Ram, Jagat",Indian J Ophthalmol,,230

A panel of hand surgeons from these different regions compared and discussed data from the centers they work in. The COVID-19 pandemic had an enormous impact on both elective and emergency surgery in Italy, not only in highly affected regions but also - and paradoxically even at a higher extent - in regions with a low COVID-19 case load. A durable and flexible redesign of hand surgery activities should be promoted, while changing and hopefully increasing human resources and enhancing administrative support.

In the core is the need to broaden the perspective on the determinants of a country's ability to cope with the spread of the virus. This paper is about bringing together diverse aspects of readiness and initial reaction to a COVID-19 outbreak. We proposed an integrated evaluation framework which encapsulates six dimensions of readiness and initial reaction. Using a specific multi-level outranking method, we analysed how these dimensions affect the relative positioning of European countries in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The results revealed that the order of countries based on our six-dimensional assessment framework is significantly reminiscent of the actual positioning of countries in terms of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in the initial phase of the pandemic. Our findings confirm that only when a country's readiness is complemented by an appropriate societal reaction we can expect a less severe outcome.

Patients with PTSD often show excessive fear memory and impairment of fear extinction (FE). It has been reported that the stability of acquired fear memory is altered through multiple memory stages, such as consolidation and reconsolidation. FE also affects the stability of fear memory. Each stage of fear memory formation and FE are regulated by different molecular mechanisms, including the CB system. However, to the best of our knowledge, no review summarizes the role of the CB system during each stage of fear memory formation and FE. In this review, we summarize the roles of endocannabinoids in fear memory formation and FE. Moreover, based on the summary, we propose a new hypothesis for the role of endocannabinoids in fear regulation, and discuss treatment for PTSD using CB system-related drugs.","Mizuno, Ikumi; Matsuda, Shingo",Pharmacol. rep,,230

They have also been widely studied as novel electrodes for supercapacitors. The interactions between water and lithium/sodium ions, and water and binary metal oxide surface determine the electrochemical reactions and their long-term stability. Our results indicate that the aqueous sodium electrolyte has a stronger influence on the capacitance and cycling stability of the binary (Ca and Mo) metal oxide electrode than its lithium cousin. The symmetric cell in a two-electrode configuration was assembled with the proposed binary metal oxide, which shows an average discharge voltage of 1.2 V, delivering a specific capacitance of 72 F g-1 at a specific energy density of 32 W h kg-1 based on the total mass of the active materials.

Today, the critical role of the immune system in tumor control is undisputed. Checkpoint antibody immunotherapy augments existing antitumor T cell activity with durable clinical responses in many tumor entities. Despite the presence of tumor-associated antigens and neoantigens, many patients have an insufficient repertoires of antitumor T cells. Autologous tumor vaccinations aim at alleviating this defect, but clinical success is modest. Loading tumor material into autologous dendritic cells followed by their laboratory expansion and therapeutic vaccination is promising, both conceptually and clinically. However, this process is laborious, time-consuming, costly, and hence less likely to solve the global cancer crisis. Therefore, it is proposed to re-focus on personalized anticancer vaccinations to enhance the immunogenicity of autologous therapeutic tumor vaccines. Recent work re-established the idea of using the alarming agents of the immune system, oxidative modifications, as an intrinsic adjuvant to broaden the antitumor T cell receptor repertoire in cancer patients. The key novelty is the use of gas plasma, a multi-reactive oxygen and nitrogen species-generating technology, for diversifying oxidative protein modifications in a, so far, unparalleled manner. This significant innovation has been successfully used in proof-of-concept studies and awaits broader recognition and implementation to explore its chances and limitations of providing affordable personalized anticancer vaccines in the future. Such multidisciplinary advance is timely, as the current COVID-19 crisis is inexorably reflecting the utmost importance of innovative and effective vaccinations in modern times.","Clemen, R.; Bekeschus, S.",Vaccines,,230

To gain an understanding of the network function it is imperative to identify and understand the network structure with respect to the underlying anatomical connectivity and the topographic organization. Here we show that the previously described resting-state network for the somatosensory area 3b comprises of distinct networks that are characteristic for different topographic representations. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis in macaque monkeys and humans using BOLD- fMRI signals from the face, the hand and rest of the medial somatosensory representations of area 3b revealed different correlation patterns. Both monkeys and humans have many similarities in the connectivity networks, although the networks are more complex in humans with many more nodes. In both the species face area network has the highest ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity, which included areas 3b and 4, and ventral premotor area. The area 3b hand network included ipsilateral hand representation in area 4. The emergent functional network structures largely reflect the known anatomical connectivity. Our results show that different body part representations in area 3b have independent functional networks perhaps reflecting differences in the behavioral use of different body parts. The results also show that large cortical areas if considered together, do not give a complete and accurate picture of the network architecture.","Thomas, John; Sharma, Dixit; Mohanta, Sounak; Jain, Neeraj",Neuroimage,,230

435881,Letter to the Editor regarding “Could pulmonary arterial hypertension patients be at lower risk from severe COVID-19?”,2020,"In fragment-based drug discovery, hundreds or often thousands of compounds smaller than ~300 Da are tested against the protein of interest to identify chemical entities that can be developed into potent drug candidates. Since the compounds are small, interactions are weak, and the screening method must therefore be highly sensitive; moreover, structural information tends to be crucial for elaborating these hits into lead-like compounds. Therefore, protein crystallography has always been a gold-standard technique, yet historically too challenging to find widespread use as a primary screen. Initial XChem experiments were demonstrated in 2014 and then trialed with academic and industrial collaborators to validate the process. Since then, a large research effort and significant beamtime have streamlined sample preparation, developed a fragment library with rapid follow-up possibilities, automated and improved the capability of I04-1 beamline for unattended data collection, and implemented new tools for data management, analysis and hit identification. XChem is now a facility for large-scale crystallographic fragment screening, supporting the entire crystals-to-deposition process, and accessible to academic and industrial users worldwide. The peer-reviewed academic user program has been actively developed since 2016, to accommodate projects from as broad a scientific scope as possible, including well-validated as well as exploratory projects. Academic access is allocated through biannual calls for peer-reviewed proposals, and proprietary work is arranged by Diamond's Industrial Liaison group. This workflow has already been routinely applied to over a hundred targets from diverse therapeutic areas, and effectively identifies weak binders (1%-30% hit rate), which both serve as high-quality starting points for compound design and provide extensive structural information on binding sites. The resilience of the process was demonstrated by continued screening of SARS-CoV-2 targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a 3-week turn-around for the main protease.","Douangamath, Alice; Powell, Ailsa; Fearon, Daren; Collins, Patrick M; Talon, Romain; Krojer, Tobias; Skyner, Rachael; Brandao-Neto, Jose; Dunnett, Louise; Dias, Alexandre; Aimon, Anthony; Pearce, Nicholas M; Wild, Conor; Gorrie-Stone, Tyler; von Delft, Frank",J. vis. exp,,230

437867,"COVID-19 More Frequent, Severe in Cancer Patients",2020,"Background: The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly worldwide. In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. Findings: Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43-63), and 20 (58·8%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]). 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia).

CMTA proposes a data science (DS) pipeline that applies machine learning models for processing, classifying (Dense-CNN) and analyzing (MBERT) multilingual (micro)-texts. DS pipeline data preparation tasks extract features from multilingual textual data and categorize it into specific information classes (i.e., 'false', 'partly false', 'misleading'). The CMTA pipeline has been experimented with multilingual micro-texts (tweets), showing misinformation spread across different languages. To assess the performance of CMTA and put it in perspective, we performed a comparative analysis of CMTA with eight monolingual models used for detecting misinformation. The comparison shows that CMTA has surpassed various monolingual models and suggests that it can be used as a general method for detecting misinformation in multilingual micro-texts. CMTA experimental results show misinformation trends about COVID-19 in different languages during the first pandemic months.","Pranesh, Raj Ratn; Farokhnejad, Mehrdad; Shekhar, Ambesh; Vargas-Solar, Genoveva",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03313v1.pdf,230

The COVID-19 pandemic quickly affected care access and shifted healthcare delivery, and neuropsychology has adapted successfully to provide tele-neuropsychological (teleNP) DBS evaluations during this time, thus permanently changing the landscape of neuropsychological practice. Method: In this paper, we discuss the lessons learned from the pandemic and we offer care management guidelines for teleNP and in-person evaluations of pre-DBS populations, with exploration of the feasibility of the different approaches for uninterrupted care access. Results: We summarize the strengths and weaknesses of these care models and we provide future directions for the state of clinical neuropsychological practice for DBS programs, with implications for broader patient populations. Conclusions: A better understanding of these dynamics will inform and educate the DBS team and community regarding the complexities of performing DBS neuropsychological evaluations during COVID-19 and beyond.","Palmese, C A; Wyman-Chick, K A; Racine, C; Pollak, L E; Lin, G; Farace, E; Tran, B; Floden, D; Bobholz, J; Turner, T H; York, M K",Clin Neuropsychol,,230
444810,Immunological imprinting of the antibody response in COVID-19 patients,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is characterized by a high level of infectivity and a high mortality among adults at risk (older than 65 years, obesity, diabetes, systemic hypertension). Following a common viral pneumonia, a multisystem inflammatory syndrome sometimes occurs, including an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) carrying a high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and generally develop a mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have been recently described. Both clinical symptoms (i.e., high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctivitis and dry cracked lips) and biological signs (e.g., elevated CRP/PCT, hyperferritinemia) resembled Kawasaki disease. In most instances, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved the cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. However, adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g., anti-IL-1Ra, anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm. Thus, a new 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2' has been recently described in children and helps to better understand Kawasaki disease pathophysiology.","Mercier, J-C; Maroni, A; Levy, M; Melki, I; Meinzer, U; Gaschignard, J; Beyler, C; Santos, A",Bull. acad. natl. med,,230

The emerging trends in SARS-CoV-2 genome data show specific mutation and genetic diversity, which could provide the basis to develop a cocktail of vaccine and may also be used to develop the region-specific diagnostic tool, thus decreasing the chances of testing failures in fields. Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission. Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions. It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option. The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region. Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus. Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.","Bajaj, Abhay; Purohit, Hemant J",Indian J Microbiol,,230

448343,Effect of licorice on patients with HSD11B1 gene polymorphisms- a pilot study,2020,"Introduction: Racial and ethnic minorities have accounted for the majority of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations for COVID-19. At the same time, ICUs were forced to deviate from long-established care processes in response to a steep increase in admissions and to prevent healthcare worker infections. These shifts may have resulted in changes to sedation practices, such as level of sedation or sedation holidays, that differed by patient race or ethnicity. We aimed to examine associations among patient race and ethnicity, sedation practices, and mortality in a large, national sample of patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed granular daily data from the Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study (VIRUS) Registry for COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs between February and November 2020. We included patients over 18 years of age, who were mechanically ventilated following clinical or PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. We will calculate descriptive statistics for mortality at discharge and 28 days by patient race/ethnicity, sex, and two care processes associated with mechanical ventilation: sedation level and sedation holidays. We will estimate risk-adjusted, hospital-level mortality differentials by race. We will use mixed effects logistic regression and causal mediation analysis to test associations among patient race/ethnicity, sedation practices for mechanical ventilation, and mortality at 28 days, controlling for comorbidities, markers of severity, and time to admission, and adjusting for clustering by ICU. Results: Among 19,626 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 8,668 (14.6%) received mechanical ventilation at 238 hospitals. The median age was 62 (IQR 40-72) and 45.1% were female. Among hospitalized patients, 23.3% self-identified as Hispanic, 26.6% as non-Hispanic Black, 35.6% as non-Hispanic White, and 14.5% as non-Hispanic and another racial group. Approximately 1% (n=236) of patients were missing race/ethnicity. At 28 days, 20.7% (n=4,076) of hospitalized patients were deceased. Use of benzodiazepines was highly clustered by hospital (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.63). In cluster-adjusted analyses, Hispanic patients were more likely to receive benzodiazepines at least once during hospitalization than either non-Hispanic White (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.76, p=0.013) or non-Hispanic Black (OR 0.70, p=0.003) patients. Multivariable mixed effects and causal mediation analyses are ongoing. Conclusions: Sedation practices, such as level of sedation and sedation holidays, are associated with mortality;yet these practices may differ based on a patient's race or ethnicity. We will leverage a unique, multi-center database with granular clinical information to understand how these differences may influence racial and ethnic disparities in respiratory failure.","Valley, T.

This paper describes Geelong's general surgical response, surgical activity, outcomes and the effect on surgical training. METHODS: Data collected from surgical audits; hospital databases and patient's medical records were used to compare the first 7 weeks of our new service delivery (30 March to 17 May 2020) to the corresponding 7 weeks in 2019 (1 April 2019 to 19 May 2019). All surgical cases, morbidity and mortality were discussed at weekly surgical audit meetings conducted by videoconference. Treatment performance indicators were tested by chi-squared test for proportions, and by Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Elective general surgery decreased by 45.9% but an essential service was maintained by substantially increasing our public in private operating to perform 81 cases. Despite a 30% decrease in emergency department presentations, general surgery admissions decreased only 6.1% while emergency operations increased 13.9%. We used telehealth to conduct 81.3% of outpatient appointments and 61.8% of pre-operative anaesthetic reviews. No significant differences were found for overall surgical outcomes, including appendicectomy (perforation rates) and laparotomy (length of stay and morbidity). Operative exposure for trainees was maintained. CONCLUSION: Geelong was able to provide a safe and effective general surgery service during the first 7 weeks of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. There are some valuable lessons which could be adopted elsewhere in the event of a surge or second wave of cases.","Drysdale, Henry R E; Ooi, Sally; Nagra, Sonal; Watters, David A; Guest, Glenn D",ANZ J Surg,,230

On the numerical side, we consider explicit, accelerated explicit, and implicit schemes for a general higher order nonlinear diffusion equation in 1D, as well as linear multigrid methods. On the neural network side, we identify corresponding concepts in terms of residual networks (ResNets), recurrent networks, and U-nets. These connections guarantee Euclidean stability of specific ResNets with a transposed convolution layer structure in each block. We present three numerical justifications for skip connections: as time discretisations in explicit schemes, as extrapolation mechanisms for accelerating those methods, and as recurrent connections in fixed point solvers for implicit schemes. Last but not least, we also motivate uncommon design choices such as nonmonotone activation functions. Our findings give a numerical perspective on the success of modern neural network architectures, and they provide design criteria for stable networks.","Alt, Tobias; Peter, Pascal; Weickert, Joachim; Schrader, Karl",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15419v2.pdf,230

454012,Implications of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-blockade for severe COVID-19 infection in patients with multiple myeloma,2021,"Background:The hyperinflammatory phenotype of acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) is characterized by elevated proinflammatory cytokines ,an increased incidence of shock ,and adverse clinical outcomes.The characterictics of this phenotype could be considered as most consistent with those expected with the cytokine storm.However, the increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and their predictive value in bronchoalveolar fluid(BALF) in intubated and survivors patients with COVID19 is unclear.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytology and cytokine content of BALF in intubated survivor and non-survivor patients with critically ill COVID19.Method and Measurements: We have enrolled to this stidy 37 intubated patients with critically ill COVID19 complicated with ARDS.All patients have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)department of Hospital Clinic of Medical University ,Baku city.In all patients have investigated daily portable chest X-ray ,biochemistry, immunology spectrum, microbiology of the endotracheal aspirate and BAL, and although proinflammatory cytology and cytokine content of BALF via bronchoscopy.Results:17 (46%) of 37 patients have died in ICU department ,and there were big differences between cytology content of BALF in intubated survivors and non-survivors . The level of the CD4+(%) in BALF was lesser in survivors compared to nonsurvivors( 61.3+-17.5 vs 82.6+-19.4;p&lt;0.01), in contrary to this the level of CD8+(%) in BALF in survivors was higher compared to non-survivors(28.7+-9.5 vs 14,3+-10.4;p&lt;0.05).CD4/CD8 ratio was lesser in survivors compared to non-survivors(5.1+-2.8 vs 8.9+-3.4;p&lt;0.01).Plasma levels of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) was higher in non-survivors compared to survivors(IL-6:3986+-1435,pg/ml vs 2453+-987,pg/ml;p&lt;0.001).BALF investigation for cytokine levels reveal markedly differences between survivors and non-survivors.Il-8 level in BALF was less in survivors compared to non-survivors(2478+-1056,pg/ml vs 6698+-1254,pg/ml;p&lt;0.03),the content of IL-6 in BALF although was significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors(643+-124,pg/ml vs 219-+-94,pg/ml;p&lt;0.005).High levels of cytokines in BALF and plasma were associated with more higher cilinical features of respiratory failure and more severe ARDS and kidney failure.In our study good predictor for high plasma and BALF levels of proinflammatory cytokines was higher level of Creactive protein.Conclusions:Hyperinflammatory status of patients with COVID19 complicated with ARDS is associated with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in plasma and BALF .However, more higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in BALF and plasma are associated with increased mortality in such patients.In intubated patients the identification of cytokine and cell content of BALF may predict the mortality risk of patients with crtically ill COVID19.","Sadigov, A.

SOURCES: A systemic search using the PubMed MEDLINE database was performed for all Predominantly Antibody Deficiencies (PADs) described in the 2020 IUIS Expert Committee for PID classification system, combined with terms for hypogammaglobulinemia. Search terms for PADs were based on the listed names and affected genes as classified by the IUIS 2020. Abstracts of the results were reviewed to find relevant case series, review articles of PADs associated with infection, opportunistic infection, autoimmunity, cytopenias, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, neurological and respiratory diseases. References from relevant articles were further reviewed for additional references. Relevant findings were grouped in accordance with the IUIS 2020 classification system. Clinical and genetic features, if known, were described. DATA SYNTHESIS: PADs refer to impaired antibody production due to molecular defects intrinsic to B cells or a failure of interaction between B and T cells. The patients develop recurrent or chronic infection or respond to the antigens with dysregulation of the immune function, causing severe allergy, autoimmunity, inflammation, lymphoproliferation and malignancy. The diagnosis is a combined exercise of clinical and laboratory investigation similar to that performed by Bruton (1952). In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the experience of XLA and CVID patients has been surprising. Variants in 39 genes were reported as causing PADs, but the clinical heterogeneity within each variant is not clear. CONCLUSION: Bruton (1952) used clinical expertise and protein electrophoresis to identify XLA. The IUIS (2020) committee used immunoglobulins and B lymphocyte to characterize PADs. Pediatricians should suspect it to detect it and prevent morbidities that can have an astonishing and irreversible impact on the child's life.","Vilela, Maria Marluce Dos Santos",,,230

457155,Inflammasome formation in the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widened many existing nutrition disparities. In response, federal nutrition assistance programs have introduced flexibility waivers in programs, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), to rapidly respond to support the nutritional health status of income-eligible participants during COVID-19. Waivers were approved that permitted flexibilities in the WIC food package, WIC vendor guidelines, and WIC clinic experience. The impact of these waivers on WIC participants' retail and clinic experiences remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to understand the experiences of WIC participants in food retail settings and with WIC clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore WIC participants' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their family's overall health, well-being, and daily lives. DESIGN: We conducted semi-structured phone interviews between April 30 and May 7, 2020. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Participants were 24 adults in WIC-enrolled families residing in Tennessee. ANALYSIS: Using grounded theory as the analytical framework, 2 coders completed an iterative, data-driven analytic process within NVivo, version 12. Hierarchical maps, coding matrices, and concept maps were used to aid direct content analysis for theme detection. RESULTS: Five primary themes emerged, including shopping barriers (existing compounded with new), coping strategies, impact on mental and emotional health, social comparison, and unintended consequences of COVID-19 on WIC families. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 created additional barriers to food security among WIC families and negatively affected their health and well-being. To meet the needs of this vulnerable population during and beyond the pandemic, the carryover of WIC flexibilities (ie, physical presence and food package substitution waivers) after COVID-19 may improve the ease of overall program participation.","McElrone, Marissa; Zimmer, Meghan C; Anderson Steeves, Elizabeth T",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,,230

Diagnostic tools are the main players that not only indicate a possible infection but can further restrict the transmission and can determine the extent to which disease progression would occur. AREAS COVERED: In this paper, we have performed a narrative and critical review on different technology-based diagnostic strategies such as molecular approaches including real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, serological testing through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, laboratory and point of care devices, radiology-based detection through computed tomography and chest X-ray, and viral cell cultures on Vero E6 cell lines are discussed in detail to address COVID-19. This review further provides an overview of emergency use authorized immunodiagnostic and molecular diagnostic kits and POC devices by FDA for timely and efficient conduction of diagnostic tests. The majority of the literature cited in this paper is collected from guidelines on protocols and other considerations on diagnostic strategies of COVID-19 issued by WHO, CDC, and FDA under emergency authorization. EXPERT OPINION: Such information holds importance to the health professionals in conducting error-free diagnostic tests and researches in producing better clinical strategies by addressing the limitations associated with the available methods.","Asrani, Purva; Eapen, Mathew Suji; Chia, Collin; Haug, Greg; Weber, Heinrich C; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh",Expert Rev Respir Med,,230
458279,A new diagnosis of systemic capillary leak syndrome in a patient with COVID-19,2020,"Objective: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the group of children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) according to three different diagnostic criteria for obesity. The effect of ADHD treatment on the risk of obesity was controlled. Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 58 subjects aged from 8 to 17 years with ADHD. Control group consisted of 62 healthy age- and sex-matched children and adolescents. Overweight and obesity were assessed according to International Obesity Task-Force (IOTF), World Health Organization (WHO) and European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG) criteria. Results: There was a significantly higher incidence of obesity in ADHD group according to WHO (ADHD vs. Control: 17.2% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.01) and IOTF criteria (ADHD vs. Control: 10.3% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.04), but no significant difference according to ECOG criteria. There was significantly higher occurrence of overweight (20.7% vs. 12.8%, p < 0.001), obesity (10.3% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.001), and overweight and obesity (31.0% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001) in the ADHD group compared to the Polish population. The analysis did not show a statistically significant relationship between the amount of taken psychostimulant and the occurrence of overweight and obesity. Conclusions: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the group of ADHD children and adolescents varies depending on the choice of diagnostic criteria. At the same time, it is significantly more frequent than in the general population. We suggest that future studies should give a clear rationale for the selection of cutoff points to minimize errors that could confound data analysis and interpretation.","Racicka-Pawlukiewicz, Ewa; Hanc, Tomasz; Kuc, Katarzyna; Bielecki, Maksymilian; Zaorska, Justyna; Wolanczyk, Tomasz; Brynska, Anita",J. child adolesc. psychopharmacol,,230

459452,Single-cell oxygen saturation imaging shows that gas exchange by red blood cells is not impaired in COVID-19 patients,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be associated with local recurrences in the treatment of liver tumors. Data obtained at our center for an earlier multinational multicenter trial regarding an in-house developed simulation software were re-evaluated in order to analyze whether the software was able to predict local recurrences. METHODS: Twenty-seven RFA ablations for either primary or secondary hepatic tumors were included. Colorectal liver metastases were shown in 14 patients and hepatocellular carcinoma in 13 patients. Overlap of the simulated volume and the tumor volume was automatically generated and defined as positive predictive value (PPV) and additionally visually assessed. Local recurrence during follow-up was defined as gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the visual assessment and gold standard. RESULTS: Mean tumor size was 18 mm (95% CI 15-21 mm). Local recurrence occurred in 5 patients. The PPV of the simulation showed a mean of 0.89 (0.84-0.93 95% CI). After visual assessment, 9 incomplete ablations were observed, of which 4 true positives and 5 false positives for the detection of an incomplete ablation. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 80% and 77% with a correct prediction in 78% of cases. No significant correlation was found between size of the tumor and PPV (Pearson Correlation 0.10; p = 0.62) or between PPV and recurrence rates (Pearson Correlation 0.28; p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: The simulation software shows promise in estimating the completeness of liver RFA treatment and predicting local recurrence rates, but could not be performed real-time. Future improvements in the field of registration could improve results and provide a possibility for real-time implementation.","van Amerongen, M J; Mariappan, P; Voglreiter, P; Flanagan, R; Jenniskens, S F M; Pollari, M; Kolesnik, M; Moche, M; Fütterer, J J",Int. j. comput. assist. radiol. surg.

459708,Multiplying effects of COVID-19 lockdown on metabolic risk and fatty liver,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. Millions of people have become infected; billions have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes, but few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the pandemic, measured by search term interest in ""coronavirus"" and ""covid fatigue"" across the United States. METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs), including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: Linear mixed models observed differences in phone usage, sleep, sedentary time and the number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in covid fatigue. When mental health metrics (e.g., depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone usage, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in covid fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were more sedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted through the spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Though unsurprising, understanding these large-scale shifts in mental health and behaviors is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mental health during the ongoing pandemic.","Mack, Dante; DaSilva, Alex; Rogers, Courtney; Hedlund, Elin; Murphy, Eilis; Vojdanovski, Vlado; Plomp, Jane; Wang, Weichen; Nepal, Subigya; Holtzheimer, Paul; Wagner, Dylan; Jacobson, Nicholas; Meyer, Meghan; Campbell, Andrew; Huckins, Jeremy",J. med. internet res,,230

Intersections of race, class, culture, personal characteristics, and access to resources uniquely shape fathers' resilience as they navigate risks to themselves and their families. The interdependence of families with other community members, family work, role enactments, gender, and policy highlights the centrality of fathers' executive function in conjunction with available resources to shape the quality of individual father-child relationships and the overall wellbeing of fathers and their families. This commentary focuses on the current pandemic and racism as risk factors for families, the ways in which fathers are uniquely affected by these risks, the ways in which fathers exhibit resilience in the face of these adversities, and implications for future research about the ways in which fathers' gendered behaviors and attitudes may ultimately change as a consequence of the pandemic and systemic racism.","Palkovitz, Rob; Fagan, Jay",Advers Resil Sci,,230
460918,High prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients with cancer,2021,"BACKGROUND: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 2.58 million deaths worldwide with over 500,000 of those in the US, at the time of this writing. Older adults (65 years of age) and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of death. Since March 2020, preventive measures including lockdowns, social isolation, quarantine and social distancing have been implemented to reduce viral spread. These measures, while effective for risk prevention, may contribute to increased social isolation and loneliness among older adults and negatively impact mental and physical health. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify the impact of the ""Stay-at-Home"" order on older adults living in a Continued Care Senior Housing Community (CCSHC) in Southern California. METHODS: Methods: Four 90-minute focus groups were convened using the Zoom communications platform during May 2020 with 21 CCSHC residents participating. Participants were asked to describe how they were managing during the ""stay-at-home"" mandate that was implemented in March 2020, including impact on their physical and mental health. Transcripts of each focus group were analyzed using qualitative methods. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the qualitative data including: 1 - Impact of Quarantine on Health and Well-Being; 2 - Communication Innovation and Technology Use; 3 - Effective Ways of Coping with Quarantine; and 4 - Improving Access to Technology and Training. Participants reported a threat to their mental and physical health directly tied to quarantine and exacerbated by social isolation and decreased physical activity. Technology was identified as a lifeline for many who are socially isolated from friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Technology access, connectivity, and literacy are potential game-changers to supporting the mental and physical health of older adults and must be prioritized.","Daly, Jessica; Depp, Colin; Graham, Sarah A; Jeste, Dilip V; Kim, Ho-Cheol; Lee, Ellen E; Nebeker, Camille",,,230

461464,The Role of Anticoagulation in COVID-19-Induced Hypercoagulability,2020,"The popularity of 3D displays has risen drastically over the past few decades but these displays are still merely a novelty compared to their true potential. The development has mostly focused on Head Mounted Displays (HMD) development for Virtual Reality and in general ignored non-HMD 3D displays. This is due to the inherent difficulty in the creation of these displays and their impracticability in general use due to cost, performance, and lack of meaningful use cases. In fairness to the hardware manufacturers who have made striking innovations in this field, there has been a dereliction of duty of software developers and researchers in terms of developing software to best utilize these displays. This paper will seek to identify what areas of future software development could mitigate this dereliction. To achieve this goal, the paper will first examine the current state of the art and perform a comparative analysis on different types of 3D displays, from this analysis a clear researcher gap exists in terms of software development for Light field displays which are the current state of the art of non-HMD-based 3D displays. The paper will then outline six distinct areas where the context-awareness concept will allow for non-HMD-based 3D displays in particular light field displays that can not only compete but surpass their HMD-based brethren for many specific use cases.","Pan, Xingyu; Xu, Xuanhui; Dev, Soumyabrata; Campbell, Abraham G",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08390v1.pdf,230
462512,Setting the clock back: new hope for dialysis patients. Sodium thiosulphate and the regression of vascular calcifications,2020,"PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) on mortality, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and clinical recovery in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search through the PubMed, Scopus and Embase from the inception of databases until 6 April 2021. The intervention group was SOF/DCV, and the control group was standard of care. The primary outcome was mortality, defined as clinically validated death. The secondary outcomes were (1) the need for ICU admission or IMV and (2) clinical recovery. The pooled effect estimates were reported as risk ratios (RRs). RESULTS: There were four studies with a total of 231 patients in this meta-analysis. Three studies were randomised controlled trial, and one study was non-randomised. SOF/DCV was associated with lower mortality (RR: 0.31 (0.12, 0.78); p=0.013; I2: 0%) and reduced need for ICU admission or IMV (RR: 0.35 (0.18, 0.69); p=0.002; I2: 0%). Clinical recovery was achieved more frequently in the SOF/DCV (RR: 1.20 (1.04, 1.37); p=0.011; I2: 21.1%). There was a moderate certainty of evidence for mortality and need for ICU/IMV outcome, and a low certainty of evidence for clinical recovery. The absolute risk reductions were 140 fewer per 1000 for mortality and 186 fewer per 1000 for the need for ICU/IMV. The increase in clinical recovery was 146 more per 1000. CONCLUSION: SOF/DCV may reduce mortality rate and need for ICU/IMV in patients with COVID-19 while increasing the chance for clinical recovery.

462869,Italian survey on managing immune checkpoint inhibitors in oncology during COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted for airway segmentation. The performance of 3D CNNs is greatly influenced by the dataset while the public airway datasets are mainly clean CT scans with coarse annotation, thus difficult to be generalized to noisy CT scans (e.g. COVID-19 CT scans). In this work, we proposed a new dual-stream network to address the variability between the clean domain and noisy domain, which utilizes the clean CT scans and a small amount of labeled noisy CT scans for airway segmentation. We designed two different encoders to extract the transferable clean features and the unique noisy features separately, followed by two independent decoders. Further on, the transferable features are refined by the channel-wise feature recalibration and Signed Distance Map (SDM) regression. The feature recalibration module emphasizes critical features and the SDM pays more attention to the bronchi, which is beneficial to extracting the transferable topological features robust to the coarse labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrated the obvious improvement brought by our proposed method. Compared to other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, our method accurately segmented more bronchi in the noisy CT scans.","Zhang, Minghui; Yu, Xin; Zhang, Hanxiao; Zheng, Hao; Yu, Weihao; Pan, Hong; Cai, Xiangran; Gu, Yun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.02920v1.pdf,230

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey from April 21 to 30, 2020. We queried sites regarding NICU demographics, NICU restrictions on parental presence, and changes in ancillary staff availability. RESULTS: Globally, 277 facilities responded to the survey. NICU policies preserving 24/7 parental presence decreased (83-53%, p < 0.001) and of preserving full parental participation in rounds fell (71-32%, p < 0.001). Single-family room design NICUs best preserved 24/7 parental presence after the emergence of COVID-19 (single-family room 65%, hybrid-design 57%, open bay design 45%, p = 0.018). In all, 120 (43%) NICUs reported reductions in therapy services, lactation medicine, and/or social work support. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital restrictions have significantly limited parental presence for NICU admitted infants, although single-family room design may attenuate this effect.","Darcy Mahoney, Ashley; White, Robert D; Velasquez, Annalyn; Barrett, Tyson S; Clark, Reese H; Ahmad, Kaashif A",J Perinatol,,230

This study was to investigate the situation of mental health status among medical staff following COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted through structured questionnaires to collect the demographical information of the participating medical staff via WeChat following COVID-19 crisis. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), impact of events scale revised (IES-R), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale were used to evaluate depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and sleep quality, respectively. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS A total of 597 medical staff's information was included for the statistical analysis, and found 45.23% of subjects had PTSD symptoms, the mean PSQI score was 6.320±3.587. The results of multivariable analysis implied that medical workers who did not participate in the Hubei aid program (ß=4.128; 95% CI, 0.983-7.272; P=0.010) and PTSD symptoms (ß=7.212; 95% CI, 4.807-9.616; P<0.001) were associated with a higher tendency to depression. The PSQI score was linearly related to the CES-D score (ß=1.125; 95% CI, 0.804-1.445; P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that medical workers who did not participate in the Hubei aid program, no traumatic experience before COVID-19 outbreaks, and PTSD symptoms may affect the tendency to depression in females, but not in males. PSQI score was linearly related to the CES-D score both in males and females. CONCLUSIONS The medical staff with PTSD symptoms and higher PSQI score may have a higher tendency to depression following COVID-19 outbreaks.","Chen, Liwen; Lin, Dongmei; Feng, Haishan",Med Sci Monit,,230

465109,Respiratory Muscle Strength Training to Improve Vocal Function in Patients with Presbyphonia,2020,"Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized proteinaceous antibacterial peptides. They selectively interfere with the growth of other bacteria. The production and secretion of bacteriocins confer a distinct ecological advantage to the producer in competing against other bacteria that are present in the same ecological niche. Streptococcus mutans, a significant contributor to the development of dental caries, is one of the most prolific producers of bacteriocins, known as mutacins in S. mutans In this study, we characterized the locus encoding mutacin B-Ny266, a lantibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity. The chromosomal locus is composed of six predicted operon structures encoding proteins involved in regulation, antimicrobial activity, biosynthesis, modification, transport, and immunity. Mutacin B-Ny266 was purified from semisolid cultures, and two inhibitory peptides, LanA and LanA', were detected. Both peptides were highly modified. Such modifications include dehydration of serine and threonine and the formation of a C-terminal aminovinyl-cysteine (AviCys) ring. While LanA peptide alone is absolutely required for antimicrobial activity, the presence of LanA' enhanced the activity of LanA, suggesting that B-Ny266 may function as a two-peptide lantibiotic. The activation of lanAA' expression is most likely controlled by the conserved two-component system NsrRS, which is activated by LanA peptide but not by LanA'. The chromosomal locus encoding mutacin B-Ny266 was not universally conserved in all sequenced S. mutans genomes. Intriguingly, the genes encoding LanAA' peptides were restricted to the most invasive serotypes of S. mutans IMPORTANCE Although dental caries is largely preventable, it remains the most common and costly infectious disease worldwide. Caries is initiated by the presence of dental plaque biofilm that contains Streptococcus mutans, a species extensively characterized by its role in caries development and formation. S. mutans deploys an arsenal of strategies to establish itself within the oral cavity. One of them is the production of bacteriocins that confer a competitive advantage by targeting and killing closely related competitors. In this work, we found that mutacin B-Ny266 is a potent lantibiotic that is effective at killing a wide array of oral streptococci, including nearly all S. mutans strains tested. Lantibiotics produced by oral bacteria could represent a promising strategy to target caries pathogens embedded in dental plaque biofilm.","Dufour, Delphine; Barbour, Abdelahhad; Chan, Yuki; Cheng, Marcus; Rahman, Taimoor; Thorburn, Matthew; Stewart, Cameron; Finer, Yoav; Gong, Siew-Ging; Lévesque, Céline M",J. bacteriol,,230

Consequently, remote schooling has become a growing phenomenon. However, due to a lack of infrastructural capacity and widespread poverty, the experience of remote learning in developing countries may have been unequal by pupils’ socioeconomic status, gender and location. This study draws evidence from a phone survey conducted by Young Lives (YL) in Ethiopia, two states of India, Peru and Vietnam enquiring which sociodemographic groups are benefiting more from remote schooling. Logit regression results suggest that students from wealthier households, urban areas and with internet access from all countries are more likely to experience remote schooling. Pupils from higher-educated households in all countries but Peru also tend to have alternative schooling. Additionally, apart from Peru, the gender difference in experiencing remote learning is not found significant. We suggest that access to remote learning resources for marginalised students would be paramount to reduce inequality in learning loss in the global South.","Hossain, Mobarak",International Journal of Educational Development,,230

The surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the process of coronavirus entry into human cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Due to the critical role in viral-host interaction and the exposure of spike protein, it has been a focus of most vaccines' developments. However, the structural and biochemical studies of the spike protein are challenging because it is thermodynamically metastable. Here, we develop a new pipeline that automatically identifies mutants that thermodynamically stabilize the spike protein. Our pipeline integrates bioinformatics analysis of conserved residues, motion dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations, and other structural analysis to identify residues that significantly contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the spike protein. We then utilize our previously developed protein design tool, Eris, to predict thermodynamically stabilizing mutations in proteins. We validate the ability of our pipeline to identify protein stabilization mutants through known prefusion spike protein mutants. We finally utilize the pipeline to identify new prefusion spike protein stabilization mutants.","Zhang, Dong Yan; Wang, Jian; Dokholyan, Nikolay V",Proteins,,230

474437,Cytokine storm and probable role of immunoregulatory drugs in COVID-19: A comprehensive review,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The outcomes of patients treated on the COVID-minimal pathway were evaluated during a period of surging COVID-19 hospital admissions, to determine the safety of continuing to perform urgent operations during the pandemic. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Crucial treatments were delayed for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, over concerns for hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. To protect cancer patients whose survival depended on timely surgery, a ""COVID-minimal pathway"" was created. METHODS: Patients who underwent a surgical procedure on the pathway between April and May 2020 were evaluated. The ""COVID-minimal surgical pathway"" consisted of: (A) evolving best-practices in COVID-19 transmission-reduction, (B) screening patients and staff, (C) preoperative COVID-19 patient testing, (D) isolating pathway patients from COVID-19 patients. Patient status through 2 weeks from discharge was determined as a reflection of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: After implementation, pathway screening processes excluded 7 COVID-19-positive people from interacting with pathway (4 staff and 3 patients). Overall, 122 patients underwent 125 procedures on pathway, yielding 83 admissions (42 outpatient procedures). The median age was 64 (56-79) and 57% of patients were female. The most common surgical indications were cancer affecting the uterus, genitourinary tract, colon, lung or head and neck. The median length of admission was 3 days (1-6). Repeat COVID-19 testing performed on 27 patients (all negative), including 9 patients evaluated in an emergency room and 8 readmitted patients. In the postoperative period, no patient developed a COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-minimal pathway comprised of physical space modifications and operational changes may allow urgent cancer treatment to safely continue during the COVID-19 pandemic, even during the surge-phase.","Boffa, Daniel J; Judson, Benjamin L; Billingsley, Kevin G; Del Rossi, Erin; Hindinger, Kasey; Walters, Samantha; Ermer, Theresa; Ratner, Elena; Mitchell, Marci R; Laurans, Maxwell S; Johnson, Dirk C; Yoo, Peter S; Morton, John M; Zurich, Holly B; Davis, Kimberly; Ahuja, Nita",Ann Surg,,230
475156,The first non-radiographic axial spondyloarthrits with COVID-19,2021,"Viruses have caused significant damage to the world. Effective detection is required to relieve the impact of viral infections. A biomolecule can be used as a template such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), peptide, or protein, for the growth of silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) and for recognizing a virus. Both the AgNCs and the recognition elements are tunable, which is promising for the analysis of new viruses. Considering that a new virus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently requires a facile sensing strategy, various virus detection strategies based on AgNCs including fluorescence enhancement, color change, quenching, and recovery are summarized. Particular emphasis is placed on the molecular analysis of viruses using DNA stabilized AgNCs (DNA-AgNCs), which detect the virus's genetic material. The more widespread applications of AgNCs for general virus detection are also discussed. Further development of these technologies may address the challenge for facile detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Dan; Chen, Hui; Gao, Xianhui; Mei, Xifan; Yang, Liqun",ACS Sens,,230

477174,A Case of COVID-19-Induced Acute Pancreatitis,2020,"COVID-19 â a coronavirus disease, affected almost all countries in the world. It is a new virus disease, nobody has prior immunity to it, human population is prone to infections. In March 11 2020, WHO declared the pandemic status. The main symptoms include: fever, dry cough and fatigue. Virus proteins need mitochondrial energy for their own survival and replication. Upon viral infections, mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism can be modulated, which can influence the energy production in the host cells. Coenzyme Q10 is an integral component of mitochondrial respiratory chain and the key component of mitochondrial ATP production. The exact pathobiochemical mechanism of the disease is unknown. Modulated mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism with lower CoQ10 levels in viral infections leads us to the hypothesis that one of the main pathobiochemical effects of SARS-Cov-2 virus could be mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction with CoQ10 deficit leading to the reduction of its endogenous biosynthesis. The mechanism might be virus induced oxidative stress causing a mutation of one or more of the nine COQ genes, resulting in primary CoQ10 deficiency. New perspective for patients with COVID-19 may be supportive targeting therapy with coenzyme Q10 to increase the energy production, immunity and decrease oxidative stress (Fig. 1, Ref. 51).

477299,Differences in Clinical and Imaging Presentation of Pediatric Patients with COVID-19 in Comparison with Adults,2020,"There is a lack of scientific evidence about the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical manifestations are not thoroughly understood;classically, the virus manifests itself at the pulmonary level but can manifest at other levels. To the best of our knowledge, systematic reviews and non-systematic reviews about COVID-19 symptoms in the feet have not been published. The aim of this review of reviews was to analyze and synthesize the published reviews on manifestations of COVID-19 at the foot level. Methods: a review of reviews was conducted;the eligibility criteria included studies published in English or Spanish, involving children and adults with COVID-19, and reporting foot manifestations. PubMed, SciELO, Science Direct, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, and Google Scholar were analyzed. Two authors independently performed the screening and quality assessment of the studies with AMSTAR 1, and finally, nine reviews were analyzed (one systematic and eight narratives studies). The main clinical manifestations at the foot level in patients with COVID-19 were vascular (edema, exanthems, chilblains, ischemia, and distal necrosis), dermatological (vesicular, maculopapular, papulosquamous, urticarial skin breakouts, and recurrent herpes), and neurological (muscular weakness in lower limbs, paresis, areflexias, ataxia, and difficulty walking). Erythema pernio or “COVID toes” was shown as the most characteristic lesion of this disease, especially in asymptomatic children and young people, so this typical manifestation may be considered important in patients who are positive for COVID-19. This finding does not allow for strong conclusions due to the scarce literature and methodological quality in this regard. Future studies are necessary.","Jimenez-Cebrian, Ana Maria Castro-Mendez Aurora García-Podadera Blanca Romero-Galisteo Rita Medina-Alcántara Miguel Garcia-Paya Irene Páez-Moguer Joaquín Córdoba-Fernández Antonio",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,230

479104,Liver disease and COVID-19: from Pathogenesis to Clinical Care,2020,"BackgroundLong-term persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, particularly the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimer, determines individual protection against infection and potentially viral spread. The quality of childrens natural humoral immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet incompletely understood but crucial to guide pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs. MethodsIn this prospective observational multi-center cohort study, we followed 328 households, consisting of 548 children and 717 adults, with at least one member with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serological response was assessed at 3-4 months and 11-12 months after infection using a bead-based multiplex immunoassay for 23 human coronavirus antigens including SARS-CoV-2 and its Variants of Concern (VOC) and endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and additionally by three commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. ResultsOverall, 33.76% of SARS-CoV-2 exposed children and 57.88% adults were seropositive. Children were five times more likely to have seroconverted without symptoms compared to adults. Despite the frequently asymptomatic course of infection, children had higher specific antibody levels, and their antibodies persisted longer than in adults (96.22% versus 82.89% still seropositive 11-12 months post infection). Of note, symptomatic and asymptomatic infections induced similar humoral responses in all age groups. In symptomatic children, only dysgeusia was found as diagnostic indicator of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred independent of HCoV serostatus. Antibody binding responses to VOCs were similar in children and adults, with reduced binding for the Beta variant in both groups. ConclusionsThe long-term humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is robust and may provide long-term protection even after asymptomatic infection.

We hypothesized that a significant decrease in the percentage of blood vessels with a cross-sectional area between 1.25-5 mm2 (BV5%) on chest computed tomography (CT) in COVID-19 patients is predictive of adverse clinical outcomes. Methods: Retrospective study of patients seeking acute medical care within a large integrated healthcare network from 3/1/2020-6/30/2020. Patients presenting to the emergency department, undergoing a chest CT within 24 hours of presentation, and COVID-19 testing were eligible for participation. After identification of the COVID-19-positive cohort, a randomly selected group of COVID-19-negative patients were chosen in order to achieve a target study ratio of 60% COVID-19 positive and 40% COVID-19 negative cases for analysis. Results: Patients with COVID-19 had significantly lower BV5% compared to COVID-19 negative patients (25.3% +/- 7.4 vs 30.1 % +/- 9.6;p&lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in BV5% obtained from contrast enhanced CT versus non-contrast CT (p=0.23). Average processing time for BV5% was 9 minutes and 22 seconds (+/- 6 minutes and 3 seconds), with processing time dependent on scan quality. No CT scans were unable to be analyzed. BV5% was predictive of outcomes in COVID-19 patients in a multivariate model, with a BV5% threshold below 25% associated with an odds ratio (OR) 5.58 for death, OR 3.20 for intubation, and OR 2.54 for the composite of death or intubation. A model using age and BV5% had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85 to predict the composite of intubation or death in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: This data suggests BV5% as a biomarker for predicting adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 seeking acute medical care.","Morris, M.; Yash, P.; Kang, P.; Ridenour, L.; Lavon, B.; Lanclus, M.; Gerzon, R.; Gordon, R.; De Backer, J.; Glassberg Csete, M.

479384,Respiratory follow-up after hospitalization for COVID-19: who and when?,2021,"October 11, 2020, marks the seventh month since the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Unlike other coronavirus diseases, there is a geographically disproportionate distribution of the incidence of COVID-19 cases around the world. We observed a significantly high COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries and territories with no or very small number of malaria cases or no or low national TB cases in 2018. We speculate that the high incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries less affected by malaria is partly due to overexposure to malaria which led to the regular use of the artemisinin anti-malaria drugs as well as the regular use of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for TB prevention. The vaccine produced an almost life-long immunity to TB and meningitis to its recipients. We are thus calling for a COVID-19 containment and clinical management protocol that will incorporate the use of the anti-malaria ACT drug cocktail and BCG vaccine on compassionate ground.","Kangbai, Jia Bainga; Babawo, Lawrence Sao; Kaitibi, Daniel; Sandi, Anthony A; George, Angela Magdalene; Sahr, Foday",SN Compr Clin Med,,230
479535,Changes in management for patients with lung cancer treated with radical radiotherapy during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (COVID-RT Lung),2021,"Current SARS-CoV-2 pandemy mortality created the hypothesis that some populations may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 encodes a transmembrane serine protease which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 might influence SARS-CoV2 entry into the cell. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SNPs on TMPRSS2 function and structure. In silico tools such as Ensembl, Gtex, ExPASY 2, GEPIA, CCLE, KEGG and GO were engaged to characterize TMPRSS2 and its expression profile. The functional effects of SNPs were analyzed by PolyPhen-2, PROVEN, SNAP2, SIFT and HSF. Also, Phyre2, GOR IV and PSIPRED were used to predict the secondary structure of TMPRSS2. Moreover, post-translational modification (PTM) and secretory properties were analyzed through Modpredand Phobius, respectively. Finally, miRNA profiles were investigated by PolymiRTS and miRSNPs. Out of 11,184 retrieved SNPs from dbSNP, 92 showed a different frequency between Asians and other populations. Only 21 SNPs affected the function and structure of TMPRSS2 by influencing the protein folding, PTM, splicing and miRNA function. Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile. This study highlighted the role of TMPRSS2 SNPs and epigenetic mechanisms especially non-coding RNAs in appearance of different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations. Also, this study could pave the way to potential therapeutic implication of TMPRSS2 in designing antiviral drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

METHODS: Through Swedish nationwide multiregister linkages, we selected all adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=53 455 in March 2020), other IJDs (here: spondyloarthropathies, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, n=57 112), their antirheumatic drug use, and individually matched population referents. We compared annual all-cause mortality March-September 2015 through 2020 within and across cohorts, and assessed absolute and relative risks for hospitalisation, admission to intensive care and death due to COVID-19 March-September 2020, using Cox regression. RESULTS: During March-September 2020, the absolute all-cause mortality in RA and in other IJDs was higher than 2015-2019, but relative risks versus the general population (around 2 and 1.5) remained similar during 2020 compared with 2015-2019. Among patients with IJD, the risks of hospitalisation (0.5% vs 0.3% in their population referents), admission to intensive care (0.04% vs 0.03%) and death (0.10% vs 0.07%) due to COVID-19 were low. Antirheumatic drugs were not associated with increased risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes, although for certain drugs, precision was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of severe COVID-19-related outcomes were increased among patients with IJDs, but risk increases were also seen for non-COVID-19 morbidity. Overall absolute and excess risks are low and the level of risk increases are largely proportionate to those in the general population, and explained by comorbidities. With possible exceptions, antirheumatic drugs do not have a major impact on these risks.","Bower, Hannah; Frisell, Thomas; Di Giuseppe, Daniela; Delcoigne, Bénédicte; Ahlenius, Gerd-Marie; Baecklund, Eva; Chatzidionysiou, Katerina; Feltelius, Nils; Forsblad-d039,; Elia, Helena; Kastbom, Alf; Klareskog, Lars; Lindqvist, Elisabet; Lindström, Ulf; Turesson, Carl; Sjöwall, Christopher; Askling, Johan",Ann. rheum. dis,,230

By testing and identifying a variety of respiratory pathogens, it was found that influenza viruses were the main pathogens in 172 ILI cases in 2019. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 30.81%, 14.53% and 30.55%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 6.40%, with a positive detection peak in the third quarter, while the positive rate of adenovirus was 4.65% with a positive detection peak in the second quarter of the year. Two human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 positive samples, 1 HCoV-HKU1 positive sample and 1 HCoV-NL63 positive sample were detected, respectively, and no HCoV-229E positive sample was detected. The detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus was 17.44%, and the detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 9.88%. Influenza viruses were also the main pathogens in 1 447 SARI cases. The positive rates of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus, influenza A (H3N2) virus and influenza B virus Victoria lineage were 5.46%, 1.73% and 0.30%, respectively. The positive detection of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (17.50%) peaked in the first quarter. The total positive detection rate of enterovirus/human rhinovirus was 2.97%, the positive detection peaked in the first quarter. The positive rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae was 3.25% and the positive rate of Legionella was 1.04%. 5 HCoV-229E positive samples, 10 HCoV-OC43 positive samples, 7 HCoV-HKU1 positive samples and 6 HCoV-NL63 positive samples were detected. Eight strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected after cultures. By implementing the active surveillance, we not only detected a case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in time, but also preliminary understood the pathogenic spectrum characteristics and seasonality of ILI and SARI in Shanghai. In recent years, the surveillance methods have been continuously improved and the number of sentinel hospitals has increased gradually. In particular, for the response to COVID-19, the Surveillance Information Reporting System of Acute Respiratory Infection based on HIS system has been promoted to cover the whole city, which might lay a foundation for the active surveillance and early warning of emerging infectious diseases in the future.","Chen, J; Zheng, Y X; Kong, D C; Wu, H Y; Yuan, Z A; Wu, F",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,230

We used data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of August 21, 2020 on county level. We classified states into four groups based on the 7-day change in prevalence and the state's approach to SAH policy. The groups included: (1) High Change (19 states; 7-day prevalence change &#8805;50th percentile), (2) Low Change (19 states; 7-day prevalence change <50th percentile), (3) No SAH (11 states: did not adopt SAH order), and (4) No SAH End (2 states: did not relax SAH order). We performed regression modeling assessing the association between change in prevalence at the time of SAH order relaxation and COVID-19 prevalence days after the relaxation of SAH order for four selected groups. After adjusting for other factors, compared to the High Change group, counties in the Low Change group had 33.8 (per 100,000 population) fewer cases (standard error (SE): 19.8, p < 0.001) 7 days after the relaxation of SAH order and the difference was larger by time passing. On August 21, 2020, the No SAH End group had 383.1 fewer cases (per 100,000 population) than the High Change group (SE: 143.6, p < 0.01).

485478,Evaluation of hepatic enzymes activities in COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Active participation in group assignments is an invaluable way to realize collaborative learning; however, there are several challenges attributed to the traditional way of doing group assignments. This study explores the synergistic effects of flipped classrooms and a wiki-authoring group activity on students' learning outcomes and the quality and quantity of their group-work. METHODS: In this action research, 205 master students of a medical school were involved in a course blended with flipped classrooms. While learning from online and in-class activities, students did their group assignment on an educational wiki (n = 85) or in a conventional way (n = 120). Assessment in this study was done in both formative and summative ways. Formative assessment included quizzes at the beginning of each class and students' self-assessment (focused on their satisfaction with different educational activities of the course, using an 11-item validated satisfaction questionnaire). The summative assessment incorporated assessment of the quantity and quality of students' participation in doing group assignments(by a five-item checklist); quizzes at the end of each class; the final exam; assessment of students' competency in transferring their learning into creating an outline for a hypothetical article and writing topic sentences. Using SPSS 21.0 and employing independent samples t or Mann -Whitney U tests, the educational impacts of the course were compared in two groups. RESULTS: Students in the wiki-group were more satisfied with the course. Both quantity and quality of the group assignment among students in the wiki group outweighed those among the students in the non-wiki group. Univariate linear regression analysis of the models between students' satisfaction with flipped classrooms and the quality of their participation in doing their group as well as their attitude towards the group assignment showed that the changes in the quality of the wiki students' group assignment and their attitude were dependent on the changes of their satisfaction with flipped classrooms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm that a wiki-authoring group assignment is effective in achieving student learning outcomes and integrating a wiki with flipped classrooms increases wiki accomplishment. Collaborating on a wiki activity improves both quality and quantity of group assignments among students.","Khoynaroud, Ali Ahmadian; Akbarzadeh, Amirhossein; Ghojazadeh, Morteza; Ghaffarifar, Saeideh",BMC Med Educ,,230
485479,Evaluation of hepatic enzymes activities in COVID-19 patients,2021,"BackgroundImmune protection following either vaccination or infection with SARS-CoV-2 decreases over time. ObjectiveTo determine the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies following administration of two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine, or SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated individuals. MethodsAntibody titers were measured between January 31, 2021, and July 31, 2021 in two mutually exclusive groups: i) vaccinated individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine and had no history of previous infection with COVID-19 and ii) SARS-CoV-2 convalescents who had not received the vaccine. ResultsA total of 2,653 individuals fully vaccinated by two doses of vaccine during the study period and 4,361 convalescent patients were included. Higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers were observed in vaccinated individuals (median 1581 AU/mL IQR [533.8-5644.6]) after the second vaccination, than in convalescent individuals (median 355.3 AU/mL IQR [141.2-998.7]; p<0.001). In vaccinated subjects, antibody titers decreased by up to 40% each subsequent month while in convalescents they decreased by less than 5% per month. Six months after BNT162b2 vaccination 16.1% subjects had antibody levels below the seropositivity threshold of <50 AU/mL, while only 10.8% of convalescent patients were below <50 AU/mL threshold after 9 months from SARS-CoV-2 infection. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates individuals who received the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine have different kinetics of antibody levels compared to patients who had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with higher initial levels but a much faster exponential decrease in the first group.

485942,Invasive Aspergillosis Associated with severe COVID-19: A Word of Caution,2021,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19, the newly emerging infectious disease, has been associated with acute liver injury, often related to progression to severe pneumonia. The association between moderate-severe liver injury and more severe clinical course of COVID-19 has suggested that liver injury is prevalent in severe than in mild cases of COVID-19, while no difference in liver involvement has been reported between survivors and non-survivors. The spectrum of liver involvement during COVID-19 ranges from an asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to severe hepatitis. Only rarely, cases with acute hepatitis have been reported in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Both epithelial and biliary cells possess the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors that SARS-CoV-2 uses to be internalized. However, to our knowledge, no ultrastructural identification of the virus in liver cells has been reported to date. Here we provide evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the liver of two patients, a 34-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated two patients with COVID-19 showing several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. In both patients, we performed histological and ultrastructural examinations by liver biopsy. After two months, both patients were free of symptoms, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection had resolved. RESULTS: Liver biopsy histological and ultrastructural examination showed liver injury and several virions within cytoplasmic vacuoles of cholangiocytes and in endothelial cells of hepatic sinusoids. CONCLUSIONS: Although most studies in COVID-19 have been focused on the lungs, recently, cholestatic liver pathology has been introduced in the spectrum of pathological changes related to COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, those presented in this paper are the first images of hepatic SARS-CoV-2 infected liver cells. Our findings suggest a role for cholangiocytes and biliary structures in the COVID-19.","Pirisi, M; Rigamonti, C; D039,; Alfonso, S; Nebuloni, M; Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Orrù, G; Venanzi Rullo, E; Pavone, P; Faa, G; Saba, L; Boldorini, R",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,230

487242,Regulatory agencies issue advice on use of NSAIDs for COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization created the Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) criteria in 2011 to monitor influenza (flu)-related hospitalization. Many studies have since used the SARI case definition as inclusion criteria for surveillance studies. We sought to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI criteria for detecting ten different respiratory viruses in a Middle Eastern pediatric cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data for this study comes from a prospective acute respiratory surveillance study of hospitalized children <2 years in Amman, Jordan from March 16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Participants were recruited if they had a fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained and tested by real-time RT-PCR for eleven viruses. Subjects meeting SARI criteria were determined post-hoc. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI case definition for detecting ten different viruses were calculated and results were stratified by age. RESULTS: Of the 3,175 patients enrolled, 3,164 were eligible for this study, with a median age of 3.5 months, 60.4% male, and 82% virus-positive (44% RSV and 3.8% flu). The sensitivity and specificity of the SARI criteria for detecting virus-positive patients were 44% and 77.9%, respectively. Sensitivity of SARI criteria for any virus was lowest in children <3 months at 22.4%. Removing fever as a criterion improved the sensitivity by 65.3% for detecting RSV in children <3 months; whereas when cough was removed, the sensitivity improved by 45.5% for detecting flu in same age group. CONCLUSIONS: The SARI criteria have poor sensitivity for detecting RSV, flu, and other respiratory viruses-particularly in children <3 months. Researchers and policy makers should use caution if using the criteria to estimate burden of disease in children.","Klink, Thomas; Rankin, Danielle A; Piya, Bhinnata; Spieker, Andrew J; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Williams, John V; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Halasa, Natasha B",PLoS One,,230

METHODS: We identified enrollees in the national U.S. Veterans Affairs healthcare system who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 2/28/2020 and 9/30/2020 (n=55,952), with follow-up extending to 11/19/2020. We determined trends over time in incidence of the following outcomes that occurred within 30 days of testing positive: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and death. RESULTS: Between February and July 2020, there were marked downward trends in the 30-day incidence of hospitalization (44.2% to 15.8%), ICU admission (20.3% to 5.3%), mechanical ventilation (12.7% to 2.2%), and death (12.5% to 4.4%), which subsequently plateaued between July and September 2020. These trends persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, documented symptoms and laboratory tests, including among subgroups of patients hospitalized, admitted to the ICU or treated with mechanical ventilation. From February to September, there were decreases in the use of hydroxychloroquine (56.5% to 0%), azithromycin (48.3% to 16.6%) vasopressors (20.6% to 8.7%), and dialysis (11.6% to 3.8%) and increases in the use of dexamethasone (3.4% to 53.1%), other corticosteroids (4.9% to 29.0%) and remdesivir (1.7% to 45.4%) among hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients decreased markedly between February and July, with subsequent stabilization from July to September. These trends were not explained by changes in measured baseline patient characteristics and may reflect changing treatment practices or viral pathogenicity.","Ioannou, George N; O039,; Hare, Ann M; Berry, Kristin; Fan, Vincent S; Crothers, Kristina; Eastment, McKenna C; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; Shah, Javeed A; Dominitz, Jason A",Clin. infect. dis,,230

Police personnel play a vital role in safeguarding the spread of COVID-19; thus, potentially causing severe stress due to increased consignment and direct exposure to infection during duty. The study aimed to determine the effect of the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and population lockdown on the sleep/wake 24 h rhythm of traffic police. A concise online questionnaire survey was conducted among the traffic police personnel of India. Collected data were analyzed statistically. Disorientation of working schedule, fear of being vulnerable to disease, pressure of maintaining law, and orders during lockdown increased stress level. The survey identified discontinuation of sleep, shift of mid-sleep time, increase in depression, plus stress and anxiety among traffic police personnel that affected their chronobiological milieu. Proper awareness of adequate health and safety measures, use of personnel protection equipment, regular conversation with family members, and meditation can help reduce stress during this pandemic situation.","Dey, Arindam; Majumdar, Piya; Saha, Atanu; Sahu, Subhashis",Chronobiol Int,,230

RESULTS: A total of 1871 patients (median age 66 [interquartile range, IQR 54-75]; 965 (51.6%) males; 1494 (80%) African Americans; median BMI 29.4 kg/m2 [IQR 25-35.8]; 573 (30.6%) patients with MetS) were included. Patients with MetS had increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11-1.75; P = .004), higher ICU admission (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.36-2.08; P < .001), and increased need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.52-2.37; P < .001). Among individual comorbidities, diabetes had significant association with mortality (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; P = 0.02), ICU admission (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.27-1.93; P < .001), and need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30-2.03; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: MetS is a better prognostic indicator for severe disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19 than its individual components. Patients with MetS had significantly higher mortality, increased ICU admissions, and need for mechanical ventilation.","Lohia, Prateek; Kapur, Shweta; Benjaram, Sindhuri; Pandey, Abhilasha; Mir, Tanveer; Seyoum, Berhane",J. diabetes (Online),,230

Rehabilitation departments faced barriers to providing care in the traditional manner and needed to consider protection of patients and staff, staffing and personal protective equipment shortages, and uncertainty about best practices to address a novel health condition. This article highlights the strategies implemented by acute care occupational therapy leaders to support their staff; facilitate efficient care provision; and pivot with constantly changing policies, procedures, and research during the COVID-19 crisis. Occupational therapy's distinct value in caring for this population and role in responding to the pandemic are shared to provide a guidepost for future health care crises.","Robinson, Marla R; Koverman, Brenda; Becker, Carson; Ciancio, Kate E; Fisher, Gail; Saake, Serena",Am J Occup Ther,,230

Given the systemic pattern of Covid-19, there are many factors that can influence patient's functional capacity after acute infection and the identification of such factors can contribute to the development of specific rehabilitation strategies. Pulmonary impairment is the primary cause of hospitalization due to Covid-19, and can progress to SARS as well as increase length of hospitalization. Moreover, cardiac involvement is observed in approximately 30% of hospitalized patients, with an increased risk of acute myocarditis, myocardial injury, and heart failure, which may compromise functional capacity in the long-term. Thromboembolic complications have also been reported in some patients with Covid-19 and are associated with a poor prognosis. Musculoskeletal complications may result from long periods of hospitalization and immobility, and can include fatigue, muscle weakness and polyneuropathy. Studies that address the functional capacity of patients after Covid-19 infection are still scarce. However, based on knowledge from the multiple systemic complications associated with Covid-19, it is reasonable to suggest that most patients, especially those who underwent prolonged hospitalization, will need a multiprofessional rehabilitation program. Further studies are needed to evaluate the functional impact and the rehabilitation strategies for patients affected by Covid-19.","Frota, Aline Xavier; Vieira, Marcelo Carvalho; Soares, Carla Cristiane Santos; Silva, Paula Simplício da; Silva, Gilberto Marcelo Sperandio da; Mendes, Fernanda de Souza Nogueira Sardinha; Mazzoli-Rocha, Flavia; Veloso, Henrique Horta; Costa, Ananda Dutra da; Lamas, Cristiane da Cruz; Valete-Rosalino, Claudia Maria; Gonçalves, Tatiana Rehder; Costa, Henrique Silveira; Rodrigues Junior, Luiz Fernando; Mediano, Mauro Felippe Felix",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,230

491455,Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis show a different course of COVID-19 compared to patients with spondyloarthritis?,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged to be the greatest threat to humanity in the modern world and has claimed nearly 2.2 million lives worldwide. The United States alone accounts for more than one fourth of 100 million COVID-19 cases across the globe. Although vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has begun, its efficacy in preventing a new or repeat COVID-19 infection in immunized individuals is yet to be determined. Calls for repurposing of existing, approved, drugs that target the inflammatory condition in COVID-19 are growing. Our initial gene ontology analysis predicts a similarity between SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory and immune dysregulation and the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, many of the drugs related to rheumatoid arthritis have been found to be lifesaving and contribute to lower COVID-19 morbidity. We also performed in silico investigation of binding of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a well-known catechin, and other catechins on viral proteins and identified papain-like protease protein (PLPro) as a binding partner. Catechins bind to the S1 ubiquitin-binding site of PLPro, which might inhibit its protease function and abrogate SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory function on ubiquitin proteasome system and interferon stimulated gene system. In the realms of addressing inflammation and how to effectively target SARS-CoV-2 mediated respiratory distress syndrome, we review in this article the available knowledge on the strategic placement of EGCG in curbing inflammatory signals and how it may serve as a broad spectrum therapeutic in asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients.","Chourasia, Mukesh; Koppula, Purushotham Reddy; Battu, Aruna; Ouseph, Madhu M; Singh, Anil K",Molecules (Basel),,230

492647,N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis Associated With COVID-19 Infection in a Toddler,2020,"In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, media reports have caused anxiety and distress in many. In some individuals, feeling distressed by information may lead to avoidance of information, which has been shown to undermine compliance with preventive health behaviors in many health domains (e.g., cancer screenings). We set out to examine whether feeling distressed by information predicts higher avoidance of information about COVID-19 (avoidance hypothesis), and whether this, in turn, predicts worse compliance with measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (compliance hypothesis). Thus, we conducted an online survey with a convenience sample (N = 1,059, 79.4% female) and assessed distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Furthermore, we inquired about participants' information seeking behavior and media usage, their trust in information sources, and level of eHealth literacy, as well as generalized anxiety. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to predict distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Overall, distress by information was associated with better compliance. However, distress was also linked with an increased tendency to avoid information (avoidance hypothesis), and this reduced compliance with preventive measures (compliance hypothesis). Thus, distress may generally induce adaptive behavior in support of crisis management, unless individuals respond to it by avoiding information. These findings provide insights into the consequences of distress by information and avoidance of information during a global health crisis. These results underscore that avoiding information is a maladaptive response to distress by information, which may ultimately interfere with effective crisis management. Consequently, we emphasize the need to develop measures to counteract information avoidance.","Siebenhaar, Katharina U; Köther, Anja K; Alpers, Georg W",Front Psychol,,230

Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here, we report that average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145 and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro.","Estrada, Ernesto",Chaos,,230

495213,Icosapent Ethyl - A Successful Treatment for Symptomatic COVID-19 Infection,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended. DESIGN: Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. SETTING: Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. INTERVENTIONS: Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of ""cup feeding"" is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. CONCLUSION: While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.","Ma, Kenneth",J. minim. invasive gynecol,,230
495219,The impact of COVID-19 on the Canadian Kidney Paired Donation program: an opportunity for universal implementation of kidney shipping,2020,"Background: The new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in China in 2019. Case fatality rate (CFR) indicator of the disease is one of the most important indices noticed by experts, policymakers, and managers, based on which daily evaluations and many judgments are made. CFR can change during epidemics. This study aimed to estimate the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran and to calculate the early CFR for the disease based on official statistics. Methods: This was a descriptive study whose data were obtained from the website of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran from February 20, 2020 until March 26, 2020. CFR has been obtained by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of confirmed cases at one point in time. In this study, the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran was estimated based on the mortality model in 4 scenarios. Excel 2013 software was used to analyze the data. Results: According to the findings of this study, In Iran, until March 26, 2020, a total of 27 017 people have been infected by COVID-19 and 2077 died of it. However, CFR indicator had a descending trend in Iran: 100%, 18.6%, 8.8%, 3.3%, 6.9%, and 7.7% on days 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 35, respectively. The actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran was estimated to be 4 789 454, 2 873 673, 1 436 836, and 718418 as of March 26, 2020 according to the 4 scenarios, respectively. Conclusion: In emerging epidemics, CFR indicator must not be used as a basis to judge the performance of a health system unless that epidemic condition has been clarified. Moreover, it is suggested that in the outbreak of an epidemic, specifically emerging diseases, CFR must not be the base of judgment. Making judgments, specifically in the outbreak of emerging epidemics, based on fatality rate can lead to information bias. It is also possible to estimate the total number of patients based on the CFR in circumstances where little information is available on the disease.","Moradi, Ghobad; Piroozi, Bakhtiar; Mohamadi-Bolbanabad, Amjad; Safari, Hossein; Shokri, Azad; Rahimi, Ramyar",Med.

Our objective was to assess patient satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 era. Methods: Telemedicine visit data were gathered from Stanford Health Care (Stanford) and the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). Patient satisfaction data from HSS were captured from a Press-Ganey questionnaire between April 19, 2020, and December 12, 2020, whereas Stanford data were taken from a novel survey instrument that was distributed to all patients between June 22, 2020, and November 1, 2020. Participants: There were 60,550 telemedicine visits at Stanford, each linked with a postvisit survey. At HSS, there were 66,349 total telemedicine visits with 7,348 randomly linked with a postvisit survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two measures of patient satisfaction were used for this study: (1) a patient's ""overall visit score"" and (2) whether the patient indicated the highest possible ""likelihood to recommend"" (LTR) score (LTR top box score). Results: The LTR top box percentage at Stanford increased from 69.6% to 74.0% (p = 0.0002), and HSS showed no significant change (p = 0.7067). In the multivariable model, the use of a cell phone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.23) and tablet (aOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.07-1.23) was associated with higher overall scores, whereas visits with interrupted connections (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.57) or help required to connect (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.56) predicted lower patient satisfaction. Conclusions: We present the largest published description of patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and we identify important telemedicine-specific factors that predict increased overall visit score. These include the use of cell phones or tablets, phone reminders, and connecting before the visit was scheduled to begin. Visits with poor connectivity, extended wait times, or difficulty being seen, examined, or understood by the provider were linked with reduced odds of high scores. Our results suggest that attention to connectivity and audio/visual definition will help optimize patient satisfaction with future telemedicine encounters.","Rodrigues, Adrian; Yu, Jonathan S; Bhambhvani, Hriday; Uppstrom, Tyler; Ricci, William M; Dines, Joshua S; Hayden-Gephart, Melanie",Telemed. j. e. health,,230

AIM: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to elicit treatment attribute preferences among patients with haemophilia A and caregivers of children with haemophilia A. MATERIALS & METHODS: A survey of sociodemographics and preferences was completed by an online panel of adult patients with haemophilia A and caregivers of children (<18 years) with haemophilia A. The DCE included a series of questions in which respondents chose their preferred option from pairs of hypothetical treatment profiles with systematic variation in the levels of six attributes (safety concerns with too much clotting, bleed protection, dosing frequency, length of time the product has been approved for use, product type and joint health studies). Preference weights and relative attribute importance scores were estimated using random parameters logit models. RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients (mean age: 35.5 years) and 96 caregivers (mean age of child: 10.3 years) were included. For patients with haemophilia A, the top three attributes ranked from the most to least important were: (a) dosing frequency; (b) bleed protection; and (c) safety concerns with too much clotting. For caregivers of children with haemophilia A, the ranking was as follows: (a) safety concerns; (b) bleed protection; and (c) dosing.

This article made a diagnostic of Brazilian organizations in relation to their suitability for LGPD, based on the perception of Information Technology (IT) practitioners who work in these organizations. We used a survey with 41 questions to diagnose different Brazilian organizations, both public and private. The diagnostic questionnaire was answered by 105 IT practitioners. The results show that 27% of organizations process personal data of public access based on good faith and LGPD principles. In addition, our findings also revealed that 16.3% of organizations have not established a procedure or methodology to verify that the LGPD principles are being respected during the development of services that will handle personal data from the product or service design phase to its execution and 20% of the organizations did not establish a communication process to the personal data holders, regarding the possible data breaches. The result of the diagnostic allows organizations and data users to have an overview of how the treatment of personal data of their customers is being treated and which points of attention are in relation to the principles of LGPD.","Sâmmara Éllen Renner, Ferrão Carvalho Artur Potiguara Edna Dias Canedo Alana Paula Barbosa Mota Teixeira Costa Pedro Henrique Anderson Jefferson Cerqueira",Information,,230

Data from an Italian multicenter study,2021,"The COVID-19 outbreak negatively impacted the mental health and emotions of many individuals. The study presented here explores the mental health and emotion regulation experienced by undergraduate nursing students in China during the pandemic. Potential risk factors related to negative mental health symptoms were identified in this study. An online cross-sectional study including 342 respondents was performed from March 6, 2020, to April 1, 2020, at a University in China. A Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were used to evaluate mental health and emotions. The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, or comorbid anxiety and depression were 55.0%, 56.4%, and 31.6%, respectively. The mean score of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression was 29.36 ± 8.00 and 15.55 ± 5.14. Lower scores for cognitive reappraisal and higher scores for expressive suppression were susceptible to symptoms of anxiety, depression, or comorbid anxiety and depression. Issues with mental health occurred in nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study provide a better understanding of the association between mental health and emotion regulation, which will help direct psychological intervention that relieves these issues during the pandemic.","Zhu, Yuanyuan; Wang, Hongyun; Wang, Aihong",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,230

In coping and fighting against COVID-19, the most critical step is to effectively screen and diagnose infected patients. Among them, chest X-ray imaging technology is a valuable imaging diagnosis method. The use of computer-aided diagnosis to screen X-ray images of COVID-19 cases can provide experts with auxiliary diagnosis suggestions, which can reduce the burden of experts to a certain extent. In this study, we first used conventional transfer learning methods, using five pre-trained deep learning models, which the Xception model showed a relatively ideal effect, and the diagnostic accuracy reached 96.75%. In order to further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we propose an efficient diagnostic method that uses a combination of deep features and machine learning classification. It implements an end-to-end diagnostic model. The proposed method was tested on two datasets and performed exceptionally well on both of them. We first evaluated the model on 1102 chest X-ray images. The experimental results show that the diagnostic accuracy of Xception + SVM is as high as 99.33%. Compared with the baseline Xception model, the diagnostic accuracy is improved by 2.58%. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC of this model reached 99.27%, 99.38% and 99.32%, respectively. To further illustrate the robustness of our method, we also tested our proposed model on another dataset. Finally also achieved good results. Compared with related research, our proposed method has higher classification accuracy and efficient diagnostic performance. Overall, the proposed method substantially advances the current radiology based methodology, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.","Wang, Dingding; Mo, Jiaqing; Zhou, Gang; Xu, Liang; Liu, Yajun",PLoS One,,230

The present scoring system may help assess disease severity and oxygen supply requirements in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data on patient characteristics at baseline and throughout hospitalization for COVID-19 were extracted from medical records. Disease severity was dichotomized into two categories without or with oxygen supply as asymptomatic, mild, and moderate illness (AMMI), and severe and critical illness (CSI). The AMMI and CSI groups were compared. Predictors of disease severity, previously identified in the outpatient setting, were included in multivariable logistic regression analysis; the obtained coefficients were converted to integers and assigned a score. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Correlation between COVID-19 severity and medical information was examined by comparing AMMI and CSI. Age, hemodialysis, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were candidate predictors of the need for oxygen supply in patients with COVID-19. Coefficients associated with age, hemodialysis, and CRP were as follows: 1 × age (in years, coded as 0 for values of <50, and as 1 for values of &#8805;50) + 1 × hemodialysis (coded as 0 for ""no"", and as 1 for ""yes"") + 1 × CRP (in mg/dL, coded as 0 for values of <1.0, and as 1 for values of &#8805;1.0). Patients with scores of &#8805;2 points required oxygen supply (sensitivity, 68.4%; specificity, 79.0%) CONCLUSION: The present model can help predict disease severity and oxygen requirements in COVID-19 patients in Japan.","Kitajima, Heita; Hirashima, Tomonori; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Arai, Tsuyoshi; Tamura, Yoshitaka; Hashimoto, Shoji; Morishita, Hiroshi; Matsuoka, Hiroto; Kashiwa, Yozo; Han, Yuki; Minamoto, Seijiro; Tanaka, Toshio; Nagai, Takayuki",J. infect. chemother,,230

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has been described in the context of COVID-19 in two different scenarios: as a direct complication of the infection, and as an indirect outcome secondary to psychological burden of quarantine and social isolation (i.e., stress induced cardiomyopathy). Confirming the diagnosis of TTS in COVID-19 may be challenging due to the limited use of coronary angiography consistent with the recommended guidelines aimed to minimize contact with infected individuals. The use of natriuretic peptide as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in this context may not be reliable since this peptide is already elevated in severe cases of COVID-19 regardless of TTS diagnosis. A relatively high incidence of complications has been reported in these cases, probably related to the severity of the underlying infectious disease. Although quarantine-induced stress cardiomyopathy is a reasonable outcome of the powerful stress during the current pandemic, conflicting results have been reported, and further studies are encouraged to determine the true incidence.","Moady, Gassan; Atar, Shaul",,,230

Therefore, the clinical experts specify that COV\.ID-19 virus needs to be diagnosed in early phase. For detection of the COVID-19, four different datasets were formed by taking patches sized as 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64 from 150 CT images. The feature extraction process was applied to patches to increase the classification performance. Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Directional Pattern (LDP), Grey Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM), Grey-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) algorithms were used as feature extraction methods. Support Vector Machines (SVM) classified the extracted features. 2-fold, 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validations were implemented during the classification process.

Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a study was undertaken of the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. Women with education from junior high school through college were less likely to experience symptoms of prenatal depression.

504596,"Cardiometabolic Traits, Sepsis, and Severe COVID-19: A Mendelian Randomization Investigation",2020,"Updating observations of a signal due to the delays in the measurement process is a common problem in signal processing, with prominent examples in a wide range of fields. An important example of this problem is the nowcasting of COVID-19 mortality: given a stream of reported counts of daily deaths, can we correct for the delays in reporting to paint an accurate picture of the present, with uncertainty? Without this correction, raw data will often mislead by suggesting an improving situation. We present a flexible approach using a latent Gaussian process that is capable of describing the changing auto-correlation structure present in the reporting time-delay surface. This approach also yields robust estimates of uncertainty for the estimated nowcasted numbers of deaths. We test assumptions in model specification such as the choice of kernel or hyper priors, and evaluate model performance on a challenging real dataset from Brazil. Our experiments show that Gaussian process nowcasting performs favourably against both comparable methods, and against a small sample of expert human predictions. Our approach has substantial practical utility in disease modelling -- by applying our approach to COVID-19 mortality data from Brazil, where reporting delays are large, we can make informative predictions on important epidemiological quantities such as the current effective reproduction number.","Hawryluk, Iwona; Hoeltgebaum, Henrique; Mishra, Swapnil; Miscouridou, Xenia; Schnekenberg, Ricardo P; Whittaker, Charles; Vollmer, Michaela; Flaxman, Seth; Bhatt, Samir; Mellan, Thomas A",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11249v2.pdf,230

Soluble interleukin 2 receptors (sIL2R) have been suspected as being prognostic markers for infectious diseases. This study validated the usefulness of sIL2R as a marker for deaths related to COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled participants who showed positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA admitted to the current hospital between 01 April and 30 September 2020. Of the 102 patients enrolled in this study, sIL2R levels were measured in 87 patients. For comparisons between survival and non-survival groups, potential confounding variables were entered into univariate models, and variables showing significant correlations (p < 0.05) in those models were added to a multivariate model. RESULTS: Being aged &#8805;60 years and sIL2R levels &#8805;1060 U/ml were significantly associated with mortality on univariate analyses; only sIL2R levels significantly correlated with mortality on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Further, sequential sIL2R levels in three patients were increased at progression or death.

The current report summarizes the challenges and solutions of the transition from an in-person (ie, face-to-face) to a videoconference intervention delivery approach in response to the Coronavirus Disease pandemic. METHOD: Participants included patient-family caregiver dyads who were enrolled in ongoing yoga trials and 2 certified yoga therapists who delivered the yoga sessions. We summarized their experiences using recordings of the yoga sessions and interventionists' progress notes. RESULTS: Out of 7 dyads participating in the parent trial, 1 declined the videoconferenced sessions. Participants were between the ages of 55 and 76 and mostly non-Hispanic White (83%). Patients were mainly male (83%), all had stage III or IV cancer and were undergoing radiotherapy. Caregivers were all female. Despite challenges in the areas of technology, location, and setting, instruction and personal connection, the overall acceptability was high among patients, caregivers, and instructors. Through this transition process, solutions to these challenges were found, which are described here. CONCLUSION: Although in-person interventions are favored by both the study participants and the interventionists, videoconference sessions were deemed acceptable. All participants had the benefit of a previous in-person experience, which was helpful and perhaps necessary for older and advanced cancer patients requiring practice modifications. In a remote setting, the assistance of caregivers seems particularly beneficial to ensure practice safety.

505508,Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder secondary to COVID-19,2020,"Resident memory T cells (TRM) positioned within the respiratory tract are probably required to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread and COVID-19. Importantly, TRM are mostly non-recirculating, which reduces the window of opportunity to examine these cells in the blood as they move to the lung parenchyma. Here, we identify circulating virus-specific T cell responses during acute infection with functional, migratory and apoptotic patterns modulated by viral proteins and associated with clinical outcome. Disease severity is associated predominantly with IFNÎ³ and IL-4 responses, increased responses against S peptides and apoptosis, whereas non-hospitalized patients have increased IL-12p70 levels, degranulation in response to N peptides and SARS-CoV-2-specific CCR7+ T cells secreting IL-10. In convalescent patients, lung-TRM are frequently detected even 10 months after initial infection, in which contemporaneous blood does not reflect tissue-resident profiles. Our study highlights a balanced anti-inflammatory antiviral response associated with a better outcome and persisting TRM cells as important for future protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Grau-Expósito, Judith; Sánchez-Gaona, Nerea; Massana, Núria; Suppi, Marina; Astorga-Gamaza, Antonio; Perea, David; Rosado, Joel; Falcó, Anna; Kirkegaard, Cristina; Torrella, Ariadna; Planas, Bibiana; Navarro, Jordi; Suanzes, Paula; Álvarez-Sierra, Daniel; Ayora, Alfonso; Sansano, Irene; Esperalba, Juliana; Andrés, Cristina; Antón, Andrés; Ramón Y Cajal, Santiago; Almirante, Benito; Pujol-Borrell, Ricardo; Falcó, Vicenç; Burgos, Joaquín; Buzón, María J; Genescà, Meritxell",Nat Commun,,230

509301,"Thinking Globally, Acting Locally - The U.S. Response to Covid-19",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Following two coronaviral epidemics in 2002 and 2012, December 2019 saw the emergence of a potentially fatal coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China. While most coronaviruses are responsible for mild respiratory infections, they have been demonstrated to be neuroinvasive and neurotropic for over three decades. In this review, we assess whether SARS-CoV-2 follows this trend and if the neuroinvasive potential of this novel coronavirus is worthy of further investigation. METHODS: To obtain sources for this study, we performed an online search through Pubmed, Researchgate and Google Scholar, finding 537 articles. After analysing them according to PRISMA, we included 14 in this review. DISCUSSION: Data regarding neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 is scarce and mostly inconsistent. There are however identifiable trends which might provide a basis for future research. There is strong evidence that this novel coronavirus may be neuroinvasive and could cause a wide array of neurological symptoms and complications. Cerebrospinal fluid testing may shed more light on the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system. Clarification of the respiratory failure mechanisms requires post mortem examinations and brain tissue analysis, and further research is of the utmost importance. However, we strongly believe that the existing evidence is enough to raise awareness among clinicians and help guide them through the diagnosis and optimal therapy of COVID-19 patients.","Slyk, Stanislaw; Domitrz, Izabela",Neurol Neurochir Pol,,230

This paper summarizes the interim results. Methods: Asymptomatic physicians at risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 responded to online questions at baseline and 7 weeks post-baseline. Baseline data included demographics, prophylaxis regimen (including ""no prophylaxis"") and start date. Participants who provided complete week-7 data (information on type of health facility [COVID/Non-COVID], number of presumed/confirmed cases exposed to, PPE use, SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptoms, regimen adherence and intercurrent illness) comprised the Completer population. Limited data (regimen adherence, SARS-CoV-2 testing) was collected for participants who failed to provide complete week7 data. Those providing limited/complete information comprised the Evaluable population. Results: Of 369 enrolled participants, 182 (mean age 42±11.05 years) comprised the Evaluable population. They showed a male preponderance (67.6%). Practitioners from Maharashtra (59.9%) and specialties of Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology and Critical Care (63.2%) accounted for the majority. ICMR's HCQ prophylaxis regimen was initiated by 125 (68.7%) participants with 31 (17%) initiating 'No prophylaxis'. The highest adherence was for the ICMRregimen (87.2%). In the Completer population comprising 150 participants, 87 were exposed to presumed (81) and/or confirmed cases (60). Most exposures to confirmed cases (49, 81.7%) were high-risk. PPE use was generally high (75-100%). Most participants (94.7%) did not report an AE. The proportions with an AE was similar with ICMR regimen (5.9%) and no prophylaxis (6.5%). Interpretation and conclusions: Physicians in India preferred ICMR's HCQ regimen. The regimen appears to be safe and associated with a high level of adherence.","Bavdekar, S B; Chandrasekaran, A; Govindarajan, R P; Malik, S; Bajaj, S; Javeri, Y; Niranjan, V",J Assoc Physicians India,,230

513028,Rationale of a loading dose initiation for hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 infection in the DisCoVeRy trial-authors' response,2021,"Purpose: In early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the disease COVID-19, caused by a new variant of coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a global pandemic. The government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement of people as a preventive measure. This survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India. Methods: An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results: A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes. At the time of taking the survey, 72.5% of the respondents (913/1260) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown. Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement. The proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes, government and municipal hospitals (126/253;49.8%) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those in private practice (174/775;22.4%). Apart from emergencies such as trauma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis (81.8%), other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections (9.1%) and cataract surgeries (5.9%). Approximately, 77.5% (976/1260) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began. In addition, 59.1% (745/1260) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients. When asked about the resumption of practice upon easing off of the restrictions, 57.8% (728/1260) of the respondents said they were unsure of when to resume elective surgeries; furthermore, 62.8% (791/1260) were unsure about the preferred screening strategy or precautionary approach prior to resuming surgeries and were awaiting guidelines. Conclusion: Our survey shows that majority of ophthalmologists in India were not seeing patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, with near-total cessation of elective surgeries. Emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5% of ophthalmologists who responded. A large proportions of ophthalmologists had switched over to telephonic advice or other forms of telemedicine to assist patients. Most of the responding ophthalmologists were unclear about when and how to resume surgeries upon easing off of the COVID-19 related restrictions. Regulatory bodies should take note of this and issue appropriate guidelines regarding the same.","Nair, Akshay Gopinathan; Gandhi, Rashmin A; Natarajan, Sundaram",Indian J Ophthalmol,,230

This survey assessed the status of community mitigations to fight the pandemic. The ongoing forward effort by local task forces can be assessed to note the achievements. Methods: A mixed design using quantitative and qualitative triangulations used. Data was collected through interviewer administration using a structured W.H.O tool. The univariate and bivariate analysis employed to analyze descriptive statistics. The logistic regression model was applied to control confounders and determine potent predictors. Objective: This study assessed community mitigation status on covid-19 pandemic at four selected districts of southwest Ethiopia: a mixed design survey. Results: From the total of 624 participants interviewed, nearly half reported good mitigations toward fighting the covid-19 epidemic. This study suggested that nearly half (54.2%) of the participants had good knowledge about the newly emerged epidemic symptoms. Three out of five participants had good Knowledge of preventive practices (63.1%). Nearly four out of five (72.6%) participants were knowledgeable about 14 days incubation period. The odds of having good mitigation to prevent covid-19 among the participants who had single marital status were 55% lower than those married union (AOR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.86). The odds of having good mitigation to prevent covid-19 among the participants (good knowledge symptoms) were 3.4 times higher than those with poor knowledge (AOR= 3.39, 95% CI: 2.19, 5.23). Conclusions and Recommendations: Participants' mitigation status to fight covid-19 was promising. Handwashing with soap and water, disinfecting surfaces, and covering mouth or nose while coughing were mitigated practices by the vast majority. Home staying was the least mitigated practice. Participants ' demographic status, knowledge of the epidemic symptoms, and knowledge of preventive measures were potent predictors of mitigations to fight covid-19.

513794,Participation in Social Activities and Relationship between Walking Habits and Disability Incidence,2021,"The successes of Artificial Intelligence in recent years in areas such as image analysis, natural language understanding and strategy games have sparked interest from the world of finance. Specifically, there are high expectations, and ongoing engineering projects, regarding the creation of artificial agents, known as robotic traders, capable of juggling the financial markets with the skill of experienced human traders. Obvious economic implications aside, this is certainly an area of great scientific interest, due to the challenges that such a real context poses to the use of AI techniques. Precisely for this reason, we must be aware that artificial agents capable of operating at such levels are not just round the corner, and that there will be no simple answers, but rather a concurrence of various technologies and methods to the success of the effort. In the course of this article, we review the issues inherent in the design of effective robotic traders as well as the consequently applicable solutions, having in view the general objective of bringing the current state of the art of robo-trading up to the next level of intelligence, which we refer to as Cognitive Trading. Key to our approach is the joining of two methodological and technological directions which, although both deeply rooted in the disciplinary field of artificial intelligence, have so far gone their separate ways: heuristics and learning.","Pareschi, Remo; Zappone, Federico",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12333v1.pdf,230

METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center observational study of patients with IRD actively monitored in the Department of Rheumatology who were hospitalized due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Forty-one (1.8%) out of 2315 patients admitted due to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia suffered from an IRD. The admission OR for patients with IRD was 1.91 against the general population, and it was considerably higher in patients with Sjögren syndrome, vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Twenty-seven patients were receiving treatment for IRD with corticosteroids, 23 with conventional DMARDs, 12 with biologics (7 rituximab [RTX], 4 anti-tumor necrosis factor [anti-TNF], and 1 abatacept), and 1 with Janus kinase inhibitors. Ten deaths were registered among patients with IRD. A higher hospitalization rate and a higher number of deaths were observed in patients treated with RTX (OR 12.9) but not in patients treated with anti-TNF (OR 0.9). CONCLUSION: Patients with IRD, especially autoimmune diseases and patients treated with RTX, may be at higher risk of severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population. More studies are needed to analyze this association further in order to help manage these patients during the pandemic.","Bachiller-Corral, Javier; Boteanu, Alina; Garcia-Villanueva, Maria Jesus; de la Puente, Carlos; Revenga, Marcelino; Diaz-Miguel, M Consuelo; Rodriguez-Garcia, Ana; Morell-Hita, Jose Luis; Valero, Marta; Larena, Carmen; Blazquez-Cañamero, Maria; Guillen-Astete, Carlos A; Garrote, Sandra; Sobrino, Cristina; Medina-Quiñones, Carmen; Vazquez-Diaz, Mónica",J. rheumatol,,230

However, there are only limited data regarding the precise prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Here, to estimate the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 infection in East Java, Indonesia, we investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We enrolled 1,819 individuals from June to December 2020 and observed that the subjects' overall prevalence of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was 11.4% (207/1,819). The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differed significantly between the job/occupation groups (P = 0.0001). A greater prevalence of IgG was detected in laboratory technicians (who take samples from suspected cases and deal with polymerase chain reaction [PCR] procedures, 22.2%) compared to medical personnel who see and take direct care of patients with COVID-19 (e.g., physicians and nurses, 6.0%), other staff in medical facilities (2.9%), general population (12.1%) and non-COVID-19 patients (14.6%). The highest prevalence among age groups was in the 40-49-year-olds (14.8%), and the lowest prevalence was in the 20-29-year-olds (7.4%). However, the younger population still showed a higher prevalence than generally reported, suggesting greater exposure to the virus but less susceptibility to the disease. A geographical difference was also observed: a higher prevalence in Surabaya (13.1%) than in Jombang (9.9%). In conclusion, the COVID-19 outbreak among asymptomatic populations was characterized by a high prevalence of infection in East Java, Indonesia.","Megasari, Ni Luh Ayu; Utsumi, Takako; Yamani, Laura Navika; Gunawan, Emily; Furukawa, Koichi; Nishimura, Mitsuhiro; Lusida, Maria Inge; Mori, Yasuko",PLoS One,,230

The association of previous diagnosis of neurological conditions with COVID-19 was evaluated through logistic regressions, adjusted for potential confounders, reported as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Nerve, nerve root and plexus disorders (G50-G59) were the most common conditions identified. The presence of COVID-19 was almost doubled in neurological conditions compared to the general population (0.45 vs. 0.24%, p < 0.0001). Previously diagnosed neurological conditions were associated with 60% higher odds of COVID-19 positive in the multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8). Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system, extrapyramidal and movement disorders, polyneuropathies and other disorders of the peripheral nervous system, cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes were significantly associated with a higher odds of COVID-19. The presence of neurological conditions was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of COVID-19 compared to the general population.","Veronese, Nicola; Smith, Lee; Barbagallo, Mario; Giannelli, Gianluigi; Caruso, Maria Gabriella; Cisternino, Anna Maria; Notarnicola, Maria; Cao, Chao; Waldhoer, Thomas; Yang, Lin",Acta neurol.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the topics associated with the public discourse against wearing masks in the United States. We also studied the relationship between the anti-mask discourse on social media and the number of new COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We collected a total of 51,170 English tweets between January 1, 2020, and October 27, 2020, by searching for hashtags against wearing masks. We used machine learning techniques to analyze the data collected. We investigated the relationship between the volume of tweets against mask-wearing and the daily volume of new COVID-19 cases using a Pearson correlation analysis between the two-time series. RESULTS: The results and analysis showed that social media could help identify important insights related to wearing masks. The results of topic mining identified 10 categories or themes of user concerns dominated by (1) constitutional rights and freedom of choice; (2) conspiracy theory, population control, and big pharma; and (3) fake news, fake numbers, and fake pandemic. Altogether, these three categories represent almost 65% of the volume of tweets against wearing masks. The relationship between the volume of tweets against wearing masks and newly reported COVID-19 cases depicted a strong correlation wherein the rise in the volume of negative tweets led the rise in the number of new cases by 9 days. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated the potential of mining social media for understanding the public discourse about public health issues such as wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasized the relationship between the discourse on social media and the potential impact on real events such as changing the course of the pandemic. Policy makers are advised to proactively address public perception and work on shaping this perception through raising awareness, debunking negative sentiments, and prioritizing early policy intervention toward the most prevalent topics.","Al-Ramahi, Mohammad; Elnoshokaty, Ahmed; El-Gayar, Omar; Nasralah, Tareq; Wahbeh, Abdullah",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,230

517561,Commercial Air Travel for Passengers With Cardiovascular Disease: Recommendations for Common Conditions,2021,"PM 2.5and PM 10could increase the risk for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in the general public and severely limit the sustainable development in urban areas. Land use regression models are effective in predicting the spatial distribution of atmospheric pollutants, and have been widely used in many cities in Europe, North America and China. To reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM 2.5and PM 10in Xi'an during the heating seasons, the authors established two regression prediction models using PM 2.5and PM 10concentrations from 181 monitoring stations and 87 independent variables. The model results are as follows: for PM 2.5, R 2= 0.713 and RMSE = 8.355 μg/m 3; for PM 10, R 2= 0.681 and RMSE = 14.842 μg/m 3. In addition to the traditional independent variables such as area of green space and road length, the models also include the numbers of pollutant discharging enterprises, restaurants, and bus stations. The prediction results reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of PM 2.5and PM 10in the heating seasons of Xi'an. These results also indicate that the spatial distribution of pollutants is closely related to the layout of industrial land and the location of enterprises that generate air pollution emissions. Green space can mitigate pollution, and the contribution of traffic emission is less than that of industrial emission. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply land use regression models to the Fenwei Plain, a heavily polluted area in China. It provides a scientific foundation for urban planning, land use regulation, air pollution control, and public health policy making. It also establishes a basic model for population exposure assessment, and promotes the sustainability of urban environments.","Han, Li; Zhao, Jingyuan; Gao, Yuejing; Gu, Zhaolin; Xin, Kai; Zhang, Jianxin",Sustainable Cities Soc.,,230

The progression of this viral infection occurs in the airways of the lungs with an exaggerated inflammatory response referred to as the ""cytokine storm"" that can lead to lethal lung injuries. In the absence of an effective anti-viral molecule and until the formulation of a successful vaccine, anti-inflammatory drugs might offer a complementary tool for controlling the associated complications of COVID-19 and thus decreasing the subsequent fatalities. Drug repurposing for several molecules has emerged as a rapid temporary solution for COVID-19. Among these drugs is Thalidomide; a historically emblematic controversial molecule that harbors an FDA approval for treating erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Based on just one-case report that presented positive outcomes in a patient treated amongst others with Thalidomide, two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of Thalidomide in treating severe respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients were registered. Yet, the absence of substantial evidence on Thalidomide usage in that context along with the discontinued studies on the efficiency of this drug in similar pulmonary diseases, might cause a significant obstacle for carrying out further clinical evaluations. Herein, we will discuss the theoretical effectiveness of Thalidomide in attenuating inflammatory complications that are encountered in COVID-19 patients while pinpointing the lack of the needed evidences to move forward with this drug.","Khalil, Athar; Kamar, Amina; Nemer, Georges",Front Immunol,,230

Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (-2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36-45 and >45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine. The study highlights that lockdown imposed to contain an infectious agent may affect eating behaviors and dietary habits, and advocates for organized nutritional support during future epidemic-related quarantines, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, including overweight and obese subjects.","Sidor, Aleksandra; Rzymski, Piotr",Nutrients,,230

Here, we describe a new use-case of conducting targeted wastewater surveillance to complement clinical testing for case identification in a small community at risk of COVID-19 transmission. On 2 July 2020, a cluster of COVID-19 cases in two unrelated households residing on different floors in the same stack of an apartment building was reported in Singapore. After cases were conveyed to healthcare facilities and six healthy household contacts were quarantined in their respective apartments, wastewater surveillance was implemented for the entire residential block. SARS-CoV-2 was subsequently detected in wastewaters in an increasing frequency and concentration, despite the absence of confirmed COVID-19 cases, suggesting the presence of fresh case/s in the building. Phone interviews of six residents in quarantine revealed that no one was symptomatic (fever/respiratory illness). However, when nasopharyngeal swabs from six quarantined residents were tested by PCR tests, one was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive case reported episodes of diarrhea and the case's stool sample was also positive for SARS-CoV-2, explaining the SARS-CoV-2 spikes observed in wastewaters. After the case was conveyed to a healthcare facility, wastewaters continued to yield positive signals for five days, though with a decreasing intensity. This was attributed to the return of recovered cases, who had continued to shed the virus. Our findings demonstrate the utility of wastewater surveillance as a non-intrusive tool to monitor high-risk COVID-19 premises, which is able to trigger individual tests for case detection, highlighting a new use-case for wastewater testing.","Wong, Judith Chui Ching; Tan, Joanna; Lim, Ying Xian; Arivalan, Sathish; Hapuarachchi, Hapuarachchige Chanditha; Mailepessov, Diyar; Griffiths, Jane; Jayarajah, Praveena; Setoh, Yin Xiang; Tien, Wei Ping; Low, Swee Ling; Koo, Carmen; Yenamandra, Surya Pavan; Kong, Marcella; Lee, Vernon Jian Ming; Ng, Lee Ching",Sci Total Environ,,230

Bottlenecks in device availability may contribute to mortality, and limited device availability even in ECMO centers has led to rationing recommendations. Therefore, we explored options for ad-hoc construction of veno-venous ECMO using readily available components, essentially, large cannulas, membrane oxygenators, and blood pumps. As thousands certified cardiac Impella pumps are distributed worldwide, we assembled lean ECMO by embedding Impella pumps coaxially in tubes, combined with standard gas exchangers.Ad-hoc integration of Impella blood pumps with gas exchange modules, large-bore venous cannulas, regular ECMO tubing, Y-pieces and connectors led to lean ECMO systems with stable performance over several days. Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood/minute is realistic. Benefit/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient needs respiratory support but required support systems in a center are exhausted.Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs is feasible using Impella blood pumps, results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules, and thus may offer another opportunity to oxygenate, ""recover the lungs"" and hopefully save lives in selected patients with severe COVID-19 disease even when conventional life support equipment is exhausted.

However, the mechanisms underlying these neurologic complications remain elusive. In this study, we aimed at determining whether neurologic symptoms were caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) direct infection or by either systemic or local proinflammatory mediators. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we checked for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, and 49 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (by Luminex) in the CSF +/- sera of a cohort of 22 COVID-19 patients with neurologic presentation and 55 neurologic control patients (inflammatory neurologic disorder [IND], noninflammatory neurologic disorder, and MS). RESULTS: We detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in patients with severe COVID-19 with signs of intrathecal synthesis for some of them. Of the 4 categories of tested patients, the CSF of IND exhibited the highest level of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, patients with COVID-19 did not present overall upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the CSF. However, patients with severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit patients) exhibited higher concentrations of CCL2, CXCL8, and vascular endothelium growth factor A (VEGF-A) in the CSF than patients with a milder form of COVID-19. In addition, we could show that intrathecal CXCL8 synthesis was linked to an elevated albumin ratio and correlated with the increase of peripheral inflammation (serum hepatocyte growth factor [HGF] and CXCL10). CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not indicate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF or signs of massive inflammation in the CSF compartment but highlight a specific impairment of the neurovascular unit linked to intrathecal production of CXCL8.","Bernard-Valnet, Raphael; Perriot, Sylvain; Canales, Mathieu; Pizzarotti, Beatrice; Caranzano, Leonardo; Castro-Jiménez, Mayté; Epiney, Jean-Benoit; Vijiala, Sergiu; Salvioni-Chiabotti, Paolo; Anichini, Angelica; Salerno, Alexander; Jaton, Katia; Vaucher, Julien; Perreau, Matthieu; Greub, Gilbert; Pantaleo, Giuseppe; Du Pasquier, Renaud A",,,230

We also studied 226 health care providers, 16 of whom developed COVID-19 and 11 of whom were hospitalised. Co-variates were compared with the 115 subjects with haematological cancers without COVID-19 and with 11 hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. There were no significant differences in baseline co-variates between subjects with haematological cancers developing or not developing COVID-19.

A hypothesis stemming from the Mount Etna area, Sicily",2020,"The impacts of poor air quality on human health are becoming more apparent. Businesses and governments are implementing technologies and policies in order to improve air quality. Despite this the PM10 air quality in the mining town of Moranbah, Australia, has worsened since measurements commenced in 2011. The annual average PM10 concentrations during 2012, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have all exceeded the Australian National Environmental Protection Measure's standard, and there has been an increase in the frequency of exceedances of the daily standard. The average annual increase in PM10 was 1.2 ± 0.5 µg m - 3 per year between 2011 and 2019 and has been 2.5 ± 1.2 µg m - 3 per year since 2014. The cause of this has not previously been established. Here, two machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted regression and random forest) have been implemented to model and then meteorologically normalise PM10 mass concentrations measured in Moranbah. The best performing model, using the random forest algorithm, was able to explain 59% of the variance in PM10 using a range of meteorological, environmental and temporal variables as predictors. An increasing trend after normalising for these factors was found of 0.6 ± 0.5 µg m - 3 per year since 2011 and 1.7 ± 0.3 µg m - 3 per year since 2014. These results indicate that more than half of the increase in PM10 is due to a rise in local emissions in the region. The remainder of the rise in PM10 was found to be due to a decrease of soil water content in the surrounding region, which can facilitate higher dust emissions. Whether the presence of open-cut coal mines exacerbated the role of soil water content is unclear. Although fires can have drastic effects on the local air quality, changes in fire patterns are not responsible for the rising trend. PM10 composition measurements or more detailed data relating to local sources is still needed to better isolate these emissions. Nonetheless, this study highlights the need and potential for action by industry and government to improve the air quality and reduce health risks for the nearby population.","Mallet, Marc Daniel",,,230

Yet, little is known about this in the contexts of developing countries. We use recently collected phone survey data by Young Lives from four countries-Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana State), Peru and Vietnam-to examine whether men and women suffer from coronavirus-triggered economic hardship differently. We find that men are more likely to lose jobs and income in Ethiopia and India-countries with a very high male-dominated formal sector. Conversely, gender effect is not significant in Peru and Vietnam with comparatively higher integration of women in formal employment. We further investigate whether gender effect varies by 'wealth' level. Findings suggests that only in India, in the wealthier group, men are more likely to face job and income loss than women, possibly indicating greater male concentration in higher-class occupations. However, gender differences in facing hardship by wealth group is not significant for other countries.","Hossain, Mobarak",Res Soc Stratif Mobil,,230

STUDY DESIGN: Review of prospectively collected data. METHODS: Prospectively collected data were extracted for adults with COVID-19 undergoing percutaneous or open tracheostomy between April 4, 2020 and June 2, 2020 at a major medical center in New York City. The primary endpoint was weaning from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included sedation weaning, decannulation, and discharge. RESULTS: One hundred one patients underwent tracheostomy, including 48 percutaneous (48%) and 53 open (52%), after a median intubation time of 24 days (IQR 20, 31). The most common complication was minor bleeding (n = 18, 18%). The all-cause mortality rate was 15% and no deaths were attributable to the tracheostomy. Eighty-three patients (82%) were weaned off mechanical ventilation, 88 patients (87%) were weaned off sedation, and 72 patients (71%) were decannulated. Censored median times from tracheostomy to sedation and ventilator weaning were 8 (95% CI 6-11) and 18 (95% CI 14-22) days, respectively (uncensored: 7 and 15 days). Median time from tracheostomy to decannulation was 36 (95% CI 32-47) days (uncensored: 32 days). Of those decannulated, 82% were decannulated during their index admission. There were no differences in outcomes or complication rates between percutaneous and open tracheostomy. Likelihood of discharge from the ICU was inversely related to intubation time, though the clinical relevance of this was small (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.943-0.998; P = .037). CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy by either percutaneous or open technique facilitated sedation and ventilator weaning in patients with COVID-19 after prolonged intubation. Additional study on the optimal timing of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 is warranted.

The process of xenon-induced general anesthesia has been shown to involve electron transfer, and the potency of xenon as a general anesthetic exhibits isotopic dependence. We propose that these observations can be explained by a mechanism in which the xenon nuclear spin influences the recombination dynamics of a naturally occurring radical pair of electrons. We develop a simple model inspired by the body of work on the radical-pair mechanism in cryptochrome in the context of avian magnetoreception, and we show that our model can reproduce the observed isotopic dependence of the general anesthetic potency of xenon in mice. Our results are consistent with the idea that radical pairs of electrons with entangled spins could be important for consciousness.","Smith, Jordan; Zadeh Haghighi, Hadi; Salahub, Dennis; Simon, Christoph",Sci Rep,,230

To identify protective immunity, optimization of the chemiluminescent reduction neutralizing test (CRNT), using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, is critical. Whether commercial antibody tests are comparably accurate is unknown. Methods Serum samples collected before variants were locally found were obtained from confirmed COVID-19 patients (n = 74), confirmed non-COVID-19 individuals (n = 179), and unscreened individuals (suspected healthy individuals, n = 229). The convalescent phase was defined as the period after day 10 from disease onset. The CRNT against pseudotyped viruses displaying the wild-type spike protein and a commercially available anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody test were assayed. The CRNT was also assayed, using South African (SA) and United Kingdom (UK)-derived variants. Results The CRNT (cut off value, 50% inhibition) and the anti-RBD antibody test (cut off value, 0.8 U/mL) concurred regarding symptomatic COVID-19 patients in the convalescent phase and clearly differentiated between patients and suspected healthy individuals (sensitivity; 95.8% and 100%, specificity; 99.1% and 100%, respectively). Anti-RBD antibody test results correlated with neutralizing titer (r = 0.47, 95% CI 0.20-0.68). Compared with the wild-type, CRNT reduction was observed for the SA and UK-derived variants. Of the samples with [≥]100 U/mL by the anti-RBD antibody test, 77.8% and 88.9% showed [≥]50% neutralization against the UK and the SA variants, respectively. Conclusion The CRNT and commercial anti-RBD antibody test effectively classified convalescent COVID-19 patients. The strong positive results using the commercial antibody test can reflect neutralizing activity against emerging variants.","Morinaga, Y.; Tani, H.; Terasaki, Y.; Nomura, S.; Kawasuji, H.; Shimada, T.; Igarashi, E.; Saga, Y.; Yoshida, Y.; Yasukochi, R.; Kaneda, M.; Murai, Y.; Ueno, A.; Miyajima, Y.; Fukui, Y.; Nagaoka, K.; Ono, C.; Matsuura, Y.; Fujimura, T.; Ishida, Y.; Oishi, K.; Yamamoto, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.25.21257828v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.25.21257828,230

We hypothesize that these changes will result in an increase in home institution match rates compared to previous years. DESIGN: Program match data was obtained using information posted to residency program Instagram pages and the hashtag #PRSMatch2021. Chi square was used to assess differences between groups. SETTING: Medical school regions were categorized as West, Midwest, South, and Northeast and compared to match program region. PARTICIPANTS: Matched candidates to integrated plastic surgery residencies RESULTS: A total of 181/187 (96.8%) integrated plastic surgery matched candidates were identified. Compared to historical controls, there was a statistically significant increase in the home match rate (24.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.004) and statistically significant decrease in match rate for students without a home plastic surgery program (21.0%, pâ¯=â¯0.004). Similar to prior years, applicants were more likely to match in their own region for all regions (p < 0.001); however, there was a statistical increase in students staying in the South region for residency compared to previous years (pâ¯=â¯0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The 2021 match cycle resulted in an increase in home program match rates, while decreasing match rates among students without a home plastic surgery program.

The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago. In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections. Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals. Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution. Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections. Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections. In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen​​​​​​ and worsening of infections. Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.","Capuano, Annalisa; Scavone, Cristina; Racagni, Giorgio; Scaglione, Francesco",Pharmacol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360482/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820311579; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311579?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104849,230

We report an extremely rare and first of its kind case of MIS-C in a neonate with persistent neutropenia. CASE DESCRIPTION A 19-day old boy presented with complaints of fever and loose stools for 1 day and developed rash after admission. Baby was investigated for sepsis and commenced on IV antibiotics empirically. In view of persistent fever, diarrhoea, rash and absence of obvious microbial etiology of inflammation, with elevated inflammatory marker and an epidemiologic link to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the diagnosis of MIS-C-was made. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was administered and defervescence occurred within 24 hours. He also developed neutropenia during course of illness which persisted on follow up.

593277,Lack of genetic evidence that fatty liver disease predisposes to COVID-19,2020-05-20,"The poxvirus life cycle, although physically autonomous from the host nucleus, is nevertheless dependent upon cellular functions. A requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, impaired vaccinia virus production. Here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway, TOFA and C75, reduce viral yield significantly, with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate, the pathway's end-product. Palmitate's major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation. Instead, the mitochondrial import and β-oxidation of palmitate are essential, as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine, which target these two processes respectively. Moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. In contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the TCA cycle (anaplerosis). Cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial β-oxidation of palmitate which drives the TCA cycle and energy production. Additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (ATP synthesis) that is ablated by etomoxir. The biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of TOFA, C75, or etomoxir, although the levels of viral DNA and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. However, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to TOFA and C75. Electron microscopic analysis of cells released into C75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their β-oxidation drives robust ATP production.","Greseth, Matthew D.; Traktman, Paula",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651651/,230

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to formulate a new and simple indicator that represents the COVID-19 spread rate by using publicly available data. METHODS: The new indicator K is a backward difference approximation of the logarithmic derivative of the cumulative number of cases with a time interval of 7 days. It is calculated as a ratio of the number of newly confirmed cases in a week to the total number of cases. RESULTS: The analysis of the current status of COVID-19 spreading over countries showed an approximate linear decrease in the time evolution of the K value. The slope of the linear decrease differed from country to country. In addition, it was steeper for East and Southeast Asian countries than for European countries. The regional difference in the slope seems to reflect both social and immunological circumstances for each country. CONCLUSIONS: The approximate linear decrease of the K value indicates that the COVID-19 spread does not grow exponentially but starts to attenuate from the early stage. The K trajectory in a wide range was successfully reproduced by a phenomenological model with the constant attenuation assumption, indicating that the total number of the infected people follows the Gompertz curve. Focusing on the change in the value of K will help to improve and refine epidemiological models of COVID-19.","Nakano, Takashi; Ikeda, Yoichi",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/20144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180742/,230

595194,Multimorbidity: Not Just for the West,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND: The homogeneous mixing assumption is widely adopted in epidemic modelling for its parsimony and represents the building block of more complex approaches, including very detailed agent-based models. The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics. METHODS: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes. RESULTS: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing.

595919,Self-diagnosed COVID-19 in people with multiple sclerosis: a community-based cohort of the UK MS Register,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis in the United States may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in opioid use, emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid-related overdoses, and opioid overdose deaths have been reported. No study has examined changes in multiple naloxone administrations, an indicator of overdose severity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study examines changes in the occurrence of naloxone administrations and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, North Carolina (NC). METHODS: Using a period-over-period approach, we compared the occurrence of opioid-related EMS runs, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during the 29-week period before (September 1, 2019, to March 9, 2020) and after NC’s COVID-19 state of emergency declaration (ie, the COVID-19 period of March 10 to September 30, 2020). Furthermore, historical data were used to generate a quasi-control distribution of period-over-period changes to compare the occurrence of each outcome during the COVID-19 period to each 29-week period back to January 1, 2014. RESULTS: All outcomes increased during the COVID-19 period. Compared to the previous 29 weeks, the COVID-19 period experienced increases in the weekly mean number of opioid-related EMS runs (25.6, SD 5.6 vs 18.6, SD 6.6; P<.001), naloxone administrations (22.3, SD 6.2 vs 14.1, SD 6.0; P<.001), and multiple naloxone administrations (5.0, SD 1.9 vs 2.7, SD 1.9; P<.001), corresponding to proportional increases of 37.4%, 57.8%, and 84.8%, respectively. Additionally, the increases during the COVID-19 period were greater than 91% of all historical 29-week periods analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, NC. For a host of reasons that need to be explored, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated the opioid crisis.","Khoury, Dalia; Preiss, Alexander; Geiger, Paul; Anwar, Mohd; Conway, Kevin Paul",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/29298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33999828/,230
596113,Sleep-HD trial: short and long-term effectiveness of existing insomnia therapies for patients undergoing hemodialysis,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: Antibody tests are essential tools to investigate humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. While first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results, accurate seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and quantitative test setups. METHODS: We have developed two quantitative, easy-to-implement SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, based on the spike receptor binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comprehensive evaluation of antigens from several biotechnological platforms enabled the identification of superior antigen designs for reliable serodiagnostic. Cut-off modelling based on unprecedented large and heterogeneous multicentric validation cohorts allowed us to define optimal thresholds for the tests’ broad applications in different aspects of clinical use, such as seroprevalence studies and convalescent plasma donor qualification. FINDINGS: Both developed serotests individually performed similarly-well as fully-automated CE-marked test systems. Our described sensitivity-improved orthogonal test approach assures highest specificity (99.8%); thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings with simple test formats. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19 and disclosed antibody level thresholds that correlate well with robust neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that antigen source and purity strongly impact serotest performance. Comprehensive biotechnology-assisted selection of antigens and in-depth characterisation of the assays allowed us to overcome limitations of simple ELISA-based antibody test formats based on chromometric reporters, to yield comparable assay performance as fully-automated platforms.

For a variety of reasons, tolerating wearing a mask is challenging for many individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). Therefore, we evaluated behavioral strategies to promote compliance with wearing a mask with six hospitalized individuals diagnosed with IDDs. One participant was compliant with wearing the mask for extended durations during baseline while engaging in various activities (e.g., academics, leisure). For the other five individuals, engagement in activities alone was ineffective. Blocking mask removal, reinforcement for mask wearing, and noncontingent access to preferred activities or competing stimuli were then evaluated using a changing-criterion design in which the duration participants were required to tolerate the mask gradually increased. Increases in compliance with mask wearing were achieved with all participants; however, the terminal duration was attained for only four of the five individuals.

In our study, we aimed to correlate the biochemical markers with hypoxemia and predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: A retrospective, observational study was conducted to include all the admitted COVID-19 patients (n = 183) diagnosed by a real-time Polymerase chain reaction and evaluated those for hypoxemia and disease outcomes by utilizing the biochemical markers. Results: Out of the 183 patients, 117 were in the ward, 66 were in ICU, 148 of them recovered, while 35 deaths were reported, 89 patients were having persisting hypoxemia (despite oxygen therapy) during the hospital stay, and the remaining 94 were non-hypoxemic with or without supplemental oxygen therapy. There were significant differences in mean hemoglobin (p = 0.028), total leukocyte count (p = 0.005), Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), serum urea and creatinine (p = 0.002), serum potassium (p = 0.009), C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), Lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.005), and Ferritin (p = 0.042) of the hypoxemic patients versus non-hypoxemic group. Amongst the deceased patients, there was significant leukocytosis (p = 0.008), increased Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), and Lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.009). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), and Lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.001) most significantly associated with hypoxemia and death. Conclusion: The inflammatory markers are a good guide for predicting the hypoxemia and disease outcome. The results concluded Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and Lactate dehydrogenase were effective biomarkers in predicting a severe course of COVID-19, but could not establish significant associations of serum Ferritin, Procalcitonin, and D-Dimer.","Asghar, Muhammad Sohaib; Ahmed, Iftekhar; Alvi, Haris; Iqbal, Sadia; Khan, Ismail; Alvi, Rabia Seher; Saeed, Zara; Irfan, Saboohi; Akhtar, Maria; Fatima, Ibraj",Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2020.1835214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33552406/,230

597396,"Sustainable Resumption of Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Procedures, and the Importance of Testing, During Endemic COVID-19",2021-02-22,"Pregnancy and birth are biological phenomena that carry heavy cultural overlays, and pregnant and birthing women need care and attention during both ordinary and extraordinary times. Most Pakistani pregnant women now go to doctors and hospitals for their perinatal care. Yet traditional community midwives, called DāĪ in the singular and Dāyūn in the plural, still attend 24% of all Pakistani births, primarily in rural areas. In this article, via data collected from 16 interviews—5 with Dāyūn and 11 with mothers, we explore a maternity care system in tension between the past and the present, the DāĪ and the doctor. We ask, what does the maternity care provided by the Dāyūn look like during times of normalcy, and how does it differ during COVID-19? We look at the roles the DāĪ has traditionally performed and how these roles have been changing, both in ordinary and in Covidian circumstances. Presenting the words of the Dāyūn we interviewed, all from Pakistan’s Sindh Province, we demonstrate their practices and show that these have not changed during this present pandemic, as these Dāyūn, like many others in Sindh Province, do not believe that COVID-19 is real—or are at least suspect that it is not. To contextualize the Dāyūn, we also briefly present local mother’s perceptions of the Dāyūn in their regions, which vary between extremely positive and extremely negative. Employing the theoretical frameworks of “authoritative knowledge” and of critical medical anthropology, we highlight the dominance of “modern” biomedicine over “traditional” healthcare systems and its effects on the Dāyūn and their roles within their communities. Positioning this article within Pakistan’s national profile, we propose formally training and institutionalizing the Dāyūn in order to alleviate the overwhelming burdens that pandemics—present and future—place on this country’s fragile maternity care system, to give mothers more—and more viable—options at all times, and to counterbalance the rising tide of biomedical hegemony over pregnancy and birth.","Ali, Inayat; Sadique, Salma; Ali, Shahbaz; Davis-Floyd, Robbie",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026899/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.622223,230
597804,Asthma does not influence the severity of COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2021-04-16,"The safety of personal protective equipment (PPE) is very important, and so is the choice of materials used. The ability of electrostatic charges (ESCs) generated from the friction of engineered materials to attract or repel viruses has a significant impact on their applications. This study examined the ESCs generated on the surface of PPE used by healthcare workers to enhance their potential effectiveness in protecting the wearer from viruses. This is a crucial consideration for the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a negative charge. The magnitudes and signs of generated ESCs on the surfaces of the PPE were determined experimentally using an Ultra Stable Surface DC Voltmeter. The high negative ESCs acquired by the polyethylene disposable cap and facemask are expected to repel negatively charged viruses and prevent them from adhering to the outer layer of the material. Also, the choice of polypropylene for facemasks and gowns is excellent because it is an aggressively negatively charged material in the triboelectric series. This property guarantees that facemasks and gowns can repel viruses from the wearer. However, the positive ESCs generated on latex glove surfaces are of great concern because they can attract negatively charged viruses and create a source of infection. In conclusion, it is necessary to ensure that PPE be made of materials whose surfaces develop a negative ESC to repel viruses, as well as to select polyethylene gloves.","Abdelwahab, Sayed F.; Mohamed, Mostafa K.; Ali, Waheed Y.; Ali, Ahmed S.",Arch Virol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05151-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231028/,230

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use machine learning to construct a model for the analysis of risk factors and prediction of mortality among ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 123 patients with COVID-19 in the ICU of Vulcan Hill Hospital were retrospectively selected from the database, and the data were randomly divided into a training data set (n=98) and test data set (n=25) with a 4:1 ratio. Significance tests, correlation analysis, and factor analysis were used to screen 100 potential risk factors individually. Conventional logistic regression methods and four machine learning algorithms were used to construct the risk prediction model for the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. The performance of these machine learning models was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Interpretation and evaluation of the risk prediction model were performed using calibration curves, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), etc, to ensure its stability and reliability. The outcome was based on the ICU deaths recorded from the database. RESULTS: Layer-by-layer screening of 100 potential risk factors finally revealed 8 important risk factors that were included in the risk prediction model: lymphocyte percentage, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, eosinophil percentage, creatinine, neutrophil percentage, and albumin level. Finally, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model established with the 8 important risk factors showed the best recognition ability in the training set of 5-fold cross validation (AUC=0.86) and the verification queue (AUC=0.92). The calibration curve showed that the risk predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual risk. In addition, using the SHAP and LIME algorithms, feature interpretation and sample prediction interpretation algorithms of the XGBoost black box model were implemented. Additionally, the model was translated into a web-based risk calculator that is freely available for public usage. CONCLUSIONS: The 8-factor XGBoost model predicts risk of death in ICU patients with COVID-19 well; it initially demonstrates stability and can be used effectively to predict COVID-19 prognosis in ICU patients.","Pan, Pan; Li, Yichao; Xiao, Yongjiu; Han, Bingchao; Su, Longxiang; Su, Mingliang; Li, Yansheng; Zhang, Siqi; Jiang, Dapeng; Chen, Xia; Zhou, Fuquan; Ma, Ling; Bao, Pengtao; Xie, Lixin",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/23128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035175/,230

MATERIALS AND METHODS: University-based outpatient clinic; Randomized controlled trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). Females between 18 and 60 years of age scheduled to undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopic excision of endometriosis were invited to participate. Eligible patients were randomized to receive postoperative care either through a traditional office visit or via telemedicine. PSQ-18 satisfaction surveys were performed by phone after the visit. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were analyzed out of which 25 were in the office group and 16 in the telemedicine group. Groups were homogenous to age (41.4 vs. 43.3 p. 48), body mass index (31.9 vs. 30.6 P = 0.52), distance in miles from home (12.7 vs. 12.4 P = 0.92), and parity (P = 0.51). PSQ-18 questionnaire was scored and each category was compared between the office and telemedicine groups. When comparing medians (interquartile range), the general satisfaction and time spent with doctor categories were significantly higher in the telemedicine group (4.0 [4.0, 4.5] vs. 4.5 [4.5, 5.0] P = 0.05), (4.0 [4.0, 4.5] vs. 4.5 [4.0, 5.0] P = 0.05). The remainder of the categories analyzed were not different between groups Technical Quality (4.0 [3.8, 4.5] vs. 4.5 [3.9, 5.0] P = 0.13), Interpersonal Manner (4.0 [4.0, 4.5] vs. 4.5 [4.0, 5.0] P = 0.34), Communication (4.5 [4.0, 4.5] vs. 4.5 [4.3, 5.0] P = 0.21), Accessibility and Convenience (4.0 [3.5, 4.5] v 4.0 [3.6, 4.5] P = 0.84).

598984,Clinical Profiles and Mortality of COVID‐19 Inpatients with Parkinson's Disease in Germany,2021-05-04,"OBJECTIVE: To develop regulatory network to explore and model the regulatory relationships of protein biomarkers and classify different disease groups. METHODS: Regulatory network is constructed to be a hopfield-like network with nodes representing biomarkers and directional connections to be regulations in between. The input to the network is the measured expression levels of biomarkers, and the output is the summation of regulatory strengths from other biomarkers. The network is optimized towards minimizing the energy function that is defined as the measure of the disagreement between the input and output of the network. To simulate more complicated regulations, a sigmoid kernel function is imposed on each node to construct a non-linear regulatory network. RESULTS: Two datasets have been used as test beds, one dataset includes patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with different responses to chemotherapy drug, and the other consists of patients of severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, and control normals. The regulatory networks among protein biomarkers were reconstructed for different disease conditions in each dataset. We demonstrated our methods have better classification capability when comparing with conventional methods including Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), K-nearest neighborhood (KNN), linear support vector machines (linSVM) and radial basis function based support vector machines (rbfSVM). CONCLUSION: The derived networks can effectively capture the unique regulatory patterns of protein markers associated with different patient groups and hence can be used for disease classification. The discovered regulation relationships can potentially provide insights to revealing the molecular signaling pathways. In this paper, a novel technique of regulatory network is proposed on purpose of modeling biomarker regulations and classifying different disease groups. The network is composed of a certain number of nodes that are directionally connected in between in which nodes denote predictors and connections to be the regulation relationship. The network is optimized towards minimizing its energy function with biomarker expression data acquired from a specific patient group, thus the optimized network can model the regulatory relationship of biomarkers under the same circumstance. To simulate more complicated regulations, a sigmoid kernel function is imposed on each node to construct a non-linear regulatory network. The regulatory network can extract unique features of each disease condition, thus one immediate application of regulatory network is to classifying different diseases. We demonstrated that regulatory network is capable of performing disease classification through comparing with conventional methods including FLD, KNN, linSVM and rbfSVM on two protein datasets. We believe our method is promising in mining knowledge of protein regulations and be powerful for disease classification.","Wang, Hong Qiang; Zhu, Hai Long; Cho, William C.S.; Yip, Timothy T.C.; Ngan, Roger K.C.; Law, Stephen C.K.",Artif Intell Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19962281/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2009.07.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365709001043; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0933365709001043,230

Although the approved vaccines exhibited high efficacies in randomized controlled trials, their population effectiveness in the real world remains less clear, thus casting uncertainty over the prospects for herd immunity. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination program and predicted the path to herd immunity in the U.S. Using data from 12 October 2020 to 7 March 2021, we estimated that vaccination reduced the total number of new cases by 4.4 million (from 33.0 to 28.6 million), prevented approximately 0.12 million hospitalizations (from 0.89 to 0.78 million), and decreased the population infection rate by 1.34 percentage points (from 10.10% to 8.76%). We then built a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with vaccination to predict herd immunity. Our model predicts that if the average vaccination pace between January and early March 2021 (2.08 doses per 100 people per week) is maintained, the U.S. can achieve herd immunity by the last week of July 2021, with a cumulative vaccination coverage of 60.2%. Herd immunity could be achieved earlier with a faster vaccination pace, lower vaccine hesitancy, or higher vaccine effectiveness. These findings improve our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 vaccines and can inform future public health policies regarding vaccination, especially in countries with ongoing vaccination programs.","Chen, X.; Huang, H.; Ju, J.; Sun, R.; Zhang, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.08.21256892v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.21256892,230

In the case of SARS-COV-2, the genetic sequencing was done quickly, in one month. Since then, worldwide research has focused on obtaining a vaccine. This has a major economic impact because new technological platforms and advanced genetic engineering procedures are required to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. The most difficult scientific challenge for this future vaccine obtained in the laboratory is the proof of clinical safety and efficacy. The biggest challenge of manufacturing is the construction and validation of production platforms capable of making the vaccine on a large scale.","Calina, Daniela; Docea, Anca Oana; Petrakis, Demetrios; Egorov, Alex M.; Ishmukhametov, Aydar A.; Gabibov, Alexsandr G.; Shtilman, Michael I.; Kostoff, Ronald; Carvalho, Félix; Vinceti, Marco; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",Int J Mol Med,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2020.4596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377694/,230

Reports about comprehensive investigation of COVID-19 viremia are extremely scanty. Herein, we present four COVID-19 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in blood, accounting for 12.12% of 33 detected cases. Rapid deterioration of these cases with septic shock, accompanying with lung CT images enlarged rapidly, decrease of blood oxygen, heart rate drop (with asynchrony of hypoxemia) accompanied with SARS-CoV-2 viremia. It indicates that massive replication and releasing into blood of SARS-CoV-2 and secondary inflammation storm may lead to injury of multiple organs and poor prognosis. So, positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test in blood may be a good forecasting marker of rapid deterioration of COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, clearance of viremia may indicate tendency for recovery.","Tan, Cuiyan; Li, Songbiao; Liang, Yingjian; Chen, Meizhu; Liu, Jing",Braz J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2020.08.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867020301380; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867020301380?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950458/,230
603897,Ventilating two patients with one ventilator: technical setup and laboratory testing,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Although the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have attracted interest, little attention has focused on its positive effects and possible post-traumatic growth. AIMS: To assess anxiety, well-being and post-traumatic growth in carers of children aged 6–16 years in Portugal and the UK. METHOD: A cross-sectional online survey of volunteers conducted at the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 during lockdown (1 May to 27 June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 385 caregivers (Portuguese, n = 185; UK, n = 200), predominantly mothers (n = 341, 88.6%), completed the survey. The majority were working exclusively from home (n = 271, 70.4%), almost half reported a reduction in income (n = 174, 45.2%), most children were home taught (n = 358, 93%), and 75 (19.5%) identified a family member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In total, 341 caregivers (88.6%) identified positives arising from COVID-19, most commonly related to the post-traumatic growth domains of improved relationships, a greater appreciation of life, discovering and embracing new possibilities, and positive spiritual change. A comparison of those who did (n = 341) and did not (n = 34) report any positives found a significant difference in well-being scores (t(373) = 2.24, P = 0.025) but not in anxiety scores (t(373) = 0.75, P = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Despite experiencing considerable adversity, examples of post-traumatic growth during the lockdown were common.

605080,Variation in tuberculosis treatment outcomes and treatment supervision practices in Uganda,2020-09-12,"BACKGROUND: During the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Iran reported high numbers of infections and deaths. In the following months, the burden of this infection decreased significantly, possibly due to the impact of a package of interventions. We modeled the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in Iran to quantify the impacts of these interventions. METHODS: We used a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model to model the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran, from January 21, 2020 to September 21, 2020. We estimated the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Under different scenarios, we assessed the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including physical distancing measures and self-isolation. We also estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt ), using our mathematical model and epidemiologic data. RESULTS: If no NPIs were applied, there could have been a cumulative number of 51 800 000 (95% UI: 1 910 000- 77 600 000) COVID-19 infections and 266 000 (95% UI: 119 000-476 000) deaths by September 21, 2020. If physical distancing interventions, such as school/border closures and self-isolation interventions had been introduced a week earlier than they were actually launched, 30.8% and 35.2% reduction in the number of deaths and infections respectively could have been achieved by September 21, 2020. The observed daily number of deaths showed that the Rt was one or more than one almost every day during the analysis period. CONCLUSION: Our models suggest that the NPIs implemented in Iran between January 21, 2020 and September 21, 2020 had significant effects on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Our study also showed that the timely implementation of NPIs showed a profound effect on further reductions in the numbers of infections and deaths. This highlights the importance of forecasting and early detection of future waves of infection and of the need for effective preparedness and response capabilities.","Nakhaeizadeh, Mehran; Eybpoosh, Sana; Jahani, Yunes; Ahmadi Gohari, Milad; Haghdoost, Ali Akbar; White, Lisa; Sharifi, Hamid",Int. j. health policy manag,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273920/,230

Prenatal care (PNC) providing institutes should identify the needs and demands of pregnant women by optimizing the means of PNC services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to: a) explain prenatal care experiences; b) assess the factors affecting self-care, and c) present a prenatal care guideline and Strategies to improve the PNC. METHODS: This mixed-methods study with a sequential explanatory design consists of three phases. The first phase is a qualitative study exploring the prenatal care experiences among pregnant women. In this phase, the subjects will be selected through purposive sampling; moreover, in-depth individual interviewing will be used for data collection. Finally, the conventional content analysis approach will be employed for data analysis. The second phase is quantitative and will be used as a cross-sectional approach for assessing the association between psychological factors of self-care. In this regard, a multistage cluster sampling method will be used to select 215 subjects who will be visited in health care centers of Tabriz, Iran. The third phase will be focusing on developing a prenatal care guideline and Strategies, using the qualitative and quantitative results of the previous phases, a review of the related literature, and the nominal group technique will be performed among experts. DISCUSSION: The present research is the first study to investigate the prenatal care experiences and factors influencing self-care among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic. For the purposes of the study, a mixed-methods approach will be used which aims to develop strategies for improving health care services. It is hoped that the strategy proposed in the current study could lead to improvements in this regard.

606681,Characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with covid-19 at a safety-net hospital,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Given that the severe shortage of hospital beds has led to early discharge and insufficient patient education on home care routines and isolation protocols, the close follow-up of patients and their immediate relatives is an integral part of transitioning from hospital care to home care for patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We designed the Tele-COVID-19 prospective cohort to follow-up with COVID-19 patients in Tehran, Iran, and improve health care delivery and the recording of postdischarge patients’ clinical profiles. METHODS: All adult patients who were admitted to the COVID-19 wards of teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran were eligible to participate in this cohort study. At baseline, patients were recruited from 4 major hospitals from March 9, 2020 to May 20, 2020. Telephone follow-ups, which were led by volunteer medical students, were conducted on postdischarge days 1-3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. We collected data on a range of sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics by using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 950 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were approached, 823 (response rate: 86.6%) consented and were enrolled into the cohort. Of the 823 participants, 449 (54.5%) were male. The mean age of participants was 50.1 years (SD 12.6 years). During the initial data collection phase, more than 5000 phone calls were made and over 577 reports of critical patients who were in need of urgent medical attention were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The Tele-COVID-19 cohort will provide patients with sufficient education on home care and isolation, and medical advice on care and the proper use of drugs. In addition, by preventing unnecessary hospital returns and providing information on household SARS-CoV-2 transmission as early as possible, this cohort will help with effective disease management in resource-limited settings.

Process mapping exercises were conducted during three unique emerging disease outbreak contexts with different: mode of transmission, size, and health system infrastructure. System functioning improved considerably in each country. In Sierra Leone, laboratory testing was accelerated from 6 days to within 24 hours. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, time to suspected case notification reduced from 7 to 3 days. In Nigeria, key data reached the national level in 48 hours instead of 5 days.

607708,A Case of Suspected Radiation Recall Pneumonitis After a COVID-19 Infection,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discoveries. Current platforms available for the distribution of scientific and clinical research data and information include preprint repositories and traditional peer-reviewed journals. In recent times, social media has emerged as a helpful platform to share scientific and medical discoveries. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively analyze activity on social media (specifically, Twitter) and that related to publications in the form of preprint and peer-reviewed journal articles in the context of COVID-19 and gastroenterology during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID-19–related data from Twitter (tweets and user data) and articles published in preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv) as well as in the PubMed database were collected and analyzed during the first 6 months of the pandemic, from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ–specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity. Any relationship between Twitter activity and preprint articles published and that between Twitter activity and PubMed articles published overall, by organ system, and by geographic location were identified using Spearman’s rank-order correlation. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7164 journal publications, and 4702 preprint publications were retrieved. Twitter activity (ie, number of tweets) peaked in March 2020, whereas preprint and publication activity (ie, number of articles published) peaked in April 2020. Overall, strong correlations were identified between trends in Twitter activity and preprint and publication activity (P<.001 for both). COVID-19 data across the three platforms mainly concentrated on pulmonology or critical care, but when analyzing the field of gastroenterology specifically, most tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal gastroenterology. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between trends in Twitter and publication activity for all gastroenterology topics (luminal gastroenterology: P=.009; hepatology and inflammatory bowel disease: P=.006; gastrointestinal endoscopy: P=.007), except pancreatology (P=.20), suggesting that Twitter activity did not correlate with publication activity for this topic. Finally, Twitter activity was the highest in the United States (7331 tweets), whereas PubMed activity was the highest in China (1768 publications). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential of social media as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis. Sharing and spreading information on COVID-19 in a timely manner during the pandemic has been paramount; this was achieved at a much faster pace on social media, particularly on Twitter. Future investigation could demonstrate how social media can be used to augment and promote scholarly activity, especially as the world begins to increasingly rely on digital or virtual platforms. Scientists and clinicians should consider the use of social media in augmenting public awareness regarding their scholarly pursuits.","Taneja, Sonia L; Passi, Monica; Bhattacharya, Sumona; Schueler, Samuel A; Gurram, Sandeep; Koh, Christopher",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974550/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26956,230

METHODS: A moving window of 2 mo was used to train the transfer function TS model that was then tested on the next week data. After accounting for a secular trend and weekly cycle of the SDI, a high correlation was documented between it and the daily caseload 9 days later. Similar patterns were also observed on the daily COVID-19 cases and incorporated in our models. RESULTS: In most cases, the proposed models provide a reasonable performance that was, on average, moderately better than that delivered by TS models based only on previous observations. The model coefficients associated with the SDI were statistically significant for most of the training/test sets. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed models that incorporate SDI can forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in a region. Their parameters have real-life interpretations and, hence, can help understand the inner workings of the epidemic.

METHODS: Between December 2017 and June 2020, a total of 57 patients (48 males, 9 females; median age: 12.2 days; range, 2 to 50 days) who were diagnosed with transposition of the great arteries in our clinic and underwent arterial switch operation were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were followed by the neonatologist in the neonatal intensive care unit during the preoperative and postoperative period. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (66.7%) patients had intact ventricular septum, 16 (28.1%) had ventricular septal defect, two (3.5%) had coarctation of the aorta, and one (1.7%) had Taussig-Bing anomaly. Coronary artery anomaly was present in 14 (24.5%) patients. The most common complications in the intensive care unit were renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis in seven (12.3%) patients, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia in six (10.5%) patients, and eight (14%) patients left their chests open. The median length of stay in intensive care unit was 13.8 (range, 9 to 25) days and the median length of hospital stay was 24.5 (range, 16 to 47) days. The overall mortality rate for all patients was 12.3% (n=7). The median follow-up was 8.2 months. A pulmonary valve peak Doppler gradient of ≥36 mmHg was detected in five patients (8.7%) who were followed, and these patients were monitored by providing medical treatment. None of the patients needed reoperation or reintervention. CONCLUSION: We believe that arterial switch operation, one of the complex neonatal cardiac surgery, can be performed with an acceptable mortality and morbidity rate with the use of neonatology-focused intensive care modality, which is supported by pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiac surgery.","Doyurgan, Onur; Özdemir, Fatih; Akdeniz, Osman; İrdem, Ahmet Kuddusi; Matur Okur, Nilüfer; Salık, Fikret; Aldudak, Bedri",Turk Gogus Kalp Damar Cerrahisi Derg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104506/; https://doi.org/10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2021.20309,230

610433,Unraveled roles of hyaluronan in severe COVID-19,2021-01-15,"Background An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December, 2019. The epicentre, Wuhan in Hubei Province, was in lockdown. From Jan 23, 2020, most hospitals in Wuhan only focused on patients with COVID-19, and patients with chronic diseases could not visit their physicians in clinic and had no access to prescriptions. Smart System of Disease Management (SSDM) is a series of mobile applications for chronic disease management that includes both patient and physician interfaces. After training in clinic, patients regularly do a disease activity assessment, and input data from lab tests as well as their medication. The data is then synchronised to the mobile of the responsible physician. The physician can then do an online consultation and renew prescriptions on the basis of real-time data from his or her patients. We aimed to establish the feasibility and effects of SSDM in maintaining effective interactions between patients and physicians in Hubei province during the COVID-19 epidemic period. Methods Based on the SSDM database, we did a multicentre retrospective cohort study of patients with rheumatic disease in Hubei province in China. SSDM had been widely used across China since 2015. To study the influence of interruption of routine care by the COVID-19 epidemic for patients with rheumatic disease, we included patients registered with SSDM from Hubei Province. Data on patient disease activities, online consultations, and prescription refilling, as well as surveys on satisfaction about the online service were extracted from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 27, 2020, acting as the study group, and data from the same period during 2018 and 2019 were also extracted as a control. Inclusion criteria included a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatic disease and disease duration of at least 3 months. Patients were excluded from the study if they declined participation or discontinued before completion of the survey. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, achieving a disease activity score with 28 joints (DAS28) of less than 3·2 was considered to be a treat-to-target (T2T) status. For patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease activity index-2000 (SLESAI-2K) score of less than 4 was the main target of the lupus low disease-activity state (LLDAS). We compared the T2T and LLDAS prevalence during the epidemic period of 2020 with that of 2018 and 2019. All statistical analyses were done with Python version 3.7.4. We used descriptive and frequency statistics (percentage) to describe baseline demographic information and clinical information. Comparison of ratio variables between two groups was done with a χ2 test. Findings By Feb 27, 2020, a total of 173 560 adult patients (46 861 [27%] men and 126 699 [73%] women) with rheumatic disease from 860 hospitals across China registered and routinely used SSDM since 2015. Patients were encouraged to upload their data and do a disease activity self-assessment every 1–3 months. 10 441 (6%) of 173 560 patients (3237 [31%] with rheumatoid arthritis and 1566 [15%] with systemic lupus erythematosus) were managed by 176 rheumatologists from 42 hospitals in Hubei province. From Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 27, 2020, 69 rheumatologists from 28 hospitals provided 1451 patients with 1692 consultations and supplied 566 (39%) of them with continued medication, which included 55 commonly used therapeutic drugs for rheumatic diseases. 247 (8%) of 3237 patients with rheumatoid arthritis during the 2020 epidemic and 350 (9%) in same period during 2018 and 2019 did the DAS28 self-assessments, and T2T was 47% in 2020 compared with 50% in 2018 and 2019, (p=0·53). 293 (19%) of 1566 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in 2020 and 210 (16%) in 2018 and 2019 did the SLESAI-2K self-assessments, and LLDAS was 60% in 2020 compared with 47% in 2018 and 2019 (p=0·03).

610508,Co‐circulation of COVID‐19 and dengue: A perspective from Pakistan,2020-09-29,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care in a module hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic and provide reference for domestic and foreign pharmacists participating in the epidemic prevention and control. SETTING: The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged. Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth ¥1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. PRACTICE INNOVATION: The new COVID-19 “module” pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and “zero contact” pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform “WeChat.” This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. EVALUATION: With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation. RESULTS: The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. CONCLUSION: The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.","Hua, XiaoLi; Gu, Ming; Zeng, Fang; Hu, Huiping; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Yu; Shi, Chen",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319120301539?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336673/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.04.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319120301539,230
610772,Validity of Lung Ultrasound: Is an Image Worth More Than a Thousand Sounds?,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: The long history of distrust that characterizes the relationship between the Black/African-American population and the US Medical community makes COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy of great concern. A needs assessment of the Black/African-American community assessed willingness and explored the perceptions of community members regarding COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: The study used a mixed-methods approach. Respondents (n = 183) were surveyed with a web-based questionnaire. They were asked whether there would get vaccinated for COVID-19 barring any access or cost-related challenges. Perceptions of community members regarding vaccination were explored through one-on-one interviews (n = 30) and eight focus groups (n = 49), with participants drawn from across various demographic characteristics. Survey responses were summarized using frequencies and proportions. A thematic analysis was conducted on the qualitative data. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of respondents indicated “Yes” (willing to get vaccinated); 26.8% indicated “No”, while 37.1% expressed hesitancy (“Maybe” or “I don’t know”). Themes emerging from the qualitative data are grouped into three broad categories: vaccine accessibility (transportation, information, navigating healthcare system); vaccine hesitancy (with sub-categories of compliance, complacency and confidence); and vaccine “resistance” (conspiracy theories, conflicting beliefs, distrust of Government, trustworthiness of Health care). CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate a nuanced expansion of “vaccine hesitancy” to delineate groups with varying issues and perspectives. Interventions to enhance vaccination rates in Black/African-American communities should incorporate components that assure accessibility at the minimum, but also address non-access-related issues. Priority should be given to enhancing vaccine literacy, information-sharing as efficacy and safety data emerge, and addressing specific concerns identified through community-engaged outreach efforts.","Okoro, Olihe; Kennedy, Janet; Simmons, Glenn; Vosen, Elyse Carter; Allen, Kay; Singer, Desiré; Scott, Desmond; Roberts, Renee",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34553340/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01150-0,230

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A methodological paper, with a formative approach to rapid living systematic reviews. RESULTS: Based on our experience, we propose the following definition of rapid living SR: ""A dynamic method of knowledge synthesis that allows for the constant updating of new emerging evidence and refinement of its methodological quality"". This method has the benefit of accelerating the conduct of traditional systematic reviews and allows for a synergistic adaptation of methodology based on the quality of the evidence with a flexibility to update results, methods and collaborations. CONCLUSION: Our proposed methodology has been helpful to synthesize the rapidly evolving evidence in the field of rehabilitation during the pandemic. Similarly, it may be useful when a rapid answer is urgently needed to make informed decisions.

611301,Infections as Novel Risk Factors of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases: Pathophysiological Links and Therapeutic Implications,2021-06-08,"Background: In 2006, Malawi developed a national influenza plan to mitigate, prevent and manage the burden of infection should an outbreak occur. In 2009, it translated its contingency plan to respond to the unfolding influenza pandemic. However, little is known of how Malawi translated its national influenza plan into response actions, or the success of these responses. Objective: To investigate how Malawi translated its preparedness plan and so broaden our understanding of the outcomes of the responses. Methods: We draw on data from 22 in-depth interviews with government policymakers and people working at a policy level in various non-governmental organisations, conducted to assess the level of preparedness and the challenges of translating this. Results: Through a number of public health initiatives, authorities developed communication strategies, strengthened influenza surveillance activities and updated overall goals in pandemic training and education. However, without influenza drills, exercises and simulations to test the plan, activating the pandemic plan, including coordinating and deploying generic infection control measures, was problematic. Responses during the pandemic were at times ‘weak and clumsy’ and failed to mirror the activities and processes highlighted in the preparedness plan. Conclusions: Participants stressed that in order to achieve a coordinated and successful response to mitigate and prevent the further transmission of pandemic influenza, good preparation was critical. The key elements which they identified as relevant for a rapid response included effective communications, robust evidence-based decision-making, strong and reliable surveillance systems and flexible public health responses. To effectively articulate a viable trajectory of pandemic responses, the potential value of simulation exercises could be given more consideration as a mean of sustaining good levels of preparedness and responses against future pandemics. These all demand a well-structured planning for and response to pandemic influenza strategy developed by a functioning scientific and policy advisory committee.","Sambala, Evanson Z.; Manderson, Lenore",Glob Health Action,https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2017.1341225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753109/,230

We studied the occurrence and hospitalization rates of HCoV over 9 years. METHODS: Children from Sør-Trøndelag County, Norway, hospitalized with RTIs and asymptomatic controls, were prospectively enrolled from 2006 to 2015. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed with semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for HCoV subtypes OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and 13 other respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: HCoV was present in 9.1% (313/3458) of all RTI episodes: 46.6% OC43, 32.3% NL63, 16.0% HKU1, and 5.8% 229E. Hospitalization rates for HCoV-positive children with lower RTIs were 1.5 and 2.8 per 1000 <5 and <1 years of age, respectively. The detection rate among controls was 10.2% (38/373). Codetections occurred in 68.1% of the patients and 68.4% of the controls. In a logistic regression analysis, high HCoV genomic loads (cycle threshold <28 in PCR analysis) were associated with RTIs (odds ratio = 3.12, P = .016) adjusted for relevant factors. CONCLUSIONS: HCoVs occurred in 1 of 10 hospitalized children with RTIs and asymptomatic controls. A high HCoV genomic load was associated with RTI. HCoVs are associated with a substantial burden of RTIs in need of hospitalization.","Heimdal, Inger; Moe, Nina; Krokstad, Sidsel; Christensen, Andreas; Skanke, Lars Høsøien; Nordbø, Svein Arne; Døllner, Henrik",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30418633/,230

As emergent viruses may cause episodic outbreaks of disease over time, human samples are limited. Systems biology and genetic technologies maximize opportunities for identifying critical host and viral genetic factors that regulate susceptibility and virus-induced disease severity. These approaches provide discovery platforms that highlight and allow targeted confirmation of critical targets for prophylactics and therapeutics, especially critical in an outbreak setting. Although poorly understood, it has long been recognized that host regulation of virus-associated disease severity is multigenic. The advent of systems genetic and biology resources provide new opportunities for deconvoluting the complex genetic interactions and expression networks that regulate pathogenic or protective host response patterns following virus infection. Using SARS-CoV as a model, dynamic transcriptional network changes and disease-associated phenotypes have been identified in different genetic backgrounds, leading to the promise of population-wide discovery of the underpinnings of Coronavirus pathogenesis.","Schäfer, Alexandra; Baric, Ralph S.; Ferris, Martin T.",Current Opinion in Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625714000893; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625714000893; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2014.04.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24842079/,230
611900,Gut Microbiome Composition is Associated with COVID-19 Disease Severity,2021-05-13,"Pomegranates have high levels of polyphenols (PPs) and may be a rich source of compounds with antiviral activity. We evaluated the direct anti-influenza activity of three commercially available pomegranate extracts: pomegranate juice (PJ), a concentrated liquid extract (POMxl), and a 93% PP powder extract (POMxp). The acidity of PJ and POMxl solutions contributed to rapid anti-influenza activity, but this was not a factor with POMxp. Studies using POMxp showed that 5 min treatment at room temperature with 800 μg/ml PPs resulted in at least a 3 log reduction in the titers of influenza viruses PR8 (H1N1), X31 (H3N2), and a reassortant H5N1 virus derived from a human isolate. However, the antiviral activity was less against a coronavirus and reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses derived from avian isolates. The loss of influenza infectivity was frequently accompanied by loss of hemagglutinating activity. PP treatment decreased Ab binding to viral surface molecules, suggesting some coating of particles, but this did not always correlate with loss of infectivity. Electron microscopic analysis indicated that viral inactivation by PPs was primarily a consequence of virion structural damage. Our findings demonstrate that the direct anti-influenza activity of pomegranate PPs is substantially modulated by small changes in envelope glycoproteins.","Sundararajan, Aarthi; Ganapathy, Radha; Huan, Lifang; Dunlap, John R.; Webby, Richard J.; Kotwal, Girish J.; Sangster, Mark Y.",Antiviral Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354210006686; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.06.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354210006686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20637243/,230

It causes infertility and is related to serious long-term health consequences, including reduced life expectancy, increased cardiovascular risk, decreased bone mineral density and neurological disorders. There is currently no effective therapy for POI that is widely available in clinical practice; therefore, the treatment of patients with POI is based on hormone replacement therapy. One of the recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of POI has been the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the disease. Moreover, intensive research on human folliculogenesis and reproductive biology has led to the development of novel promising therapeutic strategies with the use of exosomal miRNAs derived from mesenchymal stem cells to restore ovarian function in POI patients. This narrative review focuses on the new studies concerning the role of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of POI, together with their potential as biomarkers of the disease and targets for therapy.","Pankiewicz, Katarzyna; Laudański, Piotr; Issat, Tadeusz",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502244/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179336,230

Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics, and plausible control measures. Results: When no control interventions were in place, an outbreak of COVID-19 in our case study destination country (New Zealand; NZ) was estimated to occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1000 population per week, a crew of 20, a voyage length of 10 days, 1 day of shore leave both in NZ and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combined use of a PCR test on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing, and mask use during shore leave, increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks even with crews of only 5 members. Conclusion: Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages.

Accumulating data from different populations have shown that obesity is a risk factor for a severe evolution of the disease, however, the mechanisms that explain this association are not clearly understood. An ominous evolution of COVID-19 has been attributed to an exacerbated inflammatory response, designed as “cytokine storm” with augmented production of cytokines/chemokines through the activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, that triggers an inflammatory downstream response, mediated in part by the adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Previous studies have reported an increased expression of MyD88 and TLRs in people with obesity, mainly in those with metabolic complications. Therefore, we hypothesize, that an underlying increased Myd88/TLR signaling may predispose to patients with obesity to develop an exaggerated and dangerous inflammatory reaction against SARS CoV-2 infection, explaining at least in part, the higher severity of COVID-19. In addition, MyD88/TLR signaling in people with obesity could have a role in the development of several chronic diseases.","Cuevas, Ada M.; Clark, Jeanne M.; Potter, James J.",Int J Obes (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-021-00768-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637950/,230

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 319 HCWs in charge of infectious disease prevention and control activities at all commune healthcare centers in Ho Chi Minh City. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire which included the 36-item Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS). RESULTS: Most participants were male (56.7%), and the mean age was 34.7 (SD=7.1) years. The overall job satisfaction was relatively low. Among 9 aspects measured, coworker was found to have the highest level of satisfaction (19.6±3.9), followed by supervision (19.3±4.1). In contrast, the lowest level of satisfaction was observed in operating condition (11.4±3.4) and contingent rewards (14.3±3.8). The total score of the JSS indicated that only half of HCWs were satisfied with their job in general. Older male HCWs who were married and those who had higher income reported a higher level of job satisfaction in several aspects measured. However, there was no association between job satisfaction and other HCW’s characteristics, including specialty, occupation type, and working experience.

This article aims to understand the relevant factors that affect SARS-COV-2 clearance time. METHODS: The clinical data of 115 COVID-19 patients with SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid positive time exceeding 14 days were collected retrospectively, and the relationship between clinical characteristics, chest CT scans, blood cells, biochemical indicators, and the time of viral nucleic acid turning negative were analyzed. RESULTS: The time from symptom onsets to nucleic acid turning negative was (32.5 ± 8.7) days in this group of patients. The time of nucleic acid turning negative: no fever group was longer than fever group, diabetes group was longer than no comorbidity group, elevated levels of ALT (alanine aminotransferase), or GLU (fasting blood glucose) group, decreased levels of ALB (albumin) group or HDLC (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) group was longer than it's normal group separately (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: ALT, GLU and HDLC were independent factors that influenced the time of nucleic acid turning negative. Although diabetes or hyperglycemia is a known risk factor, HDLC is the first to be identified, clinicians should be aware of dyslipidemia in covid-19 patients.","Ding, Xinmin; Zhang, Jie; Liu, Lifei; Yuan, Xiaodong; Zang, Xuefeng; Lu, Feiping; He, Ping; Wang, Qian; Zhang, Xiaomeng; Xu, Yimin; Li, Xiang; Liu, Ying; Li, Qun; Tan, Xuebing; Zheng, Yunhui; Lin, Xue; Liu, Yuhang",Respir Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611120303589?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611120303589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181413/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106218,230
613433,Evaluation of liver histopathological findings of COVID-19 by minimally invasive autopsies,2021-07-21,"BACKGROUND: Disasters, crises and pandemics are emergencies which impact on businesses severely. The COVID-19 pandemic reached its peak in mid-April 2020 in the UK. During this period, NHS Occupational Health Services (OHS) were stretched to their limit along with other health services. OHS may have had to change their pattern of operation, operating times, services offered, etc. to cope with the pandemic. Data about business model modifications, services offered by the OHS businesses during the pandemic could help in better utilization of OHS resources in the future. AIMS: To understand the behaviour of OHS in different parts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey link was sent to both accredited and unaccredited UK Occupational Health Physicians (OHPs). RESULTS: Sixty-two OHPs responded to the survey. In the current pandemic, 51% of the OHS (95% CI 0.38–0.62) offered weekend or out-of-hours (OOH) services, 21% had to employ extra staff (95% CI 0.13–0.33) and 54% had to change their working hours (95% CI 0.41–0.65). Ninety per cent of the OHS (95% CI 0.78–0.94) continued to offer routine services; however, there was a decline in offering vaccination services. Fifty-six per cent of the OHS (95% CI 0.42–0.67) offered a dedicated telephone line and 46% of the OHS (95% CI 0.32–0.56) started a dedicated COVID-19 queries inbox. CONCLUSIONS: There was a change in the behaviour of the OHS to cope with the pandemic. Having a dedicated helpline to manage the crisis situation seemed a logical step whilst offering routine services.","Ranka, S; Quigley, J; Hussain, T",Occup Med (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406513/,230

The aim of this study was to estimate the epidemiologic parameters of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic for clinical and epidemiological help. Methods: Four electronic databases including Web of Science, Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar were searched for literature published from early December 2019 up to 23 March 2020. The ""metan"" command was used to perform a fixed or random effects analysis. Cumulative meta-analysis was performed using the ""metacum"" command. Results: Totally 76 observational studies were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for R0 was 2.99 (95% CI: 2.71-3.27) for COVID-19. The overall R0 was 3.23, 1.19, 3.6 and 2.35 for China, Singapore, Iran and Japan, respectively. The overall Serial Interval, doubling time, incubation period were 4.45, 4.14 and 4.24 days for COVID-19. In addition, the overall estimation for growth rate and case fatality rate for COVID-19 were 0.38% and 3.29%, respectively. Conclusion: Calculating the pooled estimate of the epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 as an emerging disease, could reveal epidemiological features of the disease that consequently pave the way for health policy makers to think more about control strategies.

613803,Targeting Neurological Manifestations of Coronaviruses by Candidate Phytochemicals: A Mechanistic Approach,2021-01-20,"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 has had devastating effects on the health and well-being of older adult residents and health care professionals in nursing homes. Uncertainty about the associated consequences of these adverse effects on the use of medications common to this care setting remains. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and prescription medication changes among nursing home residents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study with an interrupted time-series analysis used linked health administrative data bases for residents of all nursing homes (N = 630) in Ontario, Canada. During the observation period, residents were divided into consecutive weekly cohorts. The first observation week was March 5 to 11, 2017; the last observation week was September 20 to 26, 2020. EXPOSURES: Onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 1, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Weekly proportion of residents dispensed antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, antibiotics, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Autoregressive integrated moving average models with step and ramp intervention functions tested for level and slope changes in weekly medication use after the onset of the pandemic and were fit on prepandemic data for projected trends. RESULTS: Across study years, the annual cohort size ranged from 75 850 to 76 549 residents (mean [SD] age, 83.4 [10.8] years; mean proportion of women, 68.9%). A significant increased slope change in the weekly proportion of residents who were dispensed antipsychotics (parameter estimate [β] = 0.051; standard error [SE] = 0.010; P < .001), benzodiazepines (β = 0.026; SE = 0.003; P < .001), antidepressants (β = 0.046; SE = 0.013; P < .001), trazodone hydrochloride (β = 0.033; SE = 0.010; P < .001), anticonvulsants (β = 0.014; SE = 0.006; P = .03), and opioids (β = 0.038; SE = 0.007; P < .001) was observed. The absolute difference in observed vs estimated use in the last week of the pandemic period ranged from 0.48% (for anticonvulsants) to 1.52% (for antipsychotics). No significant level or slope changes were found for antibiotics, ARBs, or ACE inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based cohort study, statistically significant increases in the use of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids followed the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, although absolute differences were small. There were no significant changes for antibiotics, ARBs, or ACE inhibitors. Studies are needed to monitor whether changes in pharmacotherapy persist, regress, or accelerate during the course of the pandemic and how these changes affect resident-level outcomes.","Campitelli, Michael A.; Bronskill, Susan E.; Maclagan, Laura C.; Harris, Daniel A.; Cotton, Cecilia A.; Tadrous, Mina; Gruneir, Andrea; Hogan, David B.; Maxwell, Colleen J.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34338794/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.18441,230

615858,Spontaneous Splenic Rupture in Atypical Pneumonia From Mycoplasma Infection,2021-07-30,"Due to vigorous alloimmunity, an allograft is usually rejected without any conventional immunosuppressive treatment. However, continuous global immunosuppression may cause severe side effects, including tumors and infections. Mounting evidence has shown that cyclosporine (CsA), a common immunosuppressant used in clinic, impedes allograft tolerance by dampening regulatory T cells (Tregs), although it inhibits allograft rejection at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to seek an alternative immunosuppressive drug that spares Tregs with high efficiency in suppression but low toxicity. In this study, we investigated the capacity of emodin, an anthraquinone molecule originally extracted from certain natural plants, to prolong transplant survival in a mouse model and explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its action. We found that emodin significantly extended skin allograft survival and hindered CD3(+) T cell infiltration in the allograft, accompanied by an increase in CD4(+)Foxp3(+) and CD8(+)CD122(+) Treg frequencies and numbers but a reduction in effector CD8(+)CD44(high)CD62L(low) T cells in recipient mice. Emodin also inhibited effector CD8(+) T cells proliferation in vivo. However, CD4(+)CD25(+), but not CD8(+)CD122(+), Tregs derived from emodin-treated recipients were more potent in suppression of allograft rejection than those isolated from control recipients, suggesting that emodin also enhances the suppressive function of CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs. Interestingly, depleting CD25(+) Tregs largely reversed skin allograft survival prolonged by emodin while depleting CD122(+) Tregs only partially abrogated the same allograft survival. Furthermore, we found that emodin hindered dendritic cell (DC) maturation and reduced alloantibody production posttransplantation. Finally, we demonstrated that emodin inhibited in vitro proliferation of T cells and blocked their mTOR signaling as well. Therefore, emodin may be a novel mTOR inhibitor that suppresses alloimmunity by inducing both CD4(+)FoxP3(+) and CD8(+)CD122(+) Tregs, suppressing alloantibody production, and hindering DC maturation. Thus, emodin is a newly emerging immunosuppressant and could be utilized in clinical transplantation in the future.","Qiu, Feifei; Liu, Huazhen; Liang, Chun-Ling; Nie, Golay D.; Dai, Zhenhua",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167674/,230

Herein, we aimed to determine patient‐perceived seizure control during the surge, specific variables associated with worsened seizures, the prevalence of specific barriers to care, and patient‐perceived efficacy of epilepsy care delivered via telephone and live video visits during the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross‐sectional questionnaire study of adult epilepsy patients who had a scheduled appointment at a single urban Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (Montefiore Medical Center) between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 during the peak of the COVID‐19 pandemic in the Bronx. Subjects able to answer the questionnaire themselves in English or Spanish were eligible to complete a one‐time survey via telephone or secure online platform (REDCap). RESULTS: Of 1212 subjects screened, 675 were eligible, and 177 adequately completed the questionnaire. During the COVID‐19 pandemic, 75.1% of patients reported no change in seizure control, whereas 17.5% reported that their seizure control had worsened, and 7.3% reported improvement. Subjects who reported worsened seizure control had more frequent seizures at baseline, were more likely to identify stress and headaches/migraines as their typical seizure precipitants, and were significantly more likely to report increased stress related to the pandemic. Subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 did not report worsened seizure control. Nearly 17% of subjects reported poorer epilepsy care, and 9.6% had difficulty obtaining their antiseizure medications; these subjects were significantly more likely to report worse seizure control. SIGNIFICANCE: Of the nearly 20% of subjects who reported worsened seizure control during the COVID‐19 pandemic, stress and barriers to care appear to have posed the greatest challenge. This unprecedented pandemic exacerbated existing and created new barriers to epilepsy care, which must be addressed.","Rosengard, Jillian L.; Donato, Jad; Ferastraoaru, Victor; Zhao, Dan; Molinero, Isaac; Boro, Alexis; Gursky, Jonathan; Correa, Daniel José; Galanopoulou, Aristea S.; Hung, Christine; Legatt, Alan D.; Patel, Puja; Rubens, Elayna; Moshé, Solomon L.; Haut, Sheryl",Epilepsia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33258109/; https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16779,230

618377,Covid-19 and Kidney Transplantation,2020-04-24,"BACKGROUND Under emergency coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic regulations, Medicare granted temporary payment parity with in-person visits for audio-only (telephone) telemedicine visits. This policy was designed to expand telemedicine to patients without camera-equipped devices and broadband internet. However, audio-only telemedicine use has been substantial. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore whether the rate of audio-only telemedicine during the pandemic is related to patient access to technology or provider behavior. DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of the Summer and Fall 2020 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey coronavirus disease 2019 supplements, using multivariable logistic models and accounting for complex survey design. SUBJECTS A total of 3375 participants in the summer survey and 2633 participants in the fall 2020 were offered a telemedicine visit to replace a scheduled in-person visit by their usual care provider. MEASURES We compared beneficiaries who were exclusively offered audio-only telemedicine to beneficiaries who were offered video telemedicine or both audio and video. RESULTS We found that among Medicare beneficiaries who were offered telemedicine to replace a scheduled in-person appointment, ~35% were exclusively offered audio-only. 65.8% of beneficiaries exclusively offered audio-only reported having a smartphone/tablet and home internet. After controlling for personal access to technology, Hispanic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.09, P<0.001], dually eligible (AOR=1.63, P=0.002), nonprimary English speaking (AOR=1.64, P<0.001), and nonmetro beneficiaries (AOR=1.71, P=0.003) were more likely to be offered audio-only during July-November 2020. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest audio-only telemedicine use during the pandemic is only partially related to patient access to technology.

618646,Evaluation of practice variation for cancer patients care in a French cancer center during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020-09-30,"The innate immune response is the first line of defence against viruses, involving the production of type I IFN (IFN-α/β) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that control the infection. It also shapes the adaptive immune response generated by both T and B cells. Production of type I IFN occurs both in vivo and in vitro in response to Bluetongue virus (BTV), an arthropod-borne virus. However, the mechanisms responsible for the production of IFN-β in response to BTV remained unknown until recently and are still not completely understood. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the identification of cellular sensors and signalling pathways involved in this process. The RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) were shown to be involved in the expression of IFN-β as well as in the control of BTV infection in non-haematopoietic cells. In contrast, induction of IFN-α/β synthesis in sheep primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) required the MyD88 adaptor independently of the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), as well as the kinases dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK). As type I IFN is essential for the establishment of an antiviral cellular response, most of viruses have elaborated counteracting mechanisms to hinder its action. This review also addresses the ability of BTV to interfere with IFN-β synthesis and the recent findings describing the non-structural viral protein NS3 as a powerful antagonist of the host cellular response.","Vitour, Damien; Doceul, Virginie; Ruscanu, Suzana; Chauveau, Emilie; Schwartz-Cornil, Isabelle; Zientara, Stéphan",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213003742; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213003742; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.10.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211608/,230

Herein, we identify a master regulatory role of IL-6 signaling on LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and reveal that uncoupling of these two processes during sepsis induces immunoparalysis in monocytes/macrophages. In particular, we demonstrate that activation of LAP by the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus depends on ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation of p47phox subunit of NADPH oxidase. Physiologically, autocrine IL-6/JAK2/Ninein axis orchestrates microtubule organization and dynamics regulating ERK recruitment to the phagosome and LC3+ phagosome (LAPosome) formation. In sepsis, loss of IL-6 signaling specifically abrogates microtubule-mediated trafficking of ERK, leading to defective activation of LAP and impaired killing of bacterial and fungal pathogens by monocytes/macrophages, which can be selectively restored by IL-6 supplementation. Our work uncovers a molecular pathway linking IL-6 signaling with LAP and provides insight into the mechanisms underlying immunoparalysis in sepsis.","Akoumianaki, Tonia; Vaporidi, Katerina; Diamantaki, Eleni; Pène, Frédéric; Beau, Remi; Gresnigt, Mark S; Gkountzinopulou, Marina; Venichaki, Maria; Drakos, Elias; El-Benna, Jamel; Samonis, George; Le, Kieu T T; Kumar, Vinod; Georgopoulos, Dimitrios; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Netea, Mihai G; Latge, Jean-Paul; Chamilos, Georgios",Cell Host Microbe,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2021.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214493/,230

This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could mutate at an unsteady pace. Supportive evidence comes from the accelerated evolution which was revealed by tracking mutation rates of the genomic location of Spike protein. This process is sponsored by a small portion of the virus population but not the largest viral clades. Moreover, it generally took one to six months for current variants that caused peaks of COVID-19 cases and deaths to survive selection pressure. Based on this statistic result and the above speedy Spike evolution, another upcoming peak would come around July 2021 and disastrously attack Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. This is the prediction generated by a mathematical model on evolutionary spread.

619099,Verification of the Role of ADAMTS13 in the Cardiovascular Disease Using Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization,2021-07-01,"The technique RT-qPCR for viral RNA detection is the current worldwide strategy used for early detection of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. RNA extraction is a key pre-analytical step in RT-qPCR, often achieved using commercial kits. However, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing disruptions to the global supply chains used by many diagnostic laboratories to procure the commercial kits required for RNA extraction. Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic. Implementation of this method could maintain crucial testing going despite commercial kit shortages.","Wozniak, Aniela; Cerda, Ariel; Ibarra-Henriquez, Catalina; Sebastian, Valentina; Armijo, Grace; Lamig, Liliana; Miranda, Carolina; Lagos, Marcela; Solari, Sandra; Guzmán, Ana María; Quiroga, Teresa; Hitschfeld, Susan; Riveras, Eleodoro; Ferres, Marcela; Gutiérrez, Rodrigo A.; García, Patricia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.083048,230
619124,Readiness to Implement Symptom Management Care Pathways in Pediatric Cancer,2020-12-30,"Bats (order Chiroptera) are one of the most diverse and widely distributed group of mammals with a close relationship to humans. Over the past few decades, a number of studies have been performed on bat viruses; in contrast, bacterial pathogens carried by bats were largely neglected. As more bacterial pathogens are being identified from bats, the need to study their natural microbiota is becoming urgent. In the current study, fecal samples of four bat species from different locations of China were analyzed for their microbiota composition. Together with the results of others, we concluded that bat microbiota is most commonly dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria; the strict anaerobic phylum Bacteroidetes, which is dominant in other terrestrial mammals, especially humans and mice, is relatively rare in bats. This phenomenon was interpreted as a result of a highly specified gastrointestinal tract in adaptation to the flying lifestyle of bats. Further comparative study implied that bat microbiota resemble those of the order Carnivora. To discover potential bacterial pathogens, a database was generated containing the 16S rRNA gene sequences of known bacterial pathogens. Potential bacterial pathogens belonging to 12 genera were detected such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, among which some have been previously reported in bats. This study demonstrated high resolution and repeatability in detecting organisms of rare existence, and the results could be used as guidance for future bacterial pathogen isolation.","Sun, Dong-Lei; Gao, Yi-Zhou; Ge, Xing-Yi; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhou, Ning-Yi",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32582057/,230
619460,"Critical COVID-19 disease, homeostasis, and the “surprise” of effective glucocorticoid therapy",2020-07-31,"Abstract The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of uncertainty shocks on airline employment in the light of the current global pandemic. The airline industry has faced many threats throughout history, but none quite as rapid and severe as the one posed by the spread of COVID-19. One constant during uncertainty shocks and industry downturns is that airline labor bears the brunt of the decline. As the industry reduces capacity amid the increase in travel restrictions, the post-stimulus impacts to airline labor are not known. Using time series analysis, the dynamics of historical uncertainty shocks to the industry are examined. During periods of uncertainty shocks, the estimated job loss is nearly 7% of the airline workforce with an upper bound of over 13%. Major airline employment is most impacted, while low-cost and regional airline employment is least impacted. The hardest hit employees are ones related to passenger handling and flight operations, while management employees fair slightly better during these uncertain periods. Further, recovery following uncertainty shocks is estimated to take between 4 and 6 years. Overall, the labor impacts to the airline industry from uncertainty events are substantial and provide insight into the expected industry job loss from COVID-19.","Sobieralski, Joseph B.",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173453/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198220300348; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220300348,230
619569,Therapeutic Targeting of Transcription Factors to Control the Cytokine Release Syndrome in COVID-19,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of biosecurity methods to mitigate the transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) via farm personnel or contaminated fomites is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of biosecurity procedures directed at minimizing transmission via personnel following different biosecurity protocols using a controlled experimental setting. RESULTS: PEDV RNA was detected from rectal swabs of experimentally infected (INF) and sentinel pigs by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Virus shedding in INF pigs peaked at 1 day post infection (dpi) and viral RNA levels remained elevated through 19 dpi. Sentinel pigs in the low biosecurity group (LB) became PEDV positive after the first movement of study personnel from the INF group. However, rectal swabs from pigs in the medium biosecurity (MB) and high biosecurity (HB) groups were negative during the 10 consecutive days of movements and remained negative through 24 days post movement (dpm) when the first trial was terminated. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpm through 3 dpm from the personal protective equipment (PPE) of LB personnel. In addition, at 1 dpm, 2 hair/face swabs from MB personnel were positive; however, transmission of virus was not detected. All swabs of fomite from the HB study personnel were negative. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that indirect PEDV transmission through contaminated PPE occurs rapidly (within 24 h) under modeled conditions. Biosecurity procedures such as changing PPE, washing exposed skin areas, or taking a shower are recommended for pig production systems and appear to be an effective option for lowering the risk of PEDV transmission between groups of pigs.","Kim, Yonghyan; Yang, My; Goyal, Sagar M.; Cheeran, Maxim C-J.; Torremorell, Montserrat",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28381304/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1017-4,230

The policy change initiated an ongoing debate among the general public, as well as in the political arena and the scientific community, over this major public health concern. Hence, we conducted a survey aimed at assessing Italian public health professionals’ attitudes towards and opinions on mandatory vaccination. A validated online questionnaire was administered to 1350 members of the Italian Society of Hygiene, Preventive Medicine and Public Health. Among the 1044 responders (response rate 77%), a large majority were in favour of the Italian mandatory vaccination law (91%) and against its repeal (74%). Nevertheless, according to our sample, maintaining a high level of vaccination coverage without the need to mandate would be preferable, and thus efforts to promote vaccine confidence and proactive vaccine uptake are still needed.","Pitini, Erica; Baccolini, Valentina; Rosso, Annalisa; Massimi, Azzurra; De Vito, Corrado; Marzuillo, Carolina; Villari, Paolo",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9060580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205959/,230

Whereas some have found a positive relationship, others have reported a negative relationship. To clarify the mechanisms underlying these mixed findings, we proposed and examined two mechanisms, namely mortality salience and gratitude. A total of 214 participants (M(age) = 42.05 years, SD = 16.49 years) were randomly assigned into either an experimental condition to experience a disaster or a control condition. Participants in the experimental condition reported a lower level of materialism than the scores of their counterparts in the control condition. Such effects were mediated by both mortality salience and gratitude. Participants in the experimental condition reported higher levels of both mortality salience and gratitude simultaneously. Mortality salience strengthened materialism, but gratitude weakened materialism.

DESIGN: This was a single time-point observational study utilizing a combination of surveys and standardized measures, which were administered to parents by researchers by telephone. SETTING: The Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Clinic of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Catania University, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 200 caregivers completed the questionnaires on behalf of themselves and their child. They were predominantly mothers (88.00%) and primary caregivers (93.50%), with a mean age of 42.84 years (sd = 7.13). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: A questionnaire featured in a previous study was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on general wellbeing, types of support, family health, home-based learning, and child behaviors. Children’s diagnoses were recorded. Caregivers provided information about physical, mental, financial, and vocational wellbeing, and completed several standardised measures of mental health and well-being: the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale - K6; the General Anxiety Disorder Scale – GAD-2; and the WHO Well-being Scale – WHO-5. RESULTS: Overall, 58.50% of respondents agreed somewhat or strongly that their child’s overall health and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic, while 47.74% felt that their own wellbeing as parents had been affected. Whilst home-based learning and disruption to services for children were noted as being significant, child wellbeing appeared to not be correlated with these but rather to restrictions, home isolation, and disruption to routine. CONCLUSION: Children with neurocognitive disorders and their families have been substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected that targeted resources and support services will be required in response to this increase in need.","Rizzo, Renata; Karlov, Lisa; Maugeri, Nicoletta; di silvestre, Selena; Eapen, Valsamma",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594104/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s327092,230

Los factores ambientales e infecciosos han sido fuertemente asociados al incremento de la ocurrencia de la enfermedad, hasta más del doble, en los últimos 10 años. En este artículo de revisión se describen los principales hallazgos reportados sobre la relación entre ciertas infecciones virales y bacterianas con la aparición y progresión de la EM. Métodos Se realizó un plan metodológico de búsqueda de artículos científicos relacionados con infección y EM, mediante la búsqueda de artículos científicos, principalmente publicados en inglés, en las plataformas virtuales de Pubmed, Medline y Cochrane. Para la búsqueda se utilizaron como palabras claves (términos MeSH): «virus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis». Se eligieron artículos publicados en revistas indexadas durante los últimos 15 años. Resultados Estudios epidemiológicos sugieren que la EM tiene un componente etiológico infeccioso que origina un proceso inflamatorio que puede contribuir a la iniciación o exacerbación de la enfermedad. Particularmente, la infección viral y los eventos de desmielinización en el SNC puede deberse a la penetración de un virus como el virus Epstein-Barr (EBV), a través del torrente sanguíneo, específicamente hacia el SNC. Por otro lado, las infecciones bacterianas crónicas pueden causar procesos de desmielinización en el SNC que agravan la enfermedad de EM. Conclusiones Este estudio contribuye a aportar evidencia científica donde se demuestra la multicausalidad implicada en la ocurrencia de la EM. Aún falta desarrollar más estudios epidemiológicos que demuestren y comprueben la relación y la implicación de agentes virales y bacterianos en el origen, el desarrollo y la severidad de la enfermedad. Abstract Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. Environmental and infectious factors had been strongly associated and involved in the increased occurrence of MS, to more than twice, in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the main findings on the relationship between viral and bacterial infections and the onset and progression of MS. Methods The research involved a systematic review of scientific literature regarding infection and MS. Our search was performed using and consulting specialized websites like PubMed, Medline and Cochrane. The keywords (MeSH terms) employed for the digital search were: “virus, bacteria, autoimmune disease of the nervous system, and multiple sclerosis.” Articles published in English indexed journals during the past 15 years were used for the study. Results Epidemiological studies suggest that MS has an infectious etiologic component causing an inflammatory process that may contribute to the initiation and/or exacerbation of the disease. Particularly, viral infections and demyelination events in the CNS may be due to the penetration of viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) through the bloodstream to the CNS, specifically. On the other hand, chronic bacterial infections may cause demyelination processes that trigger or increase the complications of the disease in MS. Conclusions This study shows the multiple factors involved in the occurrence of MS. More epidemiological studies are necessary to support the relationship and involvement of viral and bacterial infections in the onset, development and severity of the disease.","Bermúdez-Morales, Victor Hugo; Castrejon-Salgado, Ricardo; Torres-Poveda, Kirvis; de Jesús Flores-Rivera, José; Flores-Aldana, Mario; Madrid-Marina, Vicente; Hernández-Girón, Carlos",Neurología Argentina,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S185300281630088X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S185300281630088X,230

Methods: A total of 32 children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 24 and February 12, 2020 from four provinces in Western China were enrolled in this study and followed up until discharge and quarantine 14 days later. Results: Eleven children (34%) were asymptomatic, among whom six children had normal computed tomographic (CT) scan images. Age and gender were not associated with clinical symptoms or the results of CT scan in children infected with SARS-CoV-2. The concentrations of white blood cells and neutrophils were higher in children with asymptomatic infection than in children with clinical symptoms or CT abnormalities. Patients who presented with CT abnormalities had lower D-dimer or lower total bilirubin than those who had normal CT scan but clinical symptoms. All children recovered and no one died or was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The mean duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 15.4 (SD=7.2) days and similar for both asymptomatic children and children with symptoms or CT abnormalities. We found a significant negative correlation between the lymphocyte count and the duration of positive nucleic acid test. Conclusions: Children with asymptomatic infection should be quarantined for the same duration as symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The clinical significance and mechanism behind the negative correlation between the number of lymphocytes and the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 needs further study.","Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Enmei; Xie, Jun; Smyth, Rosalind; Zhou, Qi; Zhao, Ruiqiu; Zang, Na; Long, Xiaoru; Tang, Yuyi; Estill, Janne; Yang, Shu; Zhu, Jin; Yan, Xiaofeng; Gong, Fang; Tian, Wenguang; Zhou, Xiaqia; Mo, Yunbo; Xiao, Hongzhou; Tang, Zhengzhen; Chen, Yanni; Wang, Yi; Cui, Yuxia; Fang, Xiuling; Li, Feiyu; Tian, Yong; Li, Peibo; Deng, Quanmin; Ren, Chengsong; He, Ronghui; Li, Yi; Qin, Hong; Wang, Aiguo; Deng, Hongli; Wu, Jianguo; Meng, Wenbo; Li, Weiguo; Zhao, Yao; Luo, Zhengxiu; Wang, Zijun; Cheng, Yaolong; Wang, Gary; Li, Qiu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.20073288; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20073288v1?rss=1,230

Nevertheless, because of the multifactorial etiology of ARDS in the context of individual circumstances, this strategy needs to be adjusted to each patient’s needs. In recent years it has become increasingly evident that prone positioning, early spontaneous breathing and early mobilization improve the course of the disease.

As of 15/01/2021, more than ninety million cases of infections have been confirmed, with almost two million related deaths. SARS-CoV-2 causes bilateral interstitial pneumonia, which can be responsible of respiratory failure in the most severe cases, but the virus has also a wide range of other manifestations, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, and cutaneous signs and symptoms. Cutaneous manifestations are an important matter of study for allergy specialists, as they can be specific signs of the infection, but also manifestations of adverse reactions to the medical therapy in use. In this case series, we report four different cases of dermatological manifestations in COVID patients, two in hospitalised patients and two in patients with mild disease, treated at home. The first reported case is a woman, who develops urticaria while being treated at home with mild COVID-infection; the second and the third case reported are drug- hypersensivity reactions to remdesevir and low molecular weight heparin. The last case reported is a man with mild covid, with vasculitic sacral lesions.","Ridolo, Erminia; Pucciarini, Francesco; Barone, Alessandro; Nouvenne, Antonio; Meschi, Tiziana; Peveri, Silvia; Incorvaia, Cristoforo",Acta Biomed,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92i1.11236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682815/,230
624747,Proteomics of extracellular vesicles in plasma reveals the characteristics and residual traces of COVID-19 patients without underlying diseases after 3 months of recovery,2021-05-25,Abstract The major subgenomic RNA of the calicivirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus which codes for the viral capsid protein has been cloned as cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of this mRNA was shown to be identical to the 3′ terminal region of the genomic RNA. The 5′ end of the mRNA corresponds to position 5296 of the genomic sequence; except for two differences the first 16 nucleotides of genomic and subgenomic RNAs are identical. After isolation from liver tissue viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs were found to be resistant to RNase degradation. This protection was due to RNA packaging into particles. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of liver homogenates allowed separation of such particles containing either genomic RNA or subgenomic RNA. Genomic and subgenomic RNAs are protein-linked and for the genomic molecule this interaction is localized within the first 179 nucleotides. After radioactive labeling of purified RNA and subsequent RNase treatment a protein of 15 kDa was identified.,"Meyers, Gregor; Wirblich, Christoph; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190437G; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1887589/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190437G,230
625031,The Effectiveness of Convalescent Plasma and Hyperimmune Immunoglobulin for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Infections of Viral Etiology: A Systematic Review and Exploratory Meta-analysis,2015-01-01,"OBJECTIVES: Multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a less understood and a rare complication of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Given the scarce data regarding this novel disease, we aimed to describe the clinical features and outcomes of our patients with MIS-C and to evaluate the associated factors for the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. METHODS: The MIS-C patients under 18 years old diagnosed and treated in three referral centers between July 2020 and March 2021 were included. Data of the patients were retrospectively obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: Overall, 76 subjects (24 females) with a mean age of 8.17 ± 4.42 years were enrolled. Twenty-seven (35.5%) patients were admitted to the PICUs. The two most common systemic involvement patterns were cardiac and gastrointestinal. There was only one lethal outcome in a patient with underlying acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Those with higher procalcitonin levels at admission were found to stay longer in the hospital (r = 0.254, p = 0.027). The risk of PICU admission increased with age (aOR: 1.277; 95% CI: 1.089–1.498; p = 0.003) and with decreased initial serum albumin levels (aOR: 0.105; 95% CI: 0.029–0.378; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although there is a wide clinical variability among the patients with MIS-C, we suggest that those with older age and lower initial serum albumin levels merit close monitoring due to their higher risk for PICU admission.","Haslak, Fatih; Barut, Kenan; Durak, Cansu; Aliyeva, Ayten; Yildiz, Mehmet; Guliyeva, Vafa; Varol, Sevki Erdem; Cebeci, Sinem Oral; Aygun, Fatih; Varli, Yusuf Ziya; Ozel, Abdulrahman; Onan, Sertac Hanedan; Kocoglu, Ulkem; Erol, Meltem; Karagozlu, Fatih; Ulug, Nujin; Dedeoglu, Reyhan; Sahin, Sezgin; Adrovic, Amra; Oztunc, Funda; Kasapcopur, Ozgur",Clin Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089099/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-021-05780-x,230

The data for hepatitis C cases were collected in six districts in Xiamen City, China from 2004 to 2018. A population-mixed susceptible-infectious-chronic-recovered (SICR) model was used to fit the data and the parameters of the model were calculated. The basic reproduction number (R(0)) and the number of newly transmitted cases by a primary case per month (MNI) were adopted to quantitatively assess the transmissibility of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Eleven curve estimation models were employed to predict the trends of R(0) and MNI in the city. The SICR model fits the reported HCV data well (P < 0.01). The median R(0) of each district in Xiamen is 0.4059. R(0) follows the cubic model curve, the compound curve and the power function curve. The median MNI of each district in Xiamen is 0.0020. MNI follows the cubic model curve, the compound curve and the power function curve. The transmissibility of HCV follows a decreasing trend, which reveals that under the current policy for prevention and control, there would be a high feasibility to eliminate the transmission of HCV in the city.","Wang, Yao; Zhao, Zeyu; Wang, Mingzhai; Hannah, Mikah Ngwanguong; Hu, Qingqing; Rui, Jia; Liu, Xingchun; Zhu, Yuanzhao; Xu, Jingwen; Yang, Meng; Cui, Jing-An; Su, Yanhua; Zhao, Benhua; Chen, Tianmu",Epidemiology and infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33234178/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268820002885,230

To do this, we examined the frequency of once ordinary, but newly risky behavior (as deemed by CDC guidelines) in a sample of 482 MTurkers. We ran analyses probing the situational and dispositional variables that predicted variance in risky behavior using data-driven and hypothesis-generated approaches. We found situational and dispositional variables contributed unique variance to risky behavior, controlling for variability accounted for by demographic factors. More frequent report of risky activity was associated with higher extraversion, need for cognitive closure, behavior activation, and perceived resource scarcity; in contrast, more frequent report of risky activity was associated with less empathy and living space access, as well as younger age. To break down these findings, we used a cluster analysis to profile individuals, using only situational and dispositional variables belonging to seven clusters. Combined with testing differences in risk taking by cluster identity, we suggest this profile approach might allow consideration of multi-faceted attributes that influence adherence with public health guidance in the context of health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Haupt, M.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of interprofessional service-learning on the effectiveness of AMR knowledge transfer in Hong Kong elders aged 65 or above and students from university and secondary schools. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pretest–posttest controlled study was carried out from July 2018 to March 2019 for elderly subjects and a pre- and post-test were conducted in students from May to August 2018. Elderly subjects were recruited from the university-based community outreach program. The community outreach team consisted of both university and secondary school students. Students were provided with training of geriatric care and AMR before they reached out to the community. The one-to-one intervention with the aid of video and verbal explanation to educate the elderly about the definition, causes, and consequences of AMR, and preventive measures against AMR was provided. Questionnaires on knowledge of antibiotics and AMR were used as tools to reflect on the effectiveness for both students and elderly subjects. The questionnaire was completed twice, before and 1 week after the intervention. Chi-square test, t tests and regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 93 Chinese elders, 61 of them in the intervention group and 32 in the control group participated in the study. The score obtained by the intervention group increased from 40.1 to 83.3% (p < 0.001) following intervention, while that of control group increased from 33.0 to 44.0% (p < 0.001). The increase attained in the intervention group was significantly greater than that of the control group (p < 0.001). A total of 95 secondary students and 88 university students have completed the pre-post questionnaires with 42.21% and 13% increment in AMR knowledge after the training (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The significant change in knowledge level showed effective AMR knowledge transfer to both elders and students. The study could be used as a reference when allocating resources to implement effective interprofessional service-learning for better community health education in elderly populations. Trial registration: This study was approved by the Chinese University of Hong Kong Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee in December 2018 (Ref no. SBRE-18-214).","Lo, Anna C.

626850,Temporal lung changes on thin-section CT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-11-12,"Study Objectives: Early evidence has suggested a high prevalence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in Coronavirus 19 (COVID). However, the bulk of existing data evaluates the population of COVID patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). There has been limited evidence in the emergency department (ED) population and as a result, there is variability in diagnostic evaluation for patients presenting with COVID. The objective of this study was to describe the diagnostic evaluation of both COVID positive and negative patients in the ED. Methods: Over a period of 13 months beginning March 2020, all patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) of a single, tertiary academic medical center in the United States and tested for COVID, who had contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest performed were included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was CT positivity rate for PE and radiologist impressions were used to determine positivity rate for all patients. A subset of patients received D-dimer testing or received supplemental oxygen in the ED and CT positivity was evaluated in these strata. Results: After exclusion of CT chest studies without contrast, 5576 patient encounters were included in the final cohort with 367 patients considered to be COVID positive at the time of ED presentation. The positivity rate for PE in COVID positive patients was 9.8% compared to 7.1% for non-COVID patients. The rate of D-dimer testing prior to CT was higher (76% vs 25%) in COVID positive compared to negative patients. CT test positivity rate was close when comparing COVID positive and negative patients who did not receive oxygen (5.0% vs 6.3%) but in those that received supplemental oxygen in the ED, 12.7% of COVID positive patients were positive for PE compared to 8.3% for COVID negative. The d-dimer institutional cut-off of 0.5 mcg/mL was sensitive for PE on CT without false negative results. There was a significant age difference between hypoxic patients (median age of 63) and not-hypoxic patients (median age of 50). A Sankey diagram of COVID positive patients who had both contrast-enhanced CTs performed and D-dimers drawn is presented as a figure. Conclusion: Non-hypoxic COVID positive patients had a largely comparable positivity rate of PE on contrast enhanced CT imaging compared to non-hypoxic non-COVID patients, but in the subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, COVID patients were at considerably increased risk of PE. Using the conventional cut-off value of D-dimers yielded no false negative results, however D-dimer values frequently were obtained as part of a routine COVID workup for risk stratification. Our study was limited by its single center design. Further research is needed to determine if COVID positive patients have an increased risk of pulmonary embolism.

627707,Integrative Medicine Demonstrates Advantage in COVID-19 Treatment,2020-10-05,"Luteolin, a plant flavonoid, has potent anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of luteolin-mediated immune modulation has not been fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of luteolin on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), as well as the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Luteolin dose-dependently inhibited the expression and production of these inflammatory genes and mediators in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay further confirmed the suppression of LPS-induced TNF- α, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression by luteolin at a transcriptional level. Luteolin also reduced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in LPS-activated macrophages. Moreover, luteolin blocked the degradation of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit. In addition, luteolin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). We also found that luteolin attenuated the LPS-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) and IKK phosphorylation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In sum, these data suggest that, by blocking NF-κB and AP-1 activation, luteolin acts to suppress the LPS-elicited inflammatory events in mouse alveolar macrophages, and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Our observations suggest a possible therapeutic application of this agent for treating inflammatory disorders in lung.","Chen, Chiu-Yuan; Peng, Wen-Huang; Tsai, Kuen-Daw; Hsu, Shih-Lan",Life Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320507007230; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320507007230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17977562/,230

RECENT FINDINGS: Researchers have increasingly studied immersive technology as a non-pharmacological alternative for perioperative anxiety, acute, and chronic pain management. We found several research studies published over the last 3 years: almost all studies examined the use of virtual reality for perioperative anxiety and pain; only one case report was about the use of augmented reality for preoperative anxiety. Most studies showed that virtual reality intervention is effective and safe for perioperative anxiety, acute, and chronic pain. However, the studies are heterogeneous with relatively small sample sizes. SUMMARY: This review shows that more high-quality studies (i.e., randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and standardized methods for measuring and reporting outcomes) are needed to examine the effectiveness and adverse effects of virtual reality intervention on perioperative anxiety, acute, and chronic pain in pediatrics.","Alqudimat, Mohammad; Mesaroli, Giulia; Lalloo, Chitra; Stinson, Jennifer; Matava, Clyde",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276254/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40140-021-00472-3,230

Aerosol samples were collected by a microbial air sampler, and environmental surfaces were sampled using sterile premoistened swabs at multiple sites. Ninety surface swabs and 135 aerosol samples were collected. Only two swabs, sampled from the inside of a patient's mask, were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. All other swabs and aerosol samples were negative for the virus.

628502,Predictors of Worsening Oxygenation in COVID-19,2021-03-10,"Neutrophilic asthma (NA) is a subtype of asthma that responds poorly to corticosteroid treatment. In certain diseases, microRNA (miR)-29a-3p is considered to be a key regulatory molecule for remodeling of the extracellular matrix. However, the effect of miR-29a-3p on airway remodeling is unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-29a-3p in NA. A mouse model of NA was established and these animals were compared to normal controls. Both groups of mice were subjected to lung function tests and histopathological analysis. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) were grown in culture and incubated with secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC) and a miR-29a-3p mimic. The expression of miR-29a-3p, SPARC and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the direct regulatory relationship between miR-29a-3p and SPARC. miR-29a-3p expression was significantly decreased, while SPARC expression was increased in the NA mouse model with a phenotype of EMT. Overexpression of SPARC downregulated the expression of E-cadherin, while it increased the expression of vimentin in 16HBE cells. miR-29a-3p administration reversed the SPARC-induced effects on E-cadherin and vimentin expression. Luciferase assays confirmed that SPARC was the target gene for miR-29a-3p. Furthermore, SPARC overexpression increased the protein expression of phosphorylated (p)-ERK, while transfection with miR-29a-3p mimics significantly inhibited this increase. The data suggested that EMT in the NA mouse model was associated with decreased levels of miR-29a-3p and elevated SPARC. Furthermore, SPARC could induce the formation of EMT in 16HBE cells in vitro and this was directly targeted by miR-29a-3p and mediated by p-ERK, suggesting that miR-29a-3p may participate in the airway remodeling of NA.","Zhang, Xiaobo; Xie, Jun; Sun, Hongmei; Wei, Qin; Nong, Guangmin",Int J Mol Med,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2021.5004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34278471/,230

However, unsuitable sample types and laboratory detection kits/methods lead to misdiagnosis, which delays the prevention and control of the pandemic. METHODS: We compared four nucleic acid detection methods [two kinds of reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR A: ORF1ab and N testing; RT-PCRB: only ORF1ab testing), reverse transcription recombinase aided amplification (RT-RAA) and droplet digital RT-PCR (dd-RT-PCR)] using 404 samples of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva after deep cough, to evaluate the best sample type and method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. RESULTS: Among the four methods, dd-RT-PCR exhibited the highest positivity rate (93.0%), followed by RT-PCR B (91.2%) and RT-RAA (91.2%), while the positivity rate of RT-PCR A was only 71.9%. The viral load in OPS [24.90 copies/test (IQR 15.58-129.85)] was significantly lower than that in saliva [292.30 copies/test (IQR 20.20-8628.55)] and NPS [274.40 copies/test (IQR 33.10-2836.45)]. In addition, if OPS samples were tested alone by RT-PCR A, only 21.4% of the COVID-19 patients would be considered positive. The accuracy of all methods reached nearly 100% when saliva and NPS samples from the same patient were tested simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection methods should be fully evaluated before use. High-positivity rate methods such as RT-RAA and dd-RT-PCR should be considered when possible. Furthermore, saliva after deep cough and NPS can greatly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, and testing OPS alone is not recommended.","Yu, Fei; Xie, Guoliang; Zheng, Shufa; Han, Dongsheng; Bao, Jiaqi; Zhang, Dan; Feng, Baihuan; Wang, Qi; Zou, Qianda; Wang, Ruonan; Yang, Xianzhi; Chen, Weizhen; Lou, Bin; Chen, Yu",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164346/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.685640,230

In recognition of this gap, the editors of Prevention Science put out a call to scientists to help clarify and define the concept of a “culture of prevention.” Such a culture would influence the creation of an infrastructure for implementing and sustaining the most effective strategies informed by research. The journal call stated a culture of prevention was a “general orientation or readiness of a group of people… to address problems by using a preventive, rather than a reactive approach.” This commentary examines the concept demonstrated in the array of papers presented here in which the “culture of prevention” is applied in different contexts—occupational safety and health, substance use, school, governmental, community, around problem behaviors, and violence. It is important to note that the papers represent perspectives and experiences from several countries, including some cross-national experiences providing an international framework.

Previously, we developed a personal passive air sampler (PPAS) to estimate the exposure level to chlorine gas while using chlorinated disinfectants. Herein, we investigated the color development of the passive sampler corresponding to chlorine exposure concentration and time, which allows the general population to easily estimate their gas exposure levels. The uptake and reaction rate of PPAS are also explained, and the maximum capacity of the sampler was determined as 1.8 mol of chlorine per unit volume (m(3)) of the passive sampler. Additionally, the effects of disinfectant types on the gas exposure level were successfully assessed using passive samplers deployed in a closed chamber. It is noteworthy that the same level of chlorine gas is generated from liquid household bleach regardless of dilution ratios, and we confirmed that the chlorine gas can diffuse out from a gel-type disinfectant. Considering that this PPAS reflects reactive gas removal, individual working patterns, and environmental conditions, this sampler can be successfully used to estimate personal exposure levels of chlorinated gases generated from disinfectants.","Ha, Yeonjeong; Koo, Yerim; Kwon, Jung-Hwan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501528/,230
630901,Population-based assessment of risks for severe COVID-19 disease outcomes,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent medical and biological technology advances have stimulated the development of new testing systems that have been providing huge, varied amounts of molecular and clinical data. Growing data volumes pose significant challenges for information processing systems in research centers. Additionally, the routines of genomics laboratory are typically characterized by high parallelism in testing and constant procedure changes. RESULTS: This paper describes a formal approach to address this challenge through the implementation of a genetic testing management system applied to human genome laboratory. We introduced the Human Genome Research Center Information System (CEGH) in Brazil, a system that is able to support constant changes in human genome testing and can provide patients updated results based on the most recent and validated genetic knowledge. Our approach uses a common repository for process planning to ensure reusability, specification, instantiation, monitoring, and execution of processes, which are defined using a relational database and rigorous control flow specifications based on process algebra (ACP). The main difference between our approach and related works is that we were able to join two important aspects: 1) process scalability achieved through relational database implementation, and 2) correctness of processes using process algebra. Furthermore, the software allows end users to define genetic testing without requiring any knowledge about business process notation or process algebra. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents the CEGH information system that is a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) based on a formal framework to support genetic testing management for Mendelian disorder studies. We have proved the feasibility and showed usability benefits of a rigorous approach that is able to specify, validate, and perform genetic testing using easy end user interfaces.","Araújo, Luciano V; Malkowski, Simon; Braghetto, Kelly R; Passos-Bueno, Maria R; Zatz, Mayana; Pu, Calton; Ferreira, João E",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369688/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-12-s4-s13,230
630941,Coinfections with Other Respiratory Pathogens among Patients with COVID-19.,2021-07-21,"Background In children, SARS-CoV-2 is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness of short duration. Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, the largest citizen participatory epidemiological study to date. Methods Data from 258,790 children aged 5-17 years were reported by an adult proxy between 24 March 2020 and 22 February 2021. Illness duration and symptom profiles were analysed for all children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, considered overall and within younger (5-11 years) and older (12-17 years) age groups. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. Findings 1,734 children (588 younger children, 1,146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable duration of illness with the study time frame. The commonest symptoms were headache (62.2%) and fatigue (55.0%). Median illness duration was six days (vs. three days in children testing negative); and was positively associated with age (rs 0.19, p<1.e-4) with median duration seven days in older vs. five days in younger children. Seventy-seven (4.4%) children had illness duration =>28 days (LC28); LC28 was more common in older compared with younger children (59 (5.1%) vs. 18 (3.1%), p=0.046). The commonest symptoms experienced by children with LC28 were fatigue (84.4%), headache and anosmia (both 77.9%); however, by day 28 the median symptom burden was two. Only 25 (1.8%) of 1,379 children experienced symptoms for [≥]56 days. Few children (15 children, 0.9%) in the negatively-tested cohort experienced prolonged symptom duration; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden (both throughout their illness and at day 28) than children positive for SARS-CoV-2. Interpretation Some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration; reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. Thus, a holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is required.","Molteni, E.; Sudre, C. H.; Canas, L. S.; Bhopal, S. S.; Hughes, R. C.; Antonelli, M.

631101,Asthma and COVID‐19: is asthma a risk factor for severe outcomes?,2020-05-02,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 and responsible for the current global pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can efficiently transmit the virus to naïve cats. Here, we address whether cats previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. In two independent studies, SARS-CoV-2-infected cats were re-challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 21 days post primary challenge (DPC) and necropsies performed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-secondary challenge (DP2C). Sentinels were co-mingled with the re-challenged cats at 1 DP2C. Clinical signs were recorded, and nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs, blood, and serum were collected and tissues examined for histologic lesions. Viral RNA was transiently shed via the nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal cavities of the re-challenged cats. Viral RNA was detected in various tissues of re-challenged cats euthanized at 4 DP2C, mainly in the upper respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues, but less frequently and at lower levels in the lower respiratory tract when compared to primary SARS-CoV-2 challenged cats at 4 DPC. Histologic lesions that characterized primary SARS-CoV-2 infected cats at 4 DPC were absent in the re-challenged cats. Naïve sentinels co-housed with the re-challenged cats did not shed virus or seroconvert. Together, our results indicate that cats previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be experimentally re-infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the levels of virus shed was insufficient for transmission to co-housed naïve sentinels. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats induces immune responses that provide partial, non-sterilizing immune protection against reinfection.","Gaudreault, Natasha N.; Carossino, Mariano; Morozov, Igor; Trujillo, Jessie D.; Meekins, David A.; Madden, Daniel W.; Cool, Konner; Artiaga, Bianca Libanori; McDowell, Chester; Bold, Dashzeveg; Balaraman, Velmurugan; Kwon, Taeyong; Ma, Wenjun; Henningson, Jamie; Wilson, Dennis W.; Wilson, William C.; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race-ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. RESULTS: In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% Posterior Credible Interval [CrI] = 5.4, 5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI = 6.4, 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.","Zelner, Jon; Trangucci, Rob; Naraharisetti, Ramya; Cao, Alex; Malosh, Ryan; Broen, Kelly; Masters, Nina; Delamater, Paul",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33221832/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1723,230
632348,"Development and validation of prognostic model for predicting mortality of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China",2020-12-31,"INTRODUCTION: A December 2019 WHO rapid communication recommended the use of 9-month all-oral regimens for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Besides the clinical benefits, they are thought to be less costly than the injectable-containing regimens, for both the patient and the health system. STREAM is the first randomised controlled trial with an economical evaluation to compare all-oral and injectable-containing 9–11-month MDR-TB treatment regimens. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Health system costs of delivering a 9-month injectable-containing regimen and a 9-month all-oral bedaquiline-containing regimen will be collected in Ethiopia, India, Moldova and Uganda, using ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down’ costing approaches. Patient costs will be collected using questionnaires that have been developed based on the STOP-TB questionnaire. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the cost utility of the two regimens, from a health system perspective. Secondary objectives include estimating the cost utility from a societal perspective as well as evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the regimens, using both health system and societal perspectives. The effect measure for the cost–utility analysis will be the quality-adjusted life years (QALY), while the effect measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the efficacy outcome from the clinical trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been evaluated and approved by the Ethics Advisory Group of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and also approved by ethics committees in all participating countries. All participants have provided written informed consent. The results of the economic evaluation will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

632460,COVID‐19: Herd Immunity and Convalescent Plasma Transfer Therapy,2020-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Complete genome sequences of the Astroviridae include human, non-human mammalian and avian species. A consensus topology of astroviruses has been derived from nucleotide substitutions in the full-length genomes and from non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in each of the three ORFs. Analyses of synonymous substitutions displayed a loss of tree structure, suggesting either saturation of the substitution model or a deviant pattern of synonymous substitutions in certain virus species. RESULTS: We analyzed the complete Astroviridae family for the inference of adaptive molecular evolution at sites and in branches. High rates of synonymous mutations are observed among the non-human virus species. Deviant patterns of synonymous substitutions are found in the capsid structural genes. Purifying selection is a dominant force among all astrovirus genes and only few codon sites showed values for the dN/dS ratio that may indicate site-specific molecular adaptation during virus evolution. One of these sites is the glycine residue of a RGD motif in ORF2 of human astrovirus serotype 1. RGD or similar integrin recognition motifs are present in nearly all astrovirus species. CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analysis directed by maximum likelihood approximation allows the inclusion of significantly more evolutionary history and thereby, improves the estimation of dN and dS. Sites with enhanced values for dN/dS are prominent at domains in charge of environmental communication (f.i. VP27 and domain 4 in ORF1a) more than at domains dedicated to intrinsic virus functions (f.i. VP34 and ORF1b (the virus polymerase)). Integrin recognition may play a key role in astrovirus to target cell attachment.","van Hemert, Formijn J; Lukashov, Vladimir V; Berkhout, Ben",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17343744/,230

634113,Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in a Patient with Covid-19,2020-04-22,"IGHV3-53-encoded neutralizing antibodies are commonly elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Such IGHV3-53 antibodies generally have a short CDR H3 due to structural constraints in binding the RBD (mode A). However, a small subset of IGHV3-53 antibodies to the RBD contain a longer CDR H3. Crystal structures of two IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies here demonstrate that a longer CDR H3 can be accommodated in a different binding mode (mode B). These two classes of IGHV3-53 antibodies both target the ACE2 receptor binding site, but with very different angles of approach and molecular interactions. Overall, these findings emphasize the versatility of IGHV3-53 in this common antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, where conserved IGHV3-53 germline-encoded features can be combined with very different CDR H3 lengths and light chains for SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognition and virus neutralization","Wu, Nicholas C.; Yuan, Meng; Liu, Hejun; Lee, Chang-Chun D.; Zhu, Xueyong; Bangaru, Sandhya; Torres, Jonathan L.; Caniels, Tom G.; Brouwer, Philip J.M.; van Gils, Marit J.; Sanders, Rogier W.; Ward, Andrew B.; Wilson, Ian A.",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720312638?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108274; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720312638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027617/,230

Animals Sixty-four (presumed antemortem diagnosis) and 137 (postmortem diagnosis only) client-owned dogs at two tertiary care facilities. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs with clinical or histopathological diagnosis of myocarditis were reviewed retrospectively. Results Common examination findings in dogs with a presumed antemortem diagnosis included fever (21%) and heart murmur (19%). Median cardiac troponin I was 12.2 ng/mL (range 0.2-808.0 ng/mL), and troponin exceeded 1.0 ng/mL in 26/29 (90%) dogs. Ventricular ectopy was the most common arrhythmia (54%), while decreased left ventricular systolic function was the most common echocardiographic abnormality (56%). An infectious etiology was diagnosed in 35/64 (55%) dogs. Confirmed infectious etiologies included bacterial sepsis (n = 9) or extension of endocarditis (3), toxoplasmosis or neosporosis (3), parvovirus (2), and one case each of bartonellosis, trypanosomiasis, leptospirosis, and dirofilariasis. Median survival time was 4 days (range 0 - 828 days) for all dogs, versus 82 days for dogs who survived at least two weeks following diagnosis. Presence of pericardial effusion or azotemia were significant predictors of nonsurvival. The most common inflammatory infiltrate on histopathology was neutrophilic (47%), and 20/137 (15%) dogs had concurrent bacterial endocarditis on postmortem. Conclusions Bacterial infection was the most common confirmed etiology of myocarditis in this study. Prognosis for canine myocarditis is guarded and similar to that reported for infective endocarditis. Criteria for the antemortem diagnosis of canine myocarditis are suggested.","Lakhdhir, Sarifa; Viall, Austin; Alloway, Elizabeth; Keene, Bruce; Baumgartner, Kristen; Ward, Jessica",J Vet Cardiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1760273420300473; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvc.2020.05.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1760273420300473?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668360/,230

The number of cases increased to 8,287 by September 30, 2020. By May throughout June, most of the cases were predominantly imported cases of truck drivers from neighbouring countries. Uganda responded with various restrictions and interventions including lockdown, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and use of face masks in public, to control the growth rate of the outbreak. By end of September 2020, Uganda had transitioned into community transmissions and most of the reported cases were locals contacts and alerts. This study assessed risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda, and presents estimates of the reproduction ratio in real time. An optimal control analysis was performed to determine how long the current mitigation measures such as controlling the exposure in communities, rapid detection, confirmation and contact tracing, partial lockdown of the vulnerable groups and control at the porous boarders, could be implemented and at what cost. Methods: The daily confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda were extracted from publicly available sources. Using the data, relative risks for age, gender, and geographical location were determined. Four approaches were used to forecast SARS-CoV-2 in Uganda namely linear exponential, nonlinear exponential, logistic and a deterministic model. The discrete logistic model and the next generation matrix method were used to estimate the effective reproduction number. Results: Results showed that women were at a higher risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 than the men, and the population attributable risk of SARS-CoV-2 to women was 42.22%. Most of the women affected by SARS-CoV-2 were likely contacts of cargo truck drivers at the boarders, where high infection rates were reported. Although most deaths in Uganda were in the age group of 60-69, the highest case fatality rate per 1000 was attributable the age group of 80-89, followed by 70-79. Geographically, Amuru had the highest relative risk compared to the national risk to SARS-CoV-2. For the case of mitigation scenarios, washing hands with 70% compliance and regular hand washing of 6 times a day, was the most effective and sustainable to reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure. This was followed by public wearing of face masks if at least 60% of the population complied, and physical distancing by 60% of the population. If schools, bars and churches were opened without compliance, i.e., no distancing, no handwashing and no public wearing of face masks, to mitigation measures, the highest incidence was observed, leading to a big replacement number. If mitigation measures are not followed by the population, then there will be high incidences and prevalence of the virus in the population.","Nannyonga, B. K.; Bosa, H. K.; Wodermariam, Y.

The manifestations of COVID‐19 pneumonia in transplant patients are not well understood and may have more severe symptoms, longer duration, and a worse prognosis than in immunocompetent populations. AIMS: This study proposed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. PATIENTS/METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, radiological characteristics, and clinical outcome of 24 kidney transplant patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia were evaluated from March 20, 2020, to May 20, 2020. RESULTS: The most common symptom was shortness of breath (70.8%), followed by fever (62.5%) and cough (45.8%). Five patients had leukopenia, and only one patient had leukocytosis, while 75% of the patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count in the normal range, and 79% of recipients developed lymphopenia. All of the patients had an elevated concentration of C‐reactive protein and an increase in blood urea levels. Chest CT images of 23 patients (95.8%) showed typical findings of patchy ground‐glass shadows in the lungs. Of the 24 patients, 12 were admitted to ICU (invasive care unit), and ten of 24 patients (41.6%) died, and 14 patients were discharged after complete recovery. CONCLUSION: It seems that COVID‐19 is more severe in transplant patients and has poorer outcomes. Multiple underlying diseases, low O(2) saturation, and multilobar view in chest CT scan may be of prognostic value.

Several coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), have been identified as the causative agents of these diseases. Effective measures to control these diseases are lacking. The major host cells of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus have thought to be epithelial cells on small intestine villi. Aminopeptidase-N (APN) has been described as the putative receptor for entry of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus into cells in vitro. Recently, Whitworth et al. have reported that APN knockout pigs are resistant to TGEV but not PEDV after weaning. However, it remains unclear if APN-null neonatal pigs are protected from TGEV. Here we report the generation of APN-null pigs by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology followed by somatic cell nuclear transfer. APN-null pigs are produced with normal pregnancy rate and viability, indicating lack of APN is not embryonic lethal. After viral challenge, APN-null neonatal piglets are resistant to highly virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Histopathological analyses indicate APN-null pigs exhibit normal small intestine villi, while wildtype pigs show typical lesions in small intestines. Immunochemistry analyses confirm that no transmissible gastroenteritis virus antigen is detected in target tissues in APN-null piglets. However, upon porcine epidemic diarrhea virus challenge, APN-null pigs are still susceptible with 100% mortality. Collectively, this report provides a viable tool for producing animals with enhanced resistance to TGEV and clarifies that APN is dispensable for the PEDV infection in pigs.","Luo, Lei; Wang, Shaohua; Zhu, Lin; Fan, Baochao; Liu, Tong; Wang, Lefeng; Zhao, Panpan; Dang, Yanna; Sun, Pei; Chen, Jianwen; Zhang, Yunhai; Chang, Xinjian; Yu, Zhengyu; Wang, Huanan; Guo, Rongli; Li, Bin; Zhang, Kun",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-49838-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31515498/,230

Therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated in vivo, thus patient management relies exclusively on supportive care, which given the high case-fatality rate is not highly effective. The rhesus macaque is the only known disease model for MERS-CoV, developing an acute localized-to-widespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease(2,3) that recapitulates mild-to-moderate human MERS-CoV cases(4,5). The combination of interferon-α2b and ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro(6); therefore, this strategy was initiated 8 h post-infection in the rhesus macaque model. Treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no-to-very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moreover, treated animals showed reduced levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers in addition to reduced viral genome copies, altered gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-α2b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response and improves clinical outcome. As these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic, IFN-α2b and ribavirin should be considered for management of MERS-CoV cases.","Falzarano, Darryl; de Wit, Emmie; Rasmussen, Angela L.; Feldmann, Friederike; Okumura, Atsushi; Scott, Dana P.; Brining, Doug; Bushmaker, Trenton; Martellaro, Cynthia; Baseler, Laura; Benecke, Arndt G.; Katze, Michael G.; Munster, Vincent J.; Feldmann, Heinz",Nat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24013700/; https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3362,230
638442,A Combination of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist and Dietary Intervention Could Be a Promising Approach for Obesity Treatment,2021-09-20,"Our aim was to investigate the effect of artificial liver blood purification treatment on the survival of severe/critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). A total of 101 severe and critical patients with coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were enrolled in this open, case‐control, multicenter, prospective study. According to the patients’ and their families’ willingness, they were divided into two groups. One was named the treatment group, in which the patients received artificial liver therapy plus comprehensive treatment (n = 50), while the other was named the control group, in which the patients received only comprehensive treatment (n = 51). Clinical data and laboratory examinations, as well as the 28‐day mortality rate, were collected and analyzed. Baseline data comparisons on average age, sex, pre‐treatment morbidity, initial symptoms, vital signs, pneumonia severity index score, blood routine examination and biochemistry indices etc. showed no difference between the two groups. Cytokine storm was detected, with a significant increase of serum interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) level. The serum IL‐6 level decreased from 119.94 to 20.49 pg/mL in the treatment group and increased from 40.42 to 50.81 pg/mL in the control group (P < .05), indicating that artificial liver therapy significantly decreased serum IL‐6. The median duration of viral nucleic acid persistence was 19 days in the treatment group (ranging from 6 to 67 days) and 17 days in the control group (ranging from 3 to 68 days), no significant difference was observed (P = .36). As of 28‐day follow‐up,17 patients in the treatment group experienced a median weaning time of 24 days, while 11 patients in the control group experienced a median weaning time of 35 days, with no significant difference between the two groups (P = .33). The 28‐day mortality rates were 16% (8/50) in the treatment group and 50.98% (26/51) in the control group, with a significant difference (z = 3.70, P < .001). Cytokine storm is a key factor in the intensification of COVID‐19 pneumonia. The artificial liver therapy blocks the cytokine storm by clearing inflammatory mediators, thus preventing severe cases from progressing to critically ill stages and markedly reducing short‐term mortality.","Dai, Xiahong; Zhang, Yimin; Yu, Liang; Jiang, Ying‐an; Chen, Liang; Chen, Ye; Li, Ming; Gao, Chunming; Shang, Jia; Xiang, Shulin; Li, Yongguo; Li, Jianzhou; Zhou, Chenliang; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Chen, Nan; Liu, Yuanchun; Liu, Jing; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Chen, Xiaobei; Zhu, Danhua; Gao, Hainv; Tang, Lingling; Zhu, Mengfei; Li, Lanjuan",Artif Organs,https://doi.org/10.1111/aor.13884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326621/,230
638697,"COVID-19, the first pandemic in the post-genomic era",2021-07-13,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to rise and second waves are reported in some countries, serological test kits and strips are being considered to scale up an adequate laboratory response. This study provides an update on the kinetics of humoral immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and performance characteristics of serological protocols (lateral flow assay [LFA], chemiluminescence immunoassay [CLIA] and ELISA) used for evaluations of recent and past SARS-CoV-2 infection. A thorough and comprehensive review of suitable and eligible full-text articles was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Wordometer and medRxiv from 10 January to 16 July 2020. These articles were searched using the Medical Subject Headings terms ‘COVID-19’, ‘Serological assay’, ‘Laboratory Diagnosis’, ‘Performance characteristics’, ‘POCT’, ‘LFA’, ‘CLIA’, ‘ELISA’ and ‘SARS-CoV-2’. Data from original research articles on SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection ≥second day postinfection were included in this study. In total, there were 7938 published articles on humoral immune response and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. Of these, 74 were included in this study. The detection, peak and decline period of blood anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and total antibodies for point-of-care testing (POCT), ELISA and CLIA vary widely. The most promising of these assays for POCT detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 at day 3 postinfection and peaked on the 15th day; ELISA products detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG at days 2 and 6 then peaked on the eighth day; and the most promising CLIA product detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 at day 1 and peaked on the 30th day. The most promising LFA, ELISA and CLIA that had the best performance characteristics were those targeting total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies followed by those targeting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG then IgM. Essentially, the CLIA-based SARS-CoV-2 tests had the best performance characteristics, followed by ELISA then POCT. Given the varied performance characteristics of all the serological assays, there is a need to continuously improve their detection thresholds, as well as to monitor and re-evaluate their performances to assure their significance and applicability for COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological purposes.","Emeribe, Anthony Uchenna; Abdullahi, Idris Nasir; Shuwa, Halima Ali; Uzairue, Leonard; Musa, Sanusi; Anka, Abubakar Umar; Adekola, Hafeez Aderinsayo; Bello, Zakariyya Muhammad; Rogo, Lawal Dahiru; Aliyu, Dorcas; Haruna, Shamsuddeen; Usman, Yahaya; Muhammad, Habiba Yahaya; Gwarzo, Abubakar Muhammad; Nwofe, Justin Onyebuchi; Chiwar, Hassan Musa; Okwume, Chukwudi Crescent; Animasaun, Olawale Sunday; Fasogbon, Samuel Ayobami; Olayemi, Lawal; Ogar, Christopher; Emeribe, Chinenye Helen; Ghamba, Peter Elisha; Awoniyi, Luqman O; Musa, Bolanle O P",Int Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihab005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33620427/,230
638873,Vitamin D Deficiency Is Inversely Associated with COVID-19 Incidence and Disease Severity in Chinese People,2020-11-13,"Surveillance is essential for communicable disease prevention and control. Traditional notification of demographic and clinical information, about individuals with selected (notifiable) infectious diseases, allows appropriate public health action and is protected by public health and privacy legislation, but is slow and insensitive. Big data–based electronic surveillance, by commercial bodies and government agencies (for profit or population control), which draws on a plethora of internet- and mobile device–based sources, has been widely accepted, if not universally welcomed. Similar anonymous digital sources also contain syndromic information, which can be analysed, using customised algorithms, to rapidly predict infectious disease outbreaks, but the data are nonspecific and predictions sometimes misleading. However, public health authorities could use these online sources, in combination with de-identified personal health data, to provide more accurate and earlier warning of infectious disease events—including exotic or emerging infections—even before the cause is confirmed, and allow more timely public health intervention. Achieving optimal benefits would require access to selected data from personal electronic health and laboratory (including pathogen genomic) records and the potential to (confidentially) re-identify individuals found to be involved in outbreaks, to ensure appropriate care and infection control. Despite existing widespread digital surveillance and major potential community benefits of extending its use to communicable disease control, there is considerable public disquiet about allowing public health authorities access to personal health data. Informed public discussion, greater transparency and an ethical framework will be essential to build public trust in the use of new technology for communicable disease control.","Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.; Degeling, Chris; Johnson, Jane",Asian Bioeth Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32218872/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-019-00087-1,230

Clinical trial visits generally involve eligibility assessment, enrollment, intervention administration, data collection, and follow-up, with many of these steps performed during face-to-face visits between participants and the investigative team. Social distancing, which emerged as one of the mainstay strategies for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, has presented a challenge to the traditional model of clinical trial conduct, causing many research teams to halt all in-person contacts except for life-saving research. Nonetheless, clinical research has continued during the pandemic because study teams adapted quickly, turning to virtual visits and other similar methods to complete critical research activities. The purpose of this special communication is to document this rapid transition to virtual methodologies at Clinical and Translational Science Awards hubs and highlight important considerations for future development. Looking beyond the pandemic, we envision that a hybrid approach, which implements remote activities when feasible but also maintains in-person activities as necessary, will be adopted more widely for clinical trials. There will always be a need for in-person aspects of clinical research, but future study designs will need to incorporate remote capabilities.","Loucks, Tammy L.; Tyson, Clare; Dorr, David; Garovic, Vesna D.; Hill, James; McSwain, S.

A new experiment named HD-HAPPY-FESTA yields ultrahigh-resolution total correlation subspectra, which are suitable for sign-sensitive determination of heteronuclear couplings, as demonstrated here by measuring the sign and magnitude for proton–fluorine couplings (J(HF)) from major and minor isomer products of a two-step reaction without any purification. Proton–fluorine couplings ranging from 51.5 to −2.6 Hz could be measured using HD-HAPPY-FESTA, with the smallest measured magnitude of 0.8 Hz. Experimental J(HF) values were used to identify the two fluoroketone intermediates and the four fluoroalcohol products. Results were rationalized and compared with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The previous work showed that skepticism is negatively associated with acceptance of media content. However, this association has yet to be investigated between skepticism towards content on social media and conviction of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Furthermore, this association can be a function of social media users’ dark triad traits comprising Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. A convenient sample of 439 Malaysian young adult social media users was recruited to complete the survey. Results showed that skepticism has a negative relationship with belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19. However, the strength of the relationship is varied depending on respondents’ Machiavellianism and narcissism levels. The negative association between skepticism and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories is weaker for individuals with high scores on Machiavellianism. High and moderate scores on narcissism were also found to diminish the negative relationship of skepticism with COVID-19 conspiracy ideation. The results yield implications for enhancing healthy skepticism to mitigate belief in conspiracy theories promulgated on social media. Nonetheless, Machiavellianism and narcissism appeared to weaken the power of skepticism on conspiracy theories.","Ahadzadeh, Ashraf Sadat; Ong, Fon Sim; Wu, Shin Ling",Curr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02198-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393466/,230

Such challenges call attention to the importance of frameworks that can be applied to aid sales managers in understanding the impact of and responses to COVID-19. Leavitt's model of organizational change, and socio-technical systems theory, point to the importance of considering four inter-related social (i.e., human and structure) and technical (i.e., task and technology) variables when examining organizational change, and recognizing that change to one variable can be predicated upon and/or bring about change to other variables. We tailor Leavitt's model to the B2B sales context and recognize the potential for exogenous shocks such as COVID-19 to impact each variable. In doing so, we conduct a review of practitioner-oriented articles, interviews with key informants working for B2B organizations, and a webinar with sales professionals. These efforts lead to a rich discussion and set of considerations that can help B2B sales forces better understand and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises.","Hartmann, Nathaniel; Lussier, Bruno",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850120302972?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019850120302972,230
641198,Bronchoscopy in children with COVID‐19: A case series,2020-08-13,"INTRODUCTION: Screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) prevents blindness through the early detection of sight-threatening retinal microvascular lesions that respond to timely local treatment. However, the provision of easy and regular access to DR screening programs is currently being challenged by the increasing prevalence of diabetes. One proposed solution is to extend the screening interval for patients at low risk for progression of retinopathy. To date, most providers of screening programs have hesitated to implement a strategy of extended intervals due to the lack of data on whether adherence and safety are compromised when retinal examinations occur less frequently. In the study reported here, we investigated adherence to the screening program and progression of retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes participating in a DR screening program with extended intervals. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who attended a screening program for DR. The patients were consecutively placed into a low-risk patient cohort with no retinopathy or into an intermediate-risk patient cohort with mild retinopathy (each cohort n = 500). Screening intervals were 36 months for the low-risk cohort and 18 months for the intermediate-risk cohort. RESULTS: The 1000 subjects enrolled in the study had a median age of 68 (interquartile range 12) years and 60.4% were men. At the follow-up screening visit, data on 102 subjects were not included in the analysis of adherence rate due to death, severe systemic illness, other concurrent eye disease or migration. Among the 898 remaining subjects, adherence to the screening program was 93.7% (413/443) in the 36-month group and 98.3% (449/455) in the 18-month group (p < 0.0001). Non-adherence decreased with increasing age (odds ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.888–0.954, p = 0.0005). At follow-up, 65 subjects showed progression of retinopathy; none had worse than moderate retinopathy. Risk factors for DR and treatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia were compared among subjects in the low-risk cohort: non-adherent subjects did not differ from their adherent counterparts without progression of DR, but the former had a shorter duration of diabetes and higher diastolic blood pressure than adherent subjects with progression of DR (4.5 vs. 7.5 years, p = 0.007; and 80 vs. 75 mmHg, p = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that screening DR at extended intervals can be achieved with high adherence rates without compromising patient safety. However, younger subjects and those at higher risk of progression may require extra attention.","Sharif, Ali; Jendle, Johan; Hellgren, Karl-Johan",Diabetes Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165837/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-020-00957-0,230
642798,Efficacy of glutathione therapy in relieving dyspnea associated with COVID-19 pneumonia: A report of 2 cases,2020-04-21,"INTRODUCTION: COVID‐19 parallels HIV in many ways. Socio‐behavioural science has been critical in elucidating the context and factors surrounding individual levels of engagement with known effective prevention and treatment tools for HIV, thus offering important lessons for ongoing efforts to combat the COVID‐19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Non‐adherence to effective disease mitigation strategies (e.g. condoms for HIV and masks for COVID‐19) can be attributed in part to prioritizing comfort, convenience and individual autonomy over public health. Importantly, misinformation can fuel denialism and conspiracies that discredit scientific knowledge and motivate nonadherence. These preferences and the extent to which individuals can act on their preferences may be constrained by the structures and culture in which they live. Both HIV and COVID‐19 have been politicized and influenced by evolving recommendations from scientists, clinicians, policymakers and politically motivated organizations. While vaccines are vital for ending both pandemics, their impact will depend on availability and uptake. Four decades of experience with the HIV epidemic have shown that information alone is insufficient to overcome these challenges; interventions must address the underlying, often complex factors that influence human behaviour. This article builds from socio‐behavioural science theory and describes practical and successful approaches to enable and support adherence to prevention and treatment strategies, including vaccine adoption. Key methods include reframing tools to enhance motivation, promoting centralized sources of trusted information, strategic development and messaging with and within key populations (e.g. through social media) and appealing to self‐empowerment, altruism and informed decision making. Orchestrated evidence‐based activism is needed to overcome manipulative politicization, while consistent transparent messaging around scientific discoveries and clinical recommendations are critical for public acceptance and support. Ultimately, the effectiveness of COVID‐19 vaccines will depend on our ability to engender trust in the communities most affected. CONCLUSIONS: Many lessons learned from socio‐behavioural science in the HIV pandemic are applicable to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Individual behaviour must be understood within its interpersonal and societal context to address the current barriers to adherence to disease‐mitigating strategies and promote an effective response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, which is likely to be endured for the foreseeable future.","Haberer, Jessica E; van der Straten, Ariane; Safren, Steven A; Johnson, Mallory O; Amico, K Rivet; del Rio, Carlos; Andrasik, Michele; Wilson, Ira B; Simoni, Jane M",J Int AIDS Soc,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339113/,230

Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective nursing program to promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function and prevent postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing mastectomy. With the continuous development and advancement of computer and communication technologies, telecare is gaining more and more attention and has become an important part of medical information technology construction. Falls endanger the elderly and other special populations, especially after a sudden but unassisted fall, which may be life-threatening. Timely fall detection and rescue can win valuable time for treatment and rescue, which is very important to protect users' health and improve medical monitoring. In order to provide better medical care to the elderly population and reduce the harm caused by falls, this paper will focus on the fall problem of the elderly in telecare. In order to facilitate the detection of falls of the elderly, we design an Android sensor-based data acquisition scheme, using the built-in acceleration sensor in the Android system to collect the human acceleration information, and through the JMS middleware technology, the collected data are transmitted to MATLAB for analysis and processing in real time. This paper preprocesses and synthesizes the collected human body data and visualizes the acceleration changes of various typical daily activities of the human body and breast cancer, then extracts the relevant data features according to the synthesized SVM curve, constructs a pattern recognition algorithm using the extracted features, and verifies the effectiveness of the pattern recognition algorithm through experiments.","Wang, Ling; Yan, Huang; Yan, Jing; Qian, Liyuan",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326977/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5475997,230

The current study investigates alterations in the biological estimates concerning the severity, recovery, mortality, and assessment of treatment-based outcomes. Methods A case series of 165 COVID-19 patients admitted to OMI Institute (a tertiary care hospital) was conducted between May and August 2020. The data regarding demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, radiographic abnormalities, biological estimations, symptoms, treatment, disease progression, complications, and outcomes were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Laboratory estimations included complete blood count (CBC), renal and electrolyte profile, liver function tests (LFTs), hematological indices, and inflammatory markers. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan were also performed, and data were extracted from the medical records. Analysis was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. Results Out of the 165 COVID-19 patients, 79.4% recovered and were successfully discharged, while 20.6% of inpatient died. The patients' mean age was 56.03 ± 15.96 years, with a male majority (55.1%). The most common comorbid conditions were diabetes and hypertension; fever and dry cough were among the most frequently reported symptoms. The chest imaging findings among the severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed extensive bilateral patchy opacities. The median laboratory investigations, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (14.83), C-reactive protein (CRP) (7.4 mg/dl), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (786 IU/L), ferritin (1401.15 mcg/ml), and mean oxygen saturation (88.25%), were significantly altered among cases with increased disease severity and those who expired (p<0.05). The proportion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis development was significantly high among severe/critical COVID-19 patients (p<0.05). Treatment with tocilizumab, remdesivir, doxycycline, ivermectin, enoxaparin sodium, and steroids was deemed to be potentially effective treatment options in terms of reducing COVID-19 severity and chances of recovery. Furthermore, age (OR 1.05; p=0.047), presence of comorbidity (OR 8.471; p=0.004), high NLR, LDH (final outcome) (OR 1.361 and 1.018; p<0.05), and CRP levels (midpoint) (OR 1.631; p=0.05) were identified as the strong predictors of death among COVID-19 patients. Conclusion The study identified several alterations in the clinical profile of the COVID-19 patients concerning severity during the hospital stay, affecting prognosis. Clinically, tocilizumab, remdesivir, doxycycline, ivermectin, enoxaparin sodium, and steroids were identified as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 due to their ability to alter disease-associated severity and recovery rate.","Ahsan, Tasnim; Rani, Bharta; Siddiqui, Roomana; D‘Souza, Glenis; Memon, Razzaq; Lutfi, Irfan; I.

METHODS: From March 1(st) to March 28(th), 214 patients having both chest CT scan and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCT) within 24 hours were retrospectively evaluated. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of first and expert readings were calculated together with inter reader agreement, with results of RT-PCR as standard of reference and according to symptoms and onset date. Patient characteristics and disease extent on CT were correlated to short-term outcome (death or intubation at 3 weeks follow-up). RESULTS: Of the 214 patients (119 men, mean age 59 ± 19 years), 129 had at least one positive RT-PCR result. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were 79% (95% CI: 71- 86%), 84%(74- 91%), 72%(63-81%) and 88% (81-93%) for initial CT reading and 81%(74- 88%), 91% (82-96%), 76% (67-84%) and 93% (87-97%), for expert reading, with strong inter-reader agreement (kappa index: 0.89). Considering the 123 patients with symptoms for more than 5 days, the corresponding figures were 90%, 78%, 80% and 89% for initial reading and 93%, 88%, 86% and 94% for the expert.

645879,Clinical Features of COVID-19 on Patients With Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders,2021-08-26,"A one-step real-time RT-PCR method has been developed for the simultaneous detection of both genotypes of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The assay is based on primer-probe energy transfer, and the most important advantage of this is the relative tolerance towards mutations in the target-probe region. The primers and the probe were designed using an alignment of 235 Type 1 (including all subtypes) and Type 2 PRRSV strains. According to the alignment, multiple degenerations were included in the forward and reverse primers to enable the detection of all PRRSV strains deposited in the GenBank. Specificity was tested using 37 different PRRSV strains and eight other swine pathogen viruses. The detection limit was approximately 10 copies of RNA prepared from the Lelystad virus, a European Subtype 3 virus (Belarus strain Soz-8), and an American vaccine virus (Ingelvac MLV(®)). One TCID(50) was the detection limit in the case of the cell cultured Lelystad virus and an American wild type isolate, respectively. The melting point analysis revealed melting point decrease, but no significant sensitivity and signal loss in the presence of numerous (up to five) target-probe mismatches, indicating the capability of tolerating even more mutations. The method was suitable for the detection and quantitation of phylogenetically divergent strains and can serve as a robust, high throughput tool for molecular diagnosis of the PRRSV.","Balka, Gyula; Hornyák, Ákos; Bálint, Ádám; Benyeda, Zsófia; Rusvai, Miklós",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.01.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200443/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409000159; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409000159,230

Clinical experience has demonstrated that critical illness may present later in the disease course and hypoxia is often the first indication of disease progression. The objectives of this study are to (a) assess feasibility and describe a protocol for ED-based outpatient pulse-oximetry monitoring with structured follow-up and (b) determine rates of ED return, hospitalisation and hypoxia among participants. METHODS: Prospective observational study of patients presenting to a single academic ED in Boston with suspected COVID-19. Eligible patients were adults being discharged from the ED with presumed COVID-19. Exclusion criteria included resting oxygen saturation <92%, ambulatory oxygen saturation <90%, heart rate >110 beats per minute or inability to use the device. Study personnel made scripted phone calls on postdischarge days 1, 3 and 7 to review the pulse-oximetry readings and to evaluate for decompensation. Return visit and admission information were collected via medical record and 28-day follow-up calls. RESULTS: 81 patients were enrolled of which 10 (12%) developed hypoxia after their initial discharge from the ED. Overall, 23 (28%) of the 81 patients returned to the ED at least once and 10 of those who returned (43%) were admitted. We successfully contacted 76/81 (94%) of subjects via phone at least once for follow-up assessment. DISCUSSION: Patients are eager and willing to participate in home monitoring systems and are comfortable with using technology, which will allow providers and health systems to extend our hospitals capabilities for tracking patient populations in times of crisis. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to implement an outpatient pulse-oximetry monitoring protocol to monitor patients discharged from the ED with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.","Gootenberg, David B; Kurtzman, Nicholas; O’Mara, Thomas; Ge, Jennifer Y; Chiu, David; Shapiro, Nathan I; Mechanic, Oren J; Dagan, Alon",BMJ Health Care Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301725/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2021-100330,230

Patients with underlying conditions, and especially cancer patients with impaired immunity, are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications. Although angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been identified as a cellular binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2, immunopathological changes in severe cancer patients support the investigation of additional potential receptors such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a key immunoregulator. However, a comprehensive profiling analysis of DPP4 in malignancies remains obscure. In this study, using different datasets, we demonstrated the expression of DPP4 in healthy tissues and pan-cancers, showing the risk of different cancer types towards SARS-CoV-2 infection according to DPP4 expression levels. DPP4 expression was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of various immune cells and showed strong correlations with diverse immune marker sets in pan-cancer patients analyzed by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). These findings suggest that increased DPP4 expression in specific cancer patients might account for the high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the induction of cytokine storms. Due to the critical role of DPP4 in immunometabolism, our results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of DPP4 might provide beneficial therapeutic effects for SARS-CoV-2 treatment together with other strategies in specific tumor patients.","Shu, Lingling; Liu, Yang; Li, Jinyuan; Wu, Xiaoping; Li, Yang; Huang, Hanying",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.624899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614513/,230

Besides, medical crises (like the COVID-19 outbreak) and air pollution represent additional motives for the transition from traditional to socially and environmentally sustainable LMD mode. An emerging problem for companies in the postal and logistics industry is how to determine the best LMD mode in a multi-criteria setting under uncertainty. METHOD: For the first time, an extension of the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment (WASPAS) method under the picture fuzzy environment is presented to solve the LMD mode selection problem. The introduced picture fuzzy set (PFS) based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method can be highly beneficial to managers who are in charge of LMD since it can take into account the neutral/refusal information and efficiently deal with high levels of imprecise, vague, and uncertain information. The comparative analysis with the existing state-of-the-art PFS-based MCDM methods approved the high reliability of the proposed picture fuzzy WASPAS method. Its high robustness and consistency are also confirmed. The presented method can be used to improve LMD in urban areas worldwide. Besides, it can be applied to solve other emerging MCDM problems in an uncertain environment. FINDINGS: A real-life case study of Belgrade is presented to fully illustrate the potentials and applicability of the picture fuzzy WASPAS method. The results show that postomates are the best mode for LMD in Belgrade, followed by cargo bicycles, drones, traditional delivery, autonomous vehicles, and tube transport.

Little is known about the frequency of specific symptoms in the general population, and how symptoms predict the magnitude of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We quantified IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in home-collected dried blood spot samples from 3,365 adults participating in a community-based seroprevalence study in the city of Chicago, USA, collected between June 24 and November 11, 2020. Results 17.8% of the sample was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. A cluster of symptoms (loss of sense of smell or taste, fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, fatigue, diarrhea, headache) was associated with stronger anti-RBD IgG responses among the seropositives. 39.2% of infections were asymptomatic, and 2 or fewer symptoms were reported for 66.7% of infections. Total number of symptoms was positively but weakly associated with IgG response: Median anti-RBD IgG was 0.95 ug/mL for individuals with 3 or more symptoms, in comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for asymptomatic infections. Conclusion We document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection in a large community-based cohort, and relatively low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the general population of previously exposed individuals.","McDade, T.

Among various antivirals, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are considered important passive therapeutics having an immediate effect against viral pathogens. Here we report a pseudovirus neutralization assay for rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs targeting hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 and H1N1 IAV. In this study, we generated six pseudoviruses with an HIV-1 backbone, respectively, expressing HA of four clades of H5N1 IAV and the 2009 epidemic H1N1 IAV. The resulting pseudoviruses were able to infect a variety of human and non-human cells, with 293T cells from human kidney as the most susceptible target cells. Using the established pseudovirus neutralization assay, we showed that three of ten selected mAbs specific to HA could potently neutralize infection of a pseudovirus bearing HA from the homologous IAV A/VietNam/1194/2004(H5N1) strain. This was highly consistent with the result of a microneutralization assay testing the same strain of a live IAV. Since the pseudovirus neutralization assay does not involve an infectious virus and can be performed without the requirement of a biosafety-3 laboratory, it may be applied for safe and rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs and antiviral agents targeting HA of IAVs.","Du, Lanying; Zhao, Guangyu; Zhang, Xiujuan; Liu, Zhonghua; Yu, Hong; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X10010946; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X10010946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617558/,230

The data generated can be used to compare novel strains with other viruses and allow the genetic basis of important phenotypic characteristics, such as antigenic determinants, to be elucidated. Furthermore, virus sequence data can also be used to address more fundamental questions relating to the evolution of viruses. Recent advances in laboratory methodologies allow rapid sequencing of virus genomes. For the first time, this opens up the potential for using genome sequencing to reconstruct virus transmission trees with extremely high resolution and to quickly reveal and identify the origin of unresolved transmission events within discrete infection clusters. Using foot-and-mouth disease virus as an example, this chapter describes strategies that can be successfully used to amplify and sequence the full genomes of RNA viruses.

Several frameworks exist to conceptualise healthcare systems, highlighting the stark contrast of frameworks unique to public health systems. The objectives of this study were to define public health systems and assess differences between healthcare systems and public health systems within established health systems frameworks. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis was conducted. Databases searched included EBSCOhost, OVID, Scholars Portal, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Health Systems Evidence. Data extraction, coding and analysis followed a best-fit framework analysis method. Initial codes were based on a current leading health systems and policy classification scheme – health systems arrangements (governance, financial and delivery arrangements). RESULTS: A total of 5933 unique documents were identified and 67 were included in the analysis. Definitions of public health and public health systems varied significantly as did their roles and functions across jurisdictions. Public health systems arrangements generally followed those of health systems, with the addition of partnerships (community and inter-sectoral) and communication playing a larger role in public health. A public health systems framework and conceptualisation of how public health currently fits within health systems are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Public health systems are unique and vital entities within health systems. In addition to examining how public health and public health systems have been defined within the literature, this review suggests that establishing the scope of public health is crucial to understanding its role within the larger health system and adds to the discourse around the relationship between public health, healthcare and population health. More broadly, this study addresses an important gap in understanding public health systems and provides conceptual and practical contributions as well as areas for future research.","Jarvis, Tamika; Scott, Fran; El-Jardali, Fadi; Alvarez, Elizabeth",Health Res Policy Syst,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-020-00583-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546163/,230

Although network models consider the implications of micro-level interaction patterns for disease transmission, epidemiologists and social scientists know little about the meso-structure of disease transmission. Meso-structure refers to the pattern of disease spread at a higher level of aggregation, that is, among infection clusters corresponding to organizations, locales, and events. The authors visualizes this meso-structure using publicly available contact tracing data from Singapore. Visualization shows that one highly central infection cluster appears to have generated on the order of seven or eight infection chains, amounting to 60 percent of nonimported cases during the period considered. However, no other cluster generated more than two infection chains. This heterogeneity suggests that network meso-structure is highly consequential for epidemic dynamics.","Van Gunten, Tod",Socius,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192147/; https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231211000171,230

We propose an approach that tracks two aspects of community evolution in retweet networks: flow of the members in, out and between the communities, and their influence. We start with high resolution time windows, and then select several timepoints which exhibit large differences between the communities. For community detection, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we apply an enhanced Louvain algorithm, called Ensemble Louvain, to find stable communities. In the second stage, we form influence links between these communities, and identify linked super-communities. For the detected communities, we compute internal and external influence, and for individual users, the retweet h-index influence. We apply the proposed approach to three years of Twitter data of all Slovenian tweets. The analysis shows that the Slovenian tweetosphere is dominated by politics, that the left-leaning communities are larger, but that the right-leaning communities and users exhibit significantly higher impact.

Conclusion The proposed multiplex rRT-PCR methodology will enable highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, reducing reagent use and cost, and time required by clinical laboratory technicians.","Ishige, Takayuki; Murata, Shota; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Miyabe, Akiko; Kitamura, Kouichi; Kawasaki, Kenji; Nishimura, Motoi; Igari, Hidetoshi; Matsushita, Kazuyuki",Clin Chim Acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120301789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335089/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120301789?v=s5,230
653428,Platelet and Endothelial Activation as Potential Mechanisms Behind the Thrombotic Complications of COVID-19 Patients,2021-02-24,"The matrix protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) performs multiple functions during viral genome replication and virion production and is involved in modulating multiple host signaling pathways that favor virus replication. To perform numerous functions within infected cells, the M protein needs to recruit cellular partners. To better understand the role of M during VSV replication, we looked for interacting partners by using the two-hybrid system. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit i (eIF3i) was identified to be an M-binding partner, and this interaction was validated by GST pull-down and laser confocal assays. Through a mutagenesis analysis, we found that some mutants of M between amino acids 122 and 181 impaired but did not completely abolish the M–eIF3i interaction. Furthermore, the knockdown of eIF3i by RNA interference decreased viral replication and transcription in the early stages but led to increase in later stages. VSV transcription was increased at 4 h post-infection but was not changed at 8 and 12 h post-infection after the over-expression of eIF3i. Finally, we also demonstrated that VSV could inhibit the activity of Akt1 and that the knockdown of eIF3i inhibited the expression of the ISGs regulated by phospho-Akt1. These results indicated that eIF3i may affect VSV growth by regulating the host antiviral response in HeLa cells.","Pan, Wei; Song, Deguang; He, Wenqi; Lu, Huijun; Lan, Yungang; Li, Hongli; Gao, Feng; Zhao, Kui",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113517309124; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.10.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29173589/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113517309124,230

We showed that immigration and the logarithm of general mobility is the best predictor of SARS-CoV-2 arrival times, while emigration, industrialization and air quality explain the most of the size of the epidemic in poviats. On the other hand, infection dynamics is driven to a lesser extent by previously postulated variables such as population size and density, income or the size of the elderly population. Our analyses could support Polish authorities in preparation for the second wave of infections and optimal management of resources as we have provided a proposition of optimal distribution of human resources between poviats.","Jarynowski, A.; Wojta-Kempa, M.; Krzowski, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.20090985; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20090985v1?rss=1,230

653838,The ongoing - and resurgent - Challenge of post-infarct ventricular septal defect management,2020-07-06,"INTRODUCTION: Medical students are known to have high levels of depression, anxiety and stress from the high-pressure environments that they study and train in. The coronavirus pandemic presents source of stress and anxiety to large populations in general, and to healthcare professionals in particular. This study was undertaken to assess the psychological effects of this pandemic on the mental health of medical students and trainees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed to capture information on the participant’s anxieties related to the pandemic and included a validated tool for the assessment of anxiety and depression symptoms (GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively). The questionnaire was prepared on Google Forms, and the link to the questionnaire was disseminated to 113 medical students and junior doctors on 19 April 2020, and the survey closed on 22 April 2020 midnight. RESULTS: The survey was sent to 113 students, and 83 students participated. Of the participants, 47 (56.6%) were female and 36 (43.4%) were male, and 80 (96.4%) were aged less than 30 years old. Formal anxiety and depression scores using the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 tools indicated 15/82 (18.3%) had anxiety scores of 0 (lowest possible) and 21/82 (25.6%) had the lowest possible depression score of 0. However, 6/82 (7.3%) had scores that were classified as severe depression. Females had significantly higher median anxiety (5 v 2, p < 0.002) and depression scores (5 v 3, p = 0.025) than male participants. Direct patient care and care of patients with Covid-19 did not result in significant deterioration in anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: Female students/junior doctors showed higher anxiety and depression scores than males. Direct patient care and care of patients with Covid-19 did not result in a measurable deterioration in anxiety and depression in this study. In this stressful pandemic situation, it is imperative to look after the mental health of healthcare workers as well as patients.","Pandey, Uma; Corbett, Gillian; Mohan, Suruchi; Reagu, Shuja; Kumar, Shubham; Farrell, Thomas; Lindow, Stephen",J Obstet Gynaecol India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989348/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13224-020-01366-w,230

Outbreak narratives centred on the seafood market in Wuhan began to fall apart as new evidence was published by medical doctors, virologists, and epidemiologists. No viruses in bats or pangolins have been found that are direct ancestors of SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 symptoms. Viruses are also being transformed as they interact with the human institutions, infrastructures and behaviours that facilitate their spread. Epidemiological growth curves are shaped by national and foreign capital, cosmopolitanism, aspirations for independence and ongoing interdependence, the discourse of power and the discourse of resistance, as well as coexistence and violence. In reckoning with SARS-CoV2, we need to anticipate disruptive surprise of viral emergence rather recursively search for origins.

More recently, certain protein mutations are correlated with specific functional impacts. Our clinical data from patients suggest different clinical symptoms between European countries. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 mutations could explain these disparities. Our analyses point out an association of diverse mutations, including co-evolving ones, in a few SARS-CoV-2 proteins, with specific countries. We therefore suggest combining clinical information from patients and the determination of the associated SARS-CoV-2 genome to better understand the specific symptoms.","Coppée, Frédérique; Lechien, Jérôme; Declèves, Anne-Emilie; Tafforeau, Lionel; Saussez, Sven",New Microbes New Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100696; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520300482?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2052297520300482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32509310/,230

Viral determinants of NDV virulence are not completely understood. The amino acid sequence at the protease cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein has been postulated as a major determinant of NDV virulence. In this study, we have examined the role of F protein cleavage site sequence in NDV virulence using reverse genetics technology. The sequence G-R-Q-G-R present at the cleavage site of the F protein of avirulent strain LaSota was mutated to R-R-Q-K-R, which is present in the F cleavage site of neurovirulent strain Beaudette C (BC). The resultant mutated LaSota V.F. virus did not require exogenous protease for infectivity in cell culture, indicating that the F protein was cleaved by intracellular proteases. The virulence of the mutant and parental viruses was evaluated in vivo by intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) tests in chickens. Our results showed that the modification of the F protein cleavage site resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence from an ICPI value of 0.00 for LaSota to a value of 1.12 for LaSota V.F. However, the ICPI value of LaSota V.F. was lower than that of BC, which had a value of 1.58. Interestingly, the IVPI tests showed values of 0.00 for both LaSota and LaSota V.F. viruses, compared to the IVPI value of 1.45 of BC. In vitro characteristics of the viruses were also studied. Our results demonstrate that the efficiency of cleavage of the F protein plays an important role if the NDV is delivered directly into the brains of chicks, but there could be other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication, viremia, or entry into the central nervous system.","Panda, Aruna; Huang, Zhuhui; Elankumaran, Subbiah; Rockemann, Daniel D; Samal, Siba K",Microb Pathog,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401003001669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14643634/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401003001669,230

DESIGN: Observational study with retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2272 patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) whose visits were rescheduled over lockdown (April 13–June 1, 2020) were offered participation in a self-monitoring initiative administered by SNEC with the Alleye application (Switzerland) as the testing instrument. METHODS: This was an observational study with retrospective analysis. Demographics and characteristics were compared between those who signed up and those who did not. Similar comparisons were made between patients who complied with the initiative versus those who did not. Outcomes were tracked for 6 months starting from the commencement of lockdown. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participation and compliance rates and characteristics of patients who were more likely to participate and comply with the initiative. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-two patients (32%) participated in this self-monitoring initiative. Those who participated were younger (62 years of age vs. 68 years of age; P < 0.001), men, and living with family. Patients not receiving treatment and those with poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye were more likely to participate. When grouped according to diagnosis, the proportion who participated was highest for diabetic macular edema (52%), nonneovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD; 42%), diabetic retinopathy (35%), retinal vein occlusions (18%), and neovascular AMD (15%; P < 0.001). Testing compliance rate was 43% (315/732). Patients who complied with the initiative were older, were receiving treatment, and had poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye. Trigger events occurred in 33 patients, with 5 patients having clinically verified disease progression (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: We provide clinical data on characteristics of patients with stable retinal diseases who were offered, participated in, and complied with a self-monitoring program. The lower participation rate compared with standardized clinical studies reflects the difficulties in implementation for such initiatives in clinical settings. Despite this, self-monitoring continues to show promise in relieving clinic resources, suggesting the feasibility of scaling such programs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Teo, Kelvin Yi Chong; Bachmann, Lucas M.; Sim, Dawn; Lee, Shu Yen; Tan, Anna; Wong, Tien Y.; Cheung, Chui Ming Gemmy; Wei Tan, Gavin Siew",Ophthalmol Retina,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468653021000555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33610833/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468653021000555; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oret.2021.02.005,230

As a chronic condition, osteoporosis generally requires sustained medical intervention(s) to limit the risks for additional bone loss, compromise of skeletal integrity, and fracture occurrence. Further complicating this issue is the fact that the abrupt cessation of some therapies can be associated with an increased risk for harm. It is in this context that the COVID‐19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to the provision of health care globally, including near universal requirements for social distancing. In this Perspective, we provide evidence, where available, regarding the general care of patients with osteoporosis in the COVID‐19 era and provide clinical recommendations based primarily on expert opinion when data are absent.

657817,A snapshot of COVID‐19 infection in patients with solid tumors,2020-12-19,"Social stress poses a major threat to adolescent health via its effects on internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. Available interventions to help adolescents improve their stress responses, however, have not been effective in rigorous evaluation studies, or they have been difficult to administer widely. Here we show that replicable improvements in adolescent stress responses can be achieved with a short (~30-minute), scalable synergistic mindsets intervention. This intervention, which is a self-administered online training module, targets both growth mindsets (the idea that people’s intelligence can be developed in response to challenge) and stress-can-be-enhancing mindsets (the idea that people’s stress responses can be fuel for optimal performance). Its goal is to promote positive engagement with stressful events (e.g., learning from failure on a quiz or a conflict with a peer) and to encourage adolescents to use their responses to stressful events and even their bodily symptoms (e.g. racing heart, sweaty palms, butterflies in their stomach) to their advantage. In five double-blind, randomized, controlled trials (total N = 4,091 adolescents), the new synergistic mindsets intervention improved stress-related cognitions (Studies 1-2), cardiovascular reactivity (Study 3), daily internalizing symptoms and cortisol levels (Study 4), and generalized anxiety symptoms during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns (Study 5). Effects on downstream outcomes (in Studies 3-5) were stronger among individuals who, at baseline, held the two negative mindsets targeted by the intervention, providing evidence for the proposed mechanisms. Confidence in this conclusion comes from a conservative, Bayesian machine-learning method for detecting heterogeneity.","Yeager, David; Bryan, Christopher; Gross, James; Krettek, Danielle; Santos, Pedro; Murray, Jared; Graveling, Hannah; Johnson, Meghann; Jamieson, Jeremy",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-551170/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075372/,230

How the defects in this system might result in autoimmunity is discussed in this review. Reduced lymphocyte number, termed lymphopenia, can mediate lymphopenia-induced proliferation (LIP) to maintain peripheral lymphocyte numbers. LIP not only occurs in normal physiological conditions but also correlates with autoimmunity. Of note, lymphopenia is also a typical marker of immune aging, consistent with the fact that not only the autoimmunity increases in the elderly, but also autoimmune diseases (ADs) show characteristics of immune aging. Here, we discuss the types and rates of LIP in normal and autoimmune conditions, as well as the coronavirus disease 2019 in the context of LIP. Importantly, although the causative role of LIP has been demonstrated in the development of type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, a two-hit model has suggested that the factors other than lymphopenia are required to mediate the loss of control over homeostasis to result in ADs. Interestingly, these factors may be, if not totally, related to the function/number of regulatory T cells which are key modulators to protect from self-reactivity. In this review, we summarize the important roles of lymphopenia/LIP and the Treg cells in various autoimmune conditions, thereby highlighting them as key therapeutic targets for autoimmunity treatments.","Sheu, Ting-Ting; Chiang, Bor-Luen",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22084152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923792/,230

The purpose of this quality improvement project was to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of sleep disturbance among PBT patients in our clinic and to evaluate interest in treatment for sleep disturbance. METHODS: PBT patients completed validated measures of sleep disturbance and health during routine neuro-oncology visits. Patients also reported on sleep-related symptom management and their preferences for pharmacological and/or behavioral treatment. RESULTS: Sleep disturbance was common, with 61.5% of PBT patients (N = 119; M(age) = 52.60 years; 50% male) reporting poor sleep quality and 21.5% endorsing symptoms of insomnia. Insomnia could be explained by increased fatigue and corticosteroid use; sleep quality could be explained by fatigue. Patients in our clinic with higher grade tumors, significant sleep disturbance, of minority racial/ethnic status, and those not already taking sleep medications were more likely to report their symptoms and were not well-addressed by their medical team. Patients indicated a similar interest in pharmacological and behavioral treatment, warranting the availability of both in our clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a high prevalence of sleep disturbance in PBT patients, highlighting the need for increased screening, monitoring, and treatment in our neuro-oncology clinic.

659150,Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of respiratory Gram-negative bacterial isolates from COVID-19 patients in Switzerland,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic started in China in early December 2019, and quickly spread around the world. The epidemic gradually started in Italy at the end of February 2020, and by May 31, 2020, 232,664 cases and 33,340 deaths were confirmed. As a result of this pandemic, the Italian Ministerial Decree issued on March 11, 2020, enforced lockdown; therefore, many social, recreational, and cultural centers remained closed for months. In Apulia (southern Italy), all non-urgent hospital activities were suspended, and some wards were closed, with a consequent reduction in the use of the water network and the formation of stagnant water. This situation could enhance the risk of exposure of people to waterborne diseases, including legionellosis. The purpose of this study was to monitor the microbiological quality of the water network (coliforms, E. coli, Enterococci, P. aeruginosa, and Legionella) in three wards (A, B and C) of a large COVID-19 regional hospital, closed for three months due to the COVID-19 emergency. Our study revealed that all three wards' water network showed higher contamination by Legionella pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 at T1 (after lockdown) compared to the period before the lockdown (T0). In particular, ward A at T1 showed a median value = 5600 CFU/L (range 0–91,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 75 CFU/L (range 0–5000 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.014); ward B at T1 showed a median value = 200 CFU/L (range 0–4200 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0–300 CFU/L) (p-value = 0.016) and ward C at T1 showed a median value = 175 CFU/L (range 0–22,000 CFU/L) vs T0, median value = 0 CFU/L (range 0–340 CFU/L) (p-value < 0.001). In addition, a statistically significant difference was detected in ward B between the number of positive water samples at T0 vs T1 for L. pneumophila sg 1 and sg 6 (24% vs 80% p-value < 0.001) and for coliforms (0% vs 64% p-value < 0.001). Moreover, a median value of coliform load resulted 3 CFU/100 ml (range 0–14 CFU/100 ml) at T1, showing a statistically significant increase versus T0 (0 CFU/100 ml) (p-value < 0.001). Our results highlight the need to implement a water safety plan that includes staff training and a more rigorous environmental microbiological surveillance in all hospitals before occupying a closed ward for a longer than one week, according to national and international guidelines.","De Giglio, Osvalda; Diella, Giusy; Lopuzzo, Marco; Triggiano, Francesco; Calia, Carla; Pousis, Chrysovalentinos; Fasano, Fabrizio; Caggiano, Giuseppina; Calabrese, Giuseppe; Rafaschieri, Vincenza; Carpagnano, Federica; Carlucci, Matilde; Gesualdo, Loreto; Ricci, Maria Luisa; Scaturro, Maria; Rota, Maria Cristina; Bonadonna, Lucia; Lucentini, Luca; Montagna, Maria Teresa",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120311282?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976823/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120311282; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110231,230

A central motivation in this regard is to advance patient treatment by reducing human error and increasing the accuracy of prognosis, diagnosis and therapy decisions. There is, however, also increasing awareness about bias in ML technologies and its potentially harmful consequences. Biases refer to systematic distortions of datasets, algorithms, or human decision making. These systematic distortions are understood to have negative effects on the quality of an outcome in terms of accuracy, fairness, or transparency. But biases are not only a technical problem that requires a technical solution. Because they often also have a social dimension, the ‘distorted’ outcomes they yield often have implications for equity. This paper assesses different types of biases that can emerge within applications of ML in radiology, and discusses in what cases such biases are problematic. Drawing upon theories of equity in healthcare, we argue that while some biases are harmful and should be acted upon, others might be unproblematic and even desirable—exactly because they can contribute to overcome inequities.","Pot, Mirjam; Kieusseyan, Nathalie; Prainsack, Barbara",Insights Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-020-00955-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564955/,230

660505,Life-Threatening Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage as an Initial Presentation of Microscopic Polyangiitis: COVID-19 as a Likely Culprit,2021-04-10,"A multitude of efforts worldwide aim to create a single-cell reference map of the human body, for fundamental understanding of human health, molecular medicine, and targeted treatment. Antibody-based proteomics using immunohistochemistry (IHC) has proven to be an excellent technology for integration with large-scale single-cell transcriptomics datasets. The golden standard for evaluation of IHC staining patterns is manual annotation, which is expensive and may lead to subjective errors. Artificial intelligence holds much promise for efficient and accurate pattern recognition, but confidence in prediction needs to be addressed. Here, the aim was to present a reliable and comprehensive framework for automated annotation of IHC images. We developed a multilabel classification of 7848 complex IHC images of human testis corresponding to 2794 unique proteins, generated as part of the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project. Manual annotation data for eight different cell types was generated as a basis for training and testing a proposed Hybrid Bayesian Neural Network. By combining the deep learning model with a novel uncertainty metric, DeepHistoClass (DHC) Confidence Score, the average diagnostic performance improved from 86.9% to 96.3%. This metric not only reveals which images are reliably classified by the model, but can also be utilized for identification of manual annotation errors. The proposed streamlined workflow can be developed further for other tissue types in health and disease and has important implications for digital pathology initiatives or large-scale protein mapping efforts such as the HPA project.","Ghoshal, Biraja; Hikmet, Feria; Pineau, Charles; Tucker, Allan; Lindskog, Cecilia",Mol Cell Proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2021.100140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34425263/,230

Here we describe the time course of cardiac autonomic modulation assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) during 14-month expeditions at the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. Heart rate recordings were acquired in supine position in the morning at rest once before the expedition (baseline) and monthly during the expedition from February to October. The total set comprised twenty-five healthy crewmembers (n = 15 men, 38 ± 6 yrs, n = 10 women, 32 ± 6 yrs, mean ± SD). High frequency (HF) power and the ratio of low to high frequency power (LF/HF) were used as indices of vagal modulation and sympathovagal balance. HF power adjusted for baseline differences decreased significantly during the expedition, indicating a gradual reduction in vagal tone. LF/HF powers ratio progressively shifted toward a sympathetic predominance reaching statistical significance in the final trimester (August to October) relative to the first trimester (February to April). This effect was particularly pronounced in women. The depression of cardio-vagal tone and the shift toward a sympathetic predominance observed throughout the overwintering suggest a long-term cardiac autonomic modulation in response to isolation and confinement during Antartic overwintering.","Maggioni, Martina A.; Merati, Giampiero; Castiglioni, Paolo; Mendt, Stefan; Gunga, Hanns-Christian; Stahn, Alexander C.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78722-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33311648/,230

We undertook recombination analyses of 158,118 public seasonal hCoV, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV genome sequences using the RDP4 software. We found moderate evidence for 8 SARS-CoV-2 recombination events, two of which involved the spike gene, and low evidence for one SARS-CoV-1 recombination event. Within MERS-CoV, 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 datasets, we noted 7, 1, 9, 14, and 1 high-confidence recombination events, respectively. There was propensity for recombination breakpoints in structural genes, and recombination severely skewed the temporal structure of these data, especially for NL63 and OC43. Bayesian time-scaled analyses on recombinant-free data indicated the sampled diversity of seasonal CoVs emerged in the last 70 years, with 229E displaying continuous lineage replacements. These findings emphasize the importance of genomic based surveillance to detect recombination in SARS-CoV-2, particularly if recombination may lead to immune evasion.","Pollett, Simon; Conte, Matthew A; Sanborn, Mark; Jarman, Richard G; Lidl, Grace M.; Modjarrad, Kayvon; Berry, Irina Maljkovic",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.07.434287,230

We aimed to characterize recent COVID-19 related community practice non-invasive diagnostic imaging professional work declines. Methods Using imaging metadata from nine community radiology practices across the United States between January 2019 and May 2020, we mapped work relative value unit (wRVU) weighted stand-alone non-invasive diagnostic imaging service codes to both modality and body region. Weekly 2020 vs. 2019 wRVU changes were analyzed by modality, body region, and site of service. Practice share Chi-square testing was performed. Results Aggregate weekly wRVUs ranged from a high of 120,450 (February 2020) to a low of 55,188 (April 2020). During that -52% wRVU nadir, outpatient declines were greatest (-66%). All practices followed similar aggregate trends in the distribution of wRVUs between each 2020 vs. 2019 week (p=0.96-0.98). As a percentage of total all-practice wRVUs, declines in CT (20,046/63,992; 31%) and radiography/fluoroscopy (19,196; 30%) were greatest. By body region, declines in abdomen/pelvis (16,203; 25%) and breast (12,032; 19%) imaging were greatest. Mammography (-17%) and abdominal/pelvic CT (-14%) accounted for the largest shares of total all-practice wRVU reductions. Across modality-region groups, declines were far greatest for mammography (-92%). Conclusions Substantial COVID-19 related diagnostic imaging work declines were similar across community practices and disproportionately impacted mammography. Decline patterns could facilitate pandemic second wave planning. Overall implications for practice workflows, practice finances, patient access, and payment policy are manifold.","Duszak, Richard; Maze, Jeff; Sessa, Candice; Fleishon, Howard B.; Golding, Lauren P.; Nicola, Gregory N.; Hughes, Danny R.",J Am Coll Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.06.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1546144020307420; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144020307420?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32682745/,230

In recent years, peptide-based therapeutics have been widely studied and developed to treat infectious diseases, including viral infections. Herein, the antiviral effects of the lysine linked dimer des-Cys(11), Lys(12),Lys(13)-(pBthTX-I)(2)K ((pBthTX-I)(2)K)) and derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 are reported. The lead peptide (pBthTX-I)(2)K and derivatives showed attractive inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 (EC(50) = 28–65 µM) and mostly low cytotoxic effect (CC(50) > 100 µM). To shed light on the mechanism of action underlying the peptides’ antiviral activity, the Main Protease (M(pro)) and Papain-Like protease (PL(pro)) inhibitory activities of the peptides were assessed. The synthetic peptides showed PL(pro) inhibition potencies (IC(50)s = 1.0–3.5 µM) and binding affinities (K(d) = 0.9–7 µM) at the low micromolar range but poor inhibitory activity against M(pro) (IC(50) > 10 µM). The modeled binding mode of a representative peptide of the series indicated that the compound blocked the entry of the PL(pro) substrate toward the protease catalytic cleft. Our findings indicated that non-toxic dimeric peptides derived from the Bothropstoxin-I have attractive cellular and enzymatic inhibitory activities, thereby suggesting that they are promising prototypes for the discovery and development of new drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Freire, Marjorie C.

Genetically diverse hepadnaviruses were identified in a broad range of bat species, with an overall prevalence of 13.3%. In contrast, no rodent hepadnaviruses were identified. The newly discovered bat hepadnaviruses fell into two distinct phylogenetic groups. The viruses within the first group exhibited high diversity, with some closely related to viruses previously identified in Yunnan province. Strikingly, the newly discovered viruses sampled from Jiyuan city in the second phylogenetic group were most closely related to those found in bats from West Africa, suggestive of a long-term association between bats and hepadnaviruses. A co-phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent cross-species transmission among bats from different species, genera, and families. Overall, these data suggest that there are likely few barriers to the cross-species transmission of bat hepadnaviruses.","Nie, Fang-Yuan; Lin, Xian-Dan; Hao, Zong-Yu; Chen, Xiao-Nan; Wang, Zhao-Xiao; Wang, Miao-Ruo; Wu, Jun; Wang, Hong-Wei; Zhao, Guoqiang; Ma, Runlin Z.; Holmes, Edward C.; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153861/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217303768; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217303768,230

In total, 32 PPCP pollutants classified into 23 categories were detected. Different spatial distribution patterns of PPCPs indicated possible contamination from runoff and multiple local sources. The labile-to-conservative ratios of PPCPs showed the influence of untreated domestic sewage. In addition, increased concentrations of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and erythromycin around aquaculture farms imply that aquaculture cannot be neglected as a source. The concentrations of oxytetracycline, ranitidine, ciprofloxacin, miconazole, and sulfamethizole were higher in the wet season than those in the dry season, and the difference in pharmaceutical consumption was suspected to be the main driving factor of this seasonal variation. The risk quotients calculated with the maximum concentrations of miconazole, triclosan, dehydronifedipine, and triclocarban exceeded 0.1, indicating potential moderate or high risks. Antibacterial agents in daily chemicals and azole broad-spectrum antifungals were associated with the highest risks in this study; this might be another significant pollution characteristic in the sea area around this subtropical tourist city.

This study aims to explore household medication practices by and for this population, identify practices that benefit or jeopardise medication safety and develop best practice guidance about household medication safety practices during a pandemic, grounded in individual experiences. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a descriptive qualitative study using semistructured interviews, by telephone or video call. People who have been advised to ‘cocoon’/‘shield’ and/or are aged 70 years or over and using at least one long-term medication, or their caregivers, will be eligible for inclusion. We will recruit 100 patient/carer participants: 50 from the UK and 50 from Ireland. Recruitment will be supported by our patient and public involvement (PPI) partners, personal networks and social media. Individual participant consent will be sought, and interviews audio/video recorded and/or detailed notes made. A constructivist interpretivist approach to data analysis will involve use of the constant comparative method to organise the data, along with inductive analysis. From this, we will iteratively develop best practice guidance about household medication safety practices during a pandemic from the patient’s/carer’s perspective.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a needs-based education programme provided within the first 3 days of patients’ hospitalisation, on the anxiety levels and satisfaction of psychosocial needs of their families. This was a quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-test design. A convenience sample was recruited over a period of three months, consisting of one primary family carer of each critically ill patient who had been admitted to an ICU in Hong Kong. Conducted by an ICU nurse specially assigned for the purpose, family carers in the experimental group ([Formula: see text]) received an individual education programme based on the results of a literature review and an individual family needs assessment carried out at the time of patient admission, using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. The subjects in the control group ([Formula: see text]) received the usual orientation and explanation given by the ICU nurses. Anxiety and need satisfaction were measured in the two groups at pre- and post-test and their mean scores were compared. Of the ten most important statements identified by the family carers in the two groups, the statements regarding the needs for information and assurance were found to predominate. After the needs-based intervention, the experimental group reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of satisfaction of family needs than the control group at the post-test. The findings support the effectiveness of providing families of newly admitted critically ill patients, with a needs-based educational intervention to allay anxiety and satisfy immediate psychosocial needs.

665807,A Feasibility Trial to Evaluate the Composite Efficacy of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in the Treatment of Covid 19 Pneumonia : Impact on Viral Load and Clinical Outcomes,2021-04-20,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lipoprotein apheresis is the most effective means of lipid-lowering therapy. However, it’s a semi-invasive, time consuming, and chronic therapy with variable adherence. There are still no specific guideline recommendations for the management of patients on lipid apheresis. The purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical indications and major drawbacks of lipid apheresis in the light of recent evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: Lipoprotein apheresis should be initiated at early ages and performed frequently to receive the expected cardiovascular benefits. However, in clinical practice, most patients experience ineffective apheresis and fail to reach lipid targets. This real-world failure is due to several factors including late diagnosis, delayed referral, and improper frequency of procedures. All these denote that awareness is still low among physicians. Another important factor is the semi-invasive, time consuming nature of the apheresis, leading to high refusal and low adherence rates. Moreover, apheresis decreases quality of life and increases the risk of depression. Mental status is also deteriorated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia on lipid apheresis. New effective lipid lowering agents are underway with promising cardiovascular results. SUMMARY: To overcome the drawbacks, a structured approach, including standardized protocols for lipoprotein apheresis with regular cardiovascular follow-up is warranted. New effective lipid lowering agents with documented cardiovascular benefit, should be integrated into the treatment algorithms of patients on lipoprotein apheresis.","Kayikcioglu, Meral",Curr Atheroscler Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594522/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11883-021-00911-w,230

666662,Room for Improvement: The Trephination Procedure for Pediatric Patients with Pilonidal Disease,2021,"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently approved and shows favorable outcomes, but little known about antibody responses in solid organ transplant recipients, since these patients are known to have an impaired immune response upon vaccination and have not been included in admission studies. We therefore analyzed immunogenicity in 43 liver transplant (LT) recipients in a median of 15 days (IQR, 12–24) after receiving two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 following the standard protocol, and compared these results to a control group consisting of 20 healthcare workers (HCWs). Thirty-four of the 43 (79%) LT recipients developed antibodies, compared to 20 out of 20 (100%) in the control group (p = 0.047). The median SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer was significantly lower in the LT recipients compared to the control group (216 vs. >2080 BAU/mL, p = 0.0001). Age and sex distribution was similar in the LT patients that developed antibodies after vaccination compared to those who did not. Interestingly, the patients who received mycophenolate mofetil exhibited a reduced vaccination response compared to the other LT patients (5 of 11 (45.5%) vs. 29 of 32 (90.6%), p = 0.004). In conclusion, our data reveal lower immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 in LT patients compared to the control group, but still show superior results compared to other solid organ transplant recipients reported so far.","Rashidi-Alavijeh, Jassin; Frey, Alexandra; Passenberg, Moritz; Korth, Johannes; Zmudzinski, Jaqueline; Anastasiou, Olympia E.; Saner, Fuat H.; Jahn, Michael; Lange, Christian M.; Willuweit, Katharina",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358154/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070738,230
666853,Long-term follow-up of recovered patients with COVID-19,2021-01-08,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Spanish government to declare a state of emergency. A stringent lockdown was enforced, restricting access to healthcare services, including chiropractic. Reduced access to care provision, in combination with psychological stress, social isolation and physical inactivity during lockdown, were shown to negatively influence pain conditions. However, data on strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on these conditions is lacking. METHODS: Upon easing of restrictions in May 2020, fifty-one chiropractic clinics throughout Spain pseudo-randomly invited patients, recruiting a total of 385 participants. During a 14-day period, participants were exposed to in-person chiropractic care in either one (n=177) or multiple encounters (n=109), or to no care (n=99). The effects of access to chiropractic care on patients' pain-related and psychological outcomes were assessed online through validated self-reported questionnaires before and after the period of care. Coprimary outcomes included pain intensity, pain interference and pain cognitions. RESULTS: When comparing to participants without access to care, pain intensity and interference were significantly decreased at follow-up, irrespective of the number of encounters. Kinesiophobia was also significantly reduced at follow-up, though only after multiple encounters. The relationship between fear of movement, changes in pain intensity and interference was mediated by catastrophizing. CONCLUSION: Access to in-person chiropractic care may provide pain relief, associated with reductions in interference and pain cognitions. Prioritizing in-person care for patients with maladaptive pain cognitions may help dampen the detrimental consequences of the pandemic on physical and psychological well-being.","Gevers-Montoro, C; Deldar, Z; Conesa-Buendía, F M; Lazar, E A; Mahillo-Fernandez, I; Khatibi, A; Ortega de Mues, A",Eur. j. pain (Lond.),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34618991/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1872,230

667737,Autoimmune Encephalitis Presenting with Acute Excited Catatonia in a 40-Year-Old Male Patient with Covid-19,2020-08-04,"People with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) are a vulnerable population in all aspects of access and participation, abuse and neglect, and being subject to the use of restrictive practices. Accordingly, they are a group whose human rights can be impacted where equal access to supports, services, and accessible information is compromised. The current COVID‐19 pandemic is a global humanitarian emergency that has had a devastating impact across the world, for all people. Growing concern has been raised about the impact of the COVID‐19 virus on the health of people with disabilities and there has been subsequent development of strategies and protocols to promote equal access to information, health supports, and services. People with IDD have high levels of underlying comorbidity that increases their risk of contracting COVID‐19 and measures to protect them from infection are critically important. However, those measures may trigger behaviors of concern and increase the risk of being subjected to restrictive practices. While some attention has been paid to the health impacts of COVID‐19 on people with disabilities, there has been less paid to the impact on the human rights of people with IDD who present with behaviors of concern. The aim of this paper is to provide a hypothetical exploration of the impacts of pandemic prevention measures on people with IDD and behaviors of concern in the context of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). In the absence of available guidance for working with people with IDD with behaviors of concern during COVID‐19, we suggest behavior support response plans that aim to ensure that people with IDD with behaviors of concern are supported properly in a time of significant disruption for them, thereby safeguarding their human rights.","Nankervis, Karen; Chan, Jeffrey",J Policy Pract Intellect Disabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230830/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jppi.12374,230
667838,Covid vaccination in patients with autoimmune diseases treated with mycophenolate: Let's think back to the recommendations,2021-07-16,"IMPORTANCE: Increased work requirements have been proposed throughout federal safety net programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Participation in SNAP is associated with reduced food insecurity and improved health. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether SNAP work requirements are associated with lower rates of program participation and to examine whether there are racial/ethnic disparities or spillover effects for people with disabilities, who are not intended to be affected by work requirements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationally representative, pooled cross-sectional study examined how changes in SNAP work requirements at state and local levels in the US are associated with changes in food voucher program participation. The study combined information on state and local SNAP work requirements with repeated cross-sections from the 2012 through 2017 American Community Survey (with outcomes covering 2013 to 2017). The analytical approaches were based on difference-in-difference and triple-difference methods, after controlling for other economic and social factors. The sample included low-income adults without dependents, stratified by racial/ethnic group and disability status. The study also included parents who would otherwise meet work requirement criteria as a comparison group to estimate triple-difference models. This accounted for otherwise unobserved factors affecting trends in SNAP participation within local areas. Data were analyzed from January 2019 through March 2020. EXPOSURE: Residence in areas where SNAP work requirements apply. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome is SNAP participation measured by whether anyone in the household received food vouchers at any point over the prior 12 months. RESULTS: The final analytical sample included 866 000 low-income adults (weighted mean [SE] age, 33.6 [0.01] years; 42.5% [SE, 0.07%] men). The racial/ethnic breakdown was 56.5% (SE, 0.07%) non-Hispanic white respondents, 19.4% (SE, 0.06%) non-Hispanic black respondents, 17.7% (SE, 0.06%) Hispanic respondents, 2.5% (SE, 0.02%) Asian respondents, and 3.9% (SE, 0.03%) respondents of other or multiple races. In final triple-difference models, work requirements were associated with a 4.0 percentage point decrease in participation (95% CI, –0.048 to –0.032; P < .001) for childless adults without disability, equivalent to a 21.2% reduction in SNAP participation (95% CI, –25.5% to –17.0%). For childless adults with disability, work requirements were associated with a 4.0 percentage point reduction (95% CI, –0.058 to –0.023; P < .001), equivalent to 7.8% fewer SNAP participants with disability (95% CI, –11.2% to –4.4%). When the final models were stratified by race/ethnicity, benefit reductions were larger for non-Hispanic black adults (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, –0.092 to –0.051; P < .001) and Hispanic adults (5.5 percentage points; 95% CI, –0.072 to –0.038; P < .001) than for non-Hispanic white adults (2.6 percentage points; 95% CI, –0.035 to –0.016; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Because of the association of SNAP with food security and health, work requirements that lead to benefit loss may create nutritional and health harm for low-income Americans. These findings suggest that there may be racially disparate consequences and unintended harm for those with disability.","Brantley, Erin; Pillai, Drishti; Ku, Leighton",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.5824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589228/,230

668475,High rate of HSV-1 reactivation in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients: Immunological findings,2021-07-01,"Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), also known as pinkeye, is one of the most common eye diseases in cattle. Several pathogens have been associated with IBK cases, however, Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma bovoculi and bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) are most frequently observed. A multiplex real-time PCR assay using two reactions was developed for the detection and differentiation of these five pathogens. Detection sensitivities of the multiplex assays were compared to singleplex reactions testing for the same targets. Correlation coefficients (R(2)) of >0.99, and PCR efficiencies between 92 and 106% were demonstrated in all singleplex and multiplex real-time PCR reactions. The limits of detection (LOD) of multiplex assays for Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma bovoculi and BHV-1 were 19, 23, 25, 24 and 26 copies per reaction, respectively. No cross amplification was observed for specificity testing of 179 IBK positive clinical samples and 55 non-target clinical samples. Percentage of clinical samples positive for Mycoplasma bovoculi, Moraxella bovoculi, Moraxella bovis, BHV-1 and Mycoplasma bovis were 88.8% (159/179), 75.9% (136/179), 60.3% (108/179), 11.7% (21/179) and 10.0% (18/179), respectively. Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi and Mycoplasma bovoculi were more prevalent than Mycoplasma bovis and BHV-1 in IBK samples collected from animals in this study population. Our data indicates that the multiplex real-time PCR panel assay is highly sensitive and highly specific for the detection and differentiation of the five major pathogens associated with bovine pinkeye.","Zheng, Wanglong; Porter, Elizabeth; Noll, Lance; Stoy, Colin; Lu, Nanyan; Wang, Yin; Liu, Xuming; Purvis, Tanya; Peddireddi, Lalitha; Lubbers, Brian; Hanzlicek, Gregg; Henningson, Jamie; Liu, Zongping; Bai, Jianfa",J Microbiol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701219300259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30930057/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167701219300259; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2019.03.024,230
668932,The Forgotten Gastrointestinal Tract in COVID-19 Infection,2020-07-20,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to apply reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays to clinical specimens collected from patients with acute respiratory illness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: One hundred and ninety-four samples from two different study cohorts were analysed using RT-PCR assays for picornaviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza types 1–3 viruses, and human metapneumovirus and a PCR assay for adenoviruses. The results were added to results obtained previously using cell culture and serologic methods. RESULTS: RT-PCR assays identified an additional 35 respiratory virus-associated illnesses not identified previously by cell culture or serology (n=46). Picornaviruses and coronaviruses were the most common viral infections identified only by RT-PCR. Overall, 41.8% of the acute respiratory illnesses evaluated were associated with a respiratory virus infection, with picornaviruses, coronaviruses and influenza viruses being the most common infections recognized. No human metapneumovirus infections were identified by RT-PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viral infections are commonly associated with acute respiratory illness in COPD patients, and the use of RT-PCR assays significantly increases the ability to diagnose these infections.","Beckham, J.

668975,Pathogenesis of Liver injury in COVID-19,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients with COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms, known as Long COVID. Few systematic studies have investigated this population, particularly in outpatient settings. Hence, relatively little is known about symptom makeup and severity, expected clinical course, impact on daily functioning, and return to baseline health. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of people with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, distributed via COVID-19 support groups (e.g. Body Politic, Long COVID Support Group, Long Haul COVID Fighters) and social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook). Data were collected from September 6, 2020 to November 25, 2020. We analyzed responses from 3762 participants with confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive; 1020) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested; 2742) COVID-19, from 56 countries, with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020. We estimated the prevalence of 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems and traced 66 symptoms over seven months. We measured the impact on life, work, and return to baseline health. FINDINGS: For the majority of respondents (>91%), the time to recovery exceeded 35 weeks. During their illness, participants experienced an average of 55.9+/- 25.5 (mean+/-STD) symptoms, across an average of 9.1 organ systems. The most frequent symptoms after month 6 were fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Symptoms varied in their prevalence over time, and we identified three symptom clusters, each with a characteristic temporal profile. 85.9% of participants (95% CI, 84.8% to 87.0%) experienced relapses, primarily triggered by exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress. 86.7% (85.6% to 92.5%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7% (38.5% to 50.5%) of recovered respondents. 1700 respondents (45.2%) required a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness, and an additional 839 (22.3%) were not working at the time of survey due to illness. Cognitive dysfunction or memory issues were common across all age groups (~88%). Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all symptoms were similar between groups with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Patients with Long COVID report prolonged, multisystem involvement and significant disability. By seven months, many patients have not yet recovered (mainly from systemic and neurological/cognitive symptoms), have not returned to previous levels of work, and continue to experience significant symptom burden.

669254,A Case of Immune Thrombocytopenia After COVID-19 Infection,2021-06-22,"Abstract The mechanism for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires the binding of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, well-known for its role in counteracting ACE. ACE2 is involved in modulating blood pressure and establishing blood pressure homeostasis. Recently, a critical debatable question has risen, whether using antihypertensive medications will have a favorable impact on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or a deleterious one, mainly since ACEIs and ARBs therapy can modulate the expression of ACE2 protein. The concern is that the use of ACEIs and ARBs will increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. On the other hand, several genetic association studies have examined the relationship between ACE2 genetic variants and the risk of developing hypertension in different ethnic populations. In this review, we discuss the ongoing arguments in the literature about ACE2’s role in mortality rate among COVID-19 people comorbid with hypertension and critically evaluate the current debate about the usage or discontinuation of ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, we explore the two opposing roles that ACE2 genetic variants might be playing in COVID-19 disease by reducing ACE2 receptor effectiveness and mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.","Bosso, Mira; Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Alanbaei, Muath; Abubaker, Jehad; Al-Mulla, Fahd",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2020.06.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32665962/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2329050120301418; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2329050120301418?v=s5,230

Family routines were disrupted, potentially increasing parental stress, and may be reflected in greater media screen time use in children. Objectives: To determine whether 1) parenting styles and 2) parenting stress were associated with children's screen time use during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Methods: Parents (>18 years of age) were recruited to complete an online survey regarding changes in their children's (6-12 years) screen time use and daily activities before and during the pandemic. Stress and parental involvement were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Alabama Parenting Questionnaires respectively. General linear models assessed whether parenting style and parent stress was associated with children's screen time during the pandemic, adjusting for demographic variables and daily activities. Results: 104 parents were enrolled, and 78 (75%) parents completed the surveys. Children's screen time (e.g., watching television and playing video games) increased significantly, from 2.6 hours to 5.8 hours a day (p=.001) during pandemic-related school closures. Smaller changes in children's screen time use were significantly associated with more parental involvement (p=.017). Parent stress (p=.018) significantly predicted children's screen time use. Lower household income was associated with increased hours of screen time in both models (both, p<.05). Conclusions: Children's screen time nearly doubled during the initial months of the pandemic. Parent stress and parenting styles may be modifiable risk factors to promote children's wellbeing during the ongoing pandemic.","Seguin, Diane; Keunzel, Elizabeth; Morton, J Bruce; Duerden, Emma G",J Affect Disord Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666915321001438; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666915321001438?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514458/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100217,230

By analysis of synonymous codon usage values in each ORF of PRRSV, the optimal codons for most amino acids were all C or G-ended codons except GAU for Asp, CAU for His, UUU for Phe and CCU for Pro. The synonymous codon usage patterns in different ORFs of PRRSV were different and genetically conserved. Among them, ORF1a, ORF4, ORF5 and ORF7 could cluster these strains into the two main serotypes (EU and US). Due to mutational pressure, compositional constraint played an important role in shaping the synonymous codon usage pattern in different ORFs, and the synonymous codon usage diversity in ORFs was correlated with gene function. The degree of CUB for some particular amino acids under strong selection pressure probably served as a potential genetic marker for each ORF in PRRSV. However, gene length and translational selection in nature had no effect on the synonymous codon usage pattern in PRRSV. These conclusions could not only offer an insight into the synonymous codon usage pattern and differentiation of gene function, but also assist in understanding the discrepancy of evolution among ORFs in PRRSV.","Liu, Yong-sheng; Zhou, Jian-hua; Chen, Hao-tai; Ma, Li-na; Ding, Yao-zhong; Wang, Meng; Zhang, Jie",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20438864/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134810001085; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2010.04.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134810001085,230

METHODS AND RESULTS: Real‐world data (RWD) from two health systems were used to identify 146 702 adults diagnosed with cancer between 2015 and 2020; 1267 COVID‐19 cases were identified between February 1 and July 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics were extracted. Incidence of all‐cause mortality, hospitalizations, and invasive respiratory support was assessed between February 1 and August 14, 2020. Among patients with cancer, patients with COVID‐19 were more likely to be Non‐Hispanic black (NHB), have active cancer, have comorbidities, and/or live in zip codes with median household income <$30 000. Patients with COVID‐19 living in lower‐income areas and NHB patients were at greatest risk for hospitalization from pneumonia, fluid and electrolyte disorders, cough, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure and were more likely to receive hydroxychloroquine. All‐cause mortality, hospital admission, and invasive respiratory support were more frequent among patients with cancer and COVID‐19. Male sex, increasing age, living in zip codes with median household income <$30 000, history of pulmonary circulation disorders, and recent treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy were associated with greater odds of all‐cause mortality in multivariable logistic regression models. CONCLUSION: RWD can be rapidly leveraged to understand urgent healthcare challenges. Patients with cancer are more vulnerable to COVID‐19 effects, especially in the setting of active cancer and comorbidities, with additional risk observed in NHB patients and those living in zip codes with median household income <$30 000.","Hwang, Clara; Izano, Monika A.; Thompson, Michael A.; Gadgeel, Shirish M.; Weese, James L.; Mikkelsen, Tom; Schrag, Andrew; Teka, Mahder; Walters, Sheetal; Wolf, Frank M.; Hirsch, Jonathan; Rivera, Donna R.; Kluetz, Paul G.; Singh, Harpreet; Brown, Thomas D.",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34014037/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cnr2.1388,230
671509,Unexpected increase of the compliance rate of transfusion requisition form after the COVID-19 outbreak,2020-12-02,"Background : The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the fact that there are few effective anti-viral agents for treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Although the very recent development of vaccines is an extremely important breakthrough it remains unclear how long-lived such vaccines will be. The development of new agents therefore remains an important goal. Purpose : Given the multifaceted pathology of COVID-19, a combinatorial formulation may provide an effective treatment. BEN815, a natural nutraceutical composed of extracts from guava leaves (Psidium guajava L), green tea leaves (Camellia sinensis), and rose petals (Rosa hybrida), had previously shown to have a therapeutic effect on allergic rhinitis. We investigated whether BEN815 possesses anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antioxidant activities, since the combination of these effects could be useful for the treatment of COVID-19. Study design : We examined the anti-inflammatory effects of BEN815 and its principal active components quercetin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells and in an LPS-challenged mouse model of endotoxemia. We also assessed the antioxidant activity, and antiviral effect of BEN815, quercetin, and EGCG in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Methods : The principal active ingredients in BEN815 were determined using HPLC. Changes in the levels of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured by ELISA. Changes in the expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were analyzed using western blotting. Antioxidant assay was performed using DPPH and ABTS assay. SARS-CoV-2 replication was measured by immunofluorescence staining. Results : BEN815 significantly suppressed the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α as well as COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. In addition, BEN815 protected against LPS-challenged endotoxic shock in mice. Two major ingredients of BEN815, quercetin and EGCG, reduced the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α as well as COX-2 and iNOS synthase in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. BEN815, quercetin, and EGCG were also found to have antioxidant effects. Importantly, BEN815 and EGCG could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replications in Vero cells. Conclusion : BEN815 is an anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant natural agent that can be used to prevent and improve inflammation-related diseases, COVID-19.","Shin, Jin A.; Oh, Subin; Jeong, Jong-Moon",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667031321000403?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667031321000403,230
672126,Could Some Laboratory Parameters Predict Mortality in COVID-19?,2021,"In response to the COVID-19 crisis, governments worldwide have been formulating and implementing different strategies to mitigate its social and economic impacts. We study the household consumption responses to Japan’s COVID-19 unconditional cash transfer program. Owing to frequent delays in local governments’ administrative procedures, the timing of the payment to households varied unexpectedly. Using this natural experiment, we analyze households’ consumption responses to cash transfers using high-frequency data from personal finance management software that links detailed information on expenditure, income, and wealth. We construct three consumption measures: one captures the baseline marginal propensity to consume (MPC), and the other two are for the lower and the upper bound of MPC. Additionally, we explore heterogeneity in MPCs by household income, wealth, and population characteristics, as well as consumption categories. Our results show that households exhibit immediate and non-negligible positive responses in household expenditure. There is significant heterogeneity depending on various household characteristics, with liquidity constraint status being the most crucial factor, in line with the standard consumption theory. Additionally, this study provides policymakers with insights regarding targeted cash transfer programs, conditioning on labor income, and liquidity constraints.","Kaneda, Michiru; Kubota, So; Tanaka, Satoshi",Jpn Econ Rev (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188602/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42973-021-00080-0,230
672386,Perinatal Considerations in the Hospital Disaster Management Process,2015-12-16,"Viral surveillance programs or diagnostic labs occasionally obtain infectious samples that fail to be typed by available cell culture, serological, or nucleic acid tests. Five such samples, originating from insect pools, skunk brain, human feces and sewer effluent, collected between 1955 and 1980, resulted in pathology when inoculated into suckling mice. In this study, sequence-independent amplification of partially purified viral nucleic acids and small scale shotgun sequencing was used on mouse brain and muscle tissues. A single viral agent was identified in each sample. For each virus, between 16% to 57% of the viral genome was acquired by sequencing only 42–108 plasmid inserts. Viruses derived from human feces or sewer effluent belonged to the Picornaviridae family and showed between 80% to 91% amino acid identities to known picornaviruses. The complete polyprotein sequence of one virus showed strong similarity to a simian picornavirus sequence in the provisional Sapelovirus genus. Insects and skunk derived viral sequences exhibited amino acid identities ranging from 25% to 98% to the segmented genomes of viruses within the Reoviridae family. Two isolates were highly divergent: one is potentially a new species within the orthoreovirus genus, and the other is a new species within the orbivirus genus. We demonstrate that a simple, inexpensive, and rapid metagenomics approach is effective for identifying known and highly divergent new viruses in homogenized tissues of acutely infected mice.","Victoria, Joseph G.; Kapoor, Amit; Dupuis, Kent; Schnurr, David P.; Delwart, Eric L.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18818738/,230

Most of these technologies utilize redox-active transition metal compounds due to their rich chemistry and their beneficial physical and chemical properties for these types of applications. A century since its introduction, the concept of formal oxidation states (FOS) is still widely used for rationalization of the mechanisms of redox reactions, but there exists a well-documented discrepancy between FOS and the electron density-derived charge states of transition metal ions in their bulk and molecular compounds. We summarize our findings and those of others which suggest that density-driven descriptors are, in certain cases, better suited to characterize the mechanism of redox reactions, especially when anion redox is involved, which is the blind spot of the FOS ansatz.","Koch, Daniel; Chaker, Mohamed; Ihara, Manabu; Manzhos, Sergei",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577012/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185541,230

However, there is no sufficient evidence of adequate functioning of SRL dimensions such as environment structuring, goal setting, time management, help-seeking, task strategies, and self-evaluation in the MOOC environment. This study fills the gap in understanding the structure of SRL skills utilising the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire (OSLQ). The construct-related validity of the OSLQ is evaluated based on self-reported survey responses of 913 Russian MOOC learners with confirmatory factor analysis and criterion-related validity is checked with independent samples t-tests comparison. The results show that the original six-factor hierarchical model does not fit the data adequately. The evidence implies that the dimension ‘help-seeking’ is not effective in the MOOC environment. Therefore, a redefined five-factor hierarchical model of the OSLQ is suggested.","Vilkova, Kseniia; Shcheglova, Irina",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837233/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-020-10244-x,230

The full-face Decathlon snorkeling mask, EasyBreath(R) (EB(R) mask), has been adapted to deliver continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as an emergency respiratory interface. We aimed to assess the performance of this modified EB(R) mask. Methods: CPAP set at 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O was delivered to 10 healthy volunteers with a high-flow system generator set at 40, 80, and 120 L min-1 and with a turbine-driven ventilator during both spontaneous and loaded (resistor) breathing. Inspiratory CO2 partial pressure (PiCO2), pressure inside the mask, breathing pattern and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were measured at all combinations of CPAP/flows delivered, with and without the resistor. Results: Using the high-flow generator set at 40 L min-1, the PiCO2 significantly increased and the system was unable to maintain the target CPAP of 10 and 15 cmH2O and a stable pressure within the respiratory cycle; conversely, the turbine-driven ventilator did. EAdi significantly increased with flow rates of 40 and 80 L min-1 but not at 120 L min-1 and with the turbine-driven ventilator. Conclusions: EB(R) mask can be safely used to deliver CPAP only under strict constraints, using either a high-flow generator at a flow rate greater than 80 L min-1, or a high-performance turbine-driven ventilator.","Noto, A.; Crimi, C.; Cortegiani, A.; Giardina, M.; Benedetto, F.; Princi, P.; Carlucci, A.; Appendini, L.; Gregoretti, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.28.20221317v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221317,230

It is equivalent to a secure, distributed database query and has many practical applications in privacy preserving and data sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum private set intersection cardinality based on Bloom filter, which can resist the quantum attack. It is a completely novel constructive protocol for computing the intersection cardinality by using Bloom filter. The protocol uses single photons, so it only need to do some simple single-photon operations and tests. Thus it is more likely to realize through the present technologies. The validity of the protocol is verified by comparing with other protocols. The protocol implements privacy protection without increasing the computational complexity and communication complexity, which are independent with data scale. Therefore, the protocol has a good prospects in dealing with big data, privacy-protection and information-sharing, such as the patient contact for COVID-19.","Liu, Bai; Ruan, Ou; Shi, Runhua; Zhang, Mingwu",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462472/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96770-1,230

In this work, we sought to establish if and to what extent the response of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies BNT162b2 booster measured with four different commercial immunoassays could be predicted after initial homologous vaccination. METHODS: This observational study enrolled 181 SARS-CoV-2 baseline seronegative healthcare workers (mean age 42±13 years; 59.7% females), who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. Antibodies levels were assessed with Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S, ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG II, Snibe S-RBD IgG and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG. The correlation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies 21 days after the first vaccine dose and 30 days after the second was assessed with Pearson's test. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies levels after the first (T1) and second (T2) BNT162b2 vaccine doses with all immunoassays, though the strength of such association depended on the immunoassay. Briefly, the highest correlation was found for LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (r=0.71), followed by ACCESS SARS-CoV-2 IgG II (r=0.65), Snibe S-RBD IgG (r=0.52), and then Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (r=0.40).

During infection, the accumulation and activation of macrophages and monocytes in the lungs induce inflammatory mediators and contribute to tissue injury, leading to ARDS. However, therapeutic strategies that directly target activated macrophage and monocytes have not been reported. Combination treatment with etoposide (a cytotoxic agent) and a corticosteroid has been widely used for treating hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis characterized by the systemic activation of macrophages with overwhelming inflammation. Herein, we present five cases of COVID-19-associated ARDS treated with etoposide and corticosteroids. Three of the five patients were over 65 years of age and had various underlying diseases, including multiple myeloma. Four patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), and one patient refused to be placed on MV due to underlying diseases. All patients were pre-treated with antiviral and/or other anti-inflammatory agents, but their condition deteriorated and hyperinflammation was noted. All five patients responded well to treatment and had an immediate response, as reflected by improvement in their respiratory condition and inflammatory marker levels and rapid resolution of fever after etoposide administration; however, some patients required a second dose of etoposide and longer course of steroids. All patients recovered, and there were no severe adverse events related to the drugs.

The products of these ISGs exert numerous antiviral effector functions, many of which are still not fully described. Recent efforts have been aimed at identifying which ISGs are antiviral and further characterizing their mechanisms of action. IFN effectors vary widely in their magnitude of inhibitory activity and display combinatorial antiviral properties. Collectively, ISGs can target almost any step in a virus life cycle. Some of the most potent antiviral effectors reinforce the system by further inducing IFN or ISGs. Other genes enhance or facilitate viral replication, suggesting that some viruses may have evolved to co-opt IFN effectors for a survival advantage.","Schoggins, John W.; Rice, Charles M.",Current Opinion in Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2011.10.008; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3274382?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22328912/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625711001271; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625711001271,230

The predictive value of PAB was evaluated by measuring the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Patients were defined as severely or critically ill based on the Guidance for COVID-19 (7th edition) by the National Health Commission of China. During this analysis, 316 patients had severe cases and 65 had critical cases. A reduced PAB level was associated with a higher risk of mortality and a longer hospital stay. The AUROC curve for the prognosis based on the PAB level was 0.93, with sensitivity of 97.2% and specificity of 77.6%. For severe cases, a lower level of PAB was associated with a higher risk of malnutrition, higher NK cell counts, and lower B lymphocyte counts; these factors were not significant in critical cases.

Our study objective was to assess practices of safe injection techniques and to determine predictors of SSP utilization in a rural state. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a fifteen-month cross-sectional study of participants hospitalized with IDU-associated infections in Maine. Data were collected through Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview survey and medical record review. Descriptive analyses were performed to characterize demographics, health characteristics, and injection practices. The primary outcome was SSP utilization, and the main independent variable was self-reported distance to SSP. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated SSP utilization, controlling for gender, homelessness, history of overdose, having a primary care physician and distance to SSP. RESULTS: Of the 101 study participants, 65 participants (64%) reported past 3 month SSP utilization, though only 33% used SSPs frequently. Many participants (57%) lived more than 10 miles from an SSP. Participants who lived less than 10 miles of an SSP were more likely to use an SSP (adjusted odds ratio 5.4; 95% CI 1.9–15.7). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights unsafe injection practices and lack of frequent SSP utilization among people admitted with IDU-associated infections in a rural state. Especially given increasing stimulant use, these results also highlight the need for SSP access.

Intergenerational programs provide a great opportunity for older adults to connect with people of other generations. Many studies have reported the beneficial effects of these programs, improving the mental and physical health of the elderly and contributing to better academic formation and social skills in children. The aim of this study was to examine the benefits, satisfaction, and limitations of the intergenerational interactions derived from the performance of face-to-face activities, such as daily and healthcare activities, educational, cultural and leisure activities, and physical or sport activities. Participants were subjects living in Spain of any age (grouped into three age groups: <22, 22–40, and >40 years old) and from different social groups who completed an electronic 88-item questionnaire. The analysis of sociodemographic variables of the survey respondents revealed that people aged 40 or more, with personal autonomy, single or married, and living with a partner and/or other relative, and not retired, performed face-to-face activities with people of other generations with a significantly higher frequency than the rest of the groups for each variable. Most participants who participated in intergenerational face-to-face activities reported benefits to their physical and mental health, mood, relationships, self-determination, social participation, and academic education. Most participants were quite or very satisfied with the person with whom they performed this type of activities, especially if this person was a friend or a close relative. Except for grandparents, people who participated in intergenerational face-to-face activities and who had no limitations or disabilities were more frequently reported by the participants. In conclusion, intergenerational interactions derived from the performance of face-to-face activities can contribute to improve both the physical and mental health, social skills, and relationships of all people involved.","Canedo-García, Alejandro; García-Sánchez, Jesús-Nicasio; Díaz-Prieto, Cristina; Pacheco-Sanz, Deilis-Ivonne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574603/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189683,230

However, prevailing standards in this respect are mostly empirical and arbitrary. As an alternative, we focus on a novel approach which configures indicators that evaluate topological threats to populations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We extended the current PzDom model to calculate a threshold of the model for accelerated growth, an indicator of growth extent Re(v), covariance Re(s), a topological number E(l), and expected sums of possibly increasing numbers of infected people. We term this the exPzDom model. RESULTS The indicators in the exPzDom model adhere well to the empirical dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infected people and align appropriately with actual policies instituted by the Japanese government. CONCLUSIONS The described indicators could be leveraged pursuant of objective evaluation based on mathematics. Further testing of the reliability and robustness of exPzDom model in other pandemic contexts is warranted.","Adachi, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.20116491; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.29.20116491v1?rss=1,230

Findings from this study have implications for all American youth as they return to public school from mandated schooling at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Database engines identified over 22,000 articles with 82 abstracts screened for further review. Of these, 18 full-text articles were additionally screened with 10 cross-sectional articles included in the final review. Articles were condensed into a standard review template and findings were summarized by topic. RESULTS Cardiovascular endurance findings were inconsistent. Abdominal, but not upper body, muscular strength and endurance were significantly lower in homeschool students. There were no reports on flexibility. Body composition was generally healthy in homeschool students and no differences in physical activity were seen. CONCLUSIONS Research on health-related physical fitness in homeschool youth is limited and descriptive. Further testing and potential remediation may be needed for cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance, and flexibility in homeschool youth and their public school counterparts as they return to campus.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study on observational data. In Germany, summer school holidays are coordinated between states and spread out over 13 weeks. Employing a dynamic model with district fixed effects, we analyze the association between these holidays and weekly incidence rates across 401 German districts. RESULTS: We find effects of the holiday period of around 45% of the average district incidence rates in Germany during their respective final week of holidays and the 2 weeks after holidays end. Western states tend to experience stronger effects than Eastern states. We also find statistically significant interaction effects of school holidays with per capita taxable income and the share of foreign residents in a district’s population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that changed behavior during the holiday season accelerated the pandemic and made it considerably more difficult for public health authorities to contain the spread of the virus by means of contact tracing.

While there are reports on pharmaceutical substances of SJZD focusing on its polysaccharides, the composition of non-polysaccharides (NPSs) has not yet been holistically clarified. In the current study, offline two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (2DLC-QTOF-MS/MS) was used for comprehensive NPS chemical profiling of SJZD. In addition, the MS-network of SJZD was proposed, which led to the construction of a larger in-house chemical library and accelerated qualitative processing. Four hundred forty-nine components, among which 6 were potentially novel, and 32 were confirmed by standard substances, were identified or tentatively assigned. Furthermore, based on good method validation, 19 representative components were simultaneously quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole linear ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTRAP(®)-MS/MS). They were selected for quantification on the account of their bioactive reports on in vivo or in vitro activities, the peak intensity in the mass spectrum, and characteristic structures, which have the potential to be qualitative or quantitative markers of SJZD. The present work furthers understanding of the pharmacological effects and action mechanism of NPSs in SJZD, and provides a useful analytical approach for complex composition research of TCMs. [Image: see text] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00216-021-03302-x.","Dong, Bangjian; Peng, Chongsheng; Ma, Ping; Li, Xiaobo",Anal Bioanal Chem,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03302-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851227/,230

Priority setting is always present in healthcare systems and depends on the theory of justice applicable in each society. Resource rationing has been necessary in the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore consensus documents have been published for decision-making based on four fundamental ethical values: maximization of benefits, treating people equally, contributing to creating social value and giving priority to the worst off, from which specific recommendations derive: maximize benefits; prioritize health workers; do not prioritize attendance on a first-COme, first-served basis; be sensitive to scientific evidence; recognize participation in research and apply the same principles to COVID-19 patients as to non-COVID-19 patients.","Martin-Fumadó, Carles; Gómez-Durán, Esperanza L.; Morlans-Molina, Màrius",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2445424920300224; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2445424920300224,230

It has affected a significant proportion of the global population both physically and mentally, and destroyed businesses and societies. Current evidence suggested that immunopathology may be responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages, reduced or delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) response, antibody-dependent enhancement, and especially, cytokine storm (CS). The CS is characterized by hyperproduction of an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines and is closely associated with poor prognosis. These excessively secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines initiate different inflammatory signaling pathways via their receptors on immune and tissue cells, resulting in complicated medical symptoms including fever, capillary leak syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure, ultimately leading to death in the most severe cases. Therefore, it is clinically important to understand the initiation and signaling pathways of CS to develop more effective treatment strategies for COVID-19. Herein, we discuss the latest developments in the immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 and focus on CS including the current research status of the different cytokines involved. We also discuss the induction, function, downstream signaling, and existing and potential interventions for targeting these cytokines or related signal pathways. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of CS in COVID-19 will help to develop better strategies to effectively control immunopathology in this disease and other infectious and inflammatory diseases.","Yang, Lan; Xie, Xueru; Tu, Zikun; Fu, Jinrong; Xu, Damo; Zhou, Yufeng",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234112/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00679-0,230

Cells are reproducers that not only replicate their genome but also reproduce the cellular organization that depends on semipermeable, energy-transforming membranes and cannot be recovered from the genome alone, under the famous dictum of Rudolf Virchow, Omnis cellula e cellula. In contrast, simple selfish elements are replicators that can complete their life cycles within the host cell starting from genomic RNA or DNA alone. The origin of the cellular organization is the central and perhaps the hardest problem of evolutionary biology. I argue that the origin of cells can be understood only in conjunction with the origin and evolution of selfish genetic elements. A scenario of precellular evolution is presented that involves cohesion of the genomes of the emerging cellular life forms from primordial pools of small genetic elements that eventually segregated into hosts and parasites. I further present a model of the coevolution of primordial membranes and membrane proteins, discuss protocellular and non-cellular models of early evolution, and examine the habitats on the primordial earth that could have been conducive to precellular evolution and the origin of cells.","Koonin, Eugene V.",Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10482-014-0169-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24756907/,230

A LED-device emitting a special combination of frequencies in the visible light spectrum was tested on SARS-CoV-2 infected cell surnatant dilutions in order to evaluate the antiviral efficacy. This preliminary in vitro study showed for the first time the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 through LED irradiation of visible spectrum wavelengths.

Often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that different epidemics can exhibit, even when they have the same R(0). Here, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory to forecast the size of an epidemic using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R(0) and the underlying heterogeneity. Importantly, epidemics with lower R(0) can be larger if they spread more homogeneously (and are therefore more robust to stochastic fluctuations). We illustrate the potential of this approach using different real epidemics with known estimates for R(0), heterogeneity and epidemic size in the absence of significant intervention. Further, we discuss the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R(0).","Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent; Althouse, Benjamin M.; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Allard, Antoine",J R Soc Interface,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143594/,230

This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. Thus, our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host specificity of coronaviruses reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift.","Smith, C. S.; de Jong, C.

We aim to investigate the effect of the pandemic on computed tomography (CT) imaging of cancer. Methods: Cancer-related CT exams were retrospectively analyzed during three periods of 2020: pre-COVID (1/5/20-3/14/20), COVID peak (3/15/20-5/2/20) and post-COVID peak (5/3/20-11/14/20). Volumes were assessed by 1) Imaging indication: cancer screening, initial workup, active cancer, surveillance;2) Care setting: outpatient, inpatient, ED;3) Hospital type: quaternary academic center (QAC), university-affiliated community hospital (UACH), sole community hospitals (SCHs). Results: During the COVID peak, a significant drop in CT volumes was observed (-42·2%, p<0·0001), with cancer screening, initial workup, active cancer and cancer surveillance experiencing declines by 81·7%, 54·8%, 30·7% and 44·7% respectively (p<0·0001, Figure 1). The emergency department (ED) was the only setting with stable cancer-related CT volumes. In the post-COVID peak period, CT volumes for cancer screening and for initial workup did not recover (-11·7%, p=0·037;-20·0%, p=0·031), with the outpatient setting particularly affected. CT volumes for active cancer recovered post-peak, but inconsistently across hospital types with the QAC experiencing a 9·4% decline (p=0·022) and the UACH a 41·5% increase (p<0·001). Outpatient CTs recovered during the post-peak period, but a shift in utilization away from the QAC (-8·7%, p=0·020) toward the UACH (+13·3%, p=0·013) was observed. Inpatient and ED-based cancer-related CTs increased post-peak (+20·0%, p=0·004 and +33·2%, p=0·009, respectively). Conclusions: COVID severely impacted cancer imaging care. CTs for cancer screening and initial workup did not recover to pre-COVID levels well into 2020, a finding that suggests higher numbers of patients with advanced cancers may present in the future. A redistribution of imaging utilization away from the QAC and outpatient settings, toward the community hospitals and inpatient setting/ED was observed.

To uncover the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, we here develop a robust ribonucleoprotein (RNP) capture protocol and identify 109 host factors that directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Applying RNP capture on another coronavirus HCoV-OC43 revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between coronaviral RNAs and host proteins. Transcriptome analyses and knockdown experiments delineated 17 antiviral RBPs including ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, PARP12, and SHFL and 8 proviral RBPs such as EIF3D and CSDE1 which are responsible for co-opting multiple steps of the mRNA life cycle. This also led to the identification of LARP1, a downstream target of the mTOR signaling pathway, as an antiviral host factor that interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs.

689500,Factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in patients with multiple sclerosis: A systematic review,2021-06-15,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 pandemic has been verified as a public health emergency of international concern. During the special period, the health of vulnerable groups, such as children with autism, should be concerned. Some studies have been carried out to investigate the behavioral problems of children with autism during the COVID-19, but underlying mechanisms behind it is not clear. This study examines the role of parenting stress as a mediator in the relationship between parental self-efficacy and behavioral problems in Chinese children as well as the role of perceived social support as a moderator for this mediation effect. METHODS: A total of 439 parents of children with autism (mean age=40.17, SD=5.26) were surveyed and completed five questionnaires (Conners Parent Symptom Questionnaire, Parental Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Parenting Stress Index-Short Form 15, Perceived Social Support Questionnaire, and Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory). The statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS 26.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro. RESULTS: Controlling for neuroticism, which is highly associated with psychological changes in parents, the study found that parental self-efficacy was significantly and negatively correlated with behavioral problems in children with autism. In addition, the relationship between parental self-efficacy and behavioral problems was mediated by parenting stress. Furthermore, parenting stress moderated the indirect relationship between parental self-efficacy and behavioral problems via perceived social support. CONCLUSION: These results provide direct evidences for the inextricable relationship between family, social factors and behavioral problems of children with autism. It suggest that improving perceived social support to enhance parental self-efficacy is critical to buffering against parenting stress and stabilizing children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Shu Dan; Yu, Yun; Li, Xing Kai; Chen, Sui Qing; Ren, Jie",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s327377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429669/,230
689514,Physical Exercise Moderates the Effects of Disability on Depression in People with Multiple Sclerosis during the COVID-19 Outbreak,2021-03-16,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic human alphaherpesvirus that causes varicella upon primary infection, establishes latency in multiple ganglionic neurons, and can reactivate to cause zoster. Live attenuated VZV vaccines are available; however, they can also establish latent infections and reactivate. Studies of VZV latency have been limited to the analyses of human ganglia removed at autopsy, as the virus is strictly a human pathogen. Recently, terminally differentiated human neurons have received much attention as a means to study the interaction between VZV and human neurons; however, the short life-span of these cells in culture has limited their application. Herein, we describe the construction of a model of normal human neural progenitor cells (NHNP) in tissue-like assemblies (TLAs), which can be successfully maintained for at least 180 days in three-dimensional (3D) culture, and exhibit an expression profile similar to that of human trigeminal ganglia. Infection of NHNP TLAs with cell-free VZV resulted in a persistent infection that was maintained for three months, during which the virus genome remained stable. Immediate-early, early and late VZV genes were transcribed, and low-levels of infectious VZV were recurrently detected in the culture supernatant. Our data suggest that NHNP TLAs are an effective system to investigate long-term interactions of VZV with complex assemblies of human neuronal cells.","Goodwin, Thomas J.; McCarthy, Maureen; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Cohrs, Randall J.; Kaufer, Benedikt B.",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23935496/,230

The rapidly spreading B.1.617 lineage harbors two key mutations—L452R and E484Q—in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike (S) protein. To understand the impact and structural dynamics of the variations in the interface of S protein and its host factor, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), triplicate 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed using single (E484Q or L452R) and double (E484Q + L452R) mutant structures and compared to wild type simulations. Our results indicate that the E484Q mutation disrupts the conserved salt bridge formed between Lys31 of hACE2 and Glu484 of S protein. Additionally, E484Q, which could favor the up conformation of the RBD, may help in enhanced hACE2 binding and immune escape. L452R introduces a charged patch near the binding surface that permits increased electrostatic attraction between the proteins. An improved network of intramolecular interactions observed is likely to increase the stability of the S protein and conformational changes may prevent the binding of neutralizing antibodies. The results obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that structural and dynamic changes introduced by these variations enhance the affinity of the viral S protein to hACE2 and could form the basis for further studies.","Antony, Priya; Vijayan, Ranjit",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439910/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081244,230
