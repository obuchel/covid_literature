158,Virus Adaptation by Manipulation of Host's Gene Expression,2008-06-11,"Viruses adapt to their hosts by evading defense mechanisms and taking over cellular metabolism for their own benefit. Alterations in cell metabolism as well as side-effects of antiviral responses contribute to symptoms development and virulence. Sometimes, a virus may spill over from its usual host species into a novel one, where usually will fail to successfully infect and further transmit to new host. However, in some cases, the virus transmits and persists after fixing beneficial mutations that allow for a better exploitation of the new host. This situation would represent a case for a new emerging virus. Here we report results from an evolution experiment in which a plant virus was allowed to infect and evolve on a naïve host. After 17 serial passages, the viral genome has accumulated only five changes, three of which were non-synonymous. An amino acid substitution in the viral VPg protein was responsible for the appearance of symptoms, whereas one substitution in the viral P3 protein the epistatically contributed to exacerbate severity. DNA microarray analyses show that the evolved and ancestral viruses affect the global patterns of host gene expression in radically different ways. A major difference is that genes involved in stress and pathogen response are not activated upon infection with the evolved virus, suggesting that selection has favored viral strategies to escape from host defenses.","Agudelo-Romero, Patricia; Carbonell, Pablo; Perez-Amador, Miguel A.; Elena, Santiago F.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2398778/,668
11152,Die Urologie wird elektrisch – Elektrotherapie: Moderne Therapien zur Behandlung moderner Erkrankungen – Beispiele aus der Urologie,2020-03-03,"Across Latin America, increasing access to mental health care has become a priority. Management of common mental disorders is shifting to primary care, and community mental health centers (CMHCs) are being established to treat severe needs. In urban migrant communities on the outskirts of Trujillo, Peru, five new CMHCs have been built to treat complex mental health concerns, partially in response to high rates of domestic violence and child maltreatment. However, psychologists have no training in the treatment of interpersonal trauma. This study sought to determine the utility of such a training and identify areas for cultural adaptation. Six focus groups were conducted with CMHC psychologists. Findings revealed that, while a culturally-adapted training in trauma-focused treatment is desired, sociocultural barriers to ensuring the physical and psychological safety of the service user must be considered, as well as provider barriers including short treatment packages, insufficient physical infrastructure, and unstable work conditions.","Kohrt, Brieanne K.; Murray, Maxwell P.; Cabel Salinas, Lourdes",Community Ment Health J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223220/,668

15539,Diagnostic performance of antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2,2021-02-22,"BACKGROUND: Telomeres undergo shortening with each cell division, which could be accelerated by infection. The association between virus infection and telomere length is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the putative associations between leukocyte telomere length (TL), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a national representative sample of noninstitutionalized population. METHODS: We analyzed data that was collected in a cross-sectional setting, where 3,987 participants were enrolled with available data on telomere length. The association between telomere length with previous CMV infection and CRP was analyzed using multivariable linear regression models. We further tested if obesity, measured by body mass index (BMI), and smoking could modify this relationship. RESULTS: In total, around 46% percent of the study population were men and 54% were women. Average ages were 35.1 years for men and 35.0 years for women. One unit increase of CMV antibody IgG titer was associated with -0.07 (95% confidence interval: -0.12, -0.01) unit decrease of leukocyte TL when sex was adjusted for. After additionally adjusting for BMI and smoking status, the magnitude of the association was only slightly decreased to -0.06 (95% confidence interval: -0.11, -0.01). The effect sizes were comparable after additionally adjusting for CRP. These analyses imply that previous CMV infection affects leukocyte TL through pathways other than CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Previous CMV infection was associated with shorter leukocyte TL. This association was independent of CRP.","Lin, Zhu; Gao, Hongmei; Wang, Bing; Wang, Yongqiang",Mediators Inflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7899777/,668
18568,"Messenger RNA expressing PfCSP induces functional, protective immune responses against malaria in mice",2021-06-18,"Type I interferons (IFNs) play a crucial role in the establishment of an antiviral state via signaling through their cognate type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). In this study, a replication-competent but highly attenuated strain of VSV (rVSVΔm51) carrying a deletion at position 51 of the matrix protein to remove suppression of anti-viral type I IFN responses was used to explore the effect of disrupted IFNAR signaling on inflammatory cytokine responses in mice. The kinetic responses of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-12 were evaluated in virus-infected male and female mice with or without concomitant antibody-mediated IFNAR-blockade. Unlike controls, both male and female IFNAR-blocked mice showed signs of sickness by 24-hours post-infection. Female IFNAR-blocked mice experienced greater morbidity as demonstrated by a significant decrease in body temperature. This was not the case for males. In addition, females with IFNAR-blockade mounted prolonged and exaggerated systemic inflammatory cytokine responses to rVSVΔm51. This was in stark contrast to controls with intact IFNAR signaling and males with IFNAR-blockade; they were able to down-regulate virus-induced inflammatory cytokine responses by 24-hours post-infection. Exaggerated cytokine responses in females with impaired IFNAR signaling was associated with more effective control of viremia than their male counterparts. However, the trade-off was greater immune-mediated morbidity. The results of this study demonstrated a role for IFNAR signaling in the down-regulation of antiviral cytokine responses, which was strongly influenced by sex. Our findings suggested that the potential to mount toxic cytokine responses to a virus with concomitant disruption of IFNAR signaling was heavily biased towards females.","Darzianiazizi, Maedeh; Allison, Katrina E.; Kulkarni, Raveendra R.; Sharif, Shayan; Karimi, Khalil; Bridle, Byram W.",Cytokine X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215187/,668

Wo gehen wir hin?",2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Infectious morbidity and mortality in the first week of life is commonly caused by early-onset neonatal Group B streptococcus (GBS) disease. This infection is spread from GBS positive mothers to neonates by vertical transmission during delivery and results in serious illness for newborns. Intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics have decreased the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS disease by 80%. Patients labeled with a penicillin allergy (PcnA) alternatively receive either vancomycin or clindamycin but effectiveness is controversial. We evaluated the influence of a reported PcnA label versus no PcnA label on inpatient maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: Our goal was to examine the relationship between a PcnA label, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and hospital costs. We collected retrospective data with institutional IRB approval from 2016 – 2018 for hospitalized patients who were GBS positive, pregnant at time of admission, ≥ 18 years of age, received antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS, were labeled as PcnA or non-PcnA, and completed a vaginal delivery. Patient characteristics and maternal/neonatal outcomes were examined. Statistical tests included calculations of means, medians, proportions, Mann–Whitney, two-sample t-tests, Chi-squared or Fisher’s Exact tests, and generalized linear and logistic regression models. Significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Most PcnA patients were white, older, had a higher median body mass index and mean heart rate, and a greater proportion used tobacco than non-PcnA patients. In regression analyses, PcnA hospitalized patients received a shorter duration of antibiotic treatment than non-PcnA patients [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.45, 95% CI: 0.38–0.53]. PcnA patients were also more likely to have their baby’s hospital LOS be > 48 h [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.35, 95% CI: 1.07–1.69] even though the PcnA mothers’ LOS was not different from non-PcnA mothers. Cost of care, mortality, intensive care, median parity, mean gravidity, and miscarriage were similar between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized obstetric patients, a PcnA label was associated with a shorter maternal course of antibiotic treatment and a longer neonatal LOS. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify the underlying reasons for these outcomes.","Kirven, Justin; Beddow, David; Patel, Love; Smith, Claire; Booker, Katherine S.; Dawud, Barite; St. Hill, Catherine A.",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313667/,668
23414,Systematic Biophysical Insights into the Interaction of Anti MERS-CoV Drug Ribavirin with Major Transport Protein in Human Serum: In-Vitro Studies and Implications in Diabetes and Uremia,2019-02-15,"BACKGROUND: Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) causes common cold, and is associated with severe respiratory symptoms in infants, elderly and immunocompromised patients. HCoV-OC43 is a member of Betacoronavirus genus that includes also the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses. However, the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonise the intracellular antiviral defences has not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of HCoV-OC43 structural (membrane and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ns5a and ns2a) proteins in the modulation of antiviral gene expression profile in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells using PCR array analysis. METHODS: HCoV-OC43 membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), ns5a and ns2a mRNA were amplified and cloned into the pAcGFP1-N expression vector (Clontech), followed by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Expression of M, N, ns5a and ns2a proteins were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence test. Three days post-transfection, the cells were challenged by Sendai virus. The Human Antiviral Response PCR array system (Qiagen) was used to profile the antiviral gene expression in HEK-293 cells, using the fold regulation comparison and the manual normalisation methods. RESULTS: Around 50–60 genes were downregulated by HCoV-OC43 proteins, the most prominent genes being those critical for the activation of transcription factors involved in the antiviral response like interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Among the most important downregulated genes were those coding for Interferons (IFNs) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), pro-apoptotic and pyroptotic proteins (Caspases, cathepsins, tumour necrosis factor), pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukins), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors) and their signaling transduction proteins (TICAM1, MAVS). CONCLUSION: This study shows for the first time that similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 has the ability to downregulate the transcription of genes critical for the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.

36775,End-to-End Formal Verification of Ethereum 2.0 Deposit Smart Contract,2020-06-13,"Image segmentation is an essential step in image processing and computer vision with many image segmentation algorithms having been proposed in the literature. Among these, clustering is one of the prominent approaches to achieve segmentation. Traditional clustering algorithms have been used extensively for this purpose, although they have disadvantages such as dependence on initialisation conditions and a tendency to find only local optima. To overcome these disadvantages, population-based metaheuristic algorithms can be applied. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm based on human mental search (HMS) for image segmentation. HMS is a relatively new population-based metaheuristic inspired from the manner of searching in online auctions. HMS comprises three operators: mental search, which explores the neighbourhood of candidate solutions using Levy flight; grouping, which clusters candidate solutions; and moving candidate solutions towards a promising area. To verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we conduct several experiments based on different criteria including mean cost function value, statistical analysis and image segmentation criteria. The obtained results confirm superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to competitors.","Mousavirad, Seyed Jalaleddin; Schaefer, Gerald; Ebrahimpour-Komleh, Hossein; Korovin, Iakov",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354825/,668

39479,"Estimated prevalence and viral transmissibility in subjects with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Wuhan, China",2020-09-04,"CONTEXT: Preliminary data on coexistence of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLH) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in critically ill children with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging. Herein, we summarize the available literature and fill-in the gaps in this regard. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We have performed a literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till May 12, 2020, with following keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “HLH”, “HScore”, “coagulopathy”, “D-dimer”, “cytokine storm”, “children” and “pediatrics” with interposition of Boolean operator “AND”. RESULTS: Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use ‘high D-dimer’ (> 3 µg/mL) instead of ‘low fibrinogen’ to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution. CONCLUSIONS: HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression. Children with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, especially those with documented thrombocytopenia or chilblains, should be regularly monitored for coagulopathy.","Bhattacharjee, Sukrita; Banerjee, Mainak; Pal, Rimesh",Indian Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498551/,668

Mounting evidence suggests that exosomes participate in intercellular communication and act as important molecular vehicles in the regulation of numerous physiological and pathological processes, including cancer development. Exosomes are released by various cell types under both normal and pathological conditions, and they can be found in multiple bodily fluids. Moreover, exosomes carrying a wide variety of important macromolecules provide a window into altered cellular or tissue states. Their presence in biological fluids renders them an attractive, minimally invasive approach for liquid biopsies with potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prediction, and surveillance. Due to their biocompatibility and low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, exosomes have potential clinical applications in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Here, we summarize recent advances in various technologies for exosome isolation for cancer research.

Involvement of AYAs in treatment decisions might support adherence to medical treatment. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the involvement of AYAs, aged 15 to 20 years, in cancer treatment decision making (TDM). METHODS Using interpretive focused ethnography, we conducted interviews with 16 AYAs (total of 31 interviews) receiving cancer treatment within 1 year of diagnosis. Participants reflected on a major recent TDM experience (eg, clinical trial, surgery) and other treatment decisions. RESULTS Participants distinguished important major cancer treatment decisions from minor supportive care decisions. We identified 3 common dimensions related to AYAs' involvement in cancer TDM: (1) becoming experienced with cancer, (2) import of the decision, and (3) decision-making roles. The preferences of AYAs for participation in TDM varied over time and by type of decision. We have proposed a 3-dimensional model to illustrate how these dimensions might interact to portray TDM during the first year of cancer treatment for AYAs. CONCLUSIONS As AYAs accumulate experience in making decisions, their TDM preferences might evolve at different rates depending on whether the decisions are perceived to be minor or major. Parents played a particularly important supportive role in TDM for AYA participants. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Clinicians should consider the AYAs' preferences and the role they want to assume in making different decisions in order to support and encourage involvement in their TDM and care.","Pyke-Grimm, Kimberly A; Franck, Linda S; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie; Goldsby, Robert E; Rehm, Roberta S",Cancer nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0000000000000820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084293/,668

The Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) simulator allows for objective assessment of laparoscopic skills. This study aimed to determine whether the fundamental laparoscopic skills of incoming surgery residents have improved. METHODS The initial FLS performance of first-year residents between 2003 and 2008 was identified from a prospective database. Linear regression was used to determine the effect of incoming year on performance of the five FLS simulator tasks (peg transfer, pattern cut, endoloop placement, suture with an extracorporeal knot [EC], suture with an intracorporeal knot [IC]) and the total score. Statistical significance was defined as a p value less than 0.05. RESULTS A total of 63 first-year residents were identified from the database. The total FLS scores improved over time (r = 0.39; p = 0.001). The scores for peg transfer did not change significantly, but the scores for pattern cutting (r = 0.37; p = 0.002), endoloop placement (r = 0.36; p = 0.004), suture with EC (r = 0.32; p = 0.02), and suture with IC (r = 0.26; p = 0.03) all improved significantly over the 5 years.

83092,A Fixed Cohort Field Study of Gene Expression in Circulating Leukocytes From Dairy Cows With and Without Mastitis.,2020,"Soil acidification is one of the crucial global environmental problems, affecting sustainable land use, crop yield, and ecosystem stability. Previous research reported the tolerance of crops to acid soil stress. However, the molecular response of woody plant to acid conditions remains largely unclear. Rhododendron L. is a widely distributed woody plant genus and prefers to grow in acidic soils. Herein, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was performed on R. protistum var. giganteum seedlings subjected to five pH treatments (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0), and their ecophysiological characteristics were determined for the identification of their molecular responses to acidic environments. Through pairwise comparison, 855 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with photosynthesis, cell wall, and phenylpropanoid metabolism were identified. Most of the DEGs related to photosynthesis and cell wall were up-regulated after pH 4.5 treatment. Results implied that the species improves its photosynthetic abilities and changes its cell wall characteristics to adapt to acidic conditions. Weighted gene co-expression network analyses showed that most of the hub genes were annotated to the biosynthetic pathways of ribosomal proteins and photosynthesis. Expression pattern analysis showed that genes encoding subunit ribosomal proteins decreased at pH 7.0 treatment, suggesting that pH 7.0 treatment led to cell injury in the seedlings. The species regulates protein synthesis in response to high pH stress (pH 7.0). The present study revealed the molecular response mechanism of woody plant R. protistum var. giganteum to acid environments. These findings can be useful in enriching current knowledge of how woody species adapt to soil acidification under global environmental changes.","Zhou, Xiong-Li; Wang, Yue-Hua; Shen, Shi-Kang",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888586/,668

Across all VHA facilities, as the HIT focused on cirrhosis between 2018-2019, HCC surveillance rates increased from 46% (IQR 37-53%) to 51% (IQR 42-60%, p < 0.001). The median HCC surveillance rate was 57% in facilities with high ALD Dashboard utilization compared with 45% in facilities with lower utilization (p < 0.001) and 58% in facilities using the HCC Clinical Reminder compared with 47% in facilities not using this tool (p < 0.001) in FY19. Increased use of the ALD Dashboard and adoption of the HCC Clinical Reminder were independently, significantly associated with HCC surveillance rates in multivariate models, controlling for other facility characteristics. In conclusion, the VHA's HIT Collaborative is a national healthcare initiative associated with significant improvement in HCC surveillance rates.","Rogal, Shari S; Yakovchenko, Vera; Gonzalez, Rachel; Park, Angela; Beste, Lauren A; Rozenberg-Ben-Dror, Karine; Bajaj, Jasmohan S; Scott, Dawn; McCurdy, Heather; Comstock, Emily; Sidorovic, Michael; Gibson, Sandra; Lamorte, Carolyn; Nobbe, Anna; Chartier, Maggie; Ross, David; Dominitz, Jason A; Morgan, Timothy R",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13092251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067177/,668
88467,Saliva Tests Comparable With Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.,2021-03-09,"The need for new drugs to treat microbial infections is pressing. The great progress made in the middle part of the twentieth Century was followed by a period of relative inactivity as the medical needs relating to infectious disease in the wealthier nations receded. Growing realisation that anti-infectives are needed in many parts of the world, to treat neglected diseases as well as to combat the burgeoning risk of resistance to existing drugs, has galvanised a new wave of research into anti-microbial drugs. The transfer of knowledge from the Pharmaceutical industry relating to the importance of understanding how to target drugs successfully within the body, and improved understanding of how pathogens interact with their hosts, is driving a series of new paradigms in anti-infective drug design. Here we provide an overview of those processes as an introduction to a series of articles from experts in this area that emerged from a meeting entitled ""Emerging Paradigms in Anti-Infective Drug Design"" held in London on the 17th and 18th September 2012. The symposium was organised jointly by British Society for Parasitology (BSP) and the Biological & Medicinal Chemistry sector of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and held at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The symposium set out to cover all aspects of the identification of new therapeutic modalities for the treatment of neglected and tropical diseases. We aimed to bring together leading scientists from all the disciplines working in this field and cover the pharmacology, medicinal chemistry and drug delivery of potential new medicines. Sessions were held on: ""Target diseases and targets for drugs"", ""Target based medicinal chemistry"", ""Bioavailability and chemistry"", ""Targeting intracellular microbes"", ""Alternative approaches and models"", and ""New anti-infectives - how do we get there?""

88872,Integrator restrains paraspeckles assembly by promoting isoform switching of the lncRNA NEAT1.,2020-07-01,"KEY MESSAGE Quantitation of leaf surface wax on a population of switchgrass identified three significant QTL present across six environments that contribute to leaf glaucousness and wax composition and that show complex genetic × environmental (G × E) interactions. The C4 perennial grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) is a native species of the North American tallgrass prairie. This adaptable plant can be grown on marginal lands and is useful for soil and water conservation, biomass production, and as a forage. Two major switchgrass ecotypes, lowland and upland, differ in a range of desirable traits, and the responsible underlying loci can be localized efficiently in a pseudotestcross design. An outbred four-way cross (4WCR) mapping population of 750 F2 lines was used to examine the genetic basis of differences in leaf surface wax load between two lowland (AP13 and WBC) and two upland (DAC and VS16) tetraploid cultivars. The objective of our experiments was to identify wax compositional variation among the population founders and to map underlying loci responsible for surface wax variation across environments. GCMS analyses of surface wax extracted from 4WCR F0 founders and F1 hybrids reveal higher levels of wax in lowland genotypes and show quantitative differences of β-diketones, primary alcohols, and other wax constituents. The full mapping population was sampled over two seasons from four field sites with latitudes ranging from 30 to 42 °N, and leaf surface wax was measured. We identified three high-confidence QTL, of which two displayed significant G × E effects. Over 50 candidate genes underlying the QTL regions showed similarity to genes in either Arabidopsis or barley known to function in wax synthesis, modification, regulation, and transport.","Bragg, Jennifer; Tomasi, Pernell; Zhang, Li; Williams, Tina; Wood, Delilah; Lovell, John T; Healey, Adam; Schmutz, Jeremy; Bonnette, Jason E; Cheng, Prisca; Chanbusarakum, Lisa; Juenger, Thomas; Tobias, Christian M",TAG.

METHODS From March 9 to May 3, 2020, data were collected on COVID-19 symptoms, testing, hospitalization, and mortality for 8,256 individuals living in 29 congregate programs (residences and homeless shelters) or served by 41 noncongregate programs (scattered-site housing or outpatient treatment programs). RESULTS Of the 218 (2.6%) individuals who developed COVID-19-like illness, 84 (39%) were able to obtain testing. Of the 77 individuals who tested positive, 49 (64%) were hospitalized and 19 (25%) died. Congregate housing, age over 45, and intellectual/developmental disabilities were significantly associated with hospitalization and death. CONCLUSIONS Further research on risk and preventive factors is needed to address the high risk for people with serious mental illnesses and intellectual/developmental disabilities during a pandemic, particularly for those living in congregate housing.","Tse, Jeanie; Kingman, Emily; LaStella, Drew; Chow, Elisa; Pearlman, Shoshannah",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015948/,668

These methodologies may yield distorted results because DSB-associated effects are often falsely assumed to be consequences of gene perturbation itself, especially when high copy-number sites are targeted. In the present study, we report a DSB-independent, genome-wide CRISPR screening method, termed iBARed cytosine base editing-mediated gene KO (BARBEKO). This method leverages CRISPR cytosine base editors for genome-scale KO screens by perturbing gene start codons or splice sites, or by introducing premature termination codons. Furthermore, it is integrated with iBAR, a strategy we devised for improving screening quality and efficiency. By constructing such a cell library through lentiviral infection at a high multiplicity of infection (up to 10), we achieved efficient and accurate screening results with substantially reduced starting cells. More importantly, in comparison with Cas9-mediated fitness screens, BARBEKO screens are no longer affected by DNA cleavage-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa-, K562- or DSB-sensitive retinal pigmented epithelial 1 cells. We anticipate that BARBEKO offers a valuable tool to complement the current CRISPR-KO screens in various settings.","Xu, Ping; Liu, Zhiheng; Liu, Ying; Ma, Huazheng; Xu, Yiyuan; Bao, Ying; Zhu, Shiyou; Cao, Zhongzheng; Wu, Zeguang; Zhou, Zhuo; Wei, Wensheng",Nature biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-00944-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155407/,668

We compared the efficacy and safety of Solitaire with the standard, predicate mechanical thrombectomy device, the Merci Retrieval System. METHODS In this randomised, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled patients from 18 sites (17 in the USA and one in France). Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had acute ischaemic stroke with moderate to severe neurological deficits and were treatable by thrombectomy within 8 h of stroke symptom onset. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence to randomly allocate patients to receive thrombectomy treatment with either Solitaire or Merci (1:1; block sizes of four and stratified by centre and stroke severity). The primary endpoint was Thrombolysis In Myocardial Ischemia (TIMI) scale 2 or 3 flow in all treatable vessels without symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, after up to three passes of the assigned device, as assessed by an independent core laboratory, which was masked to study assignment. Primary analysis was done by intention to treat. A prespecified efficacy stopping rule triggered an early halt to the trial. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01054560. RESULTS Between February, 2010, and February, 2011, we randomly allocated 58 patients to the Solitaire group and 55 patients to the Merci group. The primary efficacy outcome was achieved more often in the Solitaire group than it was in the Merci group (61%vs 24%; difference 37% [95% CI 19-53], odds ratio [OR] 4·87 [95% CI 2·14-11·10]; p(non-inferiority)<0·0001, p(superiority)=0·0001). More patients had good 3-month neurological outcome with Solitaire than with Merci (58%vs 33%; difference 25% [6-43], OR 2·78 [1·25-6·22]; p(non-inferiority)=0·0001, p(superiority)=0·02). 90-day mortality was lower in the Solitaire group than it was in the Merci group (17 vs 38; difference -21% [-39 to -3], OR 0·34 [0·14-0·81]; p(non-inferiority)=0·0001, p(superiority)=0·02). INTERPRETATION The Solitaire Flow Restoration Device achieved substantially better angiographic, safety, and clinical outcomes than did the Merci Retrieval System.

Advance care planning (ACP) offers medical professionals an opportunity to discuss patients' preferences. We assessed how often these preferences were known when older patients were referred to the emergency department (ED) for an acute geriatric assessment. METHODS We conducted a descriptive study on patients referred to the ED for an acute geriatric assessment in a Dutch hospital. Patients were referred by general practitioners (GPs), or in the case of nursing home residents, by elderly care physicians. The referring physician was asked if preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments were known. The primary outcome was the number of patients for whom preferences were known. Secondary outcomes included which preferences, and which variables predict known preferences. RESULTS Between 2015 and 2017, 348 patients were included in our study. At least one preference regarding life-sustaining treatments was known at referral in 45.4% (158/348) cases. In these cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) policy was always included. Preferences regarding invasive ventilation policy and ICU admission were known in 17% (59/348) and 10.3% (36/348) of the cases respectively. Known preferences were more frequent in cases referred by the elderly care physician than the GP (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In less than half the patients, at least one preference regarding life-sustaining treatments was known at the time of referral to the ED for an acute geriatric assessment; in most cases it concerned CPR policy. We recommend optimizing ACP conversations in a non-acute setting to provide more appropriate, desired, and personalized care to older patients referred to the ED.","Ermers, Daisy J M; van Beuningen-van Wijk, Marit P H; Rit, Evi Peters; Stalpers-Konijnenburg, Sonja C; Taekema, Diana G; Bosch, Frank H; Engels, Yvonne; van Mierlo, Patricia J W B",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-02002-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446116/,668

Underreporting was prevalent in the sample (only 16.6% had reported an ADR in 2015; average total number of ADR-reports was 5). We found awareness of the importance of pharmacovigilance and ADRs, information deficits (43% were not aware of the obligation to report ADRs), and several uncertainties regarding the detection and reporting of ADRs. The participants rated the German ADR reporting system as satisfactory (mean grade 3.7±1.2) and criticized the expenditure of time (63.6%) and the overall complexity (47.4%).

Here, we investigated the effect of acute aerobic exercise on cerebellar circuits, and their potential contribution to altered M1 plasticity in healthy individuals (age: 24.8 ± 4.1 years). In Experiment 1, acute aerobic exercise reduced cerebellar inhibition (CBI) (n = 10, p = 0.01), elicited by dual-coil paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. In Experiment 2, we evaluated the facilitatory effects of aerobic exercise on responses to paired associative stimulation, delivered with a 25 ms (PAS25) or 21 ms (PAS21) interstimulus interval (n = 16 per group). Increased M1 excitability evoked by PAS25, but not PAS21, relies on trans-cerebellar sensory pathways. The magnitude of the aerobic exercise effect on PAS response was not significantly different between PAS protocols (interaction effect: p = 0.30); however, planned comparisons indicated that, relative to a period of rest, acute aerobic exercise enhanced the excitatory response to PAS25 (p = 0.02), but not PAS21 (p = 0.30). Thus, the results of these planned comparisons indirectly provide modest evidence that modulation of cerebellar circuits may contribute to exercise-induced increases in M1 plasticity. The findings have implications for developing aerobic exercise strategies to ""prime"" M1 plasticity for enhanced motor skill learning in applied settings.","Mang, Cameron S; Brown, Katlyn E; Neva, Jason L; Snow, Nicholas J; Campbell, Kristin L; Boyd, Lara A",Neural plasticity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/6797928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127659/,668

Further structural optimization of the identified lead structures can lead us to new more active potential antibacterial, antitubercular, and antiviral agents. Materials and Methods Antibacterial activities of the title compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. These molecules were also evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Moreover, all the compounds (3a-j) were also evaluated against some DNA and RNA viruses in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney, Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK), Vero, human embryonic lung (HEL) and HeLa cells. Results Among the tested compounds, 3i displayed the highest efficacy against S. aureus and E. coli. Compound 3j, 5-nitro-2-furfurylidene derivative showed the highest antituberculosis activity (IC50: 6.16 µg/mL and IC90: 14.390 µg/mL).

Liver copper (Cu) was very high in casualties, but also high in culled, newborn males (19.2 ± 1.54 and 12.0 ± 2.74 sd mmol/kg dry matter (DM) respectively). Serum glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) was >80 IU/l in healthy females aged 3-24 weeks, and correlated with serum aspartate transaminase (AST). Copper supplementation of total mixed rations during lactation was excessive (40-60 mg added Cu/kg DM) and reduced to 16-28 mg Cu/kg, but supplementation of milk replacer and creep feed (10 and 35 mg added Cu/kg DM, respectively) continued. The syndrome recurred two years later, and liver Cu remained high in casualties (13.6 ± 2.6) and culled cows (6.38 ± 2.38 mmol/kg DM) prompting withdrawal of all Cu supplements. Mortality remained low (6-9 per cent) thereafter. Three years after removal of all Cu supplements, six culled newborn were examined postmortem; five had normal liver Cu (4.5 ± 1.73), but a sixth had 11.65 mmol/kg DM. In live, healthy calves (1-6 months old) sampled at the same time, GLDH and AST increased with age to levels found five years earlier, indicating possible subclinical hepatopathy. Causative links between Cu supplementation, high calf mortality and hepatopathy are plausible, and reductions in Cu supplementation may prove beneficial in other dairy herds.","Hunter, A G; Suttle, N; Martineau, H M; Spence, M A; Thomson, J R; Macrae, A I; Brown, S",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.101051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23180151/,668

The aim of this study was a retrospective two-institutional analysis of surgical therapy with respect to the kind and amount of the resection performed, the type of reconstruction and the oncological outcome. METHODS Between September 1999 and August 2010 31 patients (seven women and 24 men) were treated due to a primary malignant bone tumour or soft tissue sarcoma of the chest wall in two centres. Eight low-grade sarcomas were noted as well as 23 highly malignant sarcomas. The tumours originated from the sternum in six cases, from the ribs in 12 cases, from the soft tissues of the thoracic wall in 11 cases and from a vertebral body and the clavicle in one case each. RESULTS In 26 cases wide resection margins were achieved, while four were intralesional and one was marginal. In all 31 cases the defect of the chest wall was reconstructed using mesh grafts. At a mean follow-up of 51 months 20 patients were without evidence of disease, three were alive with disease, seven patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up. One recurrence was detected after wide resection of a malignant triton tumour. CONCLUSIONS Primary malignant bone tumour or soft tissue sarcoma of the chest wall should be treated according to the same surgical oncological principles as established for the extremities. Reconstruction with mesh grafts and musculocutaneous flaps is associated with a low morbidity.","Friesenbichler, Joerg; Leithner, Andreas; Maurer-Ertl, Werner; Szkandera, Joanna; Sadoghi, Patrick; Frings, Andreas; Maier, Alfred; Andreou, Dimosthenis; Windhager, Reinhard; Tunn, Per-Ulf",International orthopaedics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-014-2304-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633363/,668

The structures of the borates are described in terms of cation-centered and oxocentred polyhedra. There are different sequences of double chains and layers consisting of oxocentred [OM4]n+ tetrahedra and [OM5]n+ tetragonal pyramids forming a framework. Elemental composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Oxidation states and coordination sites of iron and tin in the oxoborates are determined using Mössbauer spectroscopy and compared with EDX and X-ray diffraction data (XRD). According to results obtained from high-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy, the Fe2+ to Fe3+ oxidation in vonsenite and hulsite occurs at approximately 500 and 600 K, respectively. According to the high-temperature XRD data, this process is accompanied by an assumed deformation of crystal structures and subsequent solid-phase decomposition to hematite and warwickite. It is seen as a monotonic decrease of volume thermal expansion coefficients with an increase in temperature. A partial magnetic ordering in hulsite is observed for the first time with Tc ≃ 383 K. Near this temperature, an unusual change of thermal expansion coefficients is revealed. Vonsenite starts to melt at 1571 K and hulsite melts at 1504 K. Eigenvalues of thermal expansion tensor are calculated for the oxoborates as well as anisotropy of the expansion is described in comparison with their crystal structures.","Biryukov, Yaroslav P; Zinnatullin, Almaz L; Bubnova, Rimma S; Vagizov, Farit G; Shablinskii, Andrey P; Filatov, Stanislav K; Shilovskikh, Vladimir V; Pekov, Igor V","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620006538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831273/,668

We sought to determine whether there was an association between comorbid affective disorders and socioeconomic status among irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Methods: We assembled a retrospective cohort of 1074 IBS patients with comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and/or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) seen at two tertiary referral centers between 2007 and 2015. IBS patients with comorbid GAD and/or MDD were matched 3:1 by age, sex, and race to controls with IBS and no history of comorbid GAD and/or MDD. Socioeconomic status was approximated by patient zip codes. Results: IBS patients in the lowest socioeconomic group were more likely to be diagnosed with GAD and/or MDD compared to controls (OR = 1.38, p = .0004). The median average per capita income for comorbid GAD/MDD IBS patient cohort was also significantly lower than the control IBS patient cohort ($39,880.50 vs. $41,277.00, p = .02). Conclusions: Among IBS patients, the presence of comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder and/or Major Depressive Disorder is associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower average per capita income. These findings speak to a biopsychosocial model of illness, which should be considered by clinicians in the care of IBS patients.","Silvernale, Casey; Kuo, Braden; Staller, Kyle",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2019.1665095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31530048/,668

Given calls and mandates for social distancing, most clinics have shuttered or are only conducting urgent and emergent visits. As a result, many neurologists are turning to teleneurology with real-time remote video-based visits with patients to provide ongoing care. Although telemedicine utilization and comfort has grown for many acute and ambulatory neurologic conditions in the past decade, remote visits and workflows remain foreign to many patients and neurologists. Here, we provide a practical framework for clinicians to orient themselves to the remote neurologic assessment, offering suggestions for clinician and patient preparation before the visit; recommendations to manage common challenges with remote neurologic care; modifications to the neurologic examination for remote performance, including subspecialty-specific considerations for a variety of neurologic conditions; and a discussion of the key limitations of remote visits.

METHODS Sixty patients who underwent MICS were randomized to use either a DLT (Group D, n = 30) or a BB (Group B, n = 29; one failed was omitted). The following data were collected: time of intubation and tube localization; incidence of tube displacement; postoperative sore throat and hoarseness; time of cardiopulmonary bypass; maintenance time for SpO2 < 90% (PaCO2 < 60 mmHg); mean arterial pressure and heart rate; SpO2, PaO2, PaCO2, EtCO2, mean airway pressure, and airway peak pressure; surgeons' satisfaction with anesthesia; and short-term complications. RESULTS The times of intubation and tube localization were significantly longer in Group B than in Group D (P < 0.05). Patients in Group B exhibited significantly lower incidence of tube displacement, postoperative sore throat, and hoarseness when compared with patients in Group D (P < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after tracheal intubation (P < 0.05). The mean airway pressure and airway peak pressure were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after one-lung ventilation (P < 0.05). SpO2 and PaO2 in Group B were significantly higher than in group D after cardiopulmonary bypass (P < 0.05). No short-term postoperative complications were observed in patients of Groups B and D during 3 month follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Two patients underwent the transnasal snare technique for retrograde primary jejunostomy placement. Patients included two females, age 58 and 62. In both patients, a gooseneck snare was inserted in a transnasal fashion. After insertion of the snare into the jejunum, the location was confirmed with ultrasound. The snare was then targeted using a Chiba needle through which a 0.018-inch wire was advanced and snared through the nose. The wire was exchanged for a 0.035-inch Amplatz wire over which the tract was serially dilated followed by insertion of the jejunostomy catheter through a peel-away sheath. Technical success, complications, and follow-up were recorded. RESULTS Primary jejunostomy placement was technically successful in both patients. No minor or major complications occurred. Both patients received enteral nutrition the day following placement. Follow-up was at 54 and 38 days for patients 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSION The transnasal snare technique provides a novel alternative for primary jejunostomy insertion allowing for targeting of the jejunum with improved procedural success and no complications.","Srinivasa, Rajiv N; Chick, Jeffrey Forris Beecham; Hage, Anthony N; Shields, James J; Saad, Wael E; Majdalany, Bill S; Srinivasa, Ravi N",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-017-1777-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28879520/,668

The zebrafish genome has a highly conserved, one-to-one ortholog of ACE2, i.e., ace2, whose expression profile however has not yet been studied during development or in pathologies relevant to COVID-19. Herein, we identified significant development-, tissue- and gender-specific modulations in ace2 expression based on meta-analysis of zebrafish Affymetrix transcriptomics datasets (ndatasets=107, GPL1319 in GEO database). Co-expression network analysis of ace2 revealed distinct positively correlated (carboxypeptidase activity and fibrin clot formation), and negatively correlated (cilia biogenesis/transport and chromatin modifications) STRING network modules. Using additional transcriptomics datasets, we showed zebrafish embryos before 3 days post fertilization (dpf) exhibited low levels of ace2 that increased significantly until 4 dpf implicating a role for ace2 in organogenesis. Re-analysis of RNA-seq datasets from zebrafish adult tissues demonstrated ace2 was expressed highly in intestines, variably in liver, and at lower levels in other organs. In addition, zebrafish females and males showed significant dimorphism in their age-dependent expression of ace2, and between ovary and testis where the latter had higher levels. Moreover, we demonstrated ace2 expression was significantly modulated under different physiological and pathological conditions associated with development, diet, infection, and inflammation. Our findings implicate a novel translational role for zebrafish ace2 in differentiation and pathologies predominantly found in intestines and liver, in which the effects of SARS-CoV-2 could be detrimental.","Keskus, Ayse Gokce; Tombaz, Melike; Arici, Burcin I.; Dincaslan, Fatma B.; Nabi, Afshan; Shehwana, Huma; Konu, Ozlen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.424209,668

Case rates increased again in early June 2021 in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. To determine whether the surge was due to the emergence of Delta or another variant, or vaccine failure, a rapid, opportunistic investigation was conducted that comprised virus sequence analysis of nasal swab samples from breakthrough cases and antibody assays of plasma from healthy vaccinees. More than 90% of breakthrough infections during the second case surge were due to the Alpha variant. Spike protein ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays data revealed large differences in plasma titers of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, with mRNA vaccines eliciting higher titers than adenovirus-vectored or killed virus vaccines.","Dashdorj, N.

However, pathophysiological implications of these findings remain unknown. Here, the potential impact of pre-existing T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals on markedly different COVID-19 mortality levels in different countries has been investigated. The inverse correlation is documented between the prevalence of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in people without exposure to the virus and COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries. In countries with similar levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, differences in COVID-19 mortality appear linked with the extend and consistency of implementations of social measures designed to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (lockdown; physical distancing; mask wearing). Collectively, these observations support the model that the level of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells is one of the important determinants of the innate herd immunity against COVID-19. Together with the consistent social measures directed to limit the virus spread, high levels of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells appear significant determinants diminishing the COVID-19 mortality. Observations reported in this contribution should have significant impact on definitions of the herd immunity threshold required to effectively stop the pandemic in different countries across the globe.","Glinsky, Gennadi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.03.20206151,668

Materials and Methods: This multi-center, retrospective study was conducted in three centers and included a total of 206 confirmed COVID-19 cases using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data of survivors and non-survivors were compared, and predictors of mortality were examined. Results: Among the patients, 103 (50%) were males with a mean age of 52.8±16.7 years;88.3% of the patients were discharged in a healthy condition, while 11.7% died. The mean age was significantly higher in non-survivors. Dyspnea occurred in 32.5% of patients, and a significant correlation was found between dyspnea and mortality (p&lt;0.001). Thoracic computed tomography (CT) findings were positive in 88.8% of patients. The most frequent imaging findings were ground-glass opacities in 86.4% and consolidation in 33% of patients. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with comorbidities (p&lt;0.001). There was also a significant correlation between lymphocytopenia and mortality (p&lt;0.001). A positive correlation was found between mortality risk and platelet-to-lymphocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, and red cell distribution width indices. The mortality risk was significantly higher in patients with acute kidney injury (10.7%) (p&lt;0.001). Discussion: These results suggest that advanced age, coexisting diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or acute kidney injury are associated with an increased mortality risk. The presence of dyspnoea or consolidation on thoracic CT can predict an increased mortality risk in COVID-19 patients.","Karaaslan, T.; Karatoprak, C.; Karaaslan, E.; Kuzgun, G.

168235,Real-life performances of a novel antigen detection test on nasopharyngeal specimens for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis: a prospective study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Waning of vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease is a concern. This study investigated persistence of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine effectiveness against infection and disease in Qatar, where the Beta and Delta variants have dominated incidence and PCR testing is done at a mass scale. METHODS: A matched test-negative, case-control study design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease, between January 1, 2021 to August 15, 2021. RESULTS: Estimated BNT162b2 effectiveness against any infection, asymptomatic or symptomatic, was negligible for the first two weeks after the first dose, increased to 36.5% (95% CI: 33.1-39.8) in the third week after the first dose, and reached its peak at 72.1% (95% CI: 70.9-73.2) in the first five weeks after the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually thereafter, with the decline accelerating [≥]15 weeks after the second dose, reaching diminished levels of protection by the 20th week. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was higher than against asymptomatic infection, but still waned in the same fashion. Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal disease increased rapidly to 67.7% (95% CI: 59.1-74.7) by the third week after the first dose, and reached 95.4% (95% CI: 93.4-96.9) in the first five weeks after the second dose, where it persisted at about this level for six months. CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2-induced protection against infection appears to wane rapidly after its peak right after the second dose, but it persists at a robust level against hospitalization and death for at least six months following the second dose.","Chemaitelly, H.; Tang, P.; Hasan, M.

Evidence on the Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via Building Wastewater Plumbing Systems,2021,"The Pastoral da Pessoa Idosa (PPI) is a national voluntary movement linked to the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB), comprising approximately 2500 volunteers, who offer guidance and support for well-being to more than 170,000 older people throughout Brazil. This paper analyses the results of a data gathering exercise designed to gain an overview of the scope, support needs and international transferability of the project in ‘normal’ times and during the coronavirus pandemic. A telephone questionnaire comprising 21 questions was launched nationally among PPI volunteers over a single week in May 2020. The dataset (n = 3888) was subjected to exploratory statistical analysis and key findings collated around three guiding questions. The central findings were, first, that the composition of the body of volunteers is changing, requiring changes to training and support;secondly, that the model may be exportable to other middle-income countries in which the Catholic Church does not have the same dominance over the culture, as long as a national organising structure is in place;and finally that the speedy and flexible response of the PPI to the coronavirus pandemic suggests that this type of NGO will have a role in response to future national crises.","Kevern, Peter Ruth Gelehrter da Costa Lopes Áurea Eleutério Barroso Côrte Beltrina Lucena Carolina",Religions,https://doi.org/10.3390/rel11100486,668

This article addresses this question by collecting, categorising, and situating an extensive body of research on how application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by social media platforms facilitate the spread of disinformation. We first examine the landscape of official social media APIs, then perform quantitative research on the open-source code repositories GitHub and GitLab to understand the usage patterns of these APIs. By inspecting the code repositories, we classify developers' usage of the APIs as official and unofficial, and further develop a four-stage framework characterising pathways for spreading disinformation on social media platforms. We further highlight how the stages in the framework were activated during the 2016 US Presidential Elections, before providing policy recommendations for issues relating to access to APIs, algorithmic content, advertisements, and suggest rapid response to coordinate campaigns, development of collaborative, and participatory approaches as well as government stewardship in the regulation of social media platforms.","Ng, Lynnette H.

The aim of this study was to assess the positive and negative impact of COVID-19 on plastic surgery education and training and provide recommendations for continued competency.Methods:A cross-sectional online survey of plastic surgery residents across Canada was used to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical exposure, experience with virtual education, and long-term impact of COVID-19 on surgical training.Results:This study included 61 plastic surgery residents (40% participation rate). Common educational modalities used during COVID-19 included online seminars (95%) and workshops (58%). Teaching sessions were effective if structured around patient cases (72%), recorded (66%), and limited to 1 hour (64%). There were mixed reactions towards online education sessions;residents reported feeling grateful (54%), motivated (38%), enthusiastic (28%), overwhelmed (41%), pressured to participate (23%), and anxious (13%). There were significantly less residents who felt that their clinical exposure was sufficient during (21%) versus before (72%) pandemic restrictions (P &lt; .001). Overall, 87% of residents felt that the pandemic had a negative impact on their training, surgical skill development, fellowship plans, and job prospects.Conclusions:During the initial wave of COVID-19, residents faced altered educational opportunities, which elicited positive and negative emotions with concern regarding surgical skill development and impact on future career plans. Characterizing early educational impact on residency training to identify opportunities for change is worthwhile as the overall effect of the pandemic is ongoing and remains uncertain.","Zaidman, Maya Al-Shaqsi Sultan Yeung Celine Novak Christine B.; Dengler, Jana",Plastic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/22925503211024842,668

However, compliance with such measures is likely to be shaped by a range of factors. Here, we proposed and tested a mediation model in which rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and/or theorists mediates the relationship between rational thinking style and compliance with mandated requirements. An online, nationally representative sample of the adult population in the United Kingdom (N = 520) completed a previously validated measure of rational thinking style, as well as novel measures of rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists and compliance with mandated requirements. Intercorrelations between scores on all three measures were significant and positive. Mediation analysis indicated that rational thinking style and rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists, respectively, were directly associated with compliance, and that the mediated association was also significant. These results may have implications for practical policy aimed at promoting greater compliance with mandated requirements, including social distancing. © The Author(s) 2021.","Swami, V.; Barron, D.",Journal of Pacific Rim Psychology,https://doi.org/10.1177/18344909211037385,668

Following detailed in vitro characterization, we chose NM1267 as the most promising candidate showing high affinity binding to several recently described SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and strong neutralizing capacity against a patient isolate of B.1.351 (Beta). To assess if bipNb NM1267 confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo, human ACE2 transgenic mice were treated by intranasal route before infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. NM1267-treated mice showed significantly reduced disease progression, increased survival rates and secreted less infectious virus via their nostrils. Histopathological analyses and in situ hybridization further revealed a drastically reduced viral load and inflammatory response in lungs of NM1267-treated mice.

Outcomes of SARS-CoV2 infection remain a major concern in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, especially for those with uncontrolled disease. Objectives: We aimed to investigate trends and outcomes of COVID-19 occurring in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic conditions treated with biologics and targeted synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs, tsDMARDs). Methods: We included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 regardless of severity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) undergoing bDMARDs or tsDMARDs treatment registered in our local COVID-19 reporting database. We collected relevant information about comorbidities, rheumatologic-related clinical activity (RAPID5, SDAI, BASDAI, DAPSA), type of DMARD and glucocorticoid use, as well as COVID-19 related data as severity (ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening forms), medication, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and death. We did a subgroup analysis among patients with a specific rheumatologic diagnosis, among different class of medication, patients who were or not hospitalized with COVID-19 looking how age, comorbidities, type of rheumatic condition and treatments impact COVID outcomes. Results: 40 COVID-19 cases (positive PCR for SARS-CoV2) (4.67%) were identified during the 6-month study period among 855 patients registered in our database of patients under biologic treatment, including 20 RA, 18 SpA, 2 PsA patients. The majority were in either low disease activity or remission, only two patients had active uncontrolled disease at the onset of coronavirus infection. 16 cases (40%) were asymptomatic and were tested RT-PCR-positive during routine follow-ups for their disease, 13 cases (32.5%) had mild and 8 cases (20%) moderate illness;severe pneumonia and critical disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome were reported in only 3 cases, 2 recovered after;the only patients who died was 69 years old, had cardiac disease, hypertension and diabetes, had undertaken regular rituximab perfusion one month before coronavirus infection and developed pulmonary embolism followed by septic shock. Extreme fatigue was the dominant COVID-19 associated symptom apart from the classical ones including fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, anosmia and ageusia myalgias and anorexia. No specific pattern for patients requiring intensive care unit admission. Conclusion: The COVID-16 infection rate in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disorders receiving biologics and tsDMARDs is pretty low;although immunosuppressed, these patients seem not to be at risk for severe COVID-19 illness and outcomes. These findings might reflect a potential protective role of certain biologics and/or JAK inhibitors for development and severity of COVID-19 in patients.","Ancuta, C.; Pomirleanu, C.; Strugariu, G.; Petrariu, L.; Ancuta, E.; Bran, C.; Chirieac, R.; Mihailov, C.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3467,668

This causes the heart to irregularly, sometimes too slow, or too fast, depending on the condition. Fluttering and racing heart are the most common arrhythmia symptoms, which is most of the time harmless. Sometimes heart arrhythmias can even be life-threatening and may manifest several alarming signs and symptoms. This paper is about the acquisition and analysis of heart activity. Using the AD8232 module, the heart's electrical activity is captured using the principles of Electrocardiography (ECG). For the acoustic activity of the heart, a stethoscope and an electret microphone are used to convert the acoustic energy to electrical energy. The signal from each practice is passed through an ADC to translate the signal to a digital signal to allow further operation. Upon acquiring the data, it is then analyzed whether the subject has arrhythmia, murmur, or is normal using a Deep Learning algorithm. The said algorithm is provided using a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN). Remote communities where medical assistance is scarce will benefit from this research as it can be operated with no medical experience. The study was able to successfully acquire ECGs and PCGs and analyze the heart condition of the data source. The researchers successfully integrated preprocessing techniques to better analyze the gathered data from human subjects. Lastly, the tuned CNN model correctly classified human subjects based on 4 classes which are normal, abnormal, others, and noisy. The classification accuracy shows that 80% of the 20 subjects were correctly classified based on their current medical condition. The performance sensitivity of the study is 100%, while performance specificity is 77.78%. The detection of error rate is at 20%.

Nation-wide registry-study from Norway,2021-07-13,"Introduction Vaso-Occlusive Crisis (VOC), the most common manifestation of sickle cell disease (SCD), is the first cause of death when complicated by an acute chest syndrome (ACS). We previously developed a predictive score for the occurrence of ACS in SCD patients admitted at hospital for a VOC episode (Bartolucci et al., 2016). Two hundred and fifty patients with severe VOC requiring hospitalization were included in the PRESEV I study and 19% developed a secondary ACS within days post-admission (median [IQR] : 3 [2.3]). A multivariate analysis of these data established a predictive score of secondary ACS, with a negative predictive value of 98,9% for the low-level risk. Variables for calculation of the score were: reticulocytes and leucocytes counts, hemoglobin and categorical pain score (spine -pelvis). Interestingly enough, Hydroxyurea treatment did not have any impact on the score. Our goal was to validate this score in a multicenter international study, as it could represent a useful tool for physicians, for improving VOC management, but also be of use for therapeutic trials. Herein, we present results for adults. Methods This international, multicenter, prospective, observational study was performed in thirteen centres, over two continents (Africa and Europe) and five countries (Mali, Togo, England, Belgium and France). Homozygous SCD patients, both adults and children (>2 years), were included, with severe VOC requiring admission at the emergency unit. Severe VOC was defined as pain or tenderness affecting at least one part of the body (e.g. limbs, ribs, sternum, head, spine and/or pelvis) requiring opioids (level 3) and not attributable to other causes. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an ACS, defined as an auscultatory abnormality (crepitation or bronchial breathing), or the association of a new radiologic infiltrate and chest pain or decreased breath sounds. Secondary outcome measures were hospital length of stay, morphine consumption, transfusion, hospitalization in intensive care unit and mortality. The following parameters were recorded: temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory frequency, categorical pain score. Pulmonary auscultation was performed at least once a day by a physician, every day, for the length of stay. The auscultatory abnormality, defined as crepitation, bronchial breathing or decreased breath sounds, was confirmed by a second physician. If a patient was discharged before day 5, follow-up with a phone call and/or a visit, 3 to 7 days after discharge were performed, to prevent complications or ACS. Results Three hundred and seventy-two adult patients with a severe VOC requiring hospitalization were included. Mean age was 29 (±8) years old, sex ratio (female/male) was 1.2. A hundred and ninety-one patients came from Europe and 181 from Africa. Out of the 372 patients, 68 (18.3%) further developed a secondary ACS. Mean day of ACS episode was 3.3 (±1.37). Among the 304 patients who did not develop an ACS episode (81.7%), 41 had a low risk score of developing a secondary ACS (predictive score ≤ 5). Among the 68 patients who developed a secondary ACS, 43 had a high-risk score (≥ 11). Results are shown in table 1. Three deaths were reported, all on African continent (ACS, anemia and end-stage nephropathy). Discussion and Conclusion Our multicenter international study has allowed confirmation of the incidence of patients developing a secondary ACS during a VOC. This study confirms that the PRESEV score could indeed represent a useful tool for physicians, most especially within emergency structures, by identifying patients with a low risk of further developing an ACS with a good NPV and thus, allowing a better management of SCD patients experiencing a VOC. The PRESEV score was successfully put to practice during the Covid-19 pandemic at the referral SCD center of Henri Mondor hospital and identified “low-risk” patients, who benefited from homecare services (DREPADOM). As such, the PRESEV score could represent a significant help when one considers t e shortness of bed availabilities in certain circumstances (pandemics, hospital settings in resource-limited countries, etc…). Finally, the identification of “high-risk” patients could also become useful for improving the feasibility of clinical trials for the prevention of ACS.

This study aims at exploring the impact of COVID-19 on older people in displacement. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews from 12 older persons at Durumi IDP camp Abuja, while observing strict infection control measures. The data were inductively coded with Nvivo and analysed thematically. Findings: Findings revealed that the economic and psychosocial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased older persons in displacement poverty, psychological stress and placed them at risk of ageism, social isolation and may subsequently lead to secondary displacement, thereby losing all progress, development and resilience built after initial displacement. Social implications: This paper concluded by encouraging the need for all stakeholders to pay more attention to this invisible yet vulnerable group to ensure no one is left behind as people fight through this pandemic and its social implications. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to explore the impact of COVID-19 on older people in displacement in Nigeria.

If, on the one hand, the abundance of such pandemic representations would already be a legitimate reason to address the issue, on the other hand, it is not the central motivation of the present discussion. The uniqueness of the epidemiological phenomenon that we are experiencing highlights new aspects regarding the production and use of data visualizations, one of which is its diversification beyond counting and visual representation of events related to the virus spread. In this sense, the article discusses, through the analysis of examples, three different approaches for this type of schematic representation, namely: Visualization of hypothetical data, visualizations based on secondary data, and visualization for social criticism and self-reflection. Ultimately, we can argue that design contributes to the production of data visualizations that can help people to understand the causes and implications involved in the new coronavirus and encourage civic responsibility through self-care and the practice of social distancing. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

187449,[SARS-CoV-2 infection: do not neglect neurological symptoms!],2020-05-01,"Background Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the etiological agent of an acute and highly contagious disease. Infectious bronchitis (IB) affects chicken of all ages and poses major economic loses to the poultry industry worldwide. The continuous evolution of the spike protein (S1) of IBV is responsible for the prevalence of many serotypes/genotypes around the world. Multiple lineages of IBV strains have been detected in chicken flocks in India since 2003. Aims To detect IBV genotypes prevalent in India. Methods Organ samples from 20 IBV-positive flocks with variable clinical signs were used for the amplification of the S1 gene of IBV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results Positive PCR amplicons were sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that 14 field isolates belonged to the GI-1 genetic lineage (Mass 41 serotype), two field isolates belonged to the GI-13 (UK 4/91 variant IBV strain), one field isolate grouped with GIII, GV, and GVI genetic lineage and three belonged to a variant genotype unique to India (GI-24). Phylogenetic analysis also showed a similar type of grouping within the field isolates. Among the fourteen GI-1 isolates, 12 were isolated between 2003 and 2006 and only two were isolated between 2009 and 2011. The two field isolates belonging to GI-13 were isolated in 2007, another one belonging to GIII, GV, and GVI was isolated in 2010 and three field isolates were not close to any reference IBV sequences isolated in 2006 (IND-TN-168-06), 2010 (IND-TN-280-10) and 2011 (IND-TN-290-11). Conclusion A unique variant of IBV is emerging in India (GI-24). Our findings will have important implications for future vaccine intervention.","Raja, A; Dhinakar Raj, G; Kumanan, K",Iranian journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368223/,668

190098,Early Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Emergence in the Department of Defense via Retrospective Analysis of 2019-2020 Upper Respiratory Illness Samples.,2021-06-01,"Importance The most notable symptoms of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are fever, cough, dyspnea, and in severe cases, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS.) But neurological symptoms including confusion, stroke, and encephalopathy are reported, and anosmia and hypogeusia are also common indicating that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be neurotropic. Observations The SARS-Co-1 and 2 viruses bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is present on human brain endothelium and non-neuronal cells in the nasopharynx and lingual epithelium. However, SARS-CoV-1 and 2 do not bind rodent ACE2 avidly, which has required the generation of humanized ACE2 transgenic animal models of disease. Transgenic mouse models suggest that the SARS- CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV are neurotropic and infect and damage the brain, including the cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla. The symptoms of anosmia and hypogeusia indicate a portal to the brain. The relationship between encephalitis lethargica and post encephalitis parkinsonism to the Spanish Flu (H1N1 influenza virus) is unclear but raises the question of long term neurological complications of pandemics. Conclusions and Relevance There is a concern that there may be long term neurological sequelae of infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Twenty-five patients supported by ECMO due to hemodynamic deterioration were divided into 2 groups according to their outcome: weaned ECMO (W: n = 18) or not (NW: n = 7). In the W group, we examined the differences in parameters between the 2 time points, ECMO introduction, and the reduction in ECMO flow to 40% of the initial setting known as the conventional recovery point (C-point). Significant differences were observed in systolic pulmonary artery pressure, the cardiac index measured by the thermodilution method, C-reactive protein, lactate, base excess, and the end-tidal CO(2) concentration (ETCO(2)). Next, by closely examining these 6 parameters measured every 12 hours, we found that only ETCO(2) had always changed steeply, like a 'flexion point' (E-point), in all W cases, but not in NW. The E-point was defined as an initial increase in ETCO(2) of >or= 5 mmHg over the preceding 12 hours with a continued rise over the next 12 hours. E-points appeared as much as 95 +/- 60 hours earlier than C-points and also preceded weaning off of ECMO.

Hence, we sought to determine the existence of any chronic endocrine sequelae in SARS survivors. DESIGN, PATIENTS, MEASUREMENTS Sixty-one survivors of SARS prospectively recruited were analysed for hormonal derangements 3 months following recovery. Patients with pre-existing endocrine disorders were excluded. Any endocrine abnormalities diagnosed were investigated and treated where indicated up to a year. Serial evaluation facilitated characterization of trends and prognostication of any endocrinological aberrations. RESULTS Twenty-four (39.3%) patients had evidence of hypocortisolism. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction of the majority resolved within a year. Two (3.3%) of the hypocortisolic cohort had transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Four (6.7%) were biochemically hypothyroid, being comprised of three with central hypothyroidism and one with primary hypothyroidism. Two of the three with central hypothyroidism had concomitant central hypocortisolism. Eight had subnormal DHEAS levels. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary findings highlight a possible aetiologic role of SARS-associated coronavirus in causing a reversible hypophysitis or direct hypothalamic effect, with the HPA axis affected more frequently than the HPT axis.","Leow, Melvin Khee-Shing; Kwek, Daniel Seow-Khee; Ng, Alan Wei-Keong; Ong, Kian-Chung; Kaw, Gregory Jon-Leng; Lee, Lawrence Soon-U",Clinical endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16060914/,668

The inactivated vaccine was prepared by SARS-CoV virus propagation in Vero cells, with subsequent beta-propiolactone inactivation and Sepharose 4FF column chromatography purification. One hundred forty BALB/c female mice were divided into seven groups of 20 mice each. Of the seven groups, three groups were inoculated with 0.1, 1, and 3 microg of the vaccine without adjuvant while three other groups were inoculated at the same three dosages of vaccine with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, respectively. The remaining group was set up as a blank control. Each mouse was inoculated twice at an interval of 3 weeks. One week after the second immunization, mice sera were collected to detect serum neutralizing antibodies. An assay for determining neutralizing antibody titers was developed. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) higher dosages of vaccine induced higher levels of neutralizing antibody titer; (2) the level of neutralizing antibodies induced by the inoculation with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was slightly higher than that without adjuvant, but the difference was not statistically significant.","Tang, Lin; Zhu, Qingyu; Qin, Ede; Yu, Man; Ding, Zhifen; Shi, Huiying; Cheng, Xiaojie; Wang, Caiping; Chang, Guohui; Zhu, Qiang; Fang, Fang; Chang, Haiyan; Li, Shuangli; Zhang, Xumin; Chen, Xishu; Yu, Jun; Wang, Jian; Chen, Ze",DNA and cell biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15231072/,668

Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for this condition and its related comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different staple line reinforcement techniques on staple line reinforcement through bursting pressures. METHODS Different stapler line strengthening techniques were performed on resected stomach patterns of 48 patients. The patients were enrolled prospectively into 4 groups according to surgeons preferred type of staple line reinforcement. Data concerning patient demographic variables, surgical parameters, postoperative complications, postoperative readmissions, burst pressure and burst point were collected. None of the obese patients were excluded from this study. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in the characteristics of the groups. The number of staple cartridges fired and the linearity of the staple line were similar in all groups, (p 0.524-0.265). However, there were significant differences in the burst pressure measurements in groups I, II, IIIand IV (p .001). In all groups, the burst point on the staple line of resected stomach was most commonly in the fundus section. CONCLUSIONS We believe that the burst pressure in Fibrin sealant group is significantly higher and that fibrin glue can be effective in preventing stapler line leakage.

194931,Clinical evaluation of a rapid colloidal gold immunochromatography assay for SARS-Cov-2 IgM/IgG.,2020,"Techniques are described for the growth and rapid purification of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Purified IBV has a sedimentation coefficient of 320S and a buoyant density of 1.22 g/ml in sucrose-deuterium oxide equilibrium gradients. IBV RNA extracted by proteinase K in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and further purified by phenol extraction and gradient centrifugation is single stranded and has a sedimentation coefficient of 64S, as determined by isokinetic gradient centrifugation. Analysis on sucrose gradients under both aqueous and denaturing conditions together with agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of the chaotropic agent methylmercuric hydroxide gave a value of 8 X 10(6) for the moleclar weight of IBV RNA. This value was confirmed by RNase T1 fingerprinting, which also indicated that IBV RNA is haploid. No evidence was found of subunit structure in IBV RNA. From these results together with the recently reported observation that IBV RNA is infectious and contains a tract of polyadenylic acid (Lomniczi, J. Gen. Virol., in press), we conclude that the genome of the coronaviruses is a single continuous chain of about 23,000 mononucleotides that is of messenger polarity.","Lomniczi, B; Kennedy, I",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/198590/,668
198576,Regional collaboration in the Middle East to deal with H5N1 avian flu.,2006,"The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome's 3' untranslated region contains cis-acting sequences necessary for replication. Studies of MHV and other coronaviruses have indicated a role for RNA secondary and tertiary elements in replication. Previous work in our laboratory has identified four proteins which form ribonucleoprotein complexes with the 3'-terminal 42 nucleotides [3'(+)42] of the MHV genome. Defective interfering (DI) RNA replication assays have demonstrated a role for the 3'(+)42 host protein binding element in the MHV life cycle. Using gel mobility shift RNase T1 protection assays and secondary structure modeling, we have characterized a possible role for RNA secondary structure in host protein binding to the 3'-terminal 42-nucleotide element. Additionally we have identified a role for the 3'-terminal 42-nucleotide host protein binding element in RNA replication and transcription using DI RNA replication assays and targeted recombination and by directly constructing mutants in this protein binding element using a recently described MHV reverse genetic system. DI RNA replication assays demonstrated that mutations in the 3'(+)42 host protein binding element had a deleterious effect on the accumulation of DI RNA. When the identical mutations were directly inserted into the MHV genome, most mutant genomes were viable but formed smaller plaques than the wild-type parent virus. One mutant was not viable. This mutant directed the synthesis of genome-sized negative-sense RNA approximately as efficiently as the wild type did but had a defect in subgenomic mRNA synthesis. These results point to a potential role for sequences at the extreme 3' end of the MHV genome in subgenomic RNA synthesis.","Johnson, Reed F; Feng, Min; Liu, Pinghua; Millership, Jason J; Yount, Boyd; Baric, Ralph S; Leibowitz, Julian L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16282457/,668

The SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that it is no longer the exclusive privilege of countries to report and respond to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories, but that the global community has also assumed this role, aided by the ease and power of electronic communication through the World Wide Web. This phenomenon has been cited by some scholars as a potential infringement on national sovereignty that compromises the concept that states reign supreme over their territories and peoples. At the same time, however, countries are increasingly seeking to collaborate internationally in infectious disease surveillance and response, as shown in the current situation of avian influenza (H5N1), and in the formal agreement leading to the revised International Health Regulations (IHR), suggesting that a new world order prevails over issues that once had been considered the sole domain of a sovereign nation.","Heymann, David L","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16830003/,668

Along with severe respiratory syndrome, attention has recently been paid to extrapulmonary lesions, including endocrinopathies. The aim of the study was to summarize the current literature data about the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus on the thyroid gland. One of the most striking manifestations of viral aggression is de Quervain's subacute thyroiditis. The analysis of works from the most authoritative international abstract bibliographic databases was carried out using methods of analysis and processing of scientific resources. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that subacute thyroiditis can be both a clinical manifestation and a complication of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus can also trigger other thyroid diseases. The causes of subacute thyroiditis are considered to be the direct effect of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus on thyroid cells due to the use of ACE2 receptors, the subsequent inflammatory reaction and apoptosis, as well as central hypothalamus-pituitary mechanisms. The clinical variants of subacute thyroiditis in COVID-19 are diverse and have not been fully evaluated. In this regard, it can be concluded that the true incidence of subacute thyroiditis in COVID-19 is much greater, since it is masked by severe lesions of other organs.","Aleksandrov, Yu; Semikov, V; Shulutko, A; Gogokhia, T; Gorbacheva, A; Mansurova, G",Georgian medical news,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814400/,668
200760,Characteristics of Three Different Chemiluminescence Assays for Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies,2021,"BACKGROUND High C-reactive protein (CRP) values are frequently found in patients with bacterial respiratory infection, and CRP testing has been shown to be useful in differentiating pneumonia from other respiratory infections. Raised CRP values may also be found in viral respiratory infection, and as a result there is a risk that antibiotics may be wrongly prescribed. AIMS To describe the course of the CRP response during untreated upper respiratory tract infections and associations between the development of CRP values, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and respiratory symptoms. DESIGN OF STUDY Prospective study. SETTING Seven general practices in northern Norway. METHOD Patients with upper respiratory tract infection aged 16 years or over, who were not treated with antibiotics and who had been ill for no more than 3 days, were recruited. Microbiological examinations were undertaken, together with measurements of CRP, ESR and recording of symptoms daily during the first week of illness and on days 10, 14 and 21. RESULTS An aetiological agent was established in 23 of the 41 included subjects. These were: influenza A, influenza B, rhinovirus, and other agents. Among the 15 patients examined on both the second and the third day of illness, the median CRP value increased from 7-10 mg/l, and the mean value was from 19-24 mg/l between day 2 and day 3. Peak CRP values were reached on days 2 to 4. Higher CRP values were found in those infected with influenza A and B than in the other subjects (P <0.001). A CRP value >10 mg/l was found in 26 subjects during the first 7 days, compared to five subjects after 1 week. Evidence of a secondary infection with group A streptococci was found in two of these five subjects. The development of the symptoms of sore throat, fatigue, clamminess, and pain from muscles and joints followed a similar course as the CRP response, while stuffy nose, cough, sputum production, and dyspnoea tended to persist after the CRP values had approached the normal range. CONCLUSION A moderately elevated CRP value (10-60 mg/l) is a common finding in viral upper respiratory tract infection, with a peak during days 2-4 of illness. Moderately elevated CRP values cannot support a diagnosis of bacterial infection when the illness has lasted less than 7 days, but may indicate a complication of viral infection after a week.","Melbye, Hasse; Hvidsten, Dag; Holm, Arne; Nordbø, Sveine Arne; Brox, Jan",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15353049/,668
200784,Management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,2021,"AIM Nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an important role in reproduction and pathological reaction of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the antigenicity of the protein is better than spike (S) protein. This study was to find a highly specific and antigenic recombinant SCoV nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein, and to provide a basis for further researches on early diagnosis of SARS. METHODS Full length cDNA of SCoV nucleocapsid (SCoVN) protein was amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into yeast expression vector pPIC3.5K to construct plasmid of pPIC3.5K-SCoVN. The plasmid was linearized and then transformed into Pichia pastoris (P.pastoris) GS115 (His-Mut+) by electroporation. His(+)Mut(+) recombinant strains were identified by PCR and cultivated on MM/MD plates. The influence of different factors on biomass and rSCoVN protein production during induction phase, such as various induction media, dissolved oxygen (DO) and different final concentrations of methanol, was subsequently studied. The expression level and activation were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot respectively. RESULTS All of the recombinants were His(+)Mut(+) after transformation of P.pastoris with linearized plasmids. The BMMY medium was optimal for recombinant ScoVN (rSCoVN) protein expression and growth of the recombinant strains. The final optimal concentration of methanol was 20 mL/L, the DO had a significant effect on rSCoVN protein expression and growth of recombinant strains. The rSCoVN protein expressed in recombinant strains was about 8% of the total cell protein, 520 mg/L of rSCoVN protein was achieved, and a maximum cell A at 600 nm of 62 was achieved in shake flask culture. The rSCoVN protein had a high specificity against mouse-anti-SARS-CoVN-mAb and SARS positive sera, but had no cross-reaction with normal human serum. The biological activity of rSCoVN expressed in P.pastoris was about 4-fold higher than that expressed in E.coli when the same rSCoVN protein quantity was used. CONCLUSION Active recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nucleocapsid (rSCoVN) protein can be successfully expressed in recombinant methylotrophic yeast P.pastoris GS115. The rSCoVN protein has a high specificity against SARS-CoVN-mAb and SARS positive sera, but has no cross-reaction with normal human serum. This provides a basis for further researches on the early diagnosis of SARS and the mechanism of SCoV.","Liu, Ru-Shi; Yang, Kun-Yu; Lin, Jian; Lin, Yi-Wei; Zhang, Zhi-Hong; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ning-Shao",World journal of gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534914/,668

203083,Inference of Active Viral Replication in Cases with Sustained Positive RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Objective: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, causing millions of people to be infected worldwide Imaging analysis based on computed tomography (CT) data is an important means of clinical diagnosis A supercomputing-supported method is proposed for the construction of a new comprehensive CT analysis auxiliary system dealing with pneumonia Method: The system consists of four parts: input processing module, preprocessing module, imaging analysis subsystem, and artificial intelligence(AI) analysis subsystem Among the four parts, the imaging analysis subsystem detects the pneumonia features, distinguishes typical new coronary pneumonia by analyzing the typical imaging features, such as lung consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and crazy-paving pattern, and then comes to a conclusion of pneumonia The AI analysis subsystem uses a deep learning model to classify typical viral pneumonia and COVID-19, which enhances the screening ability of pneumonia Convolutional neural network is widely used as an effective algorithm for medical image analysis, particularly in image classification It is also widely utilized in the CT image screening and has achieved good results, which has attracted the attention of domestic and foreign scholars and industry The seasonable result derived from deep learning relies largely on the number and quality of training samples Given the lack of training samples, the system selects transfer learning as the technical direction for model construction Considering the quick response to the epidemic, the quality of easy maintenance and dynamic system updating is required Thus, after comparing and analyzing the performance and classification effect indexes of many common image classification models, we build a transfer learning neural network model on the basis of inception The entire neural network can be roughly divided into two parts: the first part uses a pre-trained inception network;the role of which is to convert image data into a one-dimensional feature vector The second part uses a fully connected network to improve classification prediction The imaging analysis method analyzes the image features of COVID-19, extracts the pneumonia feature areas, and carries out semantic analysis to achieve the delineation of the pneumonia target area Simultaneously, the typical imaging characteristics of COVID-19 (such as ground glass shadow, infiltration shadow, and lung consolidation) are targeted With regard to the pneumonia target area, a multi-level dynamic threshold segmentation is first used to determine the minimum lung tissue area (rectangular region of interest (ROI)) The extraction of the lung tissue area is designed as a normal workflow For each ROI, pixel statistics, threshold segmentation, regional dissolution and expansion, and abnormal proofreading are used to obtain the pneumonia target area Aiming at the relationship between the sizes of the pneumonia target area, a logical filter is established to detect the segmented distribution features and spatial relationship with the outer contour of the lung Then, based on the characteristic relationship of typical new coronary pneumonia, the typical characteristics of new coronary pneumonia are outlined The entire comprehensive analysis platform is built on the basis of the Tianhe artificial intelligence innovation-integrated platform The Tianhe artificial intelligence innovation-integrated platform is based on the hardware fusion supporting the environment of Tianhe supercomputing, cloud computing, and big data, upon which realizes the existing mainstream deep learning framework It is highly encapsulated with the processing model algorithm, forming a visual interactive template development environment covering multiple links such as data loading, model construction, training, verification, and solidified deployment As a service on this supporting platform, CT image comprehensive analysis AI auxiliary system has access to the computing resources, data resources, and external service capabiliti s of the platform and finally achieves the rapid integration and dynamic update of the system during the pandemic Result: After its release, the system has continuously and steadily provided new COVID-19 auxiliary diagnostic services and scientific research support for more than 30 hospitals and more than 100 scientific research institutions at home and abroad, providing important support for combating the epidemic Conclusion: The supercomputing-supported new coronary pneumonia CT image comprehensive analysis auxiliary system construction method proposed in this paper has achieved important application on diagnosis and research It is an effective way to achieve rapid deployment services and provide efficient support for emergencies The system applies artificial intelligence technology using CT imaging to screen for COVID-19 By applying artificial intelligence to the screening of COVID-19 with pneumonia and giving reference opinions for auxiliary diagnosis, the marking and area statistics of the inflammatory regions are improved The system achieves the combination of artificial intelligence traditional machine vision and deep learning technology to distinguish COVID-19 by using CT images The combined route of viral pneumonitis feature extraction based on traditional machine vision and the COVID-19 image classification based on artificial intelligence technology has achieved a comprehensive analysis of medical image features and COVID-19 screening The fast implementation mode of the fusion platform scenario is based on computing power and data support Relying on the Tianhe artificial intelligence innovation-integrated service platform, the platform supports intelligent frontier innovation on the basis of computing power and data, implements an open model of simultaneous research and application, and has a multi-industry training resource model library and large-scale distributed training sources With regard to rapid deployment and other service capabilities, this comprehensive analysis system is also the first public COVID-19 AI-assisted diagnostic system deployed online Analysis based directly on

A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities. Based on the peculiarities of disorder distribution, the SARS-CoV-2 (M PID = 6%, N PID = 48%) has to be placed in Category B. Our data show however, that the SARS-CoV-2 is very strange with one of the hardest protective outer shell, (M PID = 6%) among coronaviruses. This means that it might be expected to be highly resilient in saliva or other body fluids and outside the body. An infected body is likelier to shed greater numbers of viral particles since the latter is more resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids. These particles are also likelier to remain active longer. These factors could account for the greater contagiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 and have implications for efforts to prevent its spread.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A Keith; Foster, James A; Uversky, Vladimir N",Microb Pathog,,668

As exigências proteicas e energéticas, e suas respectivas eficiências de retenção (Kp e Ke ) são fatores determinantes ao ajuste da TA. O manejo de adição de carbono (MAC) é uma ferramenta que pode determinar maior produtividade de um sistema em biofloco (BFT). Assim, o objetivo do trabalho foi estimar as exigência de proteína e energia para mantença e crescimento pelo método fatorial, e paralelamente se definir a taxa de alimentação e manejo de adição de carbono mais eficiente e os fatores de risco envolvidos no cultivo de tilápia do Nilo Oreochromis niloticus em um sistema do tipo BFT. No ensaio de exigência nutricional, utilizou-se o método de restrição quantitativa, com quatro TA (1, 0,75, 0,5 e 0,25). O trabalho foi dividido em duas fases subsequentes (P1 com duração de 39 dias e P2 com duração de 58 dias), para se verificar o comportamento das respostas avaliadas durante o crescimento. Para se estimar a eficiência de utilização da proteína, bem como exigência proteíca para mantença foi utilizado modelo exponencial. A eficiência de utilização da energia para deposição de proteína e lipídeos (KP e KL) e exigência de energia para manutenção foi calculada através do modelo fatorial. Durante o ensaio em BFT foram utilizadas as mesmas TA mencionadas e dois MAC subseqüentes. Em MAC 1 foi utilizada adição constante de melaço (fonte de carbono) para elevar a proporção de C:N para 1:17, em função da proteína adicionada via ração e o MAC 2 foi realizado em função da concentração de amônia (NH3) na água, na proporção de 6 g de melaço para 1 g de NH3. Durante 99 dias, avaliou-se na água de cultivo: NH3, Nitrito (NO2), alcalinidade, pH, sólidos dissolvidos totais estimados por condutividade elétrica (SDTe), volume de sólidos sedimentáveis (VSS). As interações entre TA e MAC sobre qualidade de água e crescimento foram feitas através de modelos lineares de efeitos mistos e o modelo de risco proporcional de Cox para determinar os fatores de risco associados a mortalidade. A exigência de energia metabolizável para manutenção avaliada foi de 11 kcal kg-0,8. O Kp foi de aproximadamente 0,25 e o KL 0,88. A exigência de proteína digestível para manutenção foi de 0,65 g kg-0,7dia-1 e a capacidade de deposição proteíca teórica máxima de 0,99 g kg-0,7dia-1. Durante o ensaio em BFT verificou-se forte impacto das varáveis de qualidade de água no desempenho dos animais, VSS, TDSe e pH foram afetados por TA e MAC. TDSe foi o principal fator de risco que colaborou para a ocorrência de mortalidade. O crescimento foi favorecido com MAC 2 e a eficiência de alimentação otimizada com a taxa de alimentação correspondente a 1,3% do peso corporal (TA 0,75).","BRITO, TULIO SOARES DE",,,668

209272,Clinical performances of an ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay and correlation with neutralization activity,2020,"Objectives: This systematic literature review highlights the economic burden of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Europe and Asia. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EconLit from December 1, 2019 to October 26, 2020. Two independent reviewers assessed all abstracts according to the eligibility criteria. Studies with queries were referred to a third reviewer to reach agreement. Studies that met the inclusion criteria after full-text review were extracted and critically appraised. Results: After removing duplicates, 845 citations were identified through database searches. Sixty-three citations were included for full-text screening;seven observational studies were included (three from Asia, four from Europe). Six studies reported baseline characteristics for hospitalized patients, and all studies reported comorbidities. Commonly reported comorbidities included diabetes (range 11.2%-50%) and hypertension (range 16.3%-64%). The proportion of patients requiring ventilation ranged from 2% to 89%. One study reported that all patients needed invasive ventilation, but due to lack of ventilators, only 64.7% received it. Pharmacology therapy use was reported in five studies: one study treated all patients with hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin, another reported propofol and cisatracurium as the most frequently used therapies. Use of antibiotics ranged from 31% to 100%, and antivirals ranged from 40% to 98.6%. Length of hospital stay was reported in five studies and varied greatly, from mean 4.6 days (SD 2.1) to median 16 days (IQR 10-23). One study estimated per-patient costs for COVID-19 patients at $4,552 for mild cases, $11,058 for severe cases, and $16,652 for critically ill cases. Conclusions: Research showed that the economic burden of COVID-19 hospitalized patients in Europe and Asia is high. This literature is growing, as our search strategy found 800 new citations published from October 2020 to January 2021. These results may be useful for future studies seeking to increase the information base on the economic burden of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Achter, E.; Shen, Y.; Goldgrub, R.; Kendall, R.; Shah, D.",Value in Health,,668

A well-functioning primary care system is crucial in epidemic situations as it plays an important role in the development of a system-wide response. METHODS: 2,187 Austrian and German GPs answered an internet survey on preparedness, testing, staff protection, perception of risk, self-confidence, a decrease in the number of patient contacts, and efforts to control the spread of the virus in the practice during the early phase of the COVID-pandemic (3rd to 30th April). RESULTS: The completion rate of the questionnaire was high (90.9%). GPs gave low ratings to their preparedness for a pandemic, testing of suspected cases and efforts to protect staff. The provision of information to GPs and the perception of risk were rated as moderate. On the other hand, the participants rated their self-confidence, a decrease in patient contacts and their efforts to control the spread of the disease highly. CONCLUSION: Primary care is an important resource for dealing with a pandemic like COVID-19. The workforce is confident and willing to take an active role, but needs to be provided with the appropriate surrounding conditions. This will require that certain conditions are met.

The goal of this study was to assess patients' experiences receiving sleep care by telehealth. METHODS: From June 2019 to May 2020, the authors recruited a sample of patients for semi-structured interviews, including patients who had one of three types of telehealth encounters in sleep medicine: in-clinic video, home-based video, and telephone. Two analysts coded transcripts using content analysis and identified themes that cut across patients and categories. RESULTS: The authors conducted interviews with 35 patients and identified five themes. 1) Improved access to care: Patients appreciated telehealth as providing access to sleep care in a timely and convenient manner. 2) Security and Privacy: Patients described how home-based telehealth afforded them greater feelings of safety and security due to avoidance of anxiety provoking triggers (e.g. crowds). Patients also noted a potential loss of privacy with telehealth. 3) Personalization of care: Patients described experiences with telehealth care that either improved or hindered their ability to communicate their needs. 4) Patient Empowerment: Patients described how telehealth empowered them to manage their sleep disorders. 5) Unmet Needs: Patients recognized specific areas where telehealth did not meet their needs, including the need for tangible services (e.g. mask fitting). CONCLUSION: Patients expressed both positive and negative experiences, highlighting areas where telehealth can be further adapted.

The present model is more accurate than previously published superstructures, due to an excellent data set collected up to a high resolution of 0.89â Å-1. The present study confirms the unusual complexity of the structure comprising a very large primitive unit cell with Z' = 16. A much smaller degree of correlated disorder of parts of the unit cell is found than is present in the previously published models. As a result of pseudo-symmetry, the structure can be described in a higher-dimensional space. The X-ray diffraction data clearly indicate a (3+1)-dimensional periodic structure with stronger main reflections and weaker superstructure reflections. Furthermore, the structure is established as being commensurate. The structure description in superspace results in a four times smaller unit cell with an additional base centring of the lattice, resulting in an eightfold substructure (Z' = 2) of the 3D superstructure. Therefore, such a superspace approach is desirable to work out this high-Z' structure.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, analytical and retrospective study included all patients aged &#8805;18 years (n = 502) who were hospitalised in Samsun, Turkey, for COVID-19 and were given favipiravir from the date between 25 March 2020 and 3 June 2020. RESULTS: In total, 58.6% (n = 294) of the patients were male and 24.5% (n = 123) were between the ages of 71 and 80 years. During the first case process, the mortality rate was 19.9%, whereas the rate of those who were discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 37.3%. During the second case process, the mortality rate was 6.2%, and the rate of those who was discharged as is/followed up at home for 14 days was 65.6%. The mean length of hospital stay was 10.61 ± 8.17 days for the first and 7.97 ± 4.16 days for the second hospitalisation; this difference was significant. Mortality risk of those who used Tocilizumab or vitamin C beside Favipiravir was higher than those who did not. The length of hospital stay was higher in patients using tocilizumab than in those who did not (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Administration of favipiravir later in the course of the disease makes it difficult to achieve the true efficacy expected from the drug and also makes it difficult for other combination drugs to contribute to survival. Favipiravir may also be effective in case of recurrence.","Oruç, Muhammet Ali; Öz, Hatice; Öztürk, Onur",Int J Clin Pract,,668

Building on logics of crisis decision-making and on the notion of 'tact', we reveal how the Dutch government initially succeeded in orchestrating collective action through aligning public health purposes and installing socio-economic policies to soften societal impact. However, when the crisis evolved into a more enduring one, a more contested policy arena emerged in which decision-makers had a hard time composing and defending a united decision-making strategy.

It is the main enzyme involved in generating various non-structural proteins that are important for viral replication and is one of the most important proteins responsible for SARS-CoV-2 virulence. In this study, we have conducted an ensemble docking of molecules from the DrugBank database using both the crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, as well as five conformations obtained after performing a cluster analysis of a 300 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This procedure elucidated the inappropriateness of the active site for non-covalent inhibitors, but it has also shown that there exists an additional, more favorable, allosteric binding site, which could be a better target for non-covalent inhibitors, as it could prevent dimerization and activation of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Two such examples are radotinib and nilotinib, tyrosine kinase inhibitors already in use for treatment of leukemia and which binding to the newly found allosteric binding site was also confirmed using MD simulations.

Methods: We retrospectively studied the clinical data, cellular and humoral immune function tests results of 101 cases of COVID-19 confirmed by our hospital. The patients were classified according to the Chinese guideline for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment and divided into two groups as non-severe group and severe group, and the results of cellular and humoral immune function tests were compared. Results: The patients in the severe group were older on average, and the proportion of patients with underlying disease was higher. The counts of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16+CD56 T cells were significantly less in the severe group than in the non-severe group (P&lt;0.05). Levels of IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, complement C3, and complement C4 were determined by mmunoassay, and no difference was found between the two groups. The diagnostic value of the cellular immune cells counts was analyzed by ROC curve. The area under the curve (AUC) of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16+CD56 T cells was 0.987 3, 0.969 3, 0.965 8, 0.817 4, and 0.658 7, respectively (P&lt;0.05), and the cut-off values for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16+CD56 T cells were 575.5, 390.0, 214.5, 111.0, and 127.5 cells/μL. Conclusion: Elderly COVID-19 patients with basic diseases are more likely to develop into severe patients. The depletion of each immune cells are more obvious in severe patients.

Our analysis demonstrates the broad diversity of T cell epitopes that have been recorded for SARS-CoV-2. A large majority are seemingly unaffected by current variants of concern. We identify a set of 20 immunoprevalent epitopes that induced T cell responses in multiple cohorts and in a large fraction of tested patients. The landscape of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes that we describe can help guide immunological studies, including those related to vaccines and diagnostics.

222868,Household Transmission and Clinical Features of SARS-CoV-2 Infections by Age in 2 US Communities,2021,"BACKGROUND: In November 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for two novel virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapies, bamlanivimab, and REGN-COV2 (casirivimab plus imdevimab), for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adolescents and adults in specified high-risk groups. This has challenged clinicians to determine the best approach to use of these products. METHODS: A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric infectious diseases pharmacy, pediatric intensive care medicine, and pediatric hematology from 29 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a guidance statement was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is typically mild and there is no high-quality evidence supporting any high risk groups. There is no evidence for safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, limited evidence of modest benefit in adults, and evidence for potential harm associated with infusion reactions or anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence available as of December 20, 2020, the panel suggests against routine administration of monoclonal antibody therapy (bamlanivimab, or casirivimab and imdevimab), for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, including those designated by the FDA as at high risk of progression to hospitalization or severe disease. Clinicians and health systems choosing to use these agents on an individualized basis should consider risk factors supported by pediatric-specific evidence, and ensure implementation of a system for safe and timely administration that does not exacerbate existing healthcare disparities.","Wolf, Joshua; Abzug, Mark J; Wattier, Rachel L; Sue, Paul K; Vora, Surabhi B; Zachariah, Philip; Dulek, Daniel E; Waghmare, Alpana; Olivero, Rosemary; Downes, Kevin J; James, Scott H; Pinninti, Swetha G; Yarbrough, April; Aldrich, Margaret L; MacBrayne, Christine E; Soma, Vijaya L; Grapentine, Steven P; Oliveira, Carlos R; Hayes, Molly; Kimberlin, David W; Jones, Sarah B; Bio, Laura L; Morton, Theodore H; Hankins, Jane S; MarÏn-Alfaro, Gabriella M; Timberlake, Kathryn; Young, Jennifer L; Orscheln, Rachel C; Schwenk, Hayden T; Goldman, David L; Groves, Helen E; Huskins, W Charles; Rajapakse, Nipunie S; Lamb, Gabriella S; Tribble, Alison C; Lloyd, Elizabeth E; Hersh, Adam L; Thorell, Emily A; Ratner, Adam J; Chiotos, Kathleen; Nakamura, Mari M",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,668

The empirical results show that the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity present antipersistence in the long run and that they tend to be positively persistent in the short run. The negative cross-correlations between the interest rate and stock market liquidity are more significant than the positive cross-correlations. Furthermore, the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity display multifractal characteristics, explaining the variations in the relationship between the interest rate and stock market liquidity at different time scales. In addition, the lower degree of multifractality in the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity confirms that it is effective for the interest rate to control stock market liquidity. The Chinese stock market liquidity is more sensitive to fluctuations in the money market rate in the short term and is inelastic in response to the money market rate in the long term. In particular, the positive cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity in the short run become strong in periods of crises and emergencies. All the evidence proves that the interest rate policy is an emergency response rather than an effective response to mounting concerns regarding the economic impact of unexpected exogenous emergencies and that the interest rate cut policy will not be as effective as expected.","Sun, Yihong; Yuan, Xuemei",PLoS One,,668

We developed a comprehensive mathematical framework based on the known mechanisms of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, incorporating the renin-angiotensin system and ACE2, which the virus exploits for cellular entry, key elements of the innate and adaptive immune responses, the role of inflammatory cytokines, and the coagulation cascade for thrombus formation. The model predicts the evolution of viral load, immune cells, cytokines, thrombosis, and oxygen saturation based on patient baseline condition and the presence of comorbidities. Model predictions were validated with clinical data from healthy people and COVID-19 patients, and the results were used to gain insight into identified risk factors of disease progression including older age; comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension; and dysregulated immune response. We then simulated treatment with various drug classes to identify optimal therapeutic protocols. We found that the outcome of any treatment depends on the sustained response rate of activated CD8+ T cells and sufficient control of the innate immune response. Furthermore, the best treatment-or combination of treatments-depends on the preinfection health status of the patient.

Such effects may be particularly pronounced amongst adolescents and young people living in contexts of precarity and constraint, including in South Africa. However, there are evidence gaps on the lived experiences of this group. We conducted telephonic semi-structured interviews with adolescents and young people in two South African provinces (n = 12, ages 18-25) in April 2020 to explore and document their experiences, challenges and coping strategies during strict COVID-19 lockdown. Participants described indirect effects of COVID-19 including food insecurity, lost livelihoods and changes to social service provisions such as municipal electricity services and sanitation. Psychosocial stressors related to uncertainty over education and work futures were also discussed. The aforementioned challenges were particularly present with young parents, 'working poor' participants, and those with pre-existing mental health challenges. Participants demonstrated excellent COVID-19 transmission and prevention knowledge, showing that they had received and correctly interpreted public health messaging. Despite this, many simultaneously held non-scientific COVID-19 beliefs. Engaging a socio ecological framework, findings demonstrate how the indirect effects of COVID-19 may exacerbate underlying multi-layered vulnerabilities for adolescents and young people living in contexts of precarity and constraint.","Gittings, Lesley; Toska, Elona; Medley, Sally; Cluver, Lucie; Logie, Carmen H; Ralayo, Nokubonga; Chen, Jenny; Mbithi-Dikgole, Jane",Glob Public Health,,668

With the introduction of external female urinary catheters, we can now substitute this type of device for an indwelling urinary catheter in many patients, decreasing their risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed the impact of a hospital-wide implementation of an external female urinary catheter at a large academic medical center. The study included female patients, greater than 18 years of age. We compared a 12-month period before and after device implementation to assess the impact on indwelling urinary catheter utilization and catheter-associated urinary tract infections rate. RESULTS: Data included over 220,000 patient days, over 10,000 external urinary catheter days and 33,000 indwelling urinary catheter days. We found a statistically significant decrease in indwelling urinary catheter utilization following the implementation of the external female urinary catheter, but only in intensive care units.

One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. METHODS: Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. RESULTS: Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (Î·2 = .03; p = .03), stress management (Î·2 = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (Î·2 = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (Î·2 = .07, p < .01), PTSD (Î·2 = .05, p = .03), and depression (Î·2 = .07, p < .01) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the resilience workshop promoted engagement in positive health behaviors and reduced the incidence of mental health symptoms, especially when administered prior to a repeat trauma exposure. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term health effects of participation in the program.","Mahaffey, Brittain L; Mackin, Daniel M; Rosen, Jonathan; Schwartz, Rebecca M; Taioli, Emanuela; Gonzalez, Adam",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,,668
230079,Approaches to Daily Monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Northern Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and mortality from them has been recognized worldwide. In Brazil, the impact of COVID-19 on CVD must be evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the current pandemic on the numbers of hospital admissions (HA), in-hospital deaths (ID), and in-hospital fatality (IF) from CVD by use of national epidemiological data from the Brazilian Unified Public Health System. METHODS: Time-series observational study using comparative analysis of the HA, ID, and IF due to CVD recorded from January to May 2020, having as reference the values registered in the same period from 2016 to 2019 and the values projected by linear regression methods for 2020. The statistical significance level applied was 0.05. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2019, there was a 15% decrease in the HA rate and a 9% decrease in the total ID due to CVD between March and May 2020, followed by a 9% increase in the IF rate due to CVD, especially among patients aged 20-59 years. The HA and IF rates registered in 2020 differed significantly from the projected trend for 2020 (p = 0.0005 and 0.0318, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the first months of the pandemic, there were a decline in HA and an increase in IF due to CVD in Brazil. These data might have resulted from the inadequate planning of the CVD management during the pandemic. Thus, immediate actions are required to change this scenario.

Cleft lip and palate repair was classified as low acuity, and nasoalveolar molding (NAM) clinics were closed. Anticipating the consequences of delayed cleft care and the additional burden this would cause families, we reassessed our risk-stratification and perioperative algorithms. We hypothesized we could safely optimize nasolabial repair without burdening our care systems and without increasing COVID-19-related morbidity/mortality. METHODS: Our multidisciplinary cleft team reevaluated patient selection to maximize surgical impact. Perioperative protocols were adjusted, and COVID-19 preoperative testing was utilized before nasolabial repair and prior to suture removal under anesthesia. RESULTS: Early in the pandemic, unilateral cleft repair was prioritized and successfully completed on 9 patients. There were no complications related to COVID-19. Nasoalveolar molding clinic was reopened after total patient volume was significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We offer an approach for surgical management of nasolabial clefts during a global pandemic. Although guidelines have suggested postponing all cleft care, we found that at our dedicated pediatric hospital with low burden of COVID-19 and adequate resources, we could follow a strategy to safely resume cleft care while decreasing burden on our patients' families and care delivery systems.","Santos, Pauline Joy F; Arowojolu, Omotayo A; Vyas, Raj M",Cleft Palate Craniofac J,,668

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Scopus, and gray literature were searched using Google Scholar up until September 2020. CONCLUSION: Although the safe and effective delivery of cancer care via telehealth requires education and training for health care professionals and patients, telehealth has provided a timely solution to the barriers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of interdisciplinary cancer services. Globally, evidence has shown that telehealth in cancer care can leverage an innovative response during the COVID-19 pandemic but may provide a long-lasting solution to enable patients to be treated appropriately in their home environment. Telehealth reduces the travel burden on patients for consultation, affords a timely solution to discuss distressing side effects, initiate interventions, and enable possible treatment additions and/or changes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Global public health disasters pose significant and unique challenges to the provision of necessary services for people affected by cancer. Oncology nurses can provide a central contribution in the delivery of telehealth through transformational leadership across all domains and settings in cancer care. Oncology nurses provide the ""hub of cancer care"" safely embedded in the interdisciplinary team. Telehealth provides a solution to the current global health crisis but could also benefit the future provision of services and broad reach clinical trials.","Paterson, Catherine; Bacon, Rachel; Dwyer, Rebecca; Morrison, Kittani S; Toohey, Kellie; O039,; Dea, Amy; Slade, James; Mortazavi, Reza; Roberts, Cara; Pranavan, Ganes; Cooney, Corrina; Nahon, Irmina; Hayes, Sandra C",Semin Oncol Nurs,,668

A growing interest in perioperative application of povidone­iodine (PVP-I) to the nasopharynx and oropharynx has emerged. The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence-based assessment of PVP-I in pediatric oral, nasal and pharyngeal surgery. METHODS: A contemporary literature review with algorithmic approach to the potential use of PVP-I in pediatric mucosal surgery. RESULTS: Several formulations of PVP-I have shown rapid in vitro virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2. Antisepsis using 1.0% PVP-I mouthwash and 0.45% PVP-I throat spray can occur after 30 seconds of contact time. To date, in vivo effectiveness of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be established and possible risks of its direct use on upper aerodigestive mucosa of children must be weighed.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty consecutive complex ablations were performed in different days using this technology. All these procedures were assisted remotely with the only intervention of a field clinical specialist located at his home who took full control of the navigation system (keyboard, mouse, and screen) and had bidirectional real-time audio/video feedback with the operating physician. Once the connection was established, the remote field clinical specialist replicated the Rhythmia screen at the remote location with all its features, and interacted identically with the physician, essentially with no perceptible differences from being physically present. There were neither interruptions nor perceptible delays in the bidirectional communications between the remote field clinical specialist and the operating physician during the procedures. Video signal delay ranged from 265 to 325 ms. All the procedures were uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: Remote system operation allowed full teleoperation of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (keyboard, mouse, and screen) as well as bidirectional real-time audio/video feedback with the operating physician, providing a fully autonomous remote assistance in 50 complex ablation procedures. This technology ensures workflow continuity and optimal workforce flexibility and has relevant and promising implications in the field of training, teaching, and resource optimization that deserves further development.","García-Bolao, Ignacio; Moñino, David; Marsal, Roger; Ramos, Pablo; Erkiaga, Ane; Irezabal, Joana; Albarrán-Rincón, Ramón",J. interv. card. electrophysiol,,668

Several commercial assays are now available; however, the response from commercial vendors to develop and market validated tests is a time-consuming process. In addition, the massive global demand made it difficult to secure a reliable commercial supply of testing kits and reagents. A public health laboratory serves a unique and important role in the delivery of health care. One of its functions is to anticipate and prepare for novel emerging pathogens with a plan for pandemic preparedness.

Results of DASS-D and DASS-A showed female preponderance (men vs women 42.5% vs 61.5%, p = .02; 42.5% vs 60%, p = .04). Severity of symptoms revealed that ophthalmologists above 40 years of age with more than 10 years' experienced severe stress (p = .005). Comprehensive ophthalmologists presented with severe stress and ophthalmologists practicing speciality with severe anxiety. Pearson's correlation analysis showed positive correlation between total DASS-21 score with each of the three subscales scores (DASS D, r-0.88: p < .001; DASS-A, r = 0.96: p = <0.001; DASS-S, r = 0.95: p < .001). Conclusion: Screening by Dass-21 scale has brought noticeable transient mental health issue among ophthalmologist to the fore. Few with high risk may require professional mental care to alleviate it.","Grover, Rohini; Dua, Pratham; Juneja, Supreet; Chauhan, Lokesh; Agarwal, Pradeep; Khurana, Ashi",Ophthalmic Epidemiol,,668

243881,SARS-CoV-2: big seroprevalence data from Pakistan-is herd immunity at hand?,2021,"In December 2019, a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 was reported in China and quickly spread to other parts of the world. The development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines has recently received much attention from numerous researchers. The present study aims to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-COV-2 using the reverse vaccinology method. In this regard, structural proteins from SARS-COV-2, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, were selected as target antigens for epitope prediction. A total of five helper T lymphocytes (HTL) and five cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes were selected after screening the predicted epitopes for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Subsequently, the selected HTL and CTL epitopes were fused via flexible linkers. Next, the cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) as an adjuvant was linked to the N-terminal of the chimeric structure. The proposed vaccine was analyzed for the properties of physicochemical, antigenicity, and allergenicity. The 3D model of the vaccine construct was predicted and docked with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to evaluate the stable interactions between the vaccine construct and TLR4. The immune simulation was also conducted to explore the immune responses induced by the vaccine. Finally, in silico cloning of the vaccine construct into the pET-28 (+) vector was conducted. The results obtained from all bioinformatics analysis stages were satisfactory; however, in vitro and in vivo tests are essential to validate these results.","Sanami, Samira; Alizadeh, Morteza; Nosrati, Masoud; Dehkordi, Korosh Ashrafi; Azadegan-Dehkordi, Fatemeh; Tahmasebian, Shahram; Nosrati, Hamed; Arjmand, Mohammad-Hassan; Ghasemi-Dehnoo, Maryam; Rafiei, Ali; Bagheri, Nader",Comput Biol Med,,668

In a region that suffers from severe inequalities, public healthcare systems are the only source of medical care for a large sector of the population who work in the informal economy or are unemployed. State-run hospitals and clinics are already overstressed by continuous demand for treatment of vector-borne diseases and community-acquired infections as well as high rates of non-communicable diseases. Ideological misconceptions and denial among Latin America's political leaders prevented timely preparations for the pandemic and added to chronic governance problems. As ethical expertise in Latin America focuses on research ethics, few hospitals in the region have functioning clinical ethics committees or clinical ethics policy, forcing healthcare personnel to make excruciating treatment decisions in an environment dominated by material scarcity and public distrust. This essay examines the emergence of COVID-19 in Latin America and the serious challenge that it poses for Latin America's public healthcare systems.","Litewka, Sergio G; Heitman, Elizabeth",Dev World Bioeth,,668

This report aims to introduce the development of novel sustainable public health care systems with regard to COVID-19 in Japan: task sharing, securing staff, and task shifting. METHODS: A descriptive study. The Japan Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare enlisted good practices regarding resource allocation and developing full readiness for sustainable public health care systems in September 2020. RESULTS: Public health center developed systems for office support, infection control, hospital coordination, and outsourced inventory control. To reduce the workload of PHNs, a support team of three to four office workers developed a response manual for residents and a format for telephone consultations regarding COVID-19. Developing an infection control team and web-based system for hospital coordination decreased the workload of PHCs in each community to prepare for the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Public health center should consider managing limited human resources and focus on providing specialized care for COVID-19 patients. Task sharing, securing staff, and task shifting are crucial strategies for developing sustainable public health care systems.","Yoshioka-Maeda, Kyoko",Public health nurs,,668

However, previous studies have indicated possible cross-reactivity of these assays, including in areas where malaria is endemic. We tested 213 well-characterized prepandemic samples from Nigeria using two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, Abbott Architect IgG and Euroimmun NCP IgG assay, both targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. To assess antibody binding strength, an avidity assay was performed on these samples and on plasma from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive persons. Thirteen (6.1%) of 212 samples run on the Abbott assay and 38 (17.8%) of 213 run on the Euroimmun assay were positive. Anti-Plasmodium IgG levels were significantly higher among false positives for both Abbott and Euroimmun; no association was found with active Plasmodium falciparum infection. An avidity assay using various concentrations of urea wash in the Euroimmun assay reduced loosely bound IgG: of 37 positive/borderline prepandemic samples, 46%, 86%, 89%, and 97% became negative using 2 M, 4 M, 5 M, and 8 M urea washes, respectively. The wash slightly reduced avidity of antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients within 28 days of PCR confirmation; thereafter, avidity increased for all urea concentrations except 8 M. This validation found moderate to substantial cross-reactivity on two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays using samples from a setting where malaria is endemic. A simple urea wash appeared to alleviate issues of cross-reactivity.","Steinhardt, Laura C; Ige, Fehintola; Iriemenam, Nnaemeka C; Greby, Stacie M; Hamada, Yohhei; Uwandu, Mabel; Aniedobe, Maureen; Stafford, Kristen A; Abimiku, Alash039; le,; Mba, Nwando; Agala, Ndidi; Okunoye, Olumide; Mpamugo, Augustine; Swaminathan, Mahesh; Onokevbagbe, Edewede; Olaleye, Temitope; Odoh, Ifeanyichukwu; Marston, Barbara J; Okoye, McPaul; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Rangaka, Molebogeng X; Rogier, Eric; Audu, Rosemary",J Clin Microbiol,,668

NUT carcinoma is a rare, aggressive, poorly differentiated carcinoma genetically defined by chromosomal rearrangement of the nuclear protein in testis (NUTM1) gene. The prognosis is extremely poor, with a mean survival < 1 year. Recent publications suggest a multimodality treatment approach. In the existing literature, only a few reports of sinonasal NUT-C have been reported. Sinonasal NUT-C is considered a very rare entity, but because of its recent inclusion as a head and neck malignancy, its true prevalence is unknown. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with NUT-C of the sinonasal cavities. In the case reported, the coexistence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related nasal congestion delayed the diagnosis of NUT-C. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed together with a review of the literature.","Crocetta, Francesco Maria; Botti, Cecilia; Fornaciari, Martina; Castellucci, Andrea; Murri, Domenico; Santandrea, Giacomo; Piana, Simonetta; Ghidini, Angelo",Head Neck pathol,,668

Here, we present the case of a 45-year-old male patient with severe multiple sclerosis without disease-modifying therapy who was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia, treated with dexamethasone and Remdesivir, and then discharged. Subsequently, the patient was readmitted twice in the next month for complications arising from worsening dysphagia, musculoskeletal weakness, and neurogenic bladder. On the first of these re-admissions, the patient presented with altered mental status, secondary to uremic encephalopathy due to acute kidney injury precipitated by lack of adequate PO hydration. This admission was complicated by multiple pulmonary emboli necessitating transfer from the floor to the ICU, in addition to central line placement, candidemia, Pseudomonas urinary tract infection, and hemorrhagic cystitis. Despite this protracted course, the patient's mental function and orientation slowly improved as his renal function improved secondary to intravenous fluid administration. Because the patient's worsening dysphagia and weakness made adequate hydration by mouth untenable, the possibility of PEG tube placement was broached with the patient and his family. After consent was obtained, a PEG tube was placed, and the patient was subsequently discharged home under the care of his family. Two days after discharge, however, the patient presented to the Emergency Department, again with altered mental status due to uremic encephalopathy secondary to dehydration. During this admission, blood cultures also revealed Pseudomonal sepsis, likely secondary to recurrent UTI ultimately caused by neurogenic bladder. Accordingly, a suprapubic catheter was placed, and the care team worked with the patient's family to develop an adequate hydration regime before discharge. This case study suggests that COVID-19 may exacerbate ongoing neuropathological processes in patients with chronic neurological disease, and illustrates strategies clinicians and patients use to grapple with these changes.","Jaisankar, Prashanth Kucera Aurelia Chin Justin Lomiguen Christine",The FASEB Journal,,668

This study evaluated several mental health and well-being indicators in a large sample from the United Kingdom (UK) during the COVID-19 lockdown where the death rate is currently the highest in Europe. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey with a study sample that mirrors general population norms according to sex, age, education, and region was launched four weeks after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK. Measures included mental health-related quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), perceived stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests were applied to examine mental health indicators across different sociodemographic groups (age, sex, employment, income, physical activity, relationship status). RESULTS: The sample comprised N=1,006 respondents (54% women) from all regions of the UK. Approximately 52% of respondents screened positive for a common mental disorder, and 28% screened positive for clinical insomnia. Mean scores and standard deviations were as follows: PHQ-9: M=9.0±7.7; GAD-7: M=8.0±6.5; ISI: M=10.4±7.0; PSS-10: M=17.7±7.9; WHO-QOL BREF: M=58.6±21.4; WHO-5 score M=13.0±6.0. Statistical analyses consistently indicated more severe mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Mental health indices also varied across UK regions. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depressive-, anxiety-, and insomnia symptoms is significantly higher in the UK, relative to pre-pandemic epidemiological data. Further studies are needed to clarify the causes for these high rates of mental health symptoms.","Pieh, Christoph; Budimir, Sanja; Delgadillo, Jaime; Barkham, Michael; Fontaine, Johnny R J; Probst, Thomas",Psychosom Med,,668

Quantifying retention time is fundamental for assessing biological impact and for the use of plastic as bioindicators of plastic pollution. Presumably, plastic is retained in the grinding section of the stomach (gizzard or ventriculus) until ground small enough and particles then pass into intestines and are defecated. We assume that particle size is related to time in the ventriculus and compared size of plastic particles in juveniles, which were exposed to plastic for a known time, to non-juveniles which were exposed for an unknown longer period. Plastic particles from Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) were of similar size between groups suggesting similar wear and retention time. Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) juveniles contained larger particles than adults suggesting particles retained in adults were worn down and thus held for a longer period.","Nania, Tessa G; Shugart, Gary W",Mar Pollut Bull,,668

In addition, the efficacy of a copper surface for inactivation of human norovirus (HuNoV) GII.4 Sydney and GI.3B Potsdam strains was evaluated by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay. Results of time-dependent inactivation of viruses on copper, bronze, and brass coupons revealed that 15 min of surface treatments of each of the copper and copper alloys achieved >4-log reduction of purified TV, as assessed by plaque assay, while up to 20 min of copper alloy surface treatments only achieved â¼2-log reduction, as assessed by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay. As assessed by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay, 10 min of copper surface treatments achieved reductions of 3 and 4 log units for HuNoVs GII.4 Sydney and GI.3B Potsdam, respectively. Results from this study suggest that even though PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay underestimated the efficacy of copper alloy surface inactivation of TV, copper alloy surfaces were able to effectively inactivate TV and HuNoVs. Therefore, copper alloys can be used as a preventive measure to prevent HuNoV infection and are an effective surface treatment for HuNoVs.","Recker, Jordan D; Li, Xinhui",J Food Prot,,668

254661,Associating SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays with Protection: Where the Field Stands,2021,"The need for proven disease-specific treatments for the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a worldwide search for therapeutic options. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time. This review highlights potential therapeutic options that may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 and suggests opportunities for further research.","Santos, Jennifer; Brierley, Stephanie; Gandhi, Mohit J; Cohen, Michael A; Moschella, Phillip C; Declan, Arwen B L",Viruses,,668

257898,Humoral signatures of protective and pathological SARS-CoV-2 infection in children,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Many trials investigate potential effects of treatments for coronavirus disease 2019. To provide sufficient information for all involveddecision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, and drug regulatory agencies), a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. The objectives are to provide hands-on statistical guidelines for harmonizing heterogeneous endpoints in coronavirus disease 2019 clinical trials. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trials for patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019. SETTING: General methods that apply to any randomized controlled trial for patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Coronavirus disease 2019 positive individuals. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We develop a multistate model that is based on hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and discharge. These events are both categories of the ordinal endpoint recommended by the World Health Organization and also within the core outcome set of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials initiative for coronavirus disease 2019 trials. To support our choice of states in the multistate model, we also perform a brief review of registered coronavirus disease 2019 clinical trials. Based on the multistate model, we give recommendation for compact, informative illustration of time-dynamic treatment effects and explorative statistical analysis. A majority of coronavirus disease 2019 clinical trials collect information on mechanical ventilation, hospitalization, and death. Using reconstructed and real data of coronavirus disease 2019 trials, we show how a stacked probability plot provides a detailed understanding of treatment effects on the patients' course of hospital stay. It contributes to harmonizing multiple endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up both within and between trials. CONCLUSIONS: All ongoing clinical trials should include a stacked probability plot in their statistical analysis plan as descriptive analysis. While primary analysis should be on an early endpoint with appropriate capability to be a surrogate (parameter), our multistate model provides additional detailed descriptive information and links results within and between coronavirus disease 2019 trials.","von Cube, Maja; Grodd, Marlon; Wolkewitz, Martin; Hazard, Derek; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Canet, Emmanuel; Lambert, Jêrome",Crit Care Med,,668

264036,Tracing Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Carriers Among 3674 Hospital Staff,2020,"Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a widely distributed and highly conserved protein in organisms. It has peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and is a receptor for cyclosporin A (CsA). Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. Seven types of coronaviruses are currently known to infect humans, among which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are fatal for humans. It is well established that CypA is essential for the replication of various coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, CoV-229E, CoV-NL63, and FCoV. Additionally, CsA and its derivatives (ALV, NIM811, etc.) have obvious inhibitory effects on a variety of coronaviruses. These results suggest that CypA is a potential antiviral target and the existing drug CsA might be used as an anti-coronavirus drug. At the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 raged in China, which seriously theatern human health and causes huge economic lases. In view of this, we describe the effects of CypA on the replication of coronaviruses and the antiviral activities of its inhibitors, which will provide the scientific basis and ideas for the development of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2.","Tian, Lu; Liu, Wenjun; Sun, Lei",Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,,668

Vaccines are an essential countermeasure and are urgently needed to control the pandemic4. Here we show that the adenovirus-vector-based vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice and elicites a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was predominantly mediated by type-1 T helper cells, as demonstrated by the profiling of the IgG subclass and the expression of cytokines. Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (using either a prime-only or a prime-boost regimen) induced a balanced humoral and cellular immune response of type-1 and type-2 T helper cells in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated rhesus macaques that were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. However, there was no difference in nasal shedding between vaccinated and control SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques. Notably, we found no evidence of immune-enhanced disease after viral challenge in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy profiles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomized controlled clinical trials in humans.","van Doremalen, Neeltje; Lambe, Teresa; Spencer, Alexandra; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Purushotham, Jyothi N; Port, Julia R; Avanzato, Victoria A; Bushmaker, Trenton; Flaxman, Amy; Ulaszewska, Marta; Feldmann, Friederike; Allen, Elizabeth R; Sharpe, Hannah; Schulz, Jonathan; Holbrook, Myndi; Okumura, Atsushi; Meade-White, Kimberly; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Edwards, Nick J; Wright, Daniel; Bissett, Cameron; Gilbride, Ciaran; Williamson, Brandi N; Rosenke, Rebecca; Long, Dan; Ishwarbhai, Alka; Kailath, Reshma; Rose, Louisa; Morris, Susan; Powers, Claire; Lovaglio, Jamie; Hanley, Patrick W; Scott, Dana; Saturday, Greg; de Wit, Emmie; Gilbert, Sarah C; Munster, Vincent J",Nature,,668

Due to the increased incidence of multimorbidity in geriatric age groups, COVID-19 disease leads to more severe consequences in the elderly. We aimed to determine the effects of age, comorbidity factors, symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiological results on prognosis by dividing our patients into 3 different geriatric age groups, using a retrospective descriptive analysis method. Patients included in the retrospective study (n = 483) were divided into the following three different geriatric age groups: young-old (65-74 years), middle-aged (75-84 years), and the oldest-elderly (85 years and over).The length of stay in the intensive care unit of the patients between the ages of 75-84 was higher than the other two groups (p = 0.013). Mortality rates were lowest in patients aged 65-74 years (p < 0.001). The rate of ground glass opacity in thorax CT was higher in patients with mortality (p < 0.001). While the rate of COPD-bronchial asthma was higher in surviving patients (p = 0.001), malignancy (p = 0.005) and cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.001) were higher in patients who died. Patients aged between 75 and 84 (OR: 2.602; 95% CI: 1.306-5.183; p = 0.007) or &#8805; 85 (OR: 4.086; 95% CI: 1.687-9.9; p = 0.002) had higher risk for mortality compared to patients aged between 65 and 74. The lowest mortality rates were observed in patients aged 65-74 years. Among the supportive diagnostic methods in 3 different geriatric age groups, PCR positivity has no effect on mortality, while the ground glass opacity on tomography is closely related to the need for intensive care and increased mortality. In patients with COPD-bronchial asthma comorbidity and those with symptoms of fatigue, dry cough, and sore throat, transfer to intensive care and mortality rates were lower, while patients who were transferred to intensive care and who developed mortality had higher malignancy and cerebrovascular disease comorbidities and dyspnea symptoms.","Görgülü, Özkan; Duyan, Murat",SN Compr Clin Med,,668

We compared observed with expected deaths from epidemiological weeks 12-22 of 2020. We also compared the number of hospital and home deaths during the period. RESULTS: There were 65 449 deaths and 17 877 COVID-19 deaths in the studied period and cities for 2020. Cardiovascular mortality increased in most cities, with greater magnitude in the Northern capitals. However, while there was a reduction in specified cardiovascular deaths in the most cities, the Northern capitals showed an increase of these events. For unspecified cardiovascular deaths, there was a marked increase in all cities, which strongly correlated to the rise in home deaths (r=0.86, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Excess cardiovascular mortality was greater in the less developed cities, possibly associated with healthcare collapse. Specified cardiovascular deaths decreased in the most developed cities, in parallel with an increase in unspecified cardiovascular and home deaths, presumably as a result of misdiagnosis. Conversely, specified cardiovascular deaths increased in cities with a healthcare collapse.","Brant, Luisa Campos Caldeira; Nascimento, Bruno Ramos; Teixeira, Renato Azeredo; Lopes, Marcelo Antônio Cartaxo Queiroga; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Oliveira, Glaucia Maria Moraes; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz Pinho",Heart,,668
269327,Spontaneous pneumomediastinum occurring in the SARS-COV-2 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread worldwide, and the pathogenic mechanism is still under investigation. The presence of a huge inflammatory response, defined as ""cytokine storm,"" is being studied in order to understand what might be the prognostic factors implicated in the progression of the infection, with ferritin being one of such markers. The role of ferritin as a marker of inflammation is already known, and whether it changes differently between COVID and non-COVID patients still remains unclear. The aim of this retrospective analysis is to understand whether the inflammatory process in these two types is different. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we compared 17 patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, who had been admitted between February and April 2020 (group A) along with 30 patients admitted for acute surgical disease with SARS-CoV-2 negative swab (group B). A further subgroup of Covid negative patients with leukocytosis was compared to group A. RESULTS: In group A, the median (interquartile range) serum ferritin was 674 (1284) ng/mL, and it was double the cutoff (300 ng/mL) in 9 out of 17 (52%). The median (IQR) value of ferritin level in the total blood samples of group B was 231, and in the subgroup with leucocytosis, 149 (145). Group A showed a significantly higher ferritin median level compared to the entire group B (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001) as well as to the subgroup with leucocytosis (p < 0.0014). CONCLUSIONS: The role of iron metabolism appears to be directly involved in COVID infection. On the other hand, in the acute inflammation of patients admitted for surgery, and probably in other common phlogistic processes, iron modifications appear to be self-limited. However, our finding suggests the use of ferritin as a marker for COVID infection.","Banchini, Filippo; Cattaneo, Gaetano Maria; Capelli, Patrizio",World J Emerg Surg,,668
271520,Nationwide seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Israel,2021,"Clean cooking energy strategies are critical for reducing air pollution, improving health, and achieving related Sustainable Development Goals. The recent COVID-19 lockdowns may impact the transition towards clean cooking fuels. The nationwide lockdown is likely to affect key factors such as energy access, income, transportation, etc., that play a role in decisions influencing household fuel use. The rural population already bears the burden of poverty and may not be able to afford and access clean cooking fuels during the lockdown. They are thus vulnerable to reversion to their traditional cooking methods using solid biomass fuels. The household air pollution caused due to the use of polluting fuels increases their susceptibility to non-communicable diseases, and thus may intensify the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is an urgent need to expand sustainable energy solutions worldwide. The present study applies the DPSIR modeling framework to establish a set of comprehensive indicators for addressing the transition towards clean cooking fuels during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also provides insights on various strategies adopted in India in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for maintaining continuity of delivering benefits under a clean cookstove program. The study offers future directions to ensure the transition towards cleaner fuels and sustainability.","Ravindra, Khaiwal; Kaur-Sidhu, Maninder; Mor, Suman; Chakma, Joy; Pillarisetti, Ajay",Environ Int,,668

The study focuses on the university students from different public and private universities of Bangladesh through a set of questionnaires according to the guideline of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). The result among 15 543 respondents shows that 44.59% are suffering from severe anxiety, 48.41% moderate anxiety, and only 3.82% mild anxiety. The results highlight that all epidemic-related stressors are positively correlated with the level of anxiety. Among the epidemic-related stressors, worry about economic influences during and after COVID-19 (r = 0.342, p < 0.001) and worry about the influence of COVID-19 on daily life (r = 0.340, p < 0.001) have a highly positive impact on the level of anxiety. Following these stressors, worry about academic delays due to COVID-19 (r = 0.326, p < 0.001) and worry about the social support during COVID-19 (r = 0.321, p < 0.001) have moderately and positively correlated with the level of anxiety. The study suggests that proper government support, as well as social awareness, should be monitored during epidemics for decreasing anxiety and maintaining a good mental health of the university students.","Dhar, Bablu Kumar; Ayittey, Foster Kofi; Sarkar, Sabrina Maria",Glob Chall,,668

To train the models, the data of all stocks are split into train and test datasets. The test dataset starts from January 2020 to April 2021 which covers the COVID-19 pandemic period. The results show that the Autoregression and Last value models have higher accuracy in predicting the stock prices because of the strong correlation between the previous day and the next day's price value.

At the moment, there are no defined drugs, while few vaccines are available in the market to combat SARS-CoV-2. Several organic molecules were designed and tested against the virus but they did not show promising activity. In this work we designed two copper complexes from the ligands analogues with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Both the ligands and complexes were well characterized by using various spectroscopic, thermal and X-ray diffraction techniques. Both the complexes as well as ligands were screened through in silico method with the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which essentially proved pivotal for successful understanding towards the target protein and their mechanism of action. The results indicated that the balanced hydrophobic and polar groups in the complexes favor their binding in the active site of the viral ADP-ribose-1 monophosphatase enzyme over the parent organic molecules.","Ali, Arif; Sepay, Nasim; Afzal, Mohd; Sepay, Nayim; Alarifi, Abdullah; Shahid, M; Ahmad, Musheer",Bioorg Chem,,668
273831,"SARS-CoV-2 Serosurvey in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",2020,"INTRODUCTION: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Detroit, an earlier termination of resuscitation protocol was initiated in March 2020. To characterize pre-hospital cardiac arrest careduring COVID-19 in Detroit, we analyzed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) rate of ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) and patient characteristics before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: OHCA data was analyzed between March 10th, 2020 - April 30th, 2020 and March 10th, 2019 - April 30th, 2019. ROSC, patient demographics, arrest location, initial rhythms, bystander CPR and field termination were compared before and during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics were utilized to compare arrest characteristics between years, and the odds of achieving vs. not achieving ROSC. 2020 vs. 2019 as a predictor for ROSC was assessed with logistic regression. RESULTS: 471 patients were included. Arrests increased to 291 during the pandemic vs. 180 in 2019 (62% increase). Age (mean difference + 6; 95% CI: +2.4 to +9.5), arrest location (nursing home OR = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.42-4.31; public place OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.25-0.88), BLS response (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.47-0.99), and field termination of resuscitation (OR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.36-4.07) differed significantly in 2020 compared to 2019. No significant difference was found in the confounder-adjusted odds of ROSC in 2020 vs 2019 (OR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.34-1.11). CONCLUSION: OHCA increased by 62% during COVID-19 in Detroit, without a significant change in prehospital ROSC. The rate of ROSC remained similar despite the implementation of an early termination of resuscitation protocol in response to COVID-19.","Mathew, Shobi; Harrison, Nicholas; Chalek, Adam D; Gorelick, Damon; Brennan, Erin; Wise, Stefanie; Gandolfo, Lauren; O039,; Neil, Brian; Dunne, Robert",Am J Emerg Med,,668

Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity on a large scale. The primary objective of this national survey was to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic on surgical activities (elective non-oncological and oncological) in Belgian hospitals. METHODS: A nationwide, multicenter survey was conducted in Belgium by the Royal Belgian Surgical Society (RBSS) board. The questionnaire focused on digestive surgical activity at different time points: period 1 (P1), before the epidemic;period 2 (P2), lockdown;and period 3 (P3), after stabilization of the epidemic. RESULTS: The participation rate in the survey was 28.2% (24 out of 85 solicited hospitals), including 15 (62.5%) from the French speaking part of Belgium and 9 (37.5%) from the Flemish speaking part. Eighteen (75%) were non-academic and 6 (25%) were academic hospitals. All surgical activities were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic except for the number of cholecystectomies. No statistical differences were observed between regions or according to the type of hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our national survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak has severely impacted in-person consultations and surgical activity for benign and malignant disease and for acute appendicitis. However, procedures for benign disease were much more affected than those for malignancies.","Liberale, G.; Van Veer, H.; Lemaitre, J.; Duinslager, M.; Ysebaert, D.; De Roover, A.; de Gheldere, C.; Komen, N.",Acta Chir Belg,,668
282995,Dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway during SARS-CoV-2 infection: An in silico study,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The interaction of COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB) are still poor characterized. Here we evaluated the immune response specific for Micobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and SARS-CoV-2 using a whole-blood-based assay-platform in COVID-19 patients either with TB or latent TB infection (LTBI). METHODS: We evaluated IFN-Î³ level in plasma from whole-blood stimulated with Mtb antigens in the Quantiferon-Plus format or with peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (CD4-S). RESULTS: We consecutively enrolled 63 COVID-19, 10 TB-COVID-19 and 11 LTBI-COVID-19 patients. IFN-Î³ response to Mtb-antigens was significantly associated to TB status and therefore it was higher in TB-COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19 patients (p &#8804; 0.0007). Positive responses against CD4-S were found in 35/63 COVID-19 patients, 7/11 LTBI-COVID-19 and only 2/10 TB-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the responders in the TB-COVID-19 group were less compared to COVID-19 and LTBI-COVID-19 groups (p = 0.037 and 0.044, respectively). Moreover, TB-COVID-19 patients showed the lowest quantitative IFN-Î³ response to CD4-S compared to COVID-19-patients (p = 0.0336) and LTBI-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0178).

284654,A blueprint for academic laboratories to produce SARS-CoV-2 quantitative RT-PCR test kits,2020,"For decades, traditional drug discovery has utilized natural product and synthetic chemistry approaches to generate libraries of compounds, some ending as promising drug candidates. A complementary approach has been to adopt the concept of biomimicry of natural products and metabolites so as to improve multiple drug-like features of the parent molecule. In this effort, promiscuous and weak interactions between ligands and receptors are often ignored in a drug discovery process. In this emerging concepts' article, we highlight microbial metabolite mimicry, whereby parent metabolites have weak interactions with their receptors, that then have led to discrete examples of more potent and effective drug-like molecules. We show specific examples of parent metabolite mimics with potent effects in vitro and in vivo. Further we show examples of emerging microbial ligand-receptor interactions and provide a context in which these ligands could be improved as potential drugs. A balanced conceptual advance is provided in which we also acknowledge potential pitfalls - hyperstimulation of finely balanced receptor-ligand interactions could also be detrimental. However, on balance, we provide examples of where this emerging concept needs to be tested. Significance Statement The concept of microbial metabolite mimicry as a means to expand drug repertoires is new. Hitherto, there are very few proof-of-concept papers demonstrating utility of this concept. More recently, papers demonstrating mimicry of intestinal microbial metabolites could potentially expand the drug repertoire for diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We opine that as more functional metabolite-receptor pairings are discovered, small molecular mimicry could be a significant effort in drug discovery.","Dvorak, Zdenek; Klapholz, Max; Burris, Thomas P; Willing, Benjamin P; Gioiello, Antimo; Pellicciari, Roberto; Galli, Francesco; March, John; Sartor, Ryan B; Kim, Chang; Levy, Maayan; Mani, Sridhar; O039,; Keefe, Stephen J",Mol. pharmacol,,668

The scale of patients now being cared for in hospital-at-home settings as a result of COVID19 places huge pressure on hospital central sterile services departments (CSSDs) to provide consumable items to safely support such patients' care. This places new importance on the disinfection of mundane objects, including crockery, cutlery and frequently touched objects in the home environment. This study examined temperature performance of steam disinfectors and the consequences of potential operator misuse on the survival of 62 bacteria and yeast organisms. METHODS: Thermal performance of steam disinfectors was evaluated using calibrated thermocouple probes in multiple permutations of device usage with 62 test organisms. RESULTS: Thermocouple data demonstrated disinfection A0 values of 6000 (upper layer) and 60 (lower layer). Steam disinfection of baby bottles had a thermal lethality of at least A0 = 600. Variation in disinfector temperatures were noted, depending on the geometric location of thermocouples. Additional notable temperature reductions occurred with device underfilling with suboptimal water volumes. Steam disinfection eradicated all 62 non-spore-forming Gram-positive, Gram-negative and yeast organisms tested and eradicated all organisms in the inner teat space of contaminated babies' dummies, rendering safe steam disinfection of babies' dummies. CONCLUSION: Domestic steam disinfection offers an inexpensive, simple, versatile and widely available technology for the elimination of common non-spore-forming nosocomial pathogens and safe disinfection of medical devices, fomites and other mundane objects within the hospital-at-home scenario, thereby enhancing patient safety.","Millar, Beverley C; Stirling, Jonathan; Maguire, Mollie; Moore, Rachel E; Murphy, Alan; Moore, John E",Infect.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the rate, timing, causes, predictors and outcomes of 30-day readmission after COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: From 13 March to 9 April 2020, all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and discharged alive were included in this retrospective observational study. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of 30-day readmission, and a restricted cubic spline function was utilized to assess the linearity of the association between continuous predictors and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1062 patients were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up time of 62 days. The mean age of patients was 56.5 years, and 40.5% were women. At the end of the study, a total of 48 (4.5%) patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and a median time to readmission was 5 days. The most common primary diagnosis of 30-day readmission was a hypoxic respiratory failure (68.8%) followed by thromboembolism (12.5%) and sepsis (6.3%). The patients with a peak serum creatinine level of &#8805;1.29 mg/dL during the index hospitalization, compared to those with a creatinine of <1.29 mg/dL, had 2.4 times increased risk of 30-day readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.23-4.74). The mortality rate during the readmission was 22.9%. CONCLUSION: With 4.5% of the thirty-day readmission rate, COVID-19 survivors were readmitted early after hospital discharge, mainly due to morbidities of COVID-19.

289385,Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Surface plasmon resonance based sensors have emerged as a commercially fostering portable bio-detector. The scientific community is engaged in extensive research to improve its performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility for the recognition of specific biomolecules. Essentially, there is a need for miniaturizing the size of existing sensors with innovative designs without compromising its bio-affinity and sensitivity performance. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a grating-coupled surface plasmon polariton sensor on a thin flat gold layer using a hybrid configuration. The proof of concept of the grating architecture has been realized through an innovative fabrication procedure, with experimental verification of its bulk sensitivity. The geometry is identical to the prism-coupling configuration, yet, with miniaturization and compactness. Characteristics of the excited modes in the spectral regime of interest are investigated using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. The effective index calculation of the resonance conditions and the accompanying field distribution can identify the excited surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and metal-assisted guided-mode resonance (MaGMR) modes. Detailed probing of the electric field distribution of the desired SPP mode reveals an extended evanescent decay length of 1284 nm, close to the theoretical limit, and an extended propagation length of 270 µm. The experimental demonstration of reflectance dip with two different analyte media perceived an increased bulk sensitivity of 1133 nm/RIU. Remarkably, this resonant mode exhibits sensing capabilities for a wide range of analyte refractive index. We believe that the fabricated configuration with observed high-sensitivity and calculated ultra-deep evanescent field penetration depth along with extended propagation length can lead to the designing of a hands-on biochip for detecting large biomolecules.","Joseph, Shereena; Sarkar, Swagato; Joseph, Joby",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,668

METHODS: a cross-sectional study conducted with 402 videos from the YouTube sharing platform. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney and Spearman's correlation tests were used. RESULTS: the videos mainly covered COVID-19 prevention (20.6%). There was a positive correlation between video length and number of views (p<0.001). The length of more than 20 minutes was associated with narration only in BSL (p=0.37) and in BSL with audio (p<0.001), while videos with less than 20 minutes were associated with simultaneous narration in BSL, audio and subtitles. Those with narration only in BSL had a similar number of views to those narrated with subtitles and/or audio (p=0.998). CONCLUSION: the videos were mostly short and included COVID-19 prevention. The longer the video, the greater the number of views.

292271,Commentary on 'Will vaccination refusal prolong the war on SARS-CoV-2?',2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has swept more than 180 countries and territories since late January 2020. As a worldwide emergency response, governments have taken various measures and policies such as self-quarantine, travel restriction, work at home, and region lockdown, to control the rapid spread of this epidemic. The common concept of these countermeasures is to conduct human mobility restrictions as COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease with human-to-human transmission. It becomes an urgent request from medical experts and policymakers to effectively evaluate the effects of human restriction policies with the aid of big data and information technology. Thus, in this study, based on big human mobility data and city POI data, we design an interactive visual analytics system called EpiMob (Epidemic Mobility) to intuitively demonstrate and simulate how the human mobility, as well as the number of infected people, will change according to a certain restriction policy or a combination of policies. EpiMob is made up of a set of coupled modules: a data processing module for data cleansing, interpolation, and indexing; a simulation module based on a modified trajectory-based SEIR model; an interaction visualization module to interactively visualize the analytical results in light of user's settings. Through multiple case studies for the biggest city of Japan (i.e., Tokyo) and domain expert interviews, we demonstrate that our system can be beneficial to give an illustrative insight in measuring and comparing the effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control.","Zhang, Zhiwen; Yang, Chuang; Fan, Zipei; Jiang, Renhe; Chen, Quanjun; Song, Xuan; Science, Ryosuke Shibasaki Center for Spatial Information; Tokyo, The University of; City, SUSTech-UTokyo Joint Research Center on Super Smart; Science, Southern University of; Technology,",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03180v1.pdf,668

The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the 4 endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 CCP donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies against CoV2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a 2-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting desired therapeutics and understanding the complex immune responses elicited by CoV2 infection.","Morgenlander, William R; Henson, Stephanie N; Monaco, Daniel R; Chen, Athena; Littlefield, Kirsten; Bloch, Evan M; Fujimura, Eric; Ruczinski, Ingo; Crowley, Andrew R; Natarajan, Harini; Butler, Savannah E; Weiner, Joshua A; Li, Mamie Z; Bonny, Tania S; Benner, Sarah E; Balagopal, Ashwin; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C; Eshleman, Susan H; Casadevall, Arturo; Redd, Andrew D; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Ackerman, Margaret E; Pekosz, Andrew; Elledge, Stephen J; Robinson, Matthew; Tobian, Aaron Ar; Larman, H Benjamin",J. clin. invest,,668

Although the wellbeing and emotional resilience of healthcare professionals are key components of continuing healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have been observed in this period to experience serious psychological problems and to be at risk in terms of mental health. Therefore, this study aims to probe psychological resilience of healthcare workers. The findings of this study showed that in order to raise psychological resilience of healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic their quality of sleep, positive emotions and life satisfaction need to be enhanced. Psychological resilience levels of healthcare workers in their later years were found to be higher. Doctors constitute the group with the lowest levels of psychological resilience among healthcare workers. The current study is considered to have contributed to the literature in this regard. Primary needs such as sleep which are determinants of quality of life, life satisfaction and psychological resilience should be met.","Bozdag, Faruk; Ergün, Naif",Psychol Rep,,668

The optimal dosing of HCQ is unknown. Our goal was to integrate historic and emerging pharmacological and toxicity data to understand safe and efficacious HCQ dosing strategies for COVID-19 treatment. The data sources included were (i) longitudinal clinical, pharmacokinetic (PK), and virologic data from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who received HCQ with or without azithromycin (n = 116), (ii) in vitro viral replication data and SARS-CoV-2 viral load inhibition by HCQ, (iii) a population PK model of HCQ, and (iv) a model relating chloroquine PKs to corrected QT (QTc) prolongation. A mechanistic PK/virologic/QTc model for HCQ was developed and externally validated to predict SARS-CoV-2 rate of viral decline and QTc prolongation. SARS-CoV-2 viral decline was associated with HCQ PKs (P < 0.001). The extrapolated patient half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) was 4.7 µM, comparable to the reported in vitro EC50s . HCQ doses > 400 mg b.i.d. for &#8805;5 days were predicted to rapidly decrease viral loads, reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection, and shorten treatment courses, compared with lower dose (&#8804; 400 mg daily) regimens. However, HCQ doses > 600 mg b.i.d. were also predicted to prolong QTc intervals. This prolongation may have clinical implications warranting further safety assessment. Due to COVID-19's variable natural history, lower dose HCQ regimens may be indistinguishable from controls. Evaluation of higher HCQ doses is needed to ensure adequate safety and efficacy.","Garcia-Cremades, Maria; Solans, Belen P; Hughes, Emma; Ernest, Jacqueline P; Wallender, Erika; Aweeka, Francesca; Luetkemeyer, Anne F; Savic, Radojka M",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,668

However, its curative effects and feasibility have yet to be confirmed by formal evaluation and well-designed clinical trials. To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effects of CP with COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious disease treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Related studies were obtained from databases and screened according to the inclusion criteria. The data quality was assessed, and the data were extracted and pooled for analysis. RESULTS: 40 studies on CP treatment for infectious diseases were included. Our study found that CP treatment could reduce the risk of mortality, with a low incidence of adverse events, promote the production of antibodies, lead to a decline in viral load, and shorten the disease course. A meta-analysis of 15 controlled studies showed that there was a significantly lower mortality rate in the group treated with CP (pooled OR=0.32; 95% CI=0.19-0.52; p<0.001, I2=54%) compared with the control groups. Studies were mostly of low or very low quality, with a moderate or high risk of bias. The sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. The exclusion of heterogeneity indicated that the results were stable. CONCLUSIONS: CP therapy has some curative effect and is well tolerated in treating infectious diseases. It is a potentially effective treatment for COVID-19.","Sun, Mengyao; Xu, Yinghui; He, Hua; Zhang, Li; Wang, Xu; Qiu, Qing; Sun, Chao; Guo, Ye; Qiu, Shi; Ma, Kewei",Int J Infect Dis,,668

304885,Interim Guidance on Testing Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads within the respiratory tract is important to define the parameters controlling the severity of Covid-19. We examined the functional and structural consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a reconstituted human bronchial epithelium model. SARSCoV- 2 replication caused a transient decrease in epithelial barrier function and disruption of tight junctions, though viral particle crossing remained limited. Rather, SARS-CoV-2 replication led to a rapid loss of the ciliary layer, characterized at the ultrastructural level by axoneme loss and misorientation of remaining basal bodies. Downregulation of the master regulator of ciliogenesis Foxj1 occurred prior to extensive cilia loss, implicating this transcription factor in the dedifferentiation of ciliated cells. Motile cilia functionwas compromised by SARS-CoV-2 infection, as measured in a mucociliary clearance assay. Epithelial defense mechanisms, including basal cell mobilization and interferon-lambda induction, ramped up only after the initiation of cilia damage. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters further demonstrated the loss of motile cilia in vivo. This study identifies cilia damage as a pathogenic mechanism that could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 spread to the deeper lung parenchyma.","Robinot, R.; Hubert, M.; Dias De Melo, G.; Lazarini, F.; Bruel, T.; Smith, N.; Levallois, S.; Larrous, F.; Fernandes, J.; Gellenoncourt, S.; Rigaud, S.; Gorgette, O.; Thouvenot, C.; Trébeau, C.; Mallet, A.; Duménil, G.; Gobaa, S.; Etournay, R.; Lledo, P.

306238,A cluster of pneumonia associated with the SARS-Cov-2 outside of Wuhan related to a house-warming banquet,2020,"The coronavirus pandemic has seen a marked rise in medical disinformation across social media. A variety of claims have garnered considerable traction, including the assertion that COVID is a hoax or deliberately manufactured, that 5G frequency radiation causes coronavirus, and that the pandemic is a ruse by big pharmaceutical companies to profiteer off a vaccine. An estimated 30% of some populations subscribe some form of COVID medico-scientific conspiracy narratives, with detrimental impacts for themselves and others. Consequently, exposing the lack of veracity of these claims is of considerable importance. Previous work has demonstrated that historical medical and scientific conspiracies are highly unlikely to be sustainable. In this article, an expanded model for a hypothetical en masse COVID conspiracy is derived. Analysis suggests that even under ideal circumstances for conspirators, commonly encountered conspiratorial claims are highly unlikely to endure, and would quickly be exposed. This work also explores the spectrum of medico-scientific acceptance, motivations behind propagation of falsehoods, and the urgent need for the medical and scientific community to anticipate and counter the emergence of falsehoods.","Grimes, David Robert",PLoS One,,668

Several recently published studies emphasize the potential efficacy of mRNA vaccines in treating different types of malignant and infectious diseases where conventional vaccine strategies and platforms fail to elicit protective immune responses. mRNA vaccines have lately raised high interest as potent vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Direct application of mRNA or its electroporation into dendritic cells was shown to induce polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ mediated antigen-specific T cell responses as well as the production of protective antibodies with the ability to eliminate transformed or infected cells. More importantly, the vaccine composition may include two or more mRNAs coding for different proteins or long peptides. This enables the induction of polyclonal immune responses against a broad variety of epitopes within the encoded antigens that are presented on various MHC complexes, thus avoiding the restriction to a certain HLA molecule or possible immune escape due to antigen-loss. The development and design of mRNA therapies was recently boosted by several critical innovations including the development of technologies for the production and delivery of high quality and stable mRNA. Several technical obstacles such as stability, delivery and immunogenicity were addressed in the past and gradually solved in the recent years.This review will summarize the most recent technological developments and application of mRNA vaccines in clinical trials and discusses the results, challenges and future directions with a special focus on the induced innate and adaptive immune responses.","Heine, Annkristin; Juranek, Stefan; Brossart, Peter",Mol Cancer,,668
307856,"The isolation period should be longer: Lesson from a child infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Chongqing, China",2020,"INTRODUCTION: During this time ofintensified hardship and disruption due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, communities, practitioners, and state and local governments have had to rapidly implement and adapt strategies that support mental health and wellbeing during a global pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, and at least half of the top 10 leading causes of death have been associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). A number of established risk factors for suicide and ACEs may have been exacerbated by the pandemic, including loneliness and the lack of connectedness. METHOD: This article briefly considers the effects of COVID-19 on social connection and outlines the importance of adapting and developing programming and resources that address suicide and ACEs prevention during a time of infrastructure disruption. Practical Applications: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ways that many individuals are able to safely interact and socially connect due to public health prevention strategies implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19. Local, city, and state government, community organizations, and public health and medical practitioners should consider the adaptation and development of existing and new programming, resources, and activities that support and strengthen social connection. In addition to implementing programs, policies may help address systemic and structural barriers to social connection, such as access to parks and open space, public transportation, or digital connectivity.","Bledsoe, Martevia; Captanian, Alexis; Somji, Alisha",J Safety Res,,668

Data regarding the immunogenicity of anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 messenger RNA (anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA) vaccines in dialysis patients were published recently. We assessed the immunogenicity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in dialysis patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred-nine patients on hemodialysis (n = 85) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 24) have received two injections of 30-µg doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), that were administered intramuscularly 28 days apart. Those who were still seronegative after the second dose were given a third dose one month later. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested before and after vaccination. RESULTS: Ninety-one out of the 102 patients who had at least a one-month follow-up after the second (n = 97) or the third (n = 5) vaccine doses had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroconversion rate was 88.7% (86 out of 97 patients) among SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients at the initiation of vaccination. Receiving immunosuppressive therapy was an independent predictive factor for non-response to vaccination. CONCLUSION: Due to high immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccines, we strongly recommend prioritizing a two-doses vaccination of dialysis patients. A third dose can be required in non-responders to two doses. When possible, patients waiting for a kidney transplantation, should be offered the vaccine before transplantation.","Longlune, Nathalie; Nogier, Marie Béatrice; Miedougé, Marcel; Gabilan, Charlotte; Cartou, Charles; Seigneuric, Bruno; Del Bello, Arnaud; Marion, Olivier; Faguer, Stanislas; Izopet, Jacques; Kamar, Nassim",Nephrol. dial. transplant,,668

309784,Saliva sampling for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections in symptomatic patients and asymptomatic carriers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Disparities in COVID-19 testing-the pandemic's most critical but limited resource-may be an important but modifiable driver of COVID-19 inequities. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Missouri State Department Health and Senior Services on all COVID-19 tests conducted in the St. Louis and Kansas City regions. We adapted a well-established tool for measuring inequity-the Lorenz curve-to compare COVID-19 testing rates per diagnosed case among Black and White populations. RESULTS: Between 3/14/2020 and 9/15/2020, 606,725 and 328,204 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the St. Louis and Kansas City regions, respectively. Over time, Black individuals consistently had approximately half the rate of testing per case compared to White individuals. In the early period (3/14/2020 to 6/15/2020), zip codes in the lowest quartile of testing rates accounted for only 12.1% and 8.8% of all tests in the St. Louis and Kansas City regions, respectively, even though they accounted for 25% of all cases each region. These zip codes had higher proportions of residents who were Black, without insurance, and with lower median incomes. These disparities were reduced but still persisted during later phases of the pandemic (6/16/2020 to 9/15/2020). Lastly, even within the same zip code, Black residents had lower rates of tests per case compared to White residents. CONCLUSIONS: Black populations had consistently lower COVID-19 testing rates per diagnosed case compared to White populations in two Missouri regions. Public health strategies should proactively focus on addressing equity gaps in COVID-19 testing to improve equity of the overall response.","Mody, Aaloke; Pfeifauf, Kristin; Bradley, Cory; Fox, Branson; Hlatshwayo, Matifadza G; Ross, Will; Sanders-Thompson, Vetta; Joynt, Karen; Reidhead, Mat; Schootman, Mario; Powderly, William G; Geng, Elvin H",Clin. infect. dis,,668

Nous avons développé une technique de typage par clivage endonucléasique des hétéroduplexes (ENUHCT). Elle repose sur le mélange de deux produits PCR (une référence et un échantillon à étudier). Après dénaturation et réhybridation, on obtient des homoduplex (Ref/Ref, Var/Var) et potentiellement des hétéroduplex (Ref/Var). La nucléase clive les heteroduplex créant des fragments de taille différente selon le nombre et la position des mutations. Par électrophorèse capillaire, il est facile de détecter la présence de mutation(s) selon le nombre et à la taille des fragments. Matériels et méthodes La preuve de concept a été réalisée avec des souches virales (https://www.european-virus-archive.com/) cultivées en cellules Vero-E6 dans un laboratoire NSB3. Les extraits d’acides nucléiques correspondant à 500 prélèvements cliniques identifiés par séquençage ont été étudiés après codage aveugle. Amplification PCR : les primers sens (TTACCAGATGATTTTACAGGC) et reverse (AGACTTTAGGTCCACAAAC) [400nm] amplifient un fragment de 303 pb sous 25-μL avec 12,5μL de 2X Reaction Mix, 0,5μL de Superscript II RT/Platinum Taq Mix et 5μL d’ARN de culture ou 3μL d’ARN provenant d’échantillons biologiques (30min/50°C–2min/94°C, puis 40 fois 15s/94°C–20s/55°C–20s/68°C, puis 2min/72°C). Mismatch detection : les 2 produits de PCR sont mélangés vol/vol. Après dénaturation/hybridation, les réactifs du Kit SURVEYOR (IDT) sont ajoutés suivant le protocole et incubés pendant 1 heure à 42°C. Capillary electrophoresis : l’analyse des fragments est faite par électrophorèse capillaire (Caliper GXII) sur puce ADNerkinElmer avec LabChip GX Reviewer. Sanger sequencing : les produits de PCR ont été séquencés par Genewiz. Résultats Les résultats obtenus sont en parfaite correspondance avec les résultats théoriques. En associant une souche européenne avec variant UK on obtient 2 fragments (231/72 pb [mismatch en 501]) ;en associant variant UK et variant SA (180/123 pb [mismatch en 484]) ;en associant souche européenne et variant SA on obtient 4 fragments (180/123/72/51 [mismatch en 484 et 501]). De même, les résultats obtenus avec les prélèvements cliniques nous ont permis d’identifier correctement les variants connus et d’identifier de nouveaux variants. Ces derniers ont été confirmés par séquençage. Conclusion ENUHCT : – est simple, sensible, peu coûteuse ;– permet de détecter les variants reconnus et de découvrir des variants encore non répertoriés ;– peut être appliquée à d’autres microorganismes ;– permet de typer plus de 1000 échantillons par jour.","Lopez, E.; Coutard, B.; Lina, B.; Falchi, A.; de Lamballerie, X.; Charrel, R.",Infectious Diseases Now,,668

Disruption in care may be a barrier to identifying COVID-19 associated sequelae, such as mental health symptoms, among the immunocompromised. Our objectives were to evaluate COVID-19-related preventive behaviors, with a focus on canceling doctor's appointments as a proxy for continuity of care, and to compare COVID-19-related mental health symptoms among the immunocompromised with the general population. We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the publicly-available COVID-19 Household Impact Survey. We defined immunocompromised as adults with a self-reported diagnosis of ""a compromised immune system"" (n = 854, 7.6%). We adherence to self-reported COVID-19 preventive behaviors among immunocompromised adults to others using &#967;2-tests. We focused on continuity of care and estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among the immunocompromised using multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We evaluated associations of mental health symptoms with being immunocompromised using multinomial logistic regression and estimated conditional odds ratios (cOR) with 95% CIs. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to adhere to recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors, including washing or sanitizing hands (96.3% vs. 89.8%, &#967;2 <0.001), maintaining social distance (91.9% vs. 83.7%, &#967;2 <0.001), and canceling a doctor's appointment (47.1% vs. 29.7%, &#967;2 <0.001). Hispanic immunocompromised adults (aPR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12-1.92) and immunocompromised women (aPR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.56) were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments compared to non-Hispanic White immunocompromised adults and men, respectively. Immunocompromised adults reported higher odds of feeling nervous/anxious/on edge (cOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.44-2.51), depressed (cOR: 2.81, 95% CI: 2.17-3.64), lonely (cOR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.74-2.98), and hopeless (cOR: 2.86, 95% CI: 2.21-3.69) 3-7 days in the last week. Immunocompromised adults were more likely to cancel their doctor's appointments and report COVID19-related mental health symptoms. The continuity of care of immunocompromised adults should be prioritized through alternative interventions, such as telehealth.","Islam, Jessica Yasmine; Vidot, Denise Christina; Havanur, Amoghvarsha; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene",AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,,668

Method: This interventional self-controlled retrospective study included 31 eyes of 31 patients with deep corneal ulcers who underwent conjunctival flap surgery in a tertiary eye care unit between 2017 and 2019. Of these, 9 eyes exhibited corneal perforation. The follow-up period was 12 months. The primary outcome measures were restoring ocular surface integrity and secondary outcome measures were improvement in visual acuity and postoperative complications encountered. Results: Out of the total of 31 patients, 17 patients (55%) were males and 14 patients (45%) were females. The mean age was 56.03 ± 15.46 years. The mean disease duration was 64.10 ± 35.01 days, the mean diameter of the ulcer was 3.61 ± 1.02 mm and the mean depth of the ulcer was 70.65 ± 20.28% of the thickness of the cornea. The etiology was extensive and the corneal ulcers were categorized as infectious (12), noninfectious (16), and unknown (3). An anatomic cure was obtained in 29 (94%) of 31 eyes. Conjunctival flap surgery was unsuccessful in 2 eyes that required evisceration. The postoperative visual acuity (BCVA) improved in 13 (42%) of the 31 eyes, decreased in 9 eyes (29%) and remained unchanged in 9 eyes (29%). The most frequent complications after conjunctival flap surgery were pseudopterygium, cataract and corneal opacity and less frequent complications were glaucoma, astigmatism, flap retraction, corneal perforation and endophthalmitis.

319510,Evaluation of transport media for laboratory detection of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract swab specimens,2020,"BACKGROUNDFatal cases of COVID-19 are increasing globally. We retrospectively investigated the potential of immunologic parameters as early predictors of COVID-19.METHODSA total of 1018 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in our 2-center retrospective study. Clinical feature, laboratory test, immunological test, radiological findings, and outcomes data were collected. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and survival curves were plotted to evaluate their clinical utility.RESULTSThe counts of all T lymphocyte subsets were markedly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors, especially CD8+ T cells. Among all tested cytokines, IL-6 was elevated most significantly, with an upward trend of more than 10-fold. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, IL-6 levels of more than 20 pg/mL and CD8+ T cell counts of less than 165 cells/µL were found to be associated with in-hospital mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. Groups with IL-6 levels of more than 20 pg/mL and CD8+ T cell counts of less than 165 cells/µL had a higher percentage of older and male patients as well as a higher proportion of patients with comorbidities, ventilation, intensive care unit admission, shock, and death. Furthermore, the receiver operating curve of the model combining IL-6 (>20 pg/mL) and CD8+ T cell counts (<165 cells/µL) displayed a more favorable discrimination than that of the CURB-65 score. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed a good fit of the model, with no statistical significance.CONCLUSIONIL-6 (>20 pg/mL) and CD8+ T cell counts (<165 cells/µL) are 2 reliable prognostic indicators that accurately stratify patients into risk categories and predict COVID-19 mortality.FundingThis work was supported by funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81772477 and 81201848).","Luo, Miao; Liu, Jing; Jiang, Weiling; Yue, Shuang; Liu, Huiguo; Wei, Shuang",JCI insight,,668

320127,Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection with a different genotype,2020,"Background/Aims: We aimed to evaluate the distribution of abnormal liver-related biomarkers in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and explore the prognostic value of elevated liver enzymes and abnormal liver synthetic capacity with regards to patient mortality. Patients and Methods: This retrospective observational study included 80 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Data were collected from the electronic medical record system by a trained team of physicians. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), albumin, and prealbumin levels at admission and on day 7 after admission were collected. The primary outcome of the current study was patient mortality. Results: Abnormal ALT, AST, TB, albumin, and prealbumin levels were observed in 11 (13.8%), 15 (18.8%), 5 (6.3%), 22 (27.5%), and 31 (38.8%) patients, respectively. Male gender correlated with elevated ALT and AST levels (p = 0.027 and 0.036, respectively). Higher levels of AST and lower levels of albumin and prealbumin were associated with patient mortality (p = 0.009, 0.002, and 0.003, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified patient age (p = 0.013, HR 1.108) and prealbumin levels (p = 0.015, HR 0.986) as independent predictors for patient mortality. However, changes in liver-related biomarkers were not associated with poor outcome in multivariate analysis (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Abnormalities in albumin and prealbumin levels are common among COVID-19 patients and hypoprealbuminemia independently predicts adverse outcome and should be carefully considered in clinical practice. Moreover, changes in liver-related biomarkers is not a salient feature of COVID-19.","Li, Tao; Guo, Ying; Zhuang, Xianghua; Huang, Laigang; Zhang, Xingqian; Wei, Fengtao; Yang, Baohua",Saudi J Gastroenterol,,668

To protect healthcare workers from infection during airway management, some expert recommendations and guidelines recommended wearing P2/N95 masks, goggles or glasses, glove, face-shields, and gowns as standard personal protective equipment (PPE). Nevertheless, several simulation studies have suggested that the standard PPE may not fully protect healthcare workers. Dr. Hsien Yung Lai introduced an acrylic box (""aerosol box"") as a part of PPE during airway management. Since then, several companies and healthcare workers have made their own modified devices (""aerosol containment device""), and the use of such a device has spread worldwide, without being formally assessed for its effectiveness, efficacy and safety. Several simulation studies have indicated that ""aerosol containment device"" would make tracheal intubation more difficult. In addition, the device would prevent the spread of droplets from a patient, but may increase the risk of healthcare workers being exposed to a higher concentration of viral aerosols. Therefore, the current state of knowledge indicates that an ""aerosol containment device"" without vacuum mechanism has only limited efficacy in protecting healthcare workers from viral transmission.","Saito, Tomoyuki; Asai, Takashi",J. anesth,,668
324457,Absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pre-pandemic plasma from children and adults in Vietnam,2021,"The uncontrolled spread of the COVID-19 pandemic which originated in China created a global turmoil. While the world is still busy figuring out a cure for the deadly disease, scientists worked out on many theories and conducted several studies to establish a relationship between the infection and other known diseases. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are one of the major complications of this infection after the respiratory manifestations. Individuals with cardiovascular complication are said to be more susceptible to acquiring the infection because the novel coronavirus uses the ACE2 receptor for its entry inside the cell and there is a high level of ACE2 expression in individuals with cardiovascular complications because of the enzyme's anti-hypertrophic, anti-fibrotic and anti-hypertensive effects on the heart. Individuals who belong to the older age group are also more susceptible. Knowing the above information, it might seem that using ACE2 inhibitors would help to slow or prevent the entry of the novel coronavirus but it would also at the same time prove to have deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system as the protective functions of ACE2 would be lost. While the search for a cure still continues it has been stated many a times that the conditions might worsen with time and the only way to keep ourselves and our family safe would be to follow the appropriate social distancing methods and get a COVID test if we experience any of the major symptoms.","Pal, Aastha; Ahirwar, Ashok Kumar; Sakarde, Apurva; Asia, Priyanka; Gopal, Niranjan; Alam, Sana; Kaim, Kirti; Ahirwar, Pradeep; Sorte, Smita R",Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,,668

A eutanásia em animais tem seus procedimentos regulamentados pela resolução do Conselho Federal de Medicina Veterinária (CFMV) e CONCEA/2015. A experimentação animal tem grande importância nas pesquisas científicas, contribuindo para o desenvolvimento da ciência e da tecnologia. Animais de várias espécies são utilizados como cobaias, sendo os camundongos os mais utilizados e os mais conhecidos cientificamente. O método de eutanásia em um estudo in vivo é uma importante escolha e deve seguir as orientações das associações internacionais que regulamentam a eutanásia como uma morte humanitária. A escolha de um método de eutanásia está relacionada à facilidade do método, seu baixo custo, eficácia, disponibilidade e baixo risco ao manipulador. Porém, todas estas qualidades não comprovam que o método de escolha seja o que menos causa sofrimento ao modelo experimental. O estudo comparou o transcriptoma de cérebro de Mus musculus post-mortem. Para tanto realizou-se cinco diferentes metodologias de eutanásia: deslocamento cervical, guilhotina, overdose de xilazina/quetamina, overdose de tiopental e câmara CO2 em camundongos C57BL/6J. Os animais foram divididos em grupos de quatro individuos e seus cérebros foram coletados e destes extraídos o RNA total e realizou-se array de expressão com o GeneChip® MoGene 2.0 ST Array Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, EUA). As análises mostram 4.780 genes diferencialmente expressos no tecido cerebral para todos os tipos de morte e, entre estes, 65 descritos na literatura como gene expressos em situação de dor (PainGenesdb). Destes, quatro - Gfra2, Glra2, Grasp e Stoml3 apresentaram diferenças significativas quando as metodologias foram comparadas par a par. Os métodos físicos (guilhotina e deslocamento cervical) apresentaram menores tempos de IMCO, CO2 tempo intermediário e xilazina/quetamina o maior desvio padrão para tempo de morte. Conclui-se com este estudo que a eutanásia com deslocamento cervical foi método com melhor reprodutibilidade seguida da decapitação por guilhotina e que as metodologias de eutanásia estudada são similares desde que bem executadas.","CARVALHO, CAMILA XAVIER DE",,,668

This paper proposes a simple yet efficient and general-purpose network, called Sequential Region Generation Network (SRGNet), to jointly detect and segment the lesion areas of COVID-19. SRGNet can make full use of the supervised segmentation information and then outputs multi-scale segmentation predictions. Through this, high-quality lesion-areas suggestions can be generated on the predicted segmentation maps, reducing the diagnosis cost. Simultaneously, the detection results conversely refine the segmentation map by a post-processing procedure, which significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. The superiorities of our SRGNet over the state-of-the-art methods are validated through extensive experiments on the built COVID-19 database.","Wu, Jipeng; Zhang, Shengchuan; Li, Xi; Chen, Jie; Xu, Haibo; Zheng, Jiawen; Gao, Yue; Tian, Yonghong; Liang, Yongsheng; Ji, Rongrong",Pattern Recognit,,668

332277,A case of transient existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the respiratory tract with the absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response,2020,"INTRODUCTION: As of December 18, 2020, there have been nearly 17 million cases of COVID-19 in the United States. Early studies reported intubation rates between 12.2-29.2% with varying criteria between sites and as the pandemic has progressed. With the rapid spread of infection and increased use of ventilators, triage of patients based on factors such as their past medical history can help guide resource allocation. This retrospective study examined a large multi-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 infection to identify risk factors associated with intubation. METHODS: Adult patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter from December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020 with COVID-19 were included in the Cerner COVID-19 dataset, which was extracted from 62 hospital systems throughout the United States. Only patients with at least two previous visits in the past 5 years were included. ICD-10 diagnosis codes, demographic data, and discharge status were collected and classified based on intubation status. Logistic regression model identified independently associated risk factors for intubation. RESULTS:18,467 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, with 5,525 seen only in the ED and 12,942 hospitalized. The mean age was 54.3 ± 20.5 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 30.42 ± 11.72, 8,397 (45.6%) patients were male, and 938 (7.2%) were intubated. 1,829 (14.1%) patients died in the hospital and 4,185 (22.7%) had a non-routine discharge, which encompasses home health care, short-term hospital, other facility including intermediate care and skilled nursing home. Using multivariate logistic regression, patients who were intubated were more likely to present with stroke, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, septic shock, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and encephalopathy. From patient demographics and past medical history, male sex (p=0.011), age &gt; 35 (p=0.035 for 35-49 years old;p&lt;0.001 for &gt;50 years old), BMI &gt; 30 (p=0.013 for BMI 30-40;p=0.004 for BMI &gt;40), and previous respiratory failure (p=0.014) were independently associated with intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19, male sex, increased age, BMI &gt; 30, and previous respiratory failure were independently associated with the risk for intubation. Intubated patients were also more likely to present with stroke, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, septic shock, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and encephalopathy. Clinicians should be aware of these independent risk factors for intubation to facilitate resource allocation and minimize the possibility of unanticipated crash intubations.","Gangu, K.; Shyu, D.; Baskett, W.; Murugesan, R.; Harleen, C.; Myers, D.; Shyu, C.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,668

This stoppage has led to the cancellation of a large number of hip and knee arthroplasties. The effect of this on patients' physical mental and economic health is unknown. METHODS: A survey was developed by the AAHKS Research Committee to assess pain, anxiety, physical function, and economic ability of patients to undergo a delayed operation. Six institutions conducted the survey to 360 patients who had to have elective hip and knee arthroplasty cancelled between March and July of 2020. RESULTS: Patients were most anxious about the uncertainty of when their operation could be rescheduled. Although 85% of patients understood and agreed with the public health measures to curb infections, almost 90% of patients plan to reschedule as soon as possible. Age and geographic region of the patients affected their anxiety. Younger patients were more likely to have financial concerns and concerns about job security. Patients in the Northeast were more concerned about catching COVID-19 during a future hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from the pain of hip and knee arthritis continue to struggle with pain from their end-stage disease. They have anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic. Few patients feel they will be limited financially and 90% want to have surgery as soon as possible. Age and physical location of the patients affect their causes for anxiety around their future surgery.","Brown, Timothy S; Bedard, Nicholas A; Rojas, Edward O; Anthony, Christopher A; Schwarzkopf, Ran; Barnes, C Lowry; Stambough, Jeffrey B; Mears, Simon C; Edwards, Paul K; Nandi, Sumon; Prieto, Hernan A; Parvizi, Javad",J Arthroplasty,,668

Increased access to specialist care in a regional setting is an additional benefit. Variation in diagnostic accuracy of telehealth consultations may affect diagnosis and management. Therefore, our aim is to determine the diagnostic concordance of telemedicine for otolaryngology in an Australian regional setting with physical consultations. METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted for all patients who received an initial telemedicine appointment over a 7-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in regional Victoria, Australia. Data were collected regarding initial diagnosis and management from telemedicine consultations, subsequent physical appointment findings and management and intraoperative findings. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (version 8.0, GraphPad). RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were included. The most common conditions referred were for consideration of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy (44.0%). Overall diagnostic concordance of the initial referrer was 63.3% and for telephone appointments, it was 81.9%. Concordance of recommended treatment plans between telephone and physical appointments was 96.9%. CONCLUSION: Although physical appointments are an essential aspect of practice in OHNS, there are significant benefits of phone only telemedicine within the context of a global pandemic which were compounded by a regional setting. Paediatric patients were found to have the highest concordance of diagnosis and treatment plans.","Kwok, Matthew; Hunn, Samuel; Tan, Hannah; Borschmann, Michael",ANZ j. Surg,,668

Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43,000 confirmed cases as of 1 September 2020. AIM: In cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19, in addition to their mandatory reporting system. METHODS: Patients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive polymerase chain-reaction test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data were collected in a customised case report form based on World Health Organisation recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms was more than 5 days after the patient&rsquo;s admission date. RESULTS: As of 1 September 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168, 59.5%), and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778, 76.2%), with a median age of 68 (interquartile range 54&ndash;79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported, with hypertension (1481, 61.7%), cardiovascular diseases (948, 39.5%) and diabetes (660, 27.5%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4, 21.1%), haematological and oncological diseases (3, 15.8%) were the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4%) episodes, mostly respiratory diseases (2470, 93.2% in adults; 16, 55.2% in children), and renal (681, 25.7%) and cardiac (631, 23.8%) complications for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7, 24.1%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989, 76.1%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8%) episodes. A total of 527 (14.5%) deaths were registered, all among adults. CONCLUSION: The surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a robust set of data for Switzerland by including about 80% (compared with official statistics) of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 hospitalised patients, with similar age and comorbidity distributions. It adds detailed information on the epidemiology, risk factors and clinical course of these cases and, therefore, is a valuable addition to the existing mandatory reporting.","Thiabaud, Amaury; Iten, Anne; Balmelli, Carlo; Senn, Laurence; Troillet, Nicolas; Widmer, Andreas; Flury, Domenica; Schreiber, Peter W; Vázquez, Miriam; Damonti, Lauro; Buettcher, Michael; Vuichard-Gysin, Danielle; Kuhm, Christoph; Cusini, Alexia; Riedel, Thomas; Nussbaumer-Ochsner, Yvonne; Gaudenz, Roman; Heininger, Ulrich; Berger, Christoph; Zucol, Franziska; Bernhard-Stirnemann, Sara; Corti, Natascia; Zimmermann, Petra; Uka, Anita; Niederer-Loher, Anita; Gardiol, Céline; Roelens, Maroussia; Keiser, Olivia",Swiss Med Wkly,,668
351861,"Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2: Discrete SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) Modeling Using Empirical Infection Data",2020,"BACKGROUND: With the accelerated aging of the Chinese population, elder abuse has become a serious social problem. As COVID-19 has had a very large impact on economic development and lifestyle in China, it has also affected elder abuse. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of elder abuse in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify changes in risk factors for elder abuse in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional study. In Hunan Province, a face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted among elderly people over 65 years of age. To ensure the consistency of the measurement standards, we used the elder abuse questionnaire from the ""Third Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status."" According to related research, we selected 10 victim-related risk factors as independent variables. A logistic regression model was established to analyze the relationship between the independent variables and the four kinds of abuse. RESULTS: We collected 10,362 samples from Hunan Province. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of financial abuse and neglect was significantly higher than that in 2010. Income had a significant impact on the four types of abuse. The lower the income was, the greater the risk of abuse. Moreover, factors such as an older age, being a woman, a lower cognitive ability, and not having a cohabiting spouse increased the possibility of abuse. The greater the number of children was, the greater the risks of physical abuse, financial abuse, and elder neglect. Seniors with higher education levels, those who frequently participated in social activities, and those with religious beliefs were less likely to suffer abuse. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 epidemic, the prevalence of elder abuse in China has increased, which may be related to economic instability and social distancing measures. Increasing the income of the elderly and giving them more social support are important measures to reduce the prevalence of elder abuse.","Du, Pengcheng; Chen, Yu",BMC Public Health,,668

Approximately one third of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have neurological disorders, especially those classified as severe cases and that require mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, almost nine out of 10 patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit could not breathe spontaneously, thus requiring invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support. So far, whether early neurological disorders such as hyposmia or anosmia, dysgeusia or ageusia, headache and vertigo are significant in the progression to the severe form of the disease or whether they are related to entry to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves has not been determined. Considering the great similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and that the severity of the condition that leads to death cannot be explained solely by lung involvement, it is important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 potential invasion to the central nervous system is partially responsible for the severe respiratory component observed in patients with COVID-19.","Grijalva-Otero, Israel",Gac Med Mex,,668

The method uses beamforming feedback matrices (BFMs) contained in the captured frames, which is a rotation matrix of channel state information (CSI). BFMs are transmitted unencrypted and easily obtained using frame capturing, requiring no specific firmware or WiFi chipsets, unlike the methods that use CSI. Such properties of BFMs allow us to apply frame capturing to various sensing tasks, e.g., vital sensing. In the proposed method, principal component analysis is applied to BFMs to isolate the effect of the chest movement of the subject, and then, discrete Fourier transform is performed to extract respiratory rates in a frequency domain. Experimental evaluation results confirm that the frame-capture-based respiratory rate estimation can achieve estimation error lower than 3.2 breaths/minute.","Kanda, T.; Sato, T.; Awano, H.; Kondo, S.; Yamamoto, K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03170v2.pdf,668

Biologics used to modulate hC5a are predominantly monoclonal antibodies. Here we present data to support an alternative therapeutic approach based on the specific inactivation of hC5a by ScpA in studies using recombinant hC5a (rhC5a). Initial characterization of ScpA confirmed activity in human serum and against rhC5a desArg (rhC5adR), the predominant hC5a form in blood. A new FRET based enzyme assay showed that ScpA cleaved rhC5a at near physiological concentrations (K m 185 nM). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies established a high affinity ScpA-rhC5a interaction (K D 34 nM, K D ITC 30.8 nM). SPR analyses also showed that substrate binding is dominated (89% of &#916;G°bind) by interactions with the bulky N-ter cleavage product (PN, 'core' residues 1-67) with interactions involving the C-ter R74 contributing most of the remaining &#916;G°bind. Furthermore, reduced binding affinity following mutation of a subset of positively charged Arginine residues of PN and in the presence of higher salt concentrations, highlighted the importance of electrostatic interactions. These data provide the first in-depth study of the ScpA-C5a interaction and indicate that ScpA's ability to efficiently cleave physiological concentrations of C5a is driven by electrostatic interactions between an exosite on the enzyme and the 'core' of C5a. The results and methods described herein will facilitate engineering of ScpA to enhance its potential as a therapeutic for excessive immune response to infectious disease.","Tecza, Malgorzata; Kagawa, Todd F; Jain, Monica; Cooney, Jakki C",,,668

This study aimed to investigate: (1) physical activity (PA) levels, sedentary behavior (SB), and sleep in young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, and (2) the change in these behaviors before and during the pandemic. A total of 631 young adults (38.8% males) aged between 18 and 35 participated in the cross-sectional study and completed a one-off online survey relating to general information, PA, SB, and sleep. For the longitudinal study, PA, SB, and sleep data, obtained from 70 participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed. Participants engaged in low PA, high SB, and long sleep duration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, a significant decline in PA while an increase in time spent in both SB and sleep was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results of this study demonstrated a sedentary lifestyle in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, which will assist health policymakers and practitioners in the development of population specific health education and behavior interventions during this pandemic and for other future events.","Zheng, Chen; Huang, Wendy Yajun; Sheridan, Sinead; Sit, Cindy Hui-Ping; Chen, Xiang-Ke; Wong, Stephen Heung-Sang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,668

Whether life interventions can be an alternative therapy for COVID-19 patients, accompanied with anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder, is controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of life interventions on anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder in COVID-19 patients to provide some guidance for clinical application. METHODS: The randomized controlled trials related to the life intervention and COVID-19 from inception to February 2021 will be searched. The following databases are our focused areas: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wan Fang Database. Two investigators would independently screen the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extract data, and evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: The results will provide a high-quality synthesis of current evidence for researchers in this subject area.

358613,The Indirect Benefit on Respiratory Health From the World's Effort to Reduce Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease with no absolute cure. Although the exact etiopathogenesis of SLE is still enigmatic, it has been well demonstrated that a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors trigger a disturbance in immune responses and thereby participate in the development of this condition. Almost all available therapeutic strategies in SLE are primarily based on the administration of immunosuppressive drugs and are not curative. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a subset of non-hematopoietic adult stem cells that can be isolated from many adult tissues and are increasingly recognized as immune response modulating agents. MSC-mediated inhibition of immune responses is a complex mechanism that involves almost every aspect of the immune response. MSCs suppress the maturation of antigen-presenting cells (DC and MQ), proliferation of T cells (Th1, T17, and Th2), proliferation and immunoglobulin production of B cells, the cytotoxic activity of CTL and NK cells in addition to increasing regulatory cytokines (TGF-ß and IL10), and decreasing inflammatory cytokines (IL17, INF-Ï, TNF-&#945;, and IL12) levels. MSCs have shown encouraging results in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, in particular SLE. This report aims to review the beneficial and therapeutic properties of MSCs; it also focuses on the results of animal model studies, preclinical studies, and clinical trials of MSC therapy in SLE from the immunoregulatory aspect.","Radmanesh, Fereshteh; Mahmoudi, Mahmoud; Yazdanpanah, Esmaeil; Keyvani, Vahideh; Kia, Nadia; Nikpoor, Amin Reza; Zafari, Parisa; Esmaeili, Seyed-Alireza",IUBMB life,,668

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among these populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Guided by the health belief model, a cross-sectional study design was employed among 335 participants, and primary data were collected through an online survey. Measured using DASS-21, anxiety, depression, and stress were the dependent variables. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses-logistic regression was used to predict independently associated variables. STATA was used to execute all data analyses. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers were 10.15, 9.25, and 2.39%, respectively. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among those aged 21-30 years old, who had completed a university degree, were married, and had quarantined for 14 days. Conversely, the risk of anxiety and depression was high among those who had bad perceived health status, high perceived susceptibility, and negative stigma perception. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers was relatively low compared to the general population. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among young people, educated people, and those under effective quarantine, but the risk was high among those who had negative perceptions about their health, stigma, and susceptibility to the disease.","Harjana, Ngakan Putu Anom; Januraga, Pande Putu; Indrayathi, Putu Ayu; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; Ward, Paul Russell",Front Public Health,,668

This paper was to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) and influenza A (H1N1) virus infections. METHODS: We included patients who had been hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2 (n = 83), H7N9 (n = 36), H1N1 (n = 44) viruses. Clinical presentation, chest CT features, and progression of patients were compared. We used the Logistic regression model to explore the possible risk factors. RESULTS: Both COVID-19 and H7N9 patients had a longer duration of hospitalization than H1N1 patients (P < 0.01), a higher complication rate, and more severe cases than H1N1 patients. H7N9 patients had higher hospitalization-fatality ratio than COVID-19 patients (P = 0.01). H7N9 patients had similar patterns of lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and those seen in H1N1 patients, which were all significantly different from patients with COVID-19 (P < 0.01). Either H7N9 or H1N1 patients had more obvious symptoms, like fever, fatigue, yellow sputum, and myalgia than COVID-19 patients (P < 0.01). The mean duration of viral shedding was 9.5 days for SARS-CoV-2 vs 9.9 days for H7N9 (P = 0.78). For severe cases, the meantime from illness onset to severity was 8.0 days for COVID-19 vs 5.2 days for H7N9 (P < 0.01), the comorbidity of chronic heart disease was more common in the COVID-19 patients than H7N9 (P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that chronic heart disease was a possible risk factor (OR > 1) for COVID-19, compared with H1N1 and H7N9. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of severe cases were higher for H7N9 and SARS-CoV-2 infections, compared with H1N1. The meantime from illness onset to severity was shorter for H7N9. Chronic heart disease was a possible risk factor for COVID-19.The comparison may provide the rationale for strategies of isolation and treatment of infected patients in the future.","Deng, Li-Si; Yuan, Jing; Ding, Li; Chen, Yuan-Li; Zhao, Chao-Hui; Chen, Gong-Qi; Li, Xing-Hua; Li, Xiao-He; Luo, Wen-Tao; Lan, Jian-Feng; Tan, Guo-Yu; Tang, Sheng-Hong; Xia, Jin-Yu; Liu, Xi",Infect Dis Poverty,,668

374321,Reinfection with two genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 viruses within 19 days,2021,"As the Coronavirus contagion develops, it is increasingly important to understand the dynamics of the disease. Its severity is best described by two parameters: its ability to spread and its lethality. Here, we combine a mathematical model with a cohort analysis approach to determine the range of case fatality rates (CFR). We use a logistical function to describe the exponential growth and subsequent flattening of COVID-19 CFR that depends on three parameters: the final CFR (L), the CFR growth rate (k), and the onset-to-death interval (t0). Using the logistic model with specific parameters (L, k and t0), we calculate the number of deaths each day for each cohort. We build an objective function that minimizes the root mean square error between the actual and predicted values of cumulative deaths and run multiple simulations by altering the three parameters. Using all of these values, we find out which set of parameters returns the lowest error when compared to the number of actual deaths. We were able to predict the CFR much closer to reality at all stages of the viral outbreak compared to traditional methods. This model can be used far more effectively than current models to estimate the CFR during an outbreak, allowing for better planning. The model can also help us better understand the impact of individual interventions on the CFR. With much better data collection and labeling, we should be able to improve our predictive power even further.","Narayanan, Charit Samyak",PLoS One,,668

Since the beginning of this infection in India, the government implemented several policies and restrictions to curtail its spread among the population. As the time passed, these restrictions were relaxed and people were advised to follow precautionary measures by themselves. These timely decisions taken by the Indian government helped in decelerating the spread of COVID-19 to a large extent. Despite these decisions, the pandemic continues to spread and hence, there is an urgent need to plan and control the spread of this disease. This is possible by finding the future predictions about the spread. Scientists across the globe are working towards estimating the future growth of COVID-19. This paper proposes a Modified SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model for projecting COVID-19 infections in India and its five states having the highest number of total cases. In this model, exposed compartment contains individuals which may be asymptomatic but infectious. Deep Learning based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model has also been used in this paper to perform short-term projections. The projections obtained from the proposed Modified SEIRD model have also been compared with the projections made by LSTM for next 30 days. The epidemiological data up to 15th August 2020 has been used for carrying out predictions in this paper. These predictions will help in arranging adequate medical infrastructure and providing proper preventive measures to handle the current pandemic. The effect of different lockdowns imposed by the Indian government has also been used in modelling and analysis in the proposed Modified SEIRD model. The results presented in this paper will act as a beacon for future policy-making to control the COVID-19 spread in India.","Bedi, Punam; Shivani,; Gole, Pushkar; Gupta, Neha; Jindal, Vinita",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06457v1.pdf,668
376620,Membrane cholesterol and SARS-CoV-2 infection: a possible connection,2020,"A recent global outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to massive supply chain disruption, resulting in difficulties for manufacturers on recovering their supply chains in a short term. This paper presents a supply chain disruption recovery strategy with the motivation of changing the original product type to cope with that. In order to maximize the total profit from product changes, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed with combining emergency procurement on the supply side and product changes by the manufacturer as well as backorder price compensation on the demand side. The model uses a heuristic algorithm based on ILOG CPLEX toolbox. Experimental results show that the proposed disruption recovery strategy can effectively reduce the profit loss of manufacturer due to late delivery and order cancellation. It is observed that the impact of supply chain disruptions is reduced. The proposed model can offer a potentially useful tool to help the manufacturers decide on the optimal recovery strategy whenever the supply chain system experiences a sudden massive disruption.","Chen, Jingzhe; Wang, Hongfeng; Zhong, Ray Y",,,668

With the number of cases increasing rapidly, the epidemiological data on the nutritional practice is scarce. In this study, we aim to describe the clinical characteristics and nutritional practice in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter, ambidirectional cohort study conducted at 11 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. All eligible critical COVID-19 patients in the study hospital intensive care units at 00:00, March 6th, 2020, were included. Data collection was performed via written case report forms. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were identified and enrolled, of whom eight died during the 28-day outcome follow- up period. The median interval between hospital admission and the study day was 24 (interquartile range, 13- 26) days and 52.2% (23 of 44) of patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation. The median nutrition risk in critically ill (mNUTRIC) score was 3 (interquartile range, 2-5) on the study day. During the enrolment day, 68.2% (30 of 44) of patients received enteral nutrition (EN), while 6.8% (3 of 44) received parenteral nutrition (PN) alone. Nausea and aspiration were uncommon, with a prevalence of 11.4% (5 of 44) and 6.8% (3 of 44), respectively. As for energy delivery, 69.7% (23 of 33) of patients receiving EN and/or PN were achieving their prescribed targets. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that EN was frequently applied in critical COVID-19 patients. Energy delivery may be suboptimal in this study requiring more attention.","Lin, Jiajia; Ke, Lu; Doig, Gordon S; Ye, Bo; Jiang, Zhengying; Liu, Zhiyong; Guo, Feng; Yin, Jiangtao; Yu, Wenkui; Sun, Jiakui; Sun, Liqun; Ding, Renyu; Xu, Hongyang; Chang, Zhigang; Long, Yi; Qian, Yajun; Tong, Zhihui; Li, Weiqin",Asia Pac J Clin Nutr,,668
380000,Digital PCR is a sensitive new technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical applications,2020,"Scholarly studies have revealed that exposure to statistics courses affect students’ anxiety levels and that this has been associated with unethical misconduct. Thus, the present research’s main objective is to comprehend the mediating role Statistics Anxiety plays on the relationship comprising students’ personality traits and academic dishonesty as manifesting before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its aim is to understand this phenomenon and provide theoretical tools for fostering sustainably personalized distance learning and instruction. Data were collected from students studying for a bachelor’s degree in the social sciences at three different Israeli colleges. The sample comprises 316 participants and data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results show a significant mediation manifested by an indirect effect between personality traits and academic dishonesty via statistics anxiety only in emergency remote teaching, although no parallel significant mediation was observed in the face-to-face course. These results could be explained by differences in delivery methods. Thus, we recommend that in the emergency remote teaching environment instructors’ presence include: (1) supportive, emphatic interaction to reduce virtual distance and (2) Social Emotional Learning (SEL) strategies, which foster students’ learning challenges and prevent anxiety and academic dishonesty.","Steinberger, Pnina Eshet Yovav Grinautsky Keren",Sustainability,,668

The molecular hypoxia response pathway has been associated with such pathologies and our recent observations on anti-hypoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of whole aqueous extract of Adhatoda Vasica (AV) prompted us to explore its effects on relevant preclinical mouse models. METHODS: In this study, we tested the effect of whole aqueous extract of AV, in murine models of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis, Cecum Ligation and Puncture (CLP) induced sepsis, and siRNA induced hypoxia-thrombosis phenotype. The effect on lung of AV treated naïve mice was also studied at transcriptome level. We also determined if the extract may have any effect on SARS-CoV2 replication. RESULTS: Oral administration AV extract attenuates increased airway inflammation, levels of transforming growth factor-ß1 (TGF-ß1), IL-6, HIF-1&#945; and improves the overall survival rates of mice in the models of pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis and rescues the siRNA induced inflammation and associated blood coagulation phenotypes in mice. We observed downregulation of hypoxia, inflammation, TGF-ß1, and angiogenesis genes and upregulation of adaptive immunity-related genes in the lung transcriptome. AV treatment also reduced the viral load in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV2.

All measures, especially in the first wave of the pandemic, were in combination with recommendations provided by professional and scientific organizations. Similar measures were applied to specific procedures, such as the management of infertility, including in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatments. Although there is no clear scientific evidence yet that the SARS-CoV-2 may exert negative effects on IVF outcome, especially at the early stages, several clinical reports indicate that the virus may impact male fertility through specific receptors presented at the somatic cells of the testis and used by the virus in order to gain entry to the respective cells. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to suspect that the virus may affect sperm function as well as oocyte performance directly through specific receptors or indirectly through other signaling pathways. Despite the good practice of IVF laboratory techniques, culture media may also be contaminated during equilibration when airborne virus's particles can contaminate culture media from an already infected embryology area or staff. Furthermore, although there is no clinical evidence, liquid nitrogen could be a route of infection for gametes and embryos when it has been contaminated during production or transportation. Therefore, cryopreservation of gametes and embryos must be virus-free. This communication aims to provide some aspects of the possible impact of the virus on gametes and embryos and how it may affect the cryopreservation procedures.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: embryo transfer; FSH: follicle stimulating hormone; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IVF: in vitro fertilization; LH: luteinizing hormone; LN: liquid nitrogen; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T: testosterone; WHO: World Health Organization.","Anifandis, George; Messini, Christina I; Simopoulou, Mara; Sveronis, George; Garas, Antonios; Daponte, Alexandros; Messinis, Ioannis E",Syst Biol Reprod Med,,668

SARS-CoV­2 replicates mainly in the upper and lower respiratory tract and is primarily transmitted by droplets from asymptomatic and symptomatic infected subjects. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R) is currently between 2 and 3, while the incubation period is 6 (median, range 2-14) days. Although most infections are uncomplicated, 5-10% of cases develop pneumonia, which can lead to hospitalization, respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for a complicated disease course include age, hypertension, chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency. The overall case fatality rate is 1.4%, with the rate rising in the sixth decade of life. Nosocomial and infections in medical personnel have been reported. Drastic reductions in social contact have been implemented in many countries with outbreaks of SARS-CoV­2, leading to rapid reductions in R. Which of the measures have been effective is still unknown.","Salzberger, B; Buder, F; Lampl, B; Ehrenstein, B; Hitzenbichler, F; Hanses, F",Internist (Berl),,668

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nationwide study including 66 patients in follow-up at Danish haematology departments with a malignant or non-malignant haematological disorder and with verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and one-month survival rate. RESULTS: Mean age was 66.7 years, 60.6% were males, 90.9% had comorbidity, and 13.6% had a BMI &#8805; 30. The most frequent diagnoses were chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma (47.0%), multiple myeloma (16.7%) and acute leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AL/MDS) (12.1%). Treatment for the haematological disease was ongoing in 59.1% of cases. Neutropenia was present in 6.5%, lymphopenia in 46.6% and hypogammaglobulinaemia in 26.3%. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in 50.0%, severe in 36.4% and critical in 13.6%. After one month, 21.2% had been admitted to ICU, and 24.2% died. Mortality was highest in older patients, patients with severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, high comorbidity score or high performance status score, purine analogue treatment and with AL/MDS. Although older patients and patients with comorbidities had the highest mortality rates, mortality was considerable among all haematological patients. CONCLUSION: Haematological patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has a severe clinical course.","Glenthøj, Andreas; Jakobsen, Lasse H; Sengeløv, Henrik; Ahmad, Syed A; Qvist, Kristian; Rewes, Annika; Poulsen, Christian B; Overgaard, Ulrik M; Mølle, Ingolf; Severinsen, Marianne T; Strandholdt, Casper N; Maibom, Jack; Kodahl, Annette R; Ryg, Jesper; Ravn, Pernille; Johansen, Isik S; Helsø, Søren N; Jensen-Fangel, Søren; Kisielewicz, Jacek; Wiese, Lothar; Helleberg, Marie; Kirk, Ole; Clausen, Michael R; Frederiksen, Henrik",Eur. j. haematol,,668

388060,Will vaccination refusal prolong the war on SARS-CoV-2?,2020,"Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) is a notorious pest that threatens maize production world-wide. Current control measures involve the use of chemical insecticides and transgenic maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins. Although additional transgenes have confirmed insecticidal activity, limited research has been conducted in maize, at least partially due to the technical difficulty of maize transformation. Here, we describe implementation of a sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) vector for rapidly testing the efficacy of both endogenous maize genes and heterologous genes from other organisms for the control of S. frugiperda in maize. Four categories of proteins were tested using the SCMV vector: (i) maize defense signaling proteins: peptide elicitors (Pep1 and Pep3) and jasmonate acid conjugating enzymes (JAR1a and JAR1b); (ii) maize defensive proteins: the previously identified ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP2) and maize proteinase inhibitor (MPI), and two proteins with predicted but unconfirmed anti-insect activities, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a lectin (JAC1); (iii) lectins from other plant species: Allium cepa agglutinin (ACA) and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA); and (iv) spider and scorpion toxins: peptides from Urodacus yaschenkoi (UyCT3 and UyCT5) and Hadronyche versuta (Hvt). In most cases, S. frugiperda larval growth was reduced by transient SCMV-mediated overexpression of genes encoding these proteins. Additionally, experiments with a subset of the SCMV-expressed genes showed effectiveness against two aphid species, Rhopalosiphum maidis (corn leaf aphid) and Myzus persicae (green peach aphid). Together, these results demonstrate that SCMV vectors are a rapid screening method for testing the efficacy and insecticidal activity of candidate genes in maize.","Chung, Seung Ho; Bigham, Mahdiyeh; Lappe, Ryan R; Chan, Barry; Nagalakshmi, Ugrappa; Whitham, Steven A; Dinesh-Kumar, Savithramma P; Jander, Georg",Plant biotechnol. j.

We aimed at investigating the rate and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs working in a regional reference center in the Southern Italy. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs and investigate the relation between the infection rate and hours of exposure or number and characteristics of procedures, including nasopharyngeal swab, high-flow oxygen delivery, suctioning of airway secretions, sputum induction, and nebulizer administration. RESULTS: After 5 months of monitoring, 425.6 hours of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (18.5 hours per person), and 920 hospital procedures, no case of nosocomial transmission was reported among the 23 HCWs enrolled in the study. CONCLUSIONS: The application of stringent preventive measures, also outside the area dedicated to patients' care, can effectively control infection spreading also in pediatric settings.","Lo Vecchio, Andrea; Pierri, Luca; Poeta, Marco; Vassallo, Edoardo; Varelli, Marco; Montella, Emma; Guarino, Alfredo; Bruzzese, Eugenia",Hosp. pediatr.

However, several questions remain unanswered regarding the prescription of steroids which led to differing opinions and practice. We surveyed practice patterns of critical care physicians in India for the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Methods: This was a nationwide, cross-sectional, online, knowledge attitude practice-based survey, among intensivists for corticosteroid use in COVID-19. The survey questionnaire had seven questions for demographic data and 14 questions in the core survey. Results: 384 responses were analyzed from different parts of the country. A majority (81.2%) agreed that steroids improved oxygenation and survival chances. 88.3% agreed that steroids are indicated because of their anti-inflammatory properties, and should be prescribed in patients with moderate (75.8%), severe (59.9%), or critical (41.1%) COVID-19. 68.8% of physicians start steroids on the basis of ""need for oxygen therapy"" and hyperglycemia (85.2%) was the most commonly reported complication. 59.1% prefer prescribing methylprednisolone followed by Dexamethasone (38.8%). 51.8% preferred to use low dose steroids, and 59.1% have used ""pulse steroids''. Rather than a fixed duration of therapy, 66.9% of the respondents rely on ""clinical improvement"" before stopping steroids, even if it meant continuing steroids for prolonged periods beyond 14 days (34.1%). 57.8% always taper steroids before stopping. Conclusions: We found wide variation in the practice patterns of critical care physicians in India for use of Corticosteroids in COVID-19.

Due to the lack of effective treatments for COVID-19, it becomes imperative to assess the geographical differences and trends in the current clinical care and outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to screen articles reporting therapeutics and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 in pregnant women prior to August 27, 2020. We performed searches, quality assessments of eligible studies, extracted and reported data according to PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analyses and cumulative meta-analyses of proportions were performed for estimating each outcome and their pattern over time respectively. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty nine pregnant women with COVID-19 from 66 studies were analyzed. In case series analysis reflecting average-risk patients, the proportion of oxygen support, antibiotics, antivirals, and plasma therapy administration except for hydroxychloroquine was substantially higher in Asian studies (55, 78, 80, 6, and 0%) compared to the US (7, 1, 12, 0, and 7%) or European (33, 12, 14, 1, and 26%) studies, respectively. The highest preterm birth and the average length of hospital stay (35%, 11.9 days) were estimated in Asian studies compared to the US studies (13%, 9.4 days) and European studies (29%, 7.3 days), respectively. Even in case reports reflecting severe cases, the use of antivirals and antibiotics was higher in Asian studies compared to the US, Latin American, and European studies. A significant decline in the use of most therapeutics along with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in pregnant women was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Geographical differences in therapeutic practice of COVID-19 were observed with differential rates of maternal and clinical outcomes. Minimizing the use of some therapeutics particularly antibiotics, antivirals, oxygen therapy, immunosuppressants, and hydroxychloroquine by risk stratification and careful consideration may further improve maternal and clinical outcomes.","Dubey, Pallavi; Thakur, Bhaskar; Reddy, Sireesha; Martinez, Carla A; Nurunnabi, Md; Manuel, Sharron L; Chheda, Sadhana; Bracamontes, Christina; Dwivedi, Alok K",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,668

The virus' main protease is a dimeric enzyme that has only recently begun to be thoroughly described, opening the door for virtual screening more broadly. Here, a PAIN-filtered flavonoid database was screened against four sites of the protease: a free (normal) conformation of the Substrate Binding Site (NSBS), an induced-fit state of the SBS (ISBS), a Dimerization Site (DS) and a Cryptic Site (CS). The mean binding energies of the top five ligands from each site were -9.52, -11.512, -7.042 and -10.348 kcal/mol for the NSBS, the ISBS, the DS and the CS, respectively. For the DS and CS, these top five compounds were selected as candidates to bind their respective site. In the case of SBS, the top 30 ligands with the lowest binding energies from NSBS and ISBS were contrasted and the ones present in both lists were selected as the final candidates. The final list was: Dorsilurin E (FL3FQUNP0001), Euchrenone a11 (FL2FALNP0014), Kurziflavolactone C (FL2FA9NC0016), Licorice glycoside E (FL2F1AGSN001) and Taxifolin 3'- (6""-phenyl- acetylglucoside) (FL4DACGS0020) for the SBS; Sanggenol O (FL2FALNP0020), CHEMBL2171573, Kanzonol E (FL3F1ANP0001), CHEMBL2171584 and Abyssynoflavanone VI (FL2FACNP0014) for DS and CHEMBL2171598, CHEMBL2171577, Denticulaflavanol (FL5FAANR0001), Kurzichalcolactone (FL1CA9NC0001) and CHEMBL2171578 for CS.

Policymakers need strategies to inform decisions about allocating scarce resources. Study design and setting: We updated a systematic review on evidence-based approaches and searched databases through May 2020 for evaluation of strategies for policymakers. Results: The 201 identified studies evaluated reducing demand for healthcare, optimizing existing resources, augmenting resources, and adopting crisis standards of care. Most research exists to reduce demand (n=149);39 higher quality studies reported benefits of contact tracing, school closures, travel restrictions, and mass vaccination. Of 28 strategies to augment resources, 6 higher quality studies reported effectiveness of establishing temporary facilities, use of volunteers, and decision support software. Of 23 strategies to optimize existing resources, 12 higher quality studies reported successful scope of work expansions and building on existing interagency agreements. Of 15 COVID-19 studies, 4 higher quality studies evaluated combinations of policies and one reported benefits of community-wide mask policies. Conclusion: Despite the volume, the evidence base is limited;few strategies were empirically tested in robust study designs. The review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of strategies to allocate resources and provides critical appraisal to direct them to the best available evidence.","Hempel, S.; Burke, R.

392836,A systematic review of the impact of the Alpha and Gamma variants of concern on hospitalization and symptomatic rate of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Vitamin D, sunshine and UVB phototherapy were first reported in the early 1900s to control psoriasis, cure rickets and cure tuberculosis (TB). Vitamin D also controlled asthma and rheumatoid arthritis with intakes ranging from 60,000 to 600,000 International Units (IU)/day. In the 1980s, interest in treating psoriasis with vitamin D rekindled. Since 1985 four different oral forms of vitamin D (D2, D3, 1-hydroxyvitaminD3 (1(OH)D3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (calcitriol)) and several topical formulations have been reported safe and effective treatments for psoriasis-as has UVB phototherapy and sunshine. In this review we show that many pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D concentrations fall within the current range of normal, while many post-treatment concentrations fall outside the upper limit of this normal (100 ng/mL). Yet, psoriasis patients showed significant clinical improvement without complications using these treatments. Current estimates of vitamin D sufficiency appear to underestimate serum 25(OH)D concentrations required for optimal health in psoriasis patients, while concentrations associated with adverse events appear to be much higher than current estimates of safe serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Based on these observations, the therapeutic index for vitamin D needs to be reexamined in the treatment of psoriasis and other diseases strongly linked to vitamin D deficiency, including COVID-19 infections, which may also improve safely with sufficient vitamin D intake or UVB exposure.","McCullough, Patrick J; McCullough, William P; Lehrer, Douglas; Travers, Jeffrey B; Repas, Steven J",Nutrients,,668

The year 2020 started full of promise as many organizations anticipated assessing themselves using perfect, or 2020, vision. While challenging on several levels, the momentous combination of events in 2020-the COVID-19 pandemic, Racial Justice Movement, and the November elections-provided Geriatric Medicine several opportunities to firmly secure a position in the mainstream. As we reflect on the new perspectives, programs, and partnerships initiated in 2020, five broader lessons emerge that can help safeguard the future of Geriatrics: the field could employ more intentional ""direct to consumer"" marketing strategies, expand the scope of what it means to be a patient advocate, pursue new strategic partnerships, take the opportunity to address racial injustice, and leverage existing skillsets to expand scope of care for patients. Given the interdisciplinary nature of Geriatrics, it is fitting that many of these lessons build upon this collaborative philosophy and are derived from domains outside of health care.

396039,The SARS-CoV-2 crisis: A crisis of reductionism?,2020,"During the first seven months of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 175,000 crowdfunding campaigns were established in the US for coronavirus-related needs using the platform GoFundMe. Though charitable crowdfunding has been popular in recent years, the widespread creation of COVID-19 related campaigns points to potential shifts in how the platform is being used, and the volume of needs users have brought to the site during a profound economic, social, and epidemiological crisis. This study offers a systematic examination of the scope and impacts of COVID-19 related crowdfunding in the early months of the pandemic and assesses how existing social and health inequities shaped crowdfunding use and outcomes. Using data collected from all US-based GoFundMe campaigns mentioning COVID or coronavirus, we used descriptive analysis and a series of negative binomial and linear models to assess the contributions of demographic factors and COVID-19 impacts to campaign creation and outcome. We find significant evidence of growing inequalities in outcomes for campaigners. We find that crowdfunding provides substantially higher benefits in wealthier counties with higher levels of education. People from these areas are more likely to initiate campaigns in response to adverse health and economic impacts of COVID-19, and they also receive more funding compared to people living in areas with lower income and education. Modeling also indicates differential outcomes based on the racial and ethnic composition of county population, though without more detail about who is creating and funding campaigns we cannot explain causality. A targeted qualitative analysis of the top earning COVID-19 campaigns offers further evidence of how user privilege and corporate practices contribute to highly unequal outcomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how a market-oriented digital technology used to respond to large-scale crisis can exacerbate inequalities and further benefit already privileged groups.","Igra, Mark; Kenworthy, Nora; Luchsinger, Cadence; Jung, Jin-Kyu",Soc Sci Med,,668
396236,"Epidemiological, clinical and genomic snapshot of the first 100 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 cases in Madrid",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Canakinumab is an IL-1ß antibody that neutralises the activity of IL-1ß. This study examined the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia. DESIGN: This study aimed to evaluate the reduction in duration of hospitalisation with adequate oxygen status. Forty-eight patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia were asked to participate in the prospective case-control study: 33 patients (cases) signed informed consent and received canakinumab (Cohort 1) and 15 patients (Controls) refused to receive the experimental drug and received institutional standard of care (Cohort 2). RESULTS: Hospital discharge within 21 days was seen in 63% of patients in Cohort 1 vs. 0% in Cohort 2 (median 14 vs. 26 days, respectively; p < 0.001). There was significant clinical improvement in ventilation regimes following administration of canakinumab compared with Cohort 2 (Stuart-Maxwell test for paired data, p < 0.001). Patients treated with canakinumab experienced a significant increase in PaO2:FiO2 (p < 0.001) and reduction in lung damage by CT (p = 0.01), along with significant decreases in immune/inflammation markers that were not observed in Cohort 2. Only mild side-effects were seen in patients treated with canakinumab; survival at 60 days was 90.0% (95% CI 71.9-96.7) in patients treated with canakinumab and 73.3% (95% CI 43.6-89.1) for Cohort 2. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with canakinumab in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia rapidly restored normal oxygen status, decreased the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and was associated with earlier hospital discharge and favourable prognosis versus standard of care.","Generali, Daniele; Bosio, Giancarlo; Malberti, Fabio; Cuzzoli, Antonio; Testa, Sophie; Romanini, Laura; Fioravanti, Antonio; Morandini, Alessandro; Pianta, Luca; Giannotti, Guglielmo; Viola, Erika Maria; Giorgi-Pierfranceschi, Matteo; Foramitti, Marina; Tira, Rosa Angela; Zangrandi, Ilaria; Chiodelli, Giulia; Machiavelli, Andrea; Cappelletti, Maria Rosa; Giossi, Alessia; De Giuli, Valeria; Costanzi, Chiara; Campana, Chiara; Bernocchi, Ottavia; Sirico, Marianna; Zoncada, Alessia; Molteni, Alfredo; Venturini, Sergio; Giudici, Fabiola; Scaltriti, Maurizio; Pan, Angelo",Int J Infect Dis,,668

We aimed to investigate the factors that cause prolonged PCR positivity and its clinical impact on COVID-19 infection. In addition, we searched for an answer on what length of time would be best for isolation. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in this retrospective study. Patients with PCR positivity (after symptom onset) longer than 14 days and PCR positivity less than 14 days were compared. The relationship between duration of symptoms and PCR negation time was examined. RESULTS: A total of 339 patients were included in this study. Fifty (14%) patients had prolonged PCR positivity after 14 days. Demographic and clinical features, and clinical outcomes (disease severity and mortality) were similar among the two groups. Age (p 0.035) and symptom duration at admission (P < .001) were found as independent factors for prolonged PCR positivity. Median of total symptom duration was 7 days (IQR: 5-11). The duration of negative conversion of PCR test was median 9 days (IQR: 7-12) after symptom onset and PCR tests became negative 3 days (IQR: 2-5) after symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We found that ongoing PCR positivity has no detrimental effect on the course of the disease and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In addition, our results showed that isolation may be discontinued 10-14 days after symptom onset and/or after 2-5 days after resolution of symptoms. This results also support WHO and ECDC recommendations on this matter.","Eser, Fatma; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Güner, Rahmet; Hasanoglu, Imran; Kaya Kalem, Ayse; Aypak, Adalet; Akinci, Esragul",Int J Clin Pract,,668

Throughout this pandemic, healthcare professionals (HCPs) have experienced difficulties stemming from poor communications, resource scarcity, lack of transparency, disbelief, and threats to the safety of their loved ones, their patients, and themselves. As part of these hardships, negative statements have been heard repeatedly. This paper describes 11 scenarios of unhelpful and dysfunctional messages heard by the authors and their colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic, reported to us by a combination of peers, administrative leadership, and the public. We explain why not to use such messaging, and we suggest more helpful and compassionate expressions based upon recommendations published by scientific organizations and well-established psychological principles. The first 10 scenarios discussed include (1) lack of understanding regarding the extent of the pandemic; (2) shaming over not seeing patients in person; (3) lack of clear and consistent communication from leadership on pandemic-related practice changes; (4) opinions that personal protective equipment (PPE) use by HCPs causes fear or is unnecessary; (5) forcing in-person care without appropriate PPE; (6) the risk of exposure to asymptomatic individuals as it relates to opening clinics; (7) media gag orders; (8) pay and benefit reductions; (9) spreading of misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic; and (10) workload expectations. The 11th scenario addresses HCPs' psychological and physical reactions to this challenging and prolonged stressful situation. We close by discussing the need for support and compassion at this difficult and unpredictable time and by offering suggestions to foster resilience and feelings of self-efficacy among HCPs.","Robblee, Jennifer; Buse, Dawn C; Halker Singh, Rashmi B; Schusse, Courtney M; Riggins, Nina; Rayhill, Melissa L; Loder, Elizabeth W; Donnelly, Megan; Borrero-Mejias, Clarimar",Headache,,668

397885,First Description of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Two Feral American Mink (Neovison vison) Caught in the Wild,2021,"Rare diseases frequently attack and weaken the immune system, increasing the patient's vulnerability to develop severe conditions after viral infections, such as COVID-19. Many patients with rare diseases also suffer from mental retardation and disability. These rare disease phenotypes do not emerge in older people who are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, but present at a very young age or at birth. These factors must be taken in consideration when caring for this vulnerable patient population during a pandemic, such as COVID-19. Patients with a rare disease have to take their regular medication continuously to control their condition and frequently, the medications, directly or indirectly, affect their immune system. It is important for this patient population, if infected with COVID-19 or another severe form of infection, to adjust the treatment protocol by specialists, in consultation with their own medical team. Special awareness and educational programs, understandable for mentally retarded patients, must be developed to educate them about social distancing, curfew, sanitization, and sensitization to the disease and quarantine. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance to reconsider the care required by patients with a rare disease during a pandemic or disaster, a program that should be adopted by the World Health Organization and governmental institutions for consideration.","Boudjelal, Mohamed; Mehyar, Nimer; Alghanem, Bandar; Almajed, Faisal; Alfadhel, Majid",J Infect Dev Ctries,,668

We investigated the risk of mortality and critical care admission in hospitalised adults with nosocomial COVID-19, relative to adults requiring hospitalisation due to community-acquired infection. MethodsWe systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed and pre-print literature from 1/1/2020 to 9/2/2021 without language restriction for studies reporting outcomes of nosocomial and community-acquired COVID-19. We performed a random effects meta-analysis (MA) to estimate the 1) relative risk of death and 2) critical care admission, stratifying studies by patient cohort characteristics and nosocomial case definition. Results21 studies were included in the primary MA, describing 8,246 admissions across 8 countries during the first wave, comprising 1517 probable or definite nosocomial COVID-19, and 6729 community-acquired cases. Across all studies, the risk of mortality was 1.31 times greater in patients with nosocomial infection, compared to community-acquired (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.70). Rates of critical care admission were similar between groups (Relative Risk, RR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.08). Immunosuppressed patients diagnosed with nosocomial COVID-19 were twice as likely to die in hospital as those admitted with community-acquired infection (RR=2.14, 95% CI: 1.76 to 2.61). ConclusionsAdults who acquire SARS-CoV-2 whilst already hospitalised are at greater risk of mortality compared to patients admitted following community-acquired infection; this finding is largely driven by a substantially increased risk of death in individuals with malignancy or who had undergone transplantation. These findings inform public health and infection control policy, and argue for individualised clinical interventions to combat the threat of nosocomial COVID-19, particularly for immunosuppressed groups.

In this study, we used pollution monitoring and meteorological data from January to May 2020 to analyze the air quality characteristics during the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan, which lasted from January 23 to April 8, 2020. Compared with the same period in 2019, the air quality in 2020 was significantly better. The total excellent and good air quality rates increased by 17.58%-90.08% in 2020; concentrations of NO2, particulate matter with a diameter <10 µm (PM10) and <2.5 µm (PM2.5), and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) also decreased by 38.23%, 30.25%, 32.92%, and 39.80%, respectively. Moreover, the number of days with NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 as the primary pollutants decreased by approximately 10%, 9%, and 15%, respectively. We compared the wind direction, wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity in January-April 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017 and found no obvious correlation between meteorological factors and improved air quality during the 2020 lockdown. The implementation of strict lockdown measures, such as home quarantining, traffic restrictions, and non-essential enterprise shutdowns, was the dominant cause for the substantial air quality improvement during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan.","Jiaxin, Chen; Hui, Hu; Feifei, Wang; Mi, Zhang; Ting, Zhou; Shicheng, Yuan; Ruoqiao, Bai; Nan, Chen; Ke, Xu; Hao, Huang",Environ Res,,668

401039,Multiplex rt-Real Time PCR assays for diagnostic testing of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza viruses. A challenge of the phase 3 pandemic setting,2020,"BACKGROUND: The straight leg raise test (SLR) is one of the most performed physical tests for mechanosensitivity and impairment of the nervous system. According to the anatomy of the tibial nerve, ankle dorsiflexion and eversion movements could be used to perform the tibial neurodynamic test (TNT). To date, no study has documented the normal responses of the TNT. OBJECTIVE: To document normal responses of the TNT in asymptomatic individuals and to investigate influences from sex and leg dominance. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 44 asymptomatic volunteer subjects, a total of 88 lower limbs, was carried out. The range of motion (ROM), quality, and distribution of sensory responses were recorded. The hip flexion ROM was measured when subjects reported an intensity of their symptoms of 2/10 (P1) and 8/10 (P2). RESULTS: The mean ROM for hip flexion at P1 was 44.22 ± 13.13&#8728; and 66.73 ± 14.30&#8728; at P2. Hip flexion was significantly greater at P2 than P1 (p< 0.001). However, it was not different between sex or limbs (p> 0.05). The descriptor of the quality of sensory responses most often used by participants was stretching (88.6% and 87.5% for P1 and P2, respectively) in the popliteal fossa and posterior calf. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the sensory responses of asymptomatic subjects resulting from the TNT. Our findings indicate that TNT responses are independent of the influence of sex or leg dominance.","Bueno-Gracia, Elena; Malo-Urriés, Miguel; Montaner-Cuello, Alberto; Borrella-Andrés, Sergio; López-de-Celis, Carlos",J. back musculoskelet. rehabil,,668

401585,Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak originating in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has emerged as a global threat to human health. The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission presents a diversity of human host and increased disease risk with advancing age, highlighting the importance of in-depth understanding of its biological properties. Structural analyses have elucidated hot spots in viral binding domains, mutations, and specific proteins in the host such as the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to be implicated in cell entry and viral infectivity. Furthermore, epigenetic changes that regulate chromatin structure have shown a major impact in genome stabilization and maintenance of cellular homoeostasis and they have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the virus infection. Epigenetic research has revealed that global DNA methylation along with ACE2 gene methylation and post-translational histone modifications may drive differences in host tissue-, biological age- and sex-biased patterns of viral infection. Moreover, modulation of the host cells epigenetic landscape following infection represents a molecular tool used by viruses to antagonize cellular signalling as well as sensing components that regulate the induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defence programmes in order to enhance viral replication and infection efficiency. In this review, we provide an update of the main research findings at the interface of epigenetics and coronavirus infection. In particular, we highlight the epigenetic factors that interfere with viral replication and infection and may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility, offering new ways of thinking in respect to host viral response.","Chlamydas, Sarantis; Papavassiliou, Athanasios G; Piperi, Christina",Epigenetics,,668

The current SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae) responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the lack of effective medications currently available to treat these classes of viral pathogens. Similarly, the Flaviviridae, which includes such viruses as Dengue, West Nile, and Zika, and the Filoviridae, with the Ebola-type viruses, as examples, all lack effective therapeutics. In this review, we present fundamental information concerning the biology of these three virus families, including their genomic makeup, mode of infection of human cells, and key proteins that may offer targeted therapies. Further, we present the natural products and their derivatives that have documented activities to these viral and host proteins, offering hope for future mechanism-based antiviral therapeutics. By arranging these potential protein targets and their natural product inhibitors by target type across these three families of virus, new insights are developed, and crossover treatment strategies are suggested. Hence, natural products, as is the case for other therapeutic areas, continue to be a promising source of structurally diverse new anti-RNA virus therapeutics.","Christy, Mitchell P; Uekusa, Yoshinori; Gerwick, Lena; Gerwick, William H",J Nat Prod,,668

404376,Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection with lysosomal alkalizers,2021,"Since the first recorded case of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh on 8th March 2020, COVID-19 has spread widely through different regions of the country, resulting in a necessity to re-evaluate the delivery of cardiovascular services, particularly procedures pertaining to interventional cardiology in resource-limited settings. Given its robust capacity for human-to-human transmission and potential of being a nosocomial source of infection, the disease has specific implications on healthcare systems and health care professionals faced with performing essential cardiac procedures in patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The limited resources in terms of cardiac catheterization laboratories that can be designated to treat only COVID positive patients are further compounded by the additional challenges of unavailability of widespread rapid testing on-site at tertiary cardiac hospitals in Bangladesh. This document prepared for our nation by the Bangladesh Society of Cardiovascular Interventions (BSCI) is intended to serve as a clinical practice guideline for cardiovascular health care professionals, with a focus on modifying standard practice of care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ensure continuation of adequate and timely treatment of cardiovascular emergencies avoiding hospital-based transmission of SARS-COV-2 among healthcare professionals and the patients. This is an evolving document based on currently available global data and is tailored to healthcare systems in Bangladesh with particular focus on, but not limited to, invasive cardiology facilities (cardiac catheterization, electrophysiology & pacing labs). This guideline is limited to the provision of cardiovascular care, and it is expected that specific targeted pharmaco-therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 be prescribed as stipulated by the National Guidelines on Clinical Management of Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) published by the Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh.","Uddin, M J; Rahman, A F; Rahman, S; Momenuzzaman, N M; Rahman, A; Majumder, A S; Mohibullah, A M; Chowdhury, A H; Malik, F N; Ahsan, S A; Mohsin, K; Haq, M M; Chowdhury, A W; Sohrabuzzaman, A M; Rahman, M; Chakraborty, B; Rahman, R; Khan, S R; Khan, K N; Reza, A M; Hussain, K S; Rashid, M; Choudhury, A K; Karmakar, K K; Ali, Z; Alam, N; Rahman, Z; Kabir, C S; Banik, D; Dutta, A; Badiuzzaman, M; Islam, A W; Sium, A H; Hossain, M D; Ahmed, N; Jahan, J; Islam, M S; Arefin, M M; Cader, F A; Banerjee, S K; Hoque, H; Shofiuddin, M; Selim, A; Das, P K; Ahmed, M; Dutto, B; Alam, S; Paul, G K; Paul, S K; Azam, M G",Mymensingh Med J,,668

To provide a swift response to a novel outbreak, prior knowledge from similar outbreaks is essential. RESULTS: Here, we study the volume of research conducted on previous coronavirus outbreaks, specifically SARS and MERS, relative to other infectious diseases by analyzing >35 million articles from the past 20 years. Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared with other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and decreases drastically upon the containment of the disease. This can yield inadequate research and limited investment in gaining a full understanding of novel coronavirus management and prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of the outcome of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we believe that measures should be taken to encourage sustained research in the field.","Kagan, Dima; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Fire, Michael",Gigascience,,668

407680,Mass Screening for SARS-CoV-2 Uncovers Significant Transmission Risk from Asymptomatic Carriers (preprint),2020,"Background: The application of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) current to peripheral nerves with conditions related to neuropathic pain is considered to be clinically safe, while it has been reported that the destruction of mitochondria after PRF application was observed by electron microscopy. If it occurs reproducibly, PRF applied to peripheral nerves should provoke neurolysis because the impairment of mitochondria is known as the primary cause of apoptosis. Methods: Human monocytic cells THP-1 loaded with 100 nM tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), a fluorescent dye that proves the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), were exposed to the electric field of continuous radiofrequency (CRF) or PRF current. The TMRM-related fluorescence from THP-1 cells was measured by flow cytometry. Results: The exposure of THP-1 cells to a PRF electric field generated by NeuroTherm NT500 for 15 min with maximum power did not decrease MMP in these cells, nor did it cause the induction of apoptosis. By contrast, the application of CRF current at 70 °C for 3 min significantly decreased MMP and induced apoptosis within 10 min after CRF application. Conclusion: We conclude from these findings that PRF application does not provoke mitochondrial injury in various types of mammalian cells because the size and the subcellular structure of the plasma membrane or mitochondria are similar among those. However, the present results cannot address the effect of PRF current on organic structure around the nervous system. Further study is required to solve the question of whether PRF current causes neurolysis or not.","Nishioka, Akira; Kimura, Maiko; Sakamoto, Eriko; Nagasaka, Hiroshi; Azma, Toshiharu",J Pain Res,,668

The optimal type and duration of prophylactic antithrombotic therapy in these patients remain unknown. METHODS: This manuscript reports the final (90-day) results of the Intermediate versus Standard-dose Prophylactic anticoagulation In cRitically-ill pATIents with COVID-19: An opeN label randomized controlled trial (INSPIRATION) study. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care were randomized to intermediate-dose versus standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for 30 days, irrespective of hospital discharge status. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or all-cause death. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS: Of 600 randomized patients, 562 entered the modified intention-to-treat analysis (median age [Q1, Q3]; 62 (50, 71) years; 237 (42.2%) women), of whom 336 (59.8%) survived to hospital discharge. The primary outcome occurred in 132 (47.8%) of patients assigned to intermediate-dose and 130 (45.4%) patients assigned to standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1.55, P=0.11). No significant differences were observed between the two groups for other efficacy outcomes, or in the landmark analysis from days 31-90.

411527,Preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the emergency department by implementing a separate pathway for patients with respiratory conditions,2021,"During the unprecedented times caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019, there is rapidly evolving information and guidance. However, a focus must also be on proper and effective risk communication. This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which apply to the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment. One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is using social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence. Another important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in broader public health messaging. As we continue to face unprecedented times in the allergy community, an understanding and appreciation of risk communication will be essential as we communicate with, and inform, our patients, and our colleagues, moving forward.","Abrams, Elissa M; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,,668
411710,SARS-CoV-2 Infection Causes Dopaminergic Neuron Senescence,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all facets of life and continues to cripple nations. COVID-19 has taken the lives of more than 2.1 million people worldwide, with a global mortality rate of 2.2%. Current COVID-19 treatment options include supportive respiratory care, parenteral corticosteroids, and remdesivir. Although COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with comorbidities, the vulnerability, clinical course, optimal management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with organ transplants has not been well described in the literature. The treatment of COVID-19 differs based on the organ(s) transplanted. Preliminary data suggested that liver transplant patients with COVID-19 did not have higher mortality rates than untransplanted COVID-19 patients. Table 1 depicts a compiled list of current published data on COVID-19 liver transplant patients. Most of these studies included both recent and old liver transplant patients. No distinction was made for early liver transplant patients who contract COVID-19 within their posttransplant hospitalization course. This potential differentiation needs to be further explored. Here, we report 2 patients who underwent liver transplantation who acquired COVID-19 during their posttransplant recovery period in the hospital. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two patients who underwent liver transplant and contracted COVID-19 in the early posttransplant period and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. This article includes a description of their hospital course, including treatment and recovery. CONCLUSION: The management of post-liver transplant patients with COVID-19 infection is complicated. Strict exposure precaution practice after organ transplantation is highly recommended. Widespread vaccination will help with prevention, but there will continue to be patients who contract COVID-19. Therefore, continued research into appropriate treatments is still relevant and critical. A temporary dose reduction of immunosuppression and continued administration of low-dose methylprednisolone, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma might be helpful in the management and recovery of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in post-liver transplant patients. Future studies and experiences from posttransplant patients are warranted to better delineate the clinical features and optimal management of COVID-19 infection in liver transplant recipients.","Dale, Miles; Sogawa, Hiroshi; Seyedsaadat, Seyed Mohammad; Wolf, David C; Bodin, Roxana; Partiula, Bernard; Nog, Rajat; Latifi, Rifat; John, Devon; Veillette, Gregory; Diflo, Thomas; Nishida, Seigo",Transplant Proc,,668

The risk factors associated with severity of disease include older age, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and lung diseases, and immune suppression. Additional evidence strongly suggests that obesity is also a risk factor for severe forms of COVID­19 disease, while other types of malnutrition increase the risk of hospitalization from influenza­like diseases, regardless of the causative agent of the illness (1). Although detailed data are not yet available on the impact of under nutrition in the evolution of COVID­19, given the known inflammatory response caused by this condition, it is reasonable to expect a suboptimal immune response and higher risk of severity, as found with obesity (2).","Cuevas, Ada; Barquera, Simon",Obesity (Silver Spring),,668
413725,SARS-CoV-2 infection and human semen: possible modes of contamination and transmission,2021,"What role does social media play for interprofessional education in a pandemic? This is the first pandemic to occur in a world filled with social media, where digital communication is ubiquitous and a high percentage of those affected are digitally literate. This paper situated within a United Kingdom (UK) context explores this new phenomenon, discussing the ways in which digital gift giving toward health and social care professionals has developed on a variety of social media platforms. This discussion proposes a theoretical understanding of digital gift giving and raises the importance of digital resilience for interprofessional learning and working. Reflections are made on the expected and imagined reciprocity of digital gift giving and the talismanic nature of employing symbols digitally to ward off COVID-19. This paper employs an ethnographic lens to unpack the issue of digital gift giving and recommends preparing students for the onslaught of digital gifts they may be exposed to upon entering the workplace. Academics are called on as the mediators of these recommendations, and suggestions are made as to how students can be best prepared for a digitally saturated interprofessional practice.","Bluteau, Joshua M; Bluteau, Patricia A",J Interprof Care,,668

Design Cohort study comparing surgical caseload during initial seven-week COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Comparison was made with pre-COVID-19 caseload over the corresponding seven-week timeframe in 2019. Setting The setting of the study was emergency surgery theaters at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. Patients All patients requiring emergency surgery over the defined study period were reviewed with the exception of obstetric and pediatric populations. Interventions Surgical caseload for 2020 and 2019 cohorts established using the Galaxy IT system used to log all operations. All relevant anesthetic charts for the 2020 cohort were subsequently reviewed to ascertain perioperative use of RA. Measurements The type of block, mode of approach, experience of the operator, personal protective equipment (PPE) worn, block complications, type of sedation and complications were entered into database. Main results A total of 338 emergency surgical cases were performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared to 603 cases over the corresponding period in 2019. This showed a 44% decrease in emergency surgical workload. There was a marked disparity in reduction of surgical caseload by surgical subspecialty. Trauma (137 vs 66 cases), a 52% decrease, and general surgery (193 vs 64 cases), a 66% decrease, were the most pronounced, and explanations for this are explored. RA was performed in 34% (26% as primary technique) of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of RA as the primary anesthesia technique was noticeably higher than previous UK data (11%), and was prominent in specialties such as general surgery, gynecology and urology, not traditionally completed under RA. Conclusions Surgical RA (and general anesthesia avoidance) has a significant role in the future to ensure high-quality perioperative care for patients whilst minimizing exposure to staff and utilization of scarce resources (PPE).","Wade, Stuart; Nair, Ganeshkrishna; Ayeni, Hafis A; Pawa, Amit",Cureus,,668

Self-selected urologists worldwide completed an online survey by the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). A total of 2494 urologists from 76 countries responded, including 1161 (46.6%) urologists in an academic setting, 719 (28.8%) in a private practice, and 614 (24.6%) in the public sector. The largest proportion (1074 (43.1%)) were from Europe, with the remainder from East/Southeast Asia (441 (17.7%)), West/Southwest Asia (386 (15.5%)), Africa (209 (8.4%)), South America (198 (7.9%)), and North America (186 (7.5%)). An analysis of differences in responses was carried out by region and practice setting. The results reveal significant restrictions in outpatient consultation and non-emergency surgery, with nonspecific efforts towards additional precautions for preventing the spread of COVID-19 during emergency surgery. These restrictions were less notable in East/Southeast Asia. Urologists often bear the decision-making responsibility regarding access to elective surgery (40.3%). Restriction of both outpatient clinics and non-emergency surgery is considerable worldwide but is lower in East/Southeast Asia. Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 during emergency surgery are common but not specific. The pandemic has had a profound impact on urology practice. There is an urgent need to provide improved guidance for this and future pandemics.","Gravas, Stavros; Bolton, Damien; Gomez, Reynaldo; Klotz, Laurence; Kulkarni, Sanjay; Tanguay, Simon; de la Rosette, Jean",,,668

Modern researches on “Fear injury kidney"" have also found that long-term or excessive fear could cause changes in the neuro-endocrine-immune system, which can induce diseases or susceptibility to some diseases. Therefore, during or after the prevalence of COVID-19, different groups of people may have emotional reactions such as stress and fear, which should be paid long-term attention, and the influence of fear on the body cannot be ignored. According to the change rule of psychological state under stress reaction, we should actively respond to and take psychological crisis intervention measures in time to reduce the harm of psychological stress to the body.","LIU, Qian-wei; ZHAO, Guo-zhen; JI, Bo; LIU, Yi-tian; ZHANG, Jing-yu; MOU, Qiu-jie; SHI, Tian-yu",World J.

420660,Estimating the false-negative test probability of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a plethora of guidance and opinion from surgical societies. A controversial area concerns the safety of surgically created smoke and the perceived potential higher risk in laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: The limited published evidence was analysed in combination with expert opinion. A review was undertaken of the novel coronavirus with regards to its hazards within surgical smoke and the procedures that could mitigate the potential risks to healthcare staff. RESULTS: Using existing knowledge of surgical smoke, a theoretical risk of virus transmission exists. Best practice should consider the operating room set-up, patient movement and operating theatre equipment when producing a COVID-19 operating protocol. The choice of energy device can affect the smoke produced, and surgeons should manage the pneumoperitoneum meticulously during laparoscopic surgery. Devices to remove surgical smoke, including extractors, filters and non-filter devices, are discussed in detail. CONCLUSION: There is not enough evidence to quantify the risks of COVID-19 transmission in surgical smoke. However, steps can be undertaken to manage the potential hazards. The advantages of minimally invasive surgery may not need to be sacrificed in the current crisis.","Mowbray, N G; Ansell, J; Horwood, J; Cornish, J; Rizkallah, P; Parker, A; Wall, P; Spinelli, A; Torkington, J",Br. j. surg,,668

With newer waves and variants of COVID-19, we conducted a systematic review to assess the determinants and disease spectrum of COVID-19 reinfection. MethodsA comprehensive search covering relevant databases was conducted for observational studies reporting Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed infection and reinfection cases. Quality assessment tool developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) for assessment of case series was used. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 for pooled proportions of findings in first infection and reinfection with 95% confidence interval (CI). ResultsEighty-one studies reporting 577 cases were included from 22 countries. The mean age of patients was 46.2{+/-}18.9 years with males accounting for 45.8% of the study population while 179 (31.0%) cases of comorbidities were reported. The average time duration between first infection and reinfection was 63.6{+/-}48.9 days. During first infection and reinfection, fever was the most common symptom (41.4% and 36.4%, respectively) whilst anti-viral therapy was the most common treatment regimen administered (44.5% and 43.0%, respectively). Overall, comparable odds of symptomatic presentation and management were reported in the two infections. However, a higher Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate was observed in reinfection compared to first infection (10 vs 3). Ten deaths were reported with 565 patients fully recovering. Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death (7/10 deaths). Seventy-two studies were determined to be of good quality whilst nine studies were of fair quality. ConclusionAs the first global-scale systematic review of its kind, our findings support immunization practices given increased ICU admissions and mortality in reinfections. Our cohort serves as a guide for clinicians and authorities for devising an optimal strategy for controlling the pandemic.","Dhillon, Rubaid Azhar; Qamar, Mohammad Aadil; Irfan, Omar; Gilani, Jaleed Ahmed; Waqar, Usama; Sajid, Mir Ibrahim; Mahmood, Syed Faisal",,,668

Bio-composites were doped with 1, 5, and 10 wt.% of expanded perlite and 5 wt.% of ZrO2-MgO-P2O5. The bio-composites were prepared by the cold isostatic pressing method (250 MPa) and sintered at 900°C for 1 h. In order to evaluate the characteristics of the bio-composites, microhardness, density, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were carried out on them. Additionally, the specimens whose characteristics were determined were kept in synthetic body fluid (SBF), and their in vitro behavior was examined. As a result, it was observed that microhardness increased as both the weight and the grain size of the expanded perlite were increased. Calcium silicate, tri-calcium phosphate, and hydroxyapatite were observed in the XRD analysis of all samples, and the formation of apatite structures was increased by addition of ZrO2-MgO-P2O5.","Karip, Erdogan; Muratoglu, Mehtap",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,,668

The pandemic not only has catastrophic impacts on physical health and economy around the world, but also the psychological well-being of individuals, communities and society. The psychological and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic internationally have not been well described. There is a lack of international study assessing health-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the degree to which individuals are fearful of the pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to (1) assess the health-related impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in community-dwelling individuals around the world; (2) determine the extent various communities are fearful of COVID-19 and (3) identify perceived needs of the population to prepare for potential future pandemics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This global study involves 30 countries. For each country, we target at least 500 subjects aged 18 years or above. The questionnaires will be available online and in local languages. The questionnaires include assessment of the health impacts of COVID-19, perceived importance of future preparation for the pandemic, fear, lifestyles, sociodemographics, COVID-19-related knowledge, e-health literacy, out-of-control scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe participants' characteristics, perceptions on the health-related impacts of COVID-19, fear, anxiety and depression, lifestyles, COVID-19 knowledge, e-health literacy and other measures. Univariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess the associations of covariates on the outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the local ethics committees in participating countries, where local ethics approval is needed. The results will be actively disseminated. This study aims to map an international perspective and comparison for future preparation in a pandemic.","Lok, Kris Yuet-Wan; Fong, Daniel Yee Tak; Wong, Janet Y H; Ho, Mandy; Choi, Edmond Ph; Pandian, Vinciya; Davidson, Patricia M; Duan, Wenjie; Tarrant, Marie; Lee, Jung Jae; Lin, Chia-Chin",BMJ Open,,668

A state of uncertainty related to what has become known as SARS-CoV-2 has since fueled conspiracy narratives on social media about the origin, transmission and medical treatment of and vaccination against the resulting disease, COVID-19. Using social media intelligence to monitor and understand the proliferation of conspiracy narratives is one way to analyze the distribution of misinformation on the pandemic. We analyzed more than 9.5M German language tweets about COVID-19. The results show that only about 0.6% of all those tweets deal with conspiracy theory narratives. We also found that the political orientation of users correlates with the volume of content users contribute to the dissemination of conspiracy narratives, implying that partisan communicators have a higher motivation to take part in conspiratorial discussions on Twitter. Finally, we showed that contrary to other studies, automated accounts do not significantly influence the spread of misinformation in the German speaking Twitter sphere. They only represent about 1.31% of all conspiracy-related activities in our database.","Shahrezaye, Morteza; Meckel, Miriam; Steinacker, L'ea; Suter, Viktor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12905v1.pdf,668

TRIAL DESIGN: A parallel-group quadruple-blind (participant, intervention provider, outcome assessor and data manager), randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 pneumonia will be considered eligible. Potential candidates will be identified and consecutively included in the emergency room or in the COVID-19 admission wards of two hospitals in Spain: Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Pamplona) and Hospital Moisès Broggi (Sant Joan Despí, Barcelona). Inclusion criteria are: 1) age &#8805;18 years old; 2) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum in accordance with the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health; 3) history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 &#8805;7 days; 4) hospital admission; 5) at least one of the following: C-reactive protein (CRP) >60 mg/dL, interleukin-6 (IL-6) >40 pg/mL, and/or ferritin >1000 µg/L; and 6) provision of informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: 1) allergy or contraindication to any of the drugs under study; 2) oxygen saturation (SpO2) <90% (in air ambient) or partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) <60 mmHg (in ambient air) or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg; 3) ongoing treatment with glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressants, including biologics for another indication; 4) decompensated diabetes mellitus; 5) uncontrolled hypertension; 6) psychotic or manic disorder; 7) active cancer; 8) pregnancy or breastfeeding; 9) clinical or biochemical suspicion (procalcitonin >0.5 ng/mL) of active infection other than with SARS-CoV-2; 10) management as an outpatient; 11) conservative or palliative management; 12) participation in another clinical trial; or 13) any major uncontrolled medical, psychological, psychiatric, geographic or social problem that contraindicates the patient's participation in the trial or hinders proper follow-up and adherence to the protocol and evaluation of study outcomes. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible patients will be randomised to receive standard of care plus methylprednisolone (intervention group) or standard of care plus placebo (control group). Intervention group: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets twice daily, per os, for 7 to 14 days) ± remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + methylprednisolone (once-daily intravenous infusion of 120 mg on days 1, 2 and 3). CONTROL GROUP: standard of care at the discretion of the researcher, including lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets every 12 hours, per os, for 7 to 14 days) ± remdesivir (a single intravenous loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by once-daily intravenous maintenance doses of 100 mg from day 2 to 5), or no drug treatment, + placebo (once-daily intravenous infusion of 100 mL of 0.9% saline on days 1, 2 and 3). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with treatment failure at 14 days after randomisation, defined as: 1) death, 2) need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), 3) initiation of mechanical ventilation, 4) SpO2 falling to <90% (in ambient air) or PaO2 <60 mmHg (in ambient air) or PaO2FiO2 <300 mmHg, not explained by a cause other than COVID-19, and/or 5) decrease in PaO2 &#8805;15% from baseline, together with laboratory and radiological deterioration. RANDOMISATION: Treatment will be allocated by block randomisation stratified by patient age (< or &#8805; 75 years of age). For this purpose, we will use the R randomizeR package using two block sizes (4 and 6) with random permutation. The randomisation sequence will be generated by a unit (the Navarrabiomed Clinical Trials Platform) independent from the researchers who will recruit patients and implement the protocol. BLINDING (MASKING): The study will be quadruple-blinded, specifically, with blinding of patients, intervention providers, outcome assessors and data managers. The pharmacy at each participating hospital will prepare indistinguishable bags of methylprednisolone or placebo (0.9% saline) for patients of the experimental and placebo groups, respectively. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The percentage of patients with treatment failure (primary endpoint) is currently unknown. Assuming an absolute difference of 25% in the primary outcome between the two groups (35% in the control group and 10% in the intervention group), we estimate that 60 patients (30 per group) are required to detect this difference with a two-tailed type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2. Estimating a loss to follow-up of 20%, we should recruit a total sample size of 72 patients (36 per group). TRIAL STATUS: The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) and the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital La Princesa approved version 7.0 of the protocol on 30 April 2020 as a low intervention clinical trial. Subsequently, the protocol has been amended by researchers and re-approved by AEMPS and the same ethics committee on 1 July 2020 (version 8.0) and on 28 August 2020 (version 9.0). Currently, the trial is in the recruitment phase. Recruitment began on 28 May 2020 and is expected to be completed by February 2021.

This study examined changes in drinking as a result of campus closure due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), focusing on the influence of living situation. METHOD: A sample of 312 college students (mean age = 21.2 years; 62% female; 67% White) responded to an online survey regarding their drinking behavior before and after university closures because of COVID-19. Those participants who lived with peers pre-closure and moved home to live with parents post-closure were compared with those who remained living with peers or remained living with parents in terms of changes in frequency and quantity of drinking. RESULTS: A comparison of pre- to post-closure drinking indicated significant decreases in the typical number of drinks per week (from 11.5 to 9.9) and maximum drinks per day (from 4.9 to 3.3) and a slight increase in typical drinking days per week (from 3 to 3.2). Patterns of change significantly varied across groups. Those who moved from peers to parents showed significantly greater reductions in drinking days (from 3.1 to 2.7), number of drinks per week (from 13.9 to 8.5), and maximum drinks in one day (from 5.4 to 2.9) than those who remained living with peers or with parents. In contrast, the latter two groups significantly increased their frequency (from 3.0 to 3.7 days and 2.0 to 3.3 days, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Participants reduced their quantity of drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Returning to live with parents during emerging adulthood may be protective for heavy drinking.","White, Helene R; Stevens, Angela K; Hayes, Kerri; Jackson, Kristina M",J Stud Alcohol Drugs,,668

In parallel with the ongoing world effort to identify therapeutic solutions, there is a critical need for improvement in the prognosis of COVID-19. Here, we report plasma proteome fingerprinting that predict high (hospitalized) and low-risk (outpatients) cases of COVID-19 identified by a platform that combines machine learning with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Sample preparation, MS, and data analysis parameters were optimized to achieve an overall accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 92% in dataset without feature selection. We identified two distinct regions in the MALDI-TOF profile belonging to the same proteoforms. A combination of SDS-PAGE and quantitative bottom-up proteomic analysis allowed the identification of intact and truncated forms of serum amyloid A-1 and A-2 proteins, both already described as biomarkers for viral infections in the acute phase. Unbiased discrimination of high- and low-risk COVID-19 patients using a technology that is currently in clinical use may have a prompt application in the noninvasive prognosis of COVID-19.

439402,Intelligent Water Begins With You,2020,"Social distancing and ventilation were emphasized broadly to control the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 in confined spaces. Rationales behind these two strategies, however, were debated, especially regarding quantitative recommendations. The answers to “what is the safe distance” and “what is sufficient ventilation” are crucial to the upcoming reopening of businesses and schools, but rely on many medical, biological, and engineering factors. This study introduced two new indices into the popular while perfect-mixing-based Wells-Riley model for predicting airborne virus related infection probability – the underlying reasons for keeping adequate social distance and space ventilation. The distance index P dcan be obtained by theoretical analysis on droplet distribution and transmission from human respiration activities, and the ventilation index E zrepresents the system-dependent air distribution efficiency in a space. The study indicated that 1.6−3.0 m (5.2–9.8 ft) is the safe social distance when considering aerosol transmission of exhaled large droplets from talking, while the distance can be up to 8.2 m (26 ft) if taking into account of all droplets under calm air environment. Because of unknown dose response to COVID-19, the model used one actual pandemic case to calibrate the infectious dose (quantum of infection), which was then verified by a number of other existing cases with short exposure time (hours). Projections using the validated model for a variety of scenarios including transportation vehicles and building spaces illustrated that (1) increasing social distance (e.g., halving occupancy density) can significantly reduce the infection rate (20–40 %) during the first 30 min even under current ventilation practices; (2) minimum ventilation or fresh air requirement should vary with distancing condition, exposure time, and effectiveness of air distribution systems.","Sun, Chanjuan; Zhai, Zhiqiang",Sustainable Cities Soc.,,668

445103,[Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its impact on the first week of reopening schools in Catalonia],2020,"OBJECTIVES: The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, has the potential to spread exponentially. Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. We aim to quantify vulnerability to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing and mask usage. SETTING: The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. PARTICIPANTS: None (simulation study). RESULTS: We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower and vice versa. Scenarios with very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case) were estimated to lead to a robustly controlled epidemic. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period was projected to be 2-3 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 8-12 times higher if the testing rate was 65% or 30-50 times higher with a 50% testing rate. In reality, NSW diagnosed 254 locally acquired cases over this period, an outcome that had a moderate probability in the model (10%-18%) assuming low mask uptake (0%-25%), even in the presence of extremely high testing (90%) and near-perfect community contact tracing (75%-100%), and a considerably higher probability if testing or tracing were at lower levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Stuart, Robyn M; Abeysuriya, Romesh G; Kerr, Cliff C; Mistry, Dina; Klein, Dan J; Gray, Richard T; Hellard, Margaret; Scott, Nick",BMJ Open,,668

In addition to observing and addressing opportunities at the bedside, the CNS team was essential in the development of plans of care, crisis care standards, and a structure for critical care cross-training. OUTCOMES: Five themes essential to success were identified: a common motivation and goal, collaboration, the importance of communication in utilizing established groups to create rapid change, power of influence, and the availability of a vast number of resources including professional nursing roles. CONCLUSION: Using the expertise of a specially trained team of CNSs, an effective plan was established to ensure safe, optimal care during the COVID-19 pandemic and effectively support frontline nurses.","Pate, Kimberly; Shaffer, Kathy; Belin, Latasia; Brelewski, Kiersten; Fuller, Kayla; Gold, Charles; Golden, Leslie; Raynor, Nora; Rutledge, Sarah; Spangler, Lacey; Weaver, Kelley",Clin Nurse Spec,,668

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using a nationally representative online panel to measure where food-insecure individuals acquired food, food acquisition barriers and mobility to food sources, which were evaluated across urbanicity levels using chi-squared tests and 95 % CI. SETTING: USA. PARTICIPANTS: 2011 adults (18 years or older). RESULTS: Food insecurity impacted 62·3 % of adults in urban areas, 40·5 % in rural areas and 36·7 % in suburban areas (P < 0·001). Food acquisition barriers that were significantly more prevalent among food-insecure adults in urban areas were a change in employment status (34·2 %; 95 % CI 27·2 %, 41·1 %; P < 0·0001) and limited availability of food in retailers (38·8 %; 95 % CI 31·7 %, 45·9 %; P < 0·001). In rural areas, food-insecure adults primarily acquired food for the household from supercentres (61·5 %; 95 % CI 50·4 %, 72·5 %; P < 0·05), while locally sourced foods were less common among food-insecure adults in rural areas (6·9 %; 95 % CI 0·01 %, 13·0 %) compared to urban areas (19·8 %; 95 % CI 14·3 %, 25·4 %; P < 0·01). Transportation as a barrier did not vary significantly by urbanicity, but food-insecure adults across urbanicity levels reported utilising a range of transportation modes to acquire food. CONCLUSIONS: A planning approach that links urban and rural areas could address food insecurity by enhancing the integration of food production, transportation and food distribution, building towards a more resilient and equitable food system for all Americans.","Mui, Yeeli; Headrick, Gabby; Raja, Samina; Palmer, Anne; Ehsani, Johnathon; Pollack Porter, Keshia",Public Health Nutr,,668

This cross-sectional study in a clinical center was performed in Kermanshah, west of Iran. All patients who had a record of magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and fasting blood sugar (FBS) tests in their clinical files at the time of admission to the hospital from April 21 to July 12, and didn't have a history of an underlying disease, were included in the study. Patients were divided into outpatient (as less severe COVID-19) and intensive care units (ICU) (as severe COVID-19). For statistical analysis of collected data, the SPSS software (version 16) was used. Among a total of 134 patients, 58 cases (24 ICU and 34 outpatients) were included in the study. The mean and median age was 56 and 62 years, respectively. From all included, 33 men (57%), 25 women (43%), 52 urban (89.7%), 6 rural (10.3%), 41 alive (70.7%), and 17 died (29.3%) were recorded. From all included patients, 49.1% hyperglycemia, 38% hyponatremia, 7.3% hypokalemia, and 32% hypomagnesemia were observed. Unlike the mean of age and the level of K+, there was a statistically significant difference between the outpatient and ICU groups in terms of Mg2+, Na+, and FBS (p < 0.05).

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the chest HRCT findings of 22 children who were diagnosed as COVID-19 by clinical and nucleic acid testing in Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 25 to February 5, 2020. There were 12 boys and 10 girls, aged from 2 months to 14 years old, with a median age of 4 years, and 14 patients were under 5 years old. The characteristics of lung lesions on HRCT such as distribution, shape, density and so on and whether there were hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement and pleural changes were evaluated by 2 radiologists. Results: In all of the 22 patients, the chest CT manifestations were normal in 3 patients (3/22), meanwhile the lung involvement of the lesion was found in 19 patients (19/22). Among them, 7 patients had unilateral lung involvement, and 12 patients had bilateral involvement. The HRCT manifestations were as follows. The HRCT showed the ground glass opacity (GGO) in 6 patients, including 4 cases with light opacity and 2 with typical crazy paving sign. Four patients had lung consolidation, with local fibrous stripes and patchy hyperdensity. Six patients had mixed GGO, including 1 case with right white lung. The bronchopneumonia-like changes were seen in 3 cases with scattered spot-like or mixed patchy. The lesions in the lower lobe were more serious than those in the upper lobe, and the lesions in the lateroposterior zone of the lung were more common than those in the apical and central area of the lung. No enlarged lymph nodes and pleural effusion were seen in all patients, but 1 case had thickened interlobar pleura. Conclusions: The HRCT manifestations of COVID-19 in children are varied, and the comprehensive assessment need to be made in combination with epidemiological data, clinical manifestations and laboratory tests. However, the chest HRCT plays an important role in early diagnosis, prevention and management of COVID-19.","Ma, Huijing; Shao, Jianbo; Wang, Yongjiao; Zhai, Aiguo; Zheng, Nannan; Li, Quan; Liu, Yan",Chin.

449616,Evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assay Performance Need Inclusion of Long-Term Samples,2021,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Accessory canals of the canalis sinuosus, a bony canal carrying the anterior superior alveolar nerve and vessels, can often be present but overlooked in the anterior maxilla. Dental implant placement in this area may damage neurovascular branches if this anatomic variation is not carefully identified, resulting in unexpected complications. PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify accessory canals of the canalis sinuosus and analyze their relationship to the terminal canalis sinuosus and anterior maxilla in Chinese patients to provide a warning for surgeons operating in the anterior maxilla. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 1007 Chinese patients were examined to identify the prevalence and size of accessory canals with at least 1.0-mm diameter. Axial position of this canal was classified referring to the nasal cavity and adjacent teeth. Its sagittal position was determined by the distance from the bifurcation site of canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest and the distance from the canal opening to the palatal alveolar crest. Diameter of the terminal canalis sinuosus, distance from the terminal canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest, and anterior maxillary volume were measured on all scans. Binary logistic regression and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient were used for prevalence and diameter analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of the accessory canal was 36.9%, positively correlated the anterior maxillary volume (OR 1.408) and negatively correlated with the distance from the terminal canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest (OR 0.921). Average diameter of such canal was 1.1 ±0.1 mm, significantly higher in men, positively correlated with the diameter of terminal canalis sinuosus (rs=0.163) and the distance from the canal opening to the palatal alveolar crest (rs=0.192). All accessory canals started below the buccal cortical bone, 19.3 ±2.7 mm away from the buccal alveolar crest. There were 61.9% accessory canals opened between the central and the lateral incisors. Openings here and in the central incisor region were closer to the alveolar crest than that between the lateral incisor and the canine (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Accessory canals of the canalis sinuosus have high prevalence in the anterior maxilla in a Chinese population. Large anterior maxillary volume has been demonstrated as a risk factor associated with the presence of such canals. The region between the central and the lateral incisors was a predominant location. Openings in this region were closer to the alveolar crest than those between the lateral incisor and the canine.","Shan, Tiantian; Qu, Yang; Huang, Xiangya; Gu, Lisha",J. prosthet. dent,,668

The aim of this article is to analyse the use of urban planning regulations as an instrument for containing tourism activity in situations of overtourism. A two-stage methodological approach is employed: Firstly, a review of the local governments’ response to the effects of tourism growth and the possibilities of local control in 46 Spanish cities is presented;secondly, a comparative analysis of the stricter short-term rentals regulations adopted by those cities is carried out. The common basis of the adopted regulations is the control of tourist use of an entire dwelling. Of the cities analysed, Barcelona has the most restrictive regulation, while in all the other cities, regulation is less restrictive and depends on the type of accommodation in question and/or the conditions imposed on issuing new licences. The results demonstrate the difficulties entailed in the process of formulating and applying regulations and reveal imbalances between the economic and urban planning visions, and between the rapid change in tourism and the much slower response capacity of governments.","García-Hernández, María Sofía Mendoza de Miguel",Sustainability,,668

In this study we have proposed a novel framework for real time detection of coronavirus patients without manual intervention. In our framework, we have introduced a 3-step process in which initially K-means clustering, and feature extraction is performed as a data pre-processing step. In the second step, the selected features are optimized by a novel feature optimization approach based on hybrid differential evolution algorithm and particle swarm optimization. The optimized features are then feed forwarded to SVM classifier. Empirical results show that our proposed model is able to achieve 99.34% accuracy.

Here we assessed the clinical utility of targeted RNA and DNA molecular profiling in NMIBC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression in NMIBC samples was profiled by NanoString nCounter, a RNA quantification platform, from two independent cohorts (n = 28, n = 50); targeted panel sequencing was performed in a subgroup (n = 50). Gene signatures were externally validated using two RNAseq datasets of NMIBC tumors (n = 438, n=73). Established molecular subtype classifiers and novel gene expression signatures were assessed for associations with clinicopathologic characteristics, somatic tumor mutations, and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Molecular subtypes distinguished between low-grade Ta tumors with FGFR3 mutations and overexpression (UROMOL-class 1) and tumors with more aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics (UROMOL-classes 2 and 3), which were significantly enriched with TERT promoter mutations. However, UROMOL subclasses were not associated with recurrence after bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy in two independent cohorts. In contrast, a novel expression signature of an inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME) was associated with improved recurrence-free survival after BCG. Expression of immune checkpoint genes (PD-L1/PD-1/CTLA-4) was associated with an inflamed TME, but not with higher recurrence rates after BCG. FGFR3 mutations and overexpression were both associated with low immune signatures. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of the immune TME, rather than molecular subtypes, is a promising predictive biomarker of BCG response. Modulating the TME in an immunologically ""cold"" tumor warrants further investigation. Integrated transcriptomic and exome sequencing should improve treatment selection in NMIBC.","Damrauer, Jeffrey S; Roell, Kyle R; Smith, Markia A; Sun, Xuezheng; Kirk, Erin L; Hoadley, Katherine A; Benefield, Halei C; Iyer, Gopakumar; Solit, David B; Milowsky, Matthew I; Kim, William Y; Nielsen, Matthew E; Wobker, Sara E; Dalbagni, Guido; Al-Ahmadie, Hikmat A; Olshan, Andrew F; Bochner, Bernard H; Furberg, Helena; Troester, Melissa A; Pietzak, Eugene J",Clin. cancer res,,668

POPULATION: 28 128 women receiving antenatal care between 1 April 2016 and 31 December 2020. METHODS: Retrospective study of prospectively collected data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of women screened diagnosed as having gestational diabetes. RESULTS: The mean (SD) percentage of women diagnosed with GDM was 14.78 (2.24) in summer (June, July, August) compared with 11.23 (1.62) in winter (P < 0.001), 12.13 (1.94) in spring (P = 0.002) and 11.88 (2.67) in autumn (P = 0.003).

However, the fact that we lacked a specific, highly effective treatment for COVID led many to argue that a COVID challenge trial would be unethical and we ought to pursue traditional phase III testing instead. These ethical objections to challenge trials may have slowed the progress of a COVID vaccine, so it is important to evaluate their merit. One common way of doing so is to make an analogy to other social practices that are relevantly similar and which we currently sanction. We submit that non-directed live organ donation (NDLOD) is a promising analogy. After arguing that the risks to volunteers for each activity appear similar, we explore potential disanalogies that would undermine the comparison. We note that there are differences in both the kind and certainty of benefit secured by NDLOD compared to challenge trials. We conclude these differences are insufficient to make NDLOD permissible and challenge trials impermissible. Ultimately, if we think the risks associated with NDLOD are ethically permissible, then we should think the same of the risks associated with COVID challenge trials.","Jayaram, Athmeya; Sparks, Jacob; Callies, Daniel",Bioethics,,668

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the health care for patients with classical phenylketonuria in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the National Health Fund's reporting data concerning information on healthcare services for patients with classical phenylketonuria (PKU), which were reported to the payer by the healthcare service providers between 2009 and 2015. The analysis was prepared within the framework of mapping the health care needs of patients with metabolic diseases published in December 2016 (http://www.mapypotrzebzdrowotnych.mz.gov.pl/). RESULTS: A total of 2706 patients with PKU (including 1180 children) were registered in the healthcare system in the period covered. The estimated national prevalence of PKU was 1 per 7758 live births. Paediatric patients up to 12 moths of age accounted for over 40% of all visits to outpatient clinics. Patients over 28 years of age accounted for only 1% of all PKU patients receiving specialist outpatient care. There were twice as many clinics providing health care to children than to adults. The majority of adult patients received healthcare from the same providers as children. Sixty-nine percent of adults and 64% of children were treated in the two largest outpatient centres. There were 12 deaths, with a median age of 63 years. The working-age adults accounted for 50% of the deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients with PKU do not receive sufficient healthcare. The discontinuation of healthcare by adults with PKU can result from the lack of an adequate transition process from paediatric to adult care.","Szypowska, Agnieszka; Franek, Edward; J Grzeszczak, Wladyslaw; Zieba, Mariusz; Filipow, Winicjusz; Kabicz, Pawel; Wieckowska, Barbara; Sykut-Cegielska, Jolanta; Taybert, Joanna",Pediatr Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,,668

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic review to identify reports published from November 1, 2019, until June 15, 2020, on laboratory-confirmed community-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants less than 3 months of age. We excluded studies reporting neonates with perinatal COVID exposure and diagnosis prior to hospital discharge and hospital-onset disease, as well as clinically diagnosed cases without confirmation. Two independent reviewers performed study screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. Variables of interest included patient age, exposure to COVID-19, past medical history, clinical symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, laboratory findings, clinical course, and disposition. RESULTS: 38 publications met inclusion criteria, including 23 single case reports, 14 case series, and 1 cohort study, describing 63 infants under 3 months of age with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most cases were mild to moderate. Fever, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and neurologic findings were reported. Laboratory abnormalities included neutropenia, lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of inflammatory markers and aminotransferases. Fifty-eight (92%) infants were hospitalized, 13 (21%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 2 (3%) required mechanical ventilation. No death was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among young infants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, most cases were mild to moderate and improved with supportive care.

462199,False negative results and tolerance limits of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests,2021,"BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous physical and mental strain on the US healthcare system. Studies examining the effects of outbreaks have demonstrated both an increased prevalence and long-term development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in healthcare providers. We sought to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of medical providers, medical trainees, and administrators at a large academic center to identify stressors and moderators to guide future mental health and hospital-system interventions. METHODS: A 42-item survey examining specific stressors, grit, and resilience was widely distributed to physicians, residents, fellows, and administrators a large academic institution for departmental distribution. Survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and multivariate linear regressions. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 785 participants completed the survey. The majority of respondents rated their stress to be significantly increased during the pandemic. Respondents' fear of transmitting the virus to their family members was a significant stressor. Higher resilience was associated with lower stress, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Overall, respondents felt supported by their departments and institution and felt contingency plans and personal protective equipment were adequate. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers have increased resilience in the face of heightened stress during a pandemic. Higher resilience and grit were protective factors in managing personal and system-level stressors at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our institution. Implementing an intervention designed to enhance healthcare workers' resilience in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is warranted.","Huffman, Elizabeth M; Athanasiadis, Dimitrios I; Anton, Nicholas E; Haskett, Lindsay A; Doster, Dominique L; Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Lee, Nicole K",Am J Surg,,668

This study explored UK womens experiences of accessing pertussis vaccination during pregnancy and infant vaccinations during COVID-19. MethodsAn online cross-sectional survey was completed, between 3rd August-11 th October 2020, by 1404 women aged 16+ years who were pregnant at some point after the first UK lockdown from March 23rd, 2020. Ten follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted. ResultsMost women surveyed were pregnant (65.7%) and a third postnatal (34.3%). Almost all women (95.6%) were aware that pertussis vaccination is recommended in pregnancy. Most pregnant (72.1%) and postnatal women (84.0%) had received pertussis vaccination; however, access issues were reported. Over a third (39.6%) of women had a pregnancy vaccination appointment changed. COVID-19 made it physically difficult to access pregnancy vaccinations for one fifth (21.5%) of women and physically difficult to access infant vaccinations for almost half of women (45.8%). Nearly half of women (45.2%) reported feeling less safe attending pregnancy vaccinations and over three quarters (76.3%) less safe attending infant vaccinations due to COVID-19. The majority (94.2%) felt it was important to get their baby vaccinated during COVID-19. Pregnant women from ethnic-minorities and lower-income households were less likely to have been vaccinated. Minority-ethnicity women were more likely to report access problems and feeling less safe attending vaccinations for both themselves and their babies. Qualitative analysis found women experienced difficulties accessing antenatal care and relied on knowledge from previous pregnancies to access vaccines in pregnancy. ConclusionDuring the ongoing and future pandemics, healthcare services should prioritise equitable access to routine vaccinations, including tailoring services for ethnic-minority families who experience greater barriers to vaccination. HighlightsO_LIAccess to pregnancy vaccines in the United Kingdom was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

463970,Commentary: Potential transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection via donor corneal tissue,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the readability and presence of translated online information readily available to the British public during COVID-19. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed. The terms ""Coronavirus"", ""COVID-19"", ""Lockdown"", ""Social Distancing"", ""Handwashing"", ""Furlough Scheme"" and ""Sick pay"" were inputted into the popular search engine, Google. Websites were categorised by their source (i.e. Government, Non-Governmental Organisation, NHS and Commercial) and theme (i.e. general COVID-19 information, population practise and employment rulings). Reliable calculators for assessing readability (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Gunning Fog Index, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index and Automated Readability Index) were used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The median scores with the interquartile range from each calculator of the pooled data were observed. The presence of accompanying translated material and graphic information was also counted and presented as counts and percentages. The number of readable websites (i.e. a score &#8804; 8) for each source and theme category were also recorded. SETTING: UK Internet servers. RESULTS: The median scores of the pooled data (n = 148) had shown that the majority of websites were unreadable to the average British reader according to each calculator used (SMOG 1.3%; GF 6.8%; FK 35.8%; CL 2.6%; ARI 40%). Only 3.4% and 6.8% of the pooled websites had readily available translated material and accompanying graphic material, respectively. CONCLUSION: Readability of COVID-19 information is below national standards and that there is a lack of accompanying translated and graphics-based material online. This may lead to an amplified level of misunderstanding in BAME populations about the COVID-19 pandemic and the rulings put in place.","Khan, Sobia; Asif, Ashar; Jaffery, Ali Emad",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,668

Costs were revised with respect to the lockdown R0 or under different R0 scenarios to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the screening program adopted. Weekly nasopharyngeal swabs for parents, neonates, and personnel were the major cost during the pandemic, although they effectively reduced the number of cases in our unit.Conclusion: Parents and healthcare personnel testing appears to be an effective strategy due to the high number of contact they have within the hospital environment and outside, able to minimize the cases within our unit.

468701,Negative tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection do not rule out its responsibility for chilblains: reply from the authors,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only reservoirs of wild poliovirus transmission. Prior modeling suggested that before the COVID-19 pandemic, plans to stop the transmission of serotype 1 wild poliovirus (WPV1) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) did not appear on track to succeed. METHODS: We updated an existing poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model for Pakistan and Afghanistan to characterize the impacts of immunization disruptions and restrictions on human interactions (i.e., population mixing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also consider different options for responding to outbreaks and for preventive supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). RESULTS: The modeling suggests that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, Pakistan and Afghanistan would remain off-track for stopping all transmission through 2023 without improvements in quality. CONCLUSIONS: Using trivalent OPV (tOPV) for SIAs instead of serotype 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2) offers substantial benefits for ending the transmission of both WPV1 and cVDPV2, because tOPV increases population immunity for both serotypes 1 and 2 while requiring fewer SIA rounds, when effectively delivered in transmission areas.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Pallansch, Mark A; Cochi, Stephen L; Thompson, Kimberly M",J. infect. dis,,668

We discuss the role myocardial microvascular pericytes expressing the ACE-2 receptor and their potential for an organ-specific cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Dysfunctional microvascular support by pericytes or endothelial cells may increase the propensity for AF via increased myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, increased tissue edema, and interstitial hydrostatic pressure. All of these factors can lead to electrical perturbances at the tissue and cellular level. We also consider the contribution of Angiotensin, pulmonary hypertension, and regulatory T cells as additional contributors to AF during COVID-19 infection.

We sought to determine the extent and the determinants of exercise limitation in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital discharge. Eighteen consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 1:1 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls underwent: spirometry, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test and exercise echocardiography for the study of pulmonary circulation. Arterial blood was sampled at rest and during exercise in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 lie roughly on the same oxygen consumption isophlets than controls both at rest and during submaximal exercise, thanks to supernormal cardiac output (P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption at peak exercise was reduced by 30% in COVID-19 (P < 0.001), due to a peripheral extraction limit. In addition, within COVID-19 patients, hemoglobin content was associated with peak oxygen consumption (R2 = 0.46, P = 0.002). Respiratory reserve was not exhausted (median [IRQ], 0.59 [0.15]) in spite of moderate reduction of forced vital capacity (79 ± 40%). Pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise was not different between patients and controls. Ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (39.5 [8.5] vs. 29.5 [8.8], P < 0.001), and such an increase was mainly explained by increased chemosensitivity. When recovering from COVID-19, patients present with reduced exercise capacity and augmented exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, including anemia and reduced oxygen extraction by peripheral muscles were the major determinants of deranged exercise physiology. Pulmonary vascular function seemed unaffected, despite restrictive lung changes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY At the time of hospital discharge, patients with COVID-19 present with reduced functional capacity and exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, namely reduced oxygen extraction (myopathy) and anemia, which are not fully compensated by a supernormal cardiac output response, account for exercise limitation before exhaustion of the respiratory reserve. Enhanced chemoreflex sensitivity, rather increased dead space, mainly accounts for exercise hyperventilation. The pulmonary vascular response to exercise circulation of survived patients with COVID-19 does not present major pathological changes.","Baratto, Claudia; Caravita, Sergio; Faini, Andrea; Perego, Giovanni Battista; Senni, Michele; Badano, Luigi P; Parati, Gianfranco",J Appl Physiol (1985),,668

COVID-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 143,000 confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in prisoners hospitalized with COVID-19. An observational study of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 10 and May 10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models were used to investigate primary outcomes. Of the 706 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (mean age 66.7 ± 16.1 years, 57% males, and 44% black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9% vs. 18.7%), required vasopressors (24.1% vs. 9.9%), and intubated (25.0% vs. 15.2%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted inpatient mortality (29.6% vs. 20.1%) and 30-day mortality (34.3% vs. 24.6%).

Symptoms of continuous pain can produce psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The spread of COVID-19 pandemic added to distress experienced by patients with IC emotions, such as fear, sadness, boredom, frustration and anger. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A research on very recent literature outlines the necessity for patients facing the complexity of IC during the COVID-19 outbreak to prevent the temporary crisis, to broaden perspectives, to deal with confusion, to support in struggling with unpleasant and unexpected events. CONCLUSIONS: People affected by IC have a psychological vulnerability that needs tailored support interventions, particularly in the COVID era. A multidisciplinary approach offers a personalized treatment through a web-mediated counseling intervention for patients and their caregivers: a space for continuous discussion and reflection can favour a relationship-based process of change aimed at an improvement in quality of life.","Marano, G; Gaetani, E; Marturano, M; Sani, G; Gasbarrini, A; Scambia, G; Mazza, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,668
480667,Introductions and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York City area,2020,"Characterizing the interactions that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs make with host cell proteins during infection can improve our understanding of viral RNA functions and the host innate immune response. Using RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry, we identified up to 104 human proteins that directly and specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in infected human cells. We integrated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with changes in proteome abundance induced by viral infection and linked interactome proteins to cellular pathways relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We demonstrated by genetic perturbation that cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) and La-related protein 1 (LARP1), two of the most strongly enriched viral RNA binders, restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells and provide a global map of their direct RNA contact sites. Pharmacological inhibition of three other RNA interactome members, PPIA, ATP1A1, and the ARP2/3 complex, reduced viral replication in two human cell lines. The identification of host dependency factors and defence strategies as presented in this work will improve the design of targeted therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Schmidt, Nora; Lareau, Caleb A; Keshishian, Hasmik; Ganskih, Sabina; Schneider, Cornelius; Hennig, Thomas; Melanson, Randy; Werner, Simone; Wei, Yuanjie; Zimmer, Matthias; Ade, Jens; Kirschner, Luisa; Zielinski, Sebastian; Dölken, Lars; Lander, Eric S; Caliskan, Neva; Fischer, Utz; Vogel, Jörg; Carr, Steven A; Bodem, Jochen; Munschauer, Mathias",Nat. microbiol,,668
480668,Introductions and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York City area,2020,"Clinical trials emerged in rapid succession as the COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented need for life-saving therapies. Fair and equitable subject selection in clinical trials offering investigational therapies ought to be an urgent moral concern. Subject selection determines the distribution of risks and benefits, and impacts the applicability of the study results for the larger population. While Research Ethics Committees monitor fair subject selection within each trial, no standard oversight exists for subject selection across multiple trials for the same disease. Drawing on the experience of multiple clinical trials at a single academic medical centre in the USA, we posit that concurrent COVID-19 trials are liable to unfair and inequitable subject selection on account of scientific uncertainty, lack of transparency, scarcity and, lastly, structural barriers to equity compounded by implicit bias. To address the critical gap in the current literature and international regulation, we propose new ethical guidelines for research design and conduct that bolsters fair and equitable subject selection. Although the proposed guidelines are tailored to the research design and protocol of concurrent trials in the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have broader relevance to single COVID-19 trials.","Jansen, Maud O; Angelos, Peter; Schrantz, Stephen J; Donington, Jessica S; Madariaga, Maria Lucia L; Zakrison, Tanya L",J. med. ethics,,668

METHODS: A descriptive report of the first 100 patients with suspected COVID-19 who have visited the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 screening clinic at the National Centre for Disease Control in Tobruk, Libya. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms were fever (90%), cough (89%), dyspnea (85%), sore throat (79%), fatigue (78%), headache (64%), loss of smell (52%), loss of taste (53%), loss of appetite (43%), nausea and vomiting (26%), diarrhea (22%), and rhinorrhea (16%); 51% of the patients had lymphocytopenia, whereas 13% had thrombocytopenia. Bilateral infiltrates were the most common radiologic finding on chest X-ray (76%), and COVID-19 IgM and/or IgG antibodies were detected in 80% of the patients, whereas only 37% of the patients were tested positive by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CONCLUSIONS: The disease continued its spread across the region. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the main symptoms; 21% of the patients did not have any chest X-ray abnormalities. Initial negative results for either antibody testing or RT-PCR-testing for COVID-19 do not rule out the infection.","Ismail, Faisal; Farag, Atiya; Haq, Soghra; Kamal, Mohammad A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,668

488069,Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of developed rapid SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody test kit using novel diluent system,2021,"Sentiment Analysis techniques enable the automatic extraction of sentiment in social media data, including popular platforms as Twitter. For retailers and marketing analysts, such methods can support the understanding of customers' attitudes towards brands, especially to handle crises that cause behavioural changes in customers, including the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the increasing adoption of black-box machine learning-based techniques, transparency becomes a need for those stakeholders to understand why a given sentiment is predicted, which is rarely explored for retailers facing social media crises. This study develops an Explainable Sentiment Analysis (XSA) application for Twitter data, and proposes research propositions focused on evaluating such application in a hypothetical crisis management scenario. Particularly, we evaluate, through discussions and a simulated user experiment, the XSA support for understanding customer's needs, as well as if marketing analysts would trust such an application for their decision-making processes. Results illustrate the XSA application can be effective in providing the most important words addressing customers sentiment out of individual tweets, as well as the potential to foster analysts' confidence in such support.

Rapid, accurate, and cost-effective COVID-19 screening tests working at a population level are in imperative demand globally. MethodsBased on the eye symptoms of COVID-19, we developed and tested a COVID-19 rapid prescreening model using the eye-region images captured in China and Spain with cellphone cameras. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based model was trained on these eye images to complete binary classification task of identifying the COVID-19 cases. The performance was measured using area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1. The application programming interface was open access. FindingsThe multicenter study included 2436 pictures corresponding to 657 subjects (155 COVID-19 infection, 23{middle dot}6%) in development dataset (train and validation) and 2138 pictures corresponding to 478 subjects (64 COVID-19 infections, 13{middle dot}4%) in test dataset.

488872,"Comment Regarding Pediatric SARS-CoV-2: Clinical Presentation, Infectivity, and Immune Responses",2020,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly around the world, and some patients present gastrointestinal symptoms. The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models. Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7-12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39-65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14-50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education. With the gradual normalization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, protection and management in endoscopy units may be changed accordingly.","Tian, Yuan; Nian, Bixiao; Ma, Yongchen; Guo, Xinyue; Wang, Feng; Rong, Long",Front Public Health,,668

Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society, but their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2-4. Here, we compile new data on 1,717 local, regional, and national non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these six countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting roughly 530 million total infections. These findings may help inform whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified, or lifted, and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 has been reported7.","Hsiang, Solomon; Allen, Daniel; Annan-Phan, Sébastien; Bell, Kendon; Bolliger, Ian; Chong, Trinetta; Druckenmiller, Hannah; Huang, Luna Yue; Hultgren, Andrew; Krasovich, Emma; Lau, Peiley; Lee, Jaecheol; Rolf, Esther; Tseng, Jeanette; Wu, Tiffany",Nature (Lond.),,668

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

AIM: At a Singaporean tertiary hospital, individuals with clinical syndromes compatible with COVID-19 but no epidemiologic risk were placed in cohorted general wards for COVID-19 testing. To mitigate risk, an infection control bundle was implemented comprising infrastructural enhancements, improved personal protective equipment, and social distancing. We assessed the impact on environmental contamination and transmission. METHODS: Upon detection of a case of COVID-19 in the dedicated general ward, patients and health care workers (HCWs) contacts were identified. All patient and staff close-contacts were placed on 14-day phone surveillance and followed up for 28 days; symptomatic contacts were tested. Environmental samples were also obtained. FINDINGS: Over a 3-month period, 28 unsuspected cases of COVID-19 were contained in the dedicated general ward. In 5 of the 28 cases, sampling of the patient's environment yielded SARS-CoV-2; index cases who required supplemental oxygen had higher odds of environmental contamination (Pâ¯=â¯.01). A total of 253 staff close-contacts and 45 patient close-contacts were identified; only 3 HCWs (1.2%, 3/253) required quarantine. On 28-day follow-up, no patient-to-HCW transmission was documented; only 1 symptomatic patient close-contact tested positive.

This study examines Chinese rural residents' mental health risk under emergency lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It investigates how the environmental, socioeconomic, and behavioral dimensions of community support affect mental health in this emergency context. We also explore whether community support's effectiveness depends on the strictness of lockdown measures implemented and the level of individual perceived COVID-19 infection risk. We collect self-reported mental health risk, community support, and demographics information through a cross-sectional survey of 3892 Chinese rural residents living in small towns and villages. Ordinary least square regressions are employed to estimate the psychological effects of community support. The results suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown policies negatively affect psychological well-being, especially for rural females. The capacity for community production has the largest impact on reducing mental health risks, followed by the stability of basic medical services, community cohesion, housing condition, the stability of communications and transportation supply, and the eco-environment. The effectiveness of different community support dimensions depends on the level of lockdown policy implemented and the levels of one's perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Our study stresses the psychological significance of a healthy living environment, resilient infrastructure and public service system, and community production capacity during the lockdown in rural towns and villages.","Jia, Ziyu; Xu, Shijia; Zhang, Zican; Cheng, Zhengyu; Han, Haoqing; Xu, Haoxiang; Wang, Mingtian; Zhang, Hong; Zhou, Yi; Zhou, Zhengxu",Journal of rural studies,,668

500888,Lateral flow tests cannot rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Introduction: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently causing a pandemic all over the world. Many patients suffer from respiratory syndromes, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Coinfection with fungi is rare in these fragile patients but does increase the mortality risk in them. We present a case of COVID-19 who presented with shortness of breath and was found to have associated pulmonary cryptococcosis.Case presentation: A 78-year-old woman with hypertension and diabetes mellitus was transferred to our hospital with an upper GI bleed. Initially, she presented to another hospital after she was tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently admitted due to shortness of breath. She was transferred to our critical care unit for a higher level of care after reporting melena and having a hemoglobin drop. She was in respiratory distress when admitted and was intubated. A culture from a deep tracheal aspirate grew Cryptococcus neoformans on admission. Cryptococcal antigen in her blood was negative. The patient was started on fluconazole. More history from her family indicated that she was immunocompetent with no chronic corticosteroid therapy or HIV. Lumbar puncture was done and showed an opening pressure of 34 cm H2O with 25 RBCs/mm3 and 5 WBCs/mm3, but it was performed after she received fluconazole for several days. The patient died with ARDS. Discussion: Cryptococcosis is a potentially life-threatening fungal infection usually caused by inhalation of C. neoformans or C. gatti spores. Severe cryptococcal disease occurs in immunocompromised patients but can also occur in immunocompetent adults. The association between fungal infection and COVID-19 has been reported with Aspergillus species. Yet, few reports are available about coinfection with Cryptococcus species and COVID-19. Considering that COVID-19 causes ARDS, coinfection with Cryptococcus species almost certainly increases inflammation in the lung and the risk for poor outcomes. Since corticosteroids are a necessary treatment in COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia, initiating them in patients with cryptococcal infection should be closely monitored for the possibility of dissemination. Clinicians should obtain cultures for Cryptococcus species from blood and the central nervous system in COVID-19 patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis and balance the need for corticosteroids with the risk of cryptococcal dissemination.","Abohelwa, M.

500932,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication in an immunocompromised patient,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic was the reason for closing down all non-urgent outpatient services in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. The lockdown and reorganisation of medical units altered also the accessibility to outpatient rehabilitation services. AIM: The focus of interest in our report lies in the evaluation of the outpatient rehabilitation treatment accessibility at our centre in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Outpatients Rehabilitation Unit at University Medical Centre Maribor (UMC Maribor), Slovenia. POPULATION: Patients with diverse pathologies referred to outpatient rehabilitation. METHODS: The data was gathered retrospectively at the Institute of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (IPRM) at the UMC Maribor. The search included all the patients treated at IPRM in the pre-COVID and COVID period from March 16 to August 31 in 2019 and 2020. The data for the period including the lockdown (March 16th to August 31st 2020) and the period after the lockdown (June 1st to August 31st 2020) was analysed and compared to the same timeframes in 2019. We were interested in the magnitude of decline in the total number of patients, the number of the first and follow-up visits, the number of sessions and in the profile and pathologies of patients comparing pre-COVID and COVID period. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used in the analysis. RESULTS: With the lockdown period included there was a 44% decline in the total number of patients, a 71.1% decline in the number of sessions, a 42% decline of the first visits and a 60.9% decline of follow-up visits. When comparing the pre-COVID and COVID period after the lockdown, a 28.5% decline in the number of patients treated in 2020 compared to 2019 was observed. By analysing the number of sessions in the pre-COVID and COVID period after the lockdown there was a 46.6% decline. No statistically significant difference was found in the age groups between the two periods (X2 = 9.466; P = 0.05). The difference for the first and follow-up visits in 2019 and 2020 proved to be statistically significant (P < 0.001), as well as the difference in percentage of patients in the acute and chronic group (P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show how COVID-19 outbreak hindered the accessibility to outpatient rehabilitation service. Not only has the number of patients substantially reduced in the year 2020 compared to 2019 but also the number of sessions and number of first and follow-up visits declined. The demographic structure of the patients remained the same. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: This study adds evidence at the level of health services about lower standard of care in the physical and rehabilitation medicine field for patients experiencing disabling conditions in the time of COVID-19.","JesenSek PapeZ, Breda; SoSiC, Luka; Bojnec, Vida",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

501746,Heat inactivation of serum interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2,2020,"In the absence of vaccines and effective antiviral drugs, control of the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) relies mainly on the adequacy of public health resources and policies. Hence, failure to establish and implement scientifically reliable control measures may have a significant effect on the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, severity of the disease, and death toll. The average number of secondary transmissions from an infected person, or reproduction numbers (R0 and R), and the points at which the collective immunity begins to reduce the transmission of the infection, or herd immunity thresholds, are important epidemiological tools used in strategies of Covid-19 control, suppression, and mitigation. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through asymptomatic carriers and, possibly, aerosols, has been ignored, and this may affect the effectiveness of Covid-19 control strategies. Therefore, consideration of the two possible ways of transmission would substantially increase the values of reproduction numbers, but if estimates of the contingent of the population naturally resistant to the virus, plus those with pre-existing cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2 were considered, the evaluation of herd immunity thresholds should reach their real and achievable levels.","Tosta, Eduardo",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,668

The effects of the behavioral restriction on cognition have been little examined. The present study is aimed at analyzing the effects of lockdown on executive function prominently involved in adapting behavior to new environmental demands. We analyze non-verbal fluency abilities, as indirectly providing a measure of cognitive flexibility to react to spatial changes. Sixteen students (mean age 20.75;SD 1.34), evaluated before the start of the lockdown (T1) in a battery of psychological tasks exploring different cognitive domains, have been reassessed during lockdown (T2). The assessment included the modified Five-Point Test (m-FPT) to analyze non-verbal fluency abilities. At T2, the students were also administered the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The restriction of behaviors following a lockdown determines increased non-verbal fluency, evidenced by the significant increase of the number of new drawings. We found worsened verbal span, while phonemic verbal fluency remained unchanged. Interestingly, we observed a significant tendency to use the left part of each box in the m-FPT correlated with TAS-20 and with the subscales that assess difficulty in describing and identifying feelings. Although our data were collected from a small sample, they evidence that the restriction of behaviors determines a leftward bias, suggesting a greater activation of the right hemisphere, intrinsically connected with the processing of non-verbal information and with the need to manage an emotional situation.","Lardone, A.; Turriziani, P.; Sorrentino, P.; Gigliotta, O.; Chirico, A.; Lucidi, F.; Mandolesi, L.",Frontiers in Psychology,,668

The problems caused by this rapid transition are combined with the negative psychological outcomes of the pandemic, leading to numerous problems and difficulties in the teaching and learning processes. The recentness of these issues and developments requires detailed investigation as to how they affect distance learning. This study aims to investigate the role of psycho‐demographic variables in the motivation and attendance of higher education students in distance education within the context of the Covid‐19 pandemic. In this descriptive study, we collected data from 1494 Turkish university students via an online survey. Quantitative data were analysed using correlation analysis, t test, one‐way ANOVA, multiple linear regression analysis, and structural equation modelling. Stress, anxiety, depression and intolerance of uncertainty were correlated negatively with distance learning motivation and frequency of distance learning attendance. While students who attended distance learning only synchronously joined the courses more frequently, the motivation of those who joined the courses sometimes synchronously and sometimes asynchronously was higher. The strength of the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty and distance learning motivation was significantly increased via anxiety and depression. Findings highlight the need for analysis of psycho‐demographic variables while designing and implementing distance education programmes. Psychological variables including stress, anxiety and depression are related to motivation and attendance during distance education. While using both synchronous and asynchronous distance learning enhances motivation, synchronous learning increases attendance.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has pushed countries' health systems to the limit and had previously unknown consequences on the job performance of health professionals. In this context, what are the determinants of performance? There are numerous studies that link job performance with other variables that directly affect it, such as leadership, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work environment. However, there are no studies that jointly relate all these variables, and even less in the field of health. The main objective of this work is to analyse how these variables are configured together to generate a good level of performance of health professionals during the times of COVID-19. To do this, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is carried out, an appropriate method that will allow finding the joint causal effects of key variables in human resources to ensure a good level of job performance in health organizations. The study reveals that leadership and commitment are the two key drivers of performance. The data confirm that the ""recipe"" to achieve a good level of performance consists of the combination of leadership, commitment, and a good work environment. Additionally, in the case of less satisfied workers, linking leadership and commitment is a sufficient condition.","Yáñez-Araque, Benito; Gómez-Cantarino, Sagrario; Gutiérrez-Broncano, Santiago; López-Ruiz, Víctor-Raúl",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,668
505726,Acute smell and taste loss in outpatients: all infected with SARS-CoV-2?,2020,"Due to the COVID-19 crisis, managers and employees in many organizations suddenly are forced to work from home. Although working from home (WFH) is not a new phenomenon, it is new in its current scale and scope because of COVID-19. Against this background, we investigate the effect of WFH during the COVID-19 crisis on changes in leadership behaviors, and associated changes in perceived manager quality and productivity, at different hierarchical levels in organizations. Based on the literature, we develop two predictions in opposite directions. On the one hand, implementing WFH may force managers to show less direction and control and especially more delegation. On the other hand, research into the effects of exogenous shocks such as COVID-19, suggests that managers may become more controlling and delegate less. Consistent with the first prediction, we find that managers perceive they execute significantly less control and delegate more. Employees also perceive a significant decrease in control, however they perceive on average no change in delegation. Furthermore, and in line with the second prediction, employees of lower-level managers even report a significant decrease in delegation. Finally, our results show that increased delegation is associated with increased perceived productivity and higher manager quality. Together, these results suggest that in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the effectiveness of WFH might be hampered by the fact that required changes in leadership behaviors, in particular in delegation, are difficult to realize in times of crisis.","Stoker, Janka I.; Garretsen, Harry Lammers Joris",Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies,,668

507571,Comparison of 16 Serological SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassays in 16 Clinical Laboratories,2021,"The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has seen an unprecedented amount of rapidly generated genome data. These data have revealed the emergence of lineages with mutations associated to transmissibility and antigenicity, known as variants of concern (VOCs). A striking aspect of VOCs is that many of them involve an unusually large number of defining mutations. Current phylogenetic estimates of the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that its genome accrues around 2 mutations per month. However, VOCs can have around 15 defining mutations and it is hypothesised that they emerged over the course of a few months, implying that they must have evolved faster for a period of time. We analysed genome sequence data from the GISAID database to assess whether the emergence of VOCs can be attributed to changes in the evolutionary rate of the virus and whether this pattern can be detected at a phylogenetic level using genome data. We fit a range of molecular clock models and assessed their statistical fit. Our analyses indicate that the emergence of VOCs is driven by an episodic increase in the evolutionary rate of around 4-fold the background phylogenetic rate estimate that may have lasted several weeks or months. These results underscore the importance of monitoring the molecular evolution of the virus as a means of understanding the circumstances under which VOCs may emerge.","Tay, John H; Porter, Ashleigh F; Wirth, Wytamma; Duchene, Sebastian",,,668

Sickle erythrocytes can lead to thrombus formation and vaso-occlusive episodes that may result in hemolytic anemia, pain crisis and multiple organ damage. Moreover, SCD is characterized by endothelial damage, increased inflammatory response, platelet activation and aggravation, and activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic coagulation pathways. Cerebrovascular events constitute an important clinical complication of SCD. Children with SCD have a 300-fold higher risk of acute stroke and by the age of 45 about 25% of patients have suffered an overt stoke. Management and prevention of stroke in patients with SCD is not well defined.

The current paper thus explores the extent and distribution of probable PTSD among patients attending general practices in England. Cross-sectional survey data from adult patients (n = 1058) attending 11 general practices in southwest England were analysed. Patients were recruited from waiting rooms and completed anonymous questionnaires, including measures of depression, anxiety and risky alcohol use. Current probable PTSD was measured using the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Scale (PC-PTSD). Results indicated 15.1% of patients that exhibited probable PTSD (PC-PTSD &#8805; 3), with higher levels observed in practices from deprived areas. There were 53.8% of patients with probable PTSD that expressed the desire for help with these issues. The analyses suggested that rates were lowest among older adults, and highest among patients who were not in cohabitating relationships or were unemployed. Measures of anxiety and depression were associated with 10-fold and 16-fold increases in risk of probable PTSD, respectively, although there were no discernible associations with risky drinking. Such preliminary findings highlight the need for vigilance for PTSD in routine general practice in the UK, and signal a strong need for additional research and attention in this context.","Cowlishaw, Sean; Metcalf, Olivia; Stone, Caleb; O039,; Donnell, Meaghan; Lotzin, Annett; Forbes, David; Hegarty, Kelsey; Kessler, David",,,668

Few nationwide data are available to compare risk factors, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 patients after ICU admission. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate baseline characteristics, treatments and 30-day outcomes of patients admitted to Swedish ICUs with COVID-19. DESIGN: Registry-based cohort study with prospective data collection. SETTING: Admissions to Swedish ICUs from 6 March to 6 May 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs. EXPOSURES: Baseline characteristics, intensive care treatments and organ failures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and death. RESULTS: We identified 1563 patients with complete 30-day follow-up. The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%. Median age was 61 [52 to 69], Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 [46 to 59] and 62.5% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 [75.0 to 140.6] mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate-to-severe acute respiratory failure. Age, male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.5 (1.1 to 2.2)], SAPS III score [aOR 1.3 (1.2 to 1.4)], severe respiratory failure [aOR 3.0 (2.0 to 4.7)], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy [aOR 1.4 (1.0 to 1.9)] and continuous renal replacement therapy [aOR 2.1 (1.5 to 3.0)] were associated with increased mortality. Except for chronic lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish ICUs is generally lower than previously reported despite a severe degree of hypoxaemia on admission. Mortality was driven by age, baseline disease severity, the presence and degree of organ failure, rather than pre-existing comorbidities.

The information is based on data collected from infectious disease/epidemiological centers in the USA, Brazil, and South Africa. Adverse COVID-19 outcomes have been associated with the burden of exposure and disease, linked to socioeconomic determinants, among specific ethnicities in all three countries. The prevalence of comorbidities before and the likelihood of work-related exposure in the context of COVID-19 infection puts ethnic minorities in the USA and some ethnic majorities and minorities in Brazil and South Africa at greater risk. We envisage that this work will contribute to ongoing discussions related to addressing socioeconomic determinants of health, and the need for stakeholders in various sectors to work on addressing observed health disparities for overall improvement in health and healthcare given the current pandemic.","Hughes, Gail Denise; Mbamalu, Oluchi Nneka; Okonji, Christabel Osaretin; Puoane, Thandi Rose",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,668
515949,Could asymptomatic carriers spread the SARS-CoV-2 infection? Experience from the Italian second wave,2021,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold. Firstly, this research aims at helping countries implement an equitable, innovative and context-appropriate stay-home game plan for the millions of disadvantaged and under-privileged students severely affected by the forfeiture of school closures; and secondly, this study proclaims that the burgeoning popularity of gamification has the potential to lay the bedrock foundation for ‘Literacy in the New Norm’. Design/methodology/approach: The temporal closure of schools around the world to limit the spread of the COVID-19 has resulted in massive educational disruptions triggering adverse effects and bringing much of education under grave threat. Through a review of the current empirical and conceptual literature, this study proposes a new gamification concept in a non-technology environment. Findings: Well underway are global dialogues that hold conversations on implementing mitigation strategies to counter the looming global health crisis. This has generated the impetus for a more concerted effort by concerned governments and international organizations to identify appropriate solutions for the continuity of learning so that the learning never stops. While educators and learners plunge further into the core of reconstructing education, the authors recognize that the fundamentals of technology and virtual connectivity have all along contributed to the multi-faceted e-learning stage set. However, concerns regarding the paradigm shift to remote online learning would certainly exacerbate inequalities cardinally felt across disadvantaged communities around the globe. Originality/value: As the world is currently bound by strict isolation measures, learners of all ages have been relegated to the confines of their homes. For the most part, the stark realities of technological mishaps that have befallen underprivileged school children, serve as a reminder to help target children all over the world who are in most peril of losing ground in terms of continued education. It is on these grounds that the criterion set out in this article elucidates the nature and scope of a supplementary stay-home game plan detailing the use of game affordances that bear intelligently in the creation of home-based activities for parents to give it their best effort in fostering a collaborative and meaningful parent-child relationship that spawns the new language of literacy in the new norm.","Zainuddin, Zamzami; Perera, Corinne Jacqueline; Haruna, Hussein; Habiburrahim, Habiburrahim",inform.Learn.Sci,,668

This study aims to evaluate the credit risk that Islamic banks in Indonesia have been exposed to related to home financing before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Panel data are employed covering the period January 2016 to September 2020 on a monthly basis. The data were analyzed using a dynamic panel approach to present a distinct picture of Sharia-compliant property financing before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. In general, the findings show that the macroeconomic variable reflected by regional inflation has had a different influence in the two periods, with Islamic banks having had much more exposure to macroeconomic risk, specifically in home financing, during the epidemic. In addition, the different influences are also shown by the study results, which show that provinces on Java Island face less risk exposure than those outside Java. In terms of impulse response factors and variance decompositions' result, before the outbreak, the response of home financing risk to inflation tended to be more stable. However, during the outbreak, the movement has tended to fluctuate more, especially outside Java Island. The same result for variance decompositions shows a similar trend, with inflation tending to have a larger impact during the outbreak. © Faaza Fakhrunnas, Yunice Karina Tumewang, M. B.

Mortality is higher in men than in women, because men age faster, and it is especially high in patients with age-related diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, because these diseases are manifestations of aging and a measure of biological age. At its deepest level, aging (a program-like continuation of developmental growth) is driven by inappropriately high cellular functioning. The hyperfunction theory of quasi-programmed aging explains why COVID-19 vulnerability (lethality) is an age-dependent syndrome, linking it to other age-related diseases. It also explains inflammaging and immunosenescence, hyperinflammation, hyperthrombosis, and cytokine storms, all of which are associated with COVID-19 vulnerability. Anti-aging interventions, such as rapamycin, may slow aging and age-related diseases, potentially decreasing COVID-19 vulnerability.","Blagosklonny, Mikhail V",Aging (Albany NY),,668

We have developed several synthetic inhibitors by structure‐based drug design. In this report, we reveal two crystal structures of SARS 3CL(pro) complexed with two new inhibitors based on our previous work. These structures combined with six crystal structures complexed with a series of related ligands reported by us are collectively analyzed. To these eight complexes, the structural basis for inhibitor binding was analyzed by the COMBINE method, which is a chemometrical analysis optimized for the protein–ligand complex. The analysis revealed that the first two latent variables gave a cumulative contribution ratio of r(2) = 0.971. Interestingly, scores using the second latent variables for each complex were strongly correlated with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of side‐chain heavy atoms of Met(49) from those of the intact crystal structure of SARS‐3CL(pro) (r = 0.77) enlarging the S(2) pocket. The substantial contribution of this side chain (∼10%) for the explanation of pIC(50)s was dependent on stereochemistry and the chemical structure of the ligand adapted to the S(2) pocket of the protease. Thus, starting from a substrate mimic inhibitor, a design for a central scaffold for a low molecular weight inhibitor was evaluated to develop a further potent inhibitor. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

590400,Secondary household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents: clinical and epidemiological aspects.,2021-09-30,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of several non-pulmonary complications such as acute myocardial injury, renal failure or thromboembolic events. A possible unifying explanation for these phenomena may be the presence of profound endothelial dysfunction and injury. This review provides an overview on the association of endothelial dysfunction with COVID-19 and its therapeutic implications. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of the key comorbidities that increase risk for severe COVID-19 such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or heart failure. Preliminary studies indicate that vascular endothelial cells can be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and evidence of widespread endothelial injury and inflammation is found in advanced cases of COVID-19. Prior evidence has established the crucial role of endothelial cells in maintaining and regulating vascular homeostasis and blood coagulation. Aggravation of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 may therefore impair organ perfusion and cause a procoagulatory state resulting in both macro- and microvascular thrombotic events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and statins are known to improve endothelial dysfunction. Data from smaller observational studies and other viral infections suggests a possible beneficial effect in COVID-19. Other treatments that are currently under investigation for COVID-19 may also act by improving endothelial dysfunction in patients. Focusing therapies on preventing and improving endothelial dysfunction could improve outcomes in COVID-19. Several clinical trials are currently underway to explore this concept.","Nägele, Matthias P.; Haubner, Bernhard; Tanner, Felix C.; Ruschitzka, Frank; Flammer, Andreas J.",Atherosclerosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2020.10.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161318/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915020305815?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021915020305815,668
590963,Estimating the Cumulative Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and the Infection Fatality Ratio in Light of Waning Antibodies,2021-04-02,"Online-learning is a feasible alternative to in-person attendance during COVID-19 pandemic. In this period, information technologies have allowed sharing experiences, but have also highlighted some limitations compared to traditional learning. Learning is strongly supported by some qualities of consciousness such as flow (intended as the optimal state of absorption and engagement activity) and sense of presence (feeling of exerting control, interacting with and getting immersed into real/virtual environments), behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, together with the need for social interaction. During online learning, feelings of disconnection, social isolation, distractions, boredom, and lack of control exert a detrimental effect on the ability to reach the state of flow, the feeling of presence, the feeling of social involvement. Since online environments could prevent the rising of these learning–supporting variables, this article aims at describing the role of flow, presence, engagement, and social interactions during online sessions and at characterizing multisensory stimulations as a driver to cope with these issues. We argue that the use of augmented, mixed, or virtual reality can support the above-mentioned domains, and thus counteract the detrimental effects of physical distance. Such support could be further increased by enhancing multisensory stimulation modalities within augmented and virtual environments.","Cesari, Valentina; Galgani, Benedetta; Gemignani, Angelo; Menicucci, Danilo",Behav Sci (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11050057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33919379/,668

One hundred and fifty‐eight patients from two hospitals were enrolled to identify the indicators of severe COVID‐19 and observe the natural course of COVID‐19 patients without clinical intervention. The total computed tomography (CT) score, a quantitative score based on assessment of the number, quadrant, and area of the lesions in CT, tended to perform better than assessment based only on the number or area of the lesions (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0887, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the total CT score, chest tightness, lymphocyte, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent factors for severe COVID‐19. For patients admitted in 2 weeks from onset to hospitalization, the frequency of severe COVID‐19 was gradually increased with the delayed hospitalization. The symptoms of fatigue, dry cough, sputum production, chest tightness, and polypnea were gradually more frequent. The levels of C‐reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, γ‐glutamyl transpeptidase, LDH, and d‐dimer were also gradually increased, as well as the scores based on CT. Conversely, the lymphocyte count and the albumin level were gradually decreased with the delayed hospitalization. Detail turning points of the above alterations were observed after 10–14 days from onset to hospitalization. Total CT score was a simple and feasible score for identifying severe COVID‐19. COVID‐19 patients without clinical intervention deteriorated gradually during the initial 10–14 days but gradually improved thereafter.","Wu, Daxian; Rao, Qunfang; Zhang, Wenfeng",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33990975/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27087,668
591708,Public Health response to an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Barcelona prison,2020,"In the wake of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-19, the world has undergone a critical situation in which grave threats to global public health emerged. Among human populations across the planet, travel restraints, border enforcement measures, quarantine, and isolation provisions were implemented to control and limit the spread of the contagion. Decisions on implementing and enforcing various control policies should be determined based on available real-world evidence and theoretical prediction. Further, countries around the globe-imposed force-quarantine and strict lockdown against the spreading could be unsustainable in the long run because of economic burden and people's frustration. This study proposes a novel exportation- importation epidemic model associated with behavioral dynamics under the evolutionary game theory by considering the two-body system: a source country of a contagious disease and a neighboring disease-free state. The model is first applied to the original COVID-19 data in China, Italy, and the Republic of Korea (ROK) and observed through consistent fitting results with equivalent goodness-of-fit. Then, the data are estimated per the appropriate parameters. Driven by these parametric settings and considering the normalized population, the numerical analysis, and epidemiological exploration, this work further elucidates the substantial impact of quarantine policies, healthcare facilities, socio-economic cost, and the public counter-compliance effect. Extensive numerical analysis shows that funds spent on the individual level as “emergency relief-package” can reduce the infection and improve quarantine policy success. Our results also explore that controlling border measurement can work well in the final epidemic stage of disease only if the cost is low.","Kabir, KM Ariful; Chowdhury, Atiqur; Tanimoto, Jun",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110918; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077921002721; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921002721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33846669/,668

592336,Targeting CTP Synthetase 1 to Restore Interferon Induction and Impede Nucleotide Synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021-02-07,"The present paper introduces a successful and general fluid-to-fluid similarity theory for heat transfer to fluids at supercritical pressure, having a high degree of universality. This work shortly follows the recent publication of a “local” successful similarity theory developed for fluids at supercritical pressures in a range of conditions in which the values of their molecular Prandtl number were quantitatively similar, extending its conclusions to the case of different molecular Prandtl numbers. The reason why this further step requested a short time to be elaborated is due to recognising that previous work by the Authors had actually already solved the related problems, though in a slightly different way, now interpreted in a more significant frame owing to a better problem understanding. The present similarity theory is based on first ideas developed more than one and a half decade ago by one of the authors, while addressing flow stability of supercritical fluids in heated channels, which encountered immediate problems to be applied in a straightforward way to heat transfer. These ideas were revised and considerably improved during the PhD thesis of the other author, also overcoming a sort of prejudicial assumption that finally resulted to limit their applicability. More recently, published DNS data triggered further reflections on the role of the Prandtl number, leading to the mentioned “local” form of the successful similarity theory. This led to the present step, by just recognising that the mentioned PhD thesis had already proposed a sufficient rationale to extend this local interpretation to a broader range of conditions. The rather convincing results presented herein, obtained making use of RANS CFD analyses with four different fluids, demonstrate the interesting capabilities of this final form of the theory. The establishment of an effective set of dimensionless numbers for heat transfer problems is hoped to pave the way for the development of the still lacking successful engineering heat transfer correlations for supercritical pressure fluids. It further calls for dedicated experiments needed to confirm the suitability of the present theory beyond any reasonable doubt.","Pucciarelli, Andrea; Ambrosini, Walter",Int J Heat Mass Transf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834084/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2020.120152; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001793102033088X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001793102033088X,668

However, populations that have had a history of marginalization have experienced a more profound impact. One such group is Latinx families of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) in the Unites States. In this study, we used a mixed methods approach to explore the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Latinx caregivers of children with IDD. Specifically, we (1) identified which social determinants of health are correlated with maternal caregivers perceived general health, mental health, and well-being; (2) explored the impact of the pandemic on families’ overall eating and physical activity routines; and (3) identified emergent themes from caregivers’ experiences during the pandemic. Thirty-seven Latinx caregivers participated in three interviews in which several validated instruments were administered. The results indicated that perceived social support, annual family income, food security, and receipt of financial benefits were correlated with fewer depressive symptoms. Annual family income was also significantly correlated with perceived general health. Most caregivers reported that the pandemic had placed a strain on their economic situation; increased their isolation; and disrupted their child’s therapeutic supports, online education, eating routines, and engagement in physical activity. Meanwhile, some caregivers reported positive changes as a result of the pandemic.

METHODS: Liver disease patients receiving DOAC treatment (ACLD: n = 104; vascular liver disease: n = 29) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA)/low‐molecular‐weight heparin (LMWH; ACLD: n = 45; vascular: n = 13) between January 2010 and September 2020 were retrospectively included. Invasive procedures and bleeding events were recorded. Calibrated anti‐Xa peak levels and thrombomodulin‐modified thrombin generation assays (TM‐TGAs) were measured in a subgroup of 35/28 DOAC patients. RESULTS: Among patients receiving DOAC, 55 (41.3%) had advanced liver dysfunction (Child‐Pugh‐stage [CPS] B/C) and 66 (49.6%) had experienced decompensation. Overall, 205 procedures were performed in 60 patients and procedure‐related bleedings occurred in 7 (11.7%) patients. Additionally, 38 (28.6%) patients experienced spontaneous (15 minor, 23 major) bleedings during a median follow‐up of 10.5 (IQR: 4.0‐27.8) months. Spontaneous bleedings in ACLD patients were more common in CPS‐B/C (at 12 months: 36.9% vs CPS‐A: 15.9%, subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]: 3.23 [95% CI: 1.59‐6.58], P < .001), as were major bleedings (at 12 months: 22.0% vs 5.0%, SHR: 5.82 [95% CI: 2.00‐16.90], P < .001). Importantly, CPS (adjusted SHR: 4.12 [91% CI: 1.82‐9.37], P < .001), but not the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma or varices, was independently associated with major bleeding during DOAC treatment. Additionally, ACLD patients experiencing bleeding had worse overall survival (at 12 months: 88.9% vs 95.0% without bleeding; P < .001). Edoxaban anti‐Xa peak levels were higher in patients with CPS‐B/C (345 [95% CI: 169‐395] vs CPS‐A: 137 [95% CI: 96‐248] ng/mL, P = .048) and were associated with lower TM‐TGA. Importantly, spontaneous bleeding rates were comparable to VKA/LMWH patients. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulants including DOACs should be used with caution in patients with advanced liver disease due to a significant rate of spontaneous bleeding events.","Semmler, Georg; Pomej, Katharina; Bauer, David J.

The pathogenesis of this hypercoagulability has not yet been fully elucidated, but it is thought to be multifactorial with overactivation of the complement pathways playing a central role. There is emerging evidence that the resulting complications are not confined to the venous circulation, and even in patients without typical respiratory symptoms or traditional risk factors, there is a significant rate of arterial thromboembolic disease in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT: We describe a patient presenting with bilateral leg pain without any respiratory symptoms or fever who ultimately was found to be COVID-19 positive and had thromboembolism of the aorta and bilateral iliac occlusion. This report reviews available evidence on the prevalence of arterial thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients and some proposed mechanisms of the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. CONCLUSION: It is important that the emergency physician maintain a high degree of suspicion for arterial thromboembolic disease in patients who are infected with COVID-19 even in the absence of typical respiratory symptoms. Additionally, COVID-19 should be considered in patients with unexplained thromboembolic disease, as this may increase the detection of COVID-19.","LaFree, Andrew; Lenz, Alexis; Tomaszewski, Christian; Quenzer, Faith",Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560944/; https://doi.org/10.5811/cpcem.2020.11.49593,668

In order to address the issue, we explore the potential use of standalone freely available software to perform image-based droplet detection. We select the four most popular software and classify them into rule-based and machine learning-based types after assessing the software’s modules. We test and evaluate the software’s (i) ability to detect droplets, (ii) accuracy and precision, and (iii) overall components and supporting material. In our experimental setting, we find that the rule-based type of software is better suited for image-based droplet detection. The rule-based type of software also has a simpler workflow or pipeline, especially aimed for non-experienced users.

This paper presents RNAVLab (RNA Virtual Laboratory), a virtual laboratory for studying RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots that allows scientists to address this challenge. Two important case studies show the versatility and functionalities of RNAVLab. The first study quantifies its capability to rebuild longer secondary structures from motifs found in systematically sampled nucleotide segments. The extensive sampling and predictions are made feasible in a short turnaround time because of the grid technology used.

Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or “spillover.” However, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, nonhuman animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially “spill back” to infect local wildlife—a danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host populations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. In this Review, we address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment—wildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistence—applying existing ecological concepts from epidemiology, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our discussion in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin—yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses—have separately been introduced into the human population.

We assessed the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Korea. METHODS: Using a modified World Health Organization clinical record form, we obtained clinical data for 3,060 patients with COVID-19 treated at 55 hospitals in Korea. Disease severity scores were defined as: 1) no limitation of daily activities; 2) limitation of daily activities but no need for supplemental oxygen; 3) supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula; 4) supplemental oxygen via facial mask; 5) non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 6) invasive mechanical ventilation; 7) multi-organ failure or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy; and 8) death. Recovery was defined as a severity score of 1 or 2, or discharge and release from isolation. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 43 years of age; 43.6% were male. The median time from illness onset to admission was 5 days. Of the patients with a disease severity score of 3–4 on admission, 65 (71.5%) of the 91 patients recovered, and 7 (7.7%) died due to illness by day 28. Of the patients with disease severity scores of 5–7, 7 (19.5%) of the 36 patients recovered, and 8 (22.2%) died due to illness by day 28. None of the 1,324 patients who were < 50 years of age died; in contrast, the fatality rate due to illness by day 28 was 0.5% (2/375), 0.9% (2/215), 5.8% (6/104), and 14.0% (7/50) for the patients aged 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years of age, respectively.

598877,"SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence, titres and neutralising activity in an antenatal cohort, United Kingdom, 14 April to 15 June 2020",2020-10-22,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is rare, severe connective tissue disease characterized by endothelial and vascular damage, immune activation, and resulting in inflammation and fibrosis of skin and internal organs, including the heart. SSc is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement is frequent in SSc patients, even though often asymptomatic at early stages, and represents one of the major causes of SSc-related mortality. Heart involvement has a variable clinical presentation, and its pathogenesis is not completely understood. Myocardial fibrosis is traditionally considered the immunopathologic hallmark of heart involvement in SSc. This unique histological feature is paralleled by distinctive clinical and prognostic features. The so-called “vascular hypothesis” represents the most credited hypothesis to explain myocardial fibrosis. More recently, the prominent role of an inflammatory myocardial process has been identified as a cardinal event in the evolution to fibrosis, thus also delineating an “inflammation-driven pathway to fibrosis”. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 has an apical and cardinal role in the myocardial inflammatory cascade and in cardiac dysfunction. The primary aim of this perspective article is: to present the emerging evidence on the role of IL-1 and inflammasome in both SSc and heart inflammation, to review the complex interplay between cellular metabolism and inflammasome activation, and to discuss the rationale for targeted inhibition of IL-1 for the treatment of SSc-heart involvement, providing preliminary experimental and clinical data to support this hypothesis.","De Luca, Giacomo; Cavalli, Giulio; Campochiaro, Corrado; Bruni, Cosimo; Tomelleri, Alessandro; Dagna, Lorenzo; Matucci-Cerinic, Marco",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833766/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.653950,668
599762,A Dual-Route Perspective of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Lung- vs. Gut-specific Effects of ACE-2 Deficiency,2021-06-11,"Background Information The global Covid-19 pandemic has required the rapid development and implementation of processes that support safety and quality of care. Prior to this unprecedented challenge, our satellite pediatric ambulatory surgical center consisted of four units: a preoperative unit (Preop), six operating rooms, a Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), and an Inpatient Short Stay unit. Although the Preop and PACU nurses were cross-trained to cover both areas, Inpatient nurses maintained a distinct skill set and were a standalone unit. In effort to support virus containment, including social distancing, a flexible staffing model required the integration of Preop, PACU, and Inpatient nurses into one cohesive team. Objectives of Project Development and implementation of changes to perioperative processes that support quality care and safety during Covid-19. Process of Implementation Inpatient areas were converted to support the preop care of patients/families and facilitate the adoption of COVID safety regulations. Inpatient nurses were oriented to the Preop nurse role, Preop Covid test screening, and Visitor/Employee lobby screening. This cross-training educational program included in-services on Preop documentation and procedures and one to one orientation with a Preop nurse. Presently, nurses may care for the same patient/families preoperatively and during their inpatient stay which promotes quality care and an improved surgical experience. Changes to staffing models were evaluated through staff survey, analysis of Press Ganey patient satisfaction feedback and surgical throughput data. Statement of Successful Practice A majority (83.3%) of nurses agreed or strongly agreed that the new flexible staffing model promoted team cohesion and ensured safety and quality throughout the surgical experience. Between May and September 2020, our integrated perianesthesia team cared for 1206 perioperative patients. Press Ganey scores were overwhelmingly positive. One family stated “Before surgery the nurse kept us calm, engaged, & informed. After surgery that nurse did the same thing & was also a great teacher regarding home care”. Implications for Advancing the Practice of Perianesthesia Nursing As ambulatory surgical centers, continue to adapt during the pandemic, it is imperative that perianesthesia nurses design and implement flexible staffing models that promote team cohesion and ensure safety and quality during surgery.","McCaffrey, Team Leaders Kerry; Losurdo, Nicole",Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2021.06.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089947221001726; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1089947221001726,668

Such distancing can evoke subjective feelings of negative self-perception of aging (SPA) among older adults, but how this pandemic has influenced such SPA is not yet known. This study, therefore, explored SPA at different time phases of the COVID-19 pandemic to explain the pandemic’s impact on SPA among older adults. The analysis employed a sample of 1,990 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 to 95 (mean age = 72.74 years; 43% female) in Switzerland. Data collection from different older adults within one study occurred both before and after Switzerland’s first confirmed COVID-19 case. The descriptive analysis revealed that negative SPA increased, and positive SPA decreased, after the Swiss government recommended physical distancing. After the Federal Council decided to ease these measures, negative SPA slightly decreased and positive SPA increased. According to the multivariate analysis, individuals interviewed after the lockdown were more likely to report greater levels of negative SPA and lower levels of positive SPA. Age, income, and living alone also correlated with SPA. The results suggest that the pandemic has affected older adults’ subjective views of their own aging, and these findings help illustrate the pandemic’s outcomes.","Seifert, Alexander",Gerontol Geriatr Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/2333721421999320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718526/,668

To date, no antiviral drug has been approved to treat EV71 infection. Due to the essential role that EV71 3 C protease (3C(pro)) plays in the viral life cycle, it is generally considered as a highly appealing target for antiviral drug development. In this study, we present a transgene-encoded biosensor that can accurately, sensitively and quantitatively report the proteolytic activity of EV71 3C(pro). This biosensor is based on the catalyzed activity of a pro–interleukin (IL)-1β-enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site-Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) fusion protein that we named i-3CS-GLuc. GLuc enzyme is inactive in the fusion protein because of aggregation caused by pro–IL-1β. However, the 3C(pro) of EV71 and other enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and poliovirus can recognize and process the canonical enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site between pro–IL-1β and GLuc, thereby releasing and activating GLuc and resulting in increased luciferase activity. The high sensitivity, ease of use, and applicability as a transgene in cell-based assays of i-3CS-GLuc biosensor make it a powerful tool for studying viral protease proteolytic events in living cells and for achieving high-throughput screening of antiviral agents.","Zhang, Yuan; Ke, Xianliang; Zheng, Caishang; Liu, Yan; Xie, Li; Zheng, Zhenhua; Wang, Hanzhong",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871120/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-10840-x,668

Because of the tendency to change its antigenic properties, infectious bronchitis is currently the viral disease present in most poultry producing areas of the world. New serotypes and variant strains are reported in several countries. Current commercially available vaccines do not always provide protection against new field isolates. Vaccination programs are constantly adjusted in an attempt to improve protection against this disease. Infectious laryngotracheitis has appeared in the broiler industry as a serious disease. Improved vaccines are needed to control the disease in broilers. In the U.S., the control of the highly pathogenic forms of avian influenza and the velogenic forms of Newcastle disease have been achieved by eradication. In other countries, effective vaccines have been used to control Newcastle and avian influenza. Avian pneumovirus infection is also an emerging disease of chickens and turkeys.","Villegas, P",Poultry Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9706079/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119409358; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119409358,668

However, the viral spike protein also has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and identified candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton, and cell signaling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates and may interact with the μ2 subunit of the endocytosis-associated AP2 adaptor complex, as well as with various protein domains (namely, I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB, and SH2) found in human signaling and regulatory proteins. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, such as in response to tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs are present in the tails of integrin β3 and ACE2, suggesting that these proteins could directly recruit autophagy components. Our findings identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that could uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and replication against which it may be possible to develop host-directed therapies that dampen viral infection and disease progression.

However, to ensure these benefits, the planning, management, and monitoring of a sustainable offer become crucial. Despite the increasingly widespread attention to sustainability in this sector, however, the concept of sustainable tourism still appears fragmented and fuzzy. The theoretical frameworks used in many studies often reduce sustainability to its environmental or social aspects and consider such pillars as separate issues. Furthermore, although most studies acknowledge that a potentially wide number of stakeholders play a role in sustainable tourism production, they have so far focused on host communities, tourism producers, or tourists themselves independently. Fewer explorations have addressed simultaneously different stakeholders, their perceptions of sustainable tourism experience, and the various concerns and tensions that may arise. This study aims to investigate sustainability issues in tourism by considering the voices of two relevant stakeholders involved in “co-producing” the tourism experience: tourists and tour operators. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Italy, the article critically discusses how travelers and tour operators craft the sustainability idea, the implicit assumptions that rely on their different perspectives, and their practical implications. The results highlight four different narratives on sustainable tourism, which are related to different assumptions on sustainability and actions legitimated to generate sustainable value. Finally, the article offers insights into how to develop a more holistic and critical approach to sustainable tourism through education and communication.","Galuppo, Laura; Anselmi, Paolo; De Paoli, Ilaria",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479565/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577612,668

The disease of transmissible person-to-person pneumonia caused by the extreme acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-COV-2, also known as COVID-19), has sparked a global warning. Thermal screening, quarantining, and later lockdown were methods employed by various nations to contain the spread of the virus. Though exercising various possible plans to contain the spread help in mitigating the effect of COVID-19, projecting the rise and preparing to face the crisis would help in minimizing the effect. In the scenario, this study attempts to use Machine Learning tools to forecast the possible rise in number of cases by considering the data of daily new cases. To capture the uncertainty, three different techniques: (i) Decision Tree algorithm, (ii) Support Vector Machine algorithm, and (iii) Gaussian process regression are used to project the data and capture the possible deviation. Based on the projection of new cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, medical facilities, population density, number of test conducted, and facilities of services, are considered to define the criticality index (CI). CI is used to classify all the districts of country in the regions of high risk, low risk and moderate risk. An online dashpot is created which updates the data on daily bases for next four weeks.

Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan are probably the countries with the most severe outbreaks. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important for the development and measurement of public intervention strategies. Epidemic prediction results yielded by different mathematical models are inconsistent; therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results to generate objective conclusions. Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020, to estimate the possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high-risk countries. The logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for prediction. Given that different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development. Results: When comparing all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the differences among the models were relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model did; however, once we added parameters that considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid deceleration of epidemic development. Our results demonstrated that contact rate, quarantine scale, and the initial quarantine time and length are important factors in controlling epidemic size and length. Conclusions: We demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of the COVID-19 outbreak in eight high-risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.","Zhou, Xiang; Ma, Xudong; Hong, Na; Su, Longxiang; Ma, Yingying; He, Jie; Jiang, Huizhen; Liu, Chun; Shan, Guangliang; Zhu, Weiguo; Zhang, Shuyang; Long, Yun",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044289,668

We report the case of a 43-year-old peripartum patient, who underwent two sequential V-V ECMO runs. The first extracorporeal support was established for COVID-19 ARDS, as characterized by severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia (arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction ratio 85 mmHg and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide 95 mmHg) and reduction of respiratory system static compliance to 25 mL/cmH(2)O, unresponsive to mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. After 22 days of lung rest, V-V ECMO was successfully removed and ventilator weaning initiated. A second V-V ECMO was required 7 days later, because of newly onset ARDS due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia. The second V-V ECMO run lasted 12 days. During both V-V ECMO runs, anticoagulation and ventilator settings were titrated through bedside thromboelastometry and electrical impedance tomography, respectively, without major complications.

Detailed hospital-level information on patient characteristics, outcomes, and capacity strain is currently scarce but would guide clinical decision-making and inform prioritisation and planning. METHODS: We aimed to determine factors associated with hospital mortality and describe hospital and ICU strain by conducting a prospective cohort study at a tertiary academic centre in London, UK. We included adult patients admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and followed them up until hospital discharge or 30 days. Baseline factors that are associated with hospital mortality were identified via semiparametric and parametric survival analyses. RESULTS: Our study included 429 patients: 18% of them were admitted to the ICU, 52% met criteria for ICU outreach team activation, and 61% had treatment limitations placed during their admission. Hospital mortality was 26% and ICU mortality was 34%. Hospital mortality was independently associated with increasing age, male sex, history of chronic kidney disease, increasing baseline C-reactive protein level, and dyspnoea at presentation. COVID-19 resulted in substantial ICU and hospital strain, with up to 9 daily ICU admissions and 41 daily hospital admissions, to a peak census of 80 infected patients admitted in the ICU and 250 in the hospital. Management of such a surge required extensive reorganisation of critical care services with expansion of ICU capacity from 69 to 129 beds, redeployment of staff from other hospital areas, and coordinated hospital-level effort. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a high burden of mortality for patients treated on the ward and the ICU and required substantial reconfiguration of critical care services. This has significant implications for planning and resource utilisation.","Vlachos, Savvas; Wong, Adrian; Metaxa, Victoria; Canestrini, Sergio; Lopez Soto, Carmen; Periselneris, Jimstan; Lee, Kai; Patrick, Tanya; Stovin, Christopher; Abernethy, Katrina; Albudoor, Budoor; Banerjee, Rishi; Juma, Fatimah; Al-Hashimi, Sara; Bernal, William; Maharaj, Ritesh",Crit Care Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8832660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564474/,668

In humans, disease is primarily caused by influenza A and B viruses, while influenza C virus causes mild disease mostly in children. Influenza D is an emerging virus found in cattle and pigs. To mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza, rapid and accurate diagnostic tests need to be deployed. However, the high genetic diversity displayed by influenza viruses presents a challenge to the development of a robust diagnostic test. Nucleic acid-based tests are more accurate than rapid antigen tests for influenza and are therefore better candidates to be used in both diagnostic and surveillance applications. Here, we review various nucleic acid-based techniques that have been applied towards the detection of influenza viruses in order to evaluate their utility as both diagnostic and surveillance tools. We discuss both traditional as well as novel methods to detect influenza viruses by covering techniques that require nucleic acid amplification or direct detection of viral RNA as well as comparing advantages and limitations for each method. There has been substantial progress in the development of nucleic acid-based sensing techniques for the detection of influenza virus. However, there is still an urgent need for a rapid and reliable influenza diagnostic test that can be used at point-of-care in order to enhance responsiveness to both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks.","Courtney, Samantha J.; Stromberg, Zachary R.; Kubicek-Sutherland, Jessica Z.",Biosensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bios11020047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673035/,668

Inorganic and organic Se species can be readily absorbed by the human body, but are metabolized differently and thus exhibit distinct mechanisms of action. They can act as antioxidants or serve as a source of Se for the synthesis of selenoproteins. Selenocysteine, in particular, is incorporated at the catalytic center of these proteins through a specific insertion mechanism and, due to its electronic features, enhances their catalytic activity against biological oxidants. Selenite and other Se-organic compounds may also act as direct antioxidants in cells due to their strong nucleophilic properties. In addition, Se-amino acids are more easily subjected to oxidation than the corresponding thiols/thioethers and can bind redox-active metal ions. Adequate Se intake aids in preventing several metabolic disorders and affords protection against viral infections. At present, an epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) threatens human health across several countries and impacts the global economy. Therefore, Se-supplementation could be a complementary treatment to vaccines and pharmacological drugs to reduce the viral load, mutation frequency, and enhance the immune system of populations with low Se intake in the diet.","Lima, Leonardo Warzea; Nardi, Serenella; Santoro, Veronica; Schiavon, Michela",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202330/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10071031,668

This paper investigates to what extent spatial morphology at different scales (node, community and global network) influences the use of public space by micromobility. An axial map and corresponding network for Lisbon’s walkable and open public space, and data from e-scooters parking locations, is used as case study. Relevant metrics and their correlations (intelligibility, accessibility, permeability and local dimension) for the quantitative characterization of spatial morphology properties are described and computed for Lisbon’s axial map. Communities are identified based on the network topological structure in order to investigate how these properties are affected at different scales in the case study. The resulting axial line clustering is compared via the variation of information metric with the clustering obtained from e-scooters’ proximity. The results obtained enable to conclude that the space syntax properties are scale dependent in Lisbon’s pedestrian network. On the other hand both the correlation between these properties, the number of scooters and the variation of information between clusters indicate that the spatial morphology is not the only factor influencing micromobility. Through the comparative analysis between the main properties of the public space network of Lisbon and data collected from e-scooters locations in a timeframe, centrality becomes a dynamic concept, relying not only on the static topological properties of the urban network, but also on other quantitative and qualitative factors, since the flows’ operating on the network will operate several transformations on the spatial network properties through time, uncovering spatiotemporal dynamics.","Freire de Almeida, Helena; Lopes, Rui J.; Carrilho, João M.; Eloy, Sara",Appl Netw Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226874/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-021-00387-2,668

607856,Antigen testing and non-infectious shedding of SARS-COV-2,2021-02-10,"Background SARS-CoV-2 related research has increased in importance worldwide since December 2019. Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7, the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2, each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately. Results Due to the lack of publicly available pipelines, which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern, we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HaVoC (Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants Of Concern). HaVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Conclusions HaVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks. HaVoC is currently being used in Finland for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. HaVoC user manual and source code are available at https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/havoc and https://bitbucket.org/auto_cov_pipeline/havoc, respectively.","Nguyen, Phuoc Truong; Plyusnin, Ilya; Sironen, Tarja; Vapalahti, Olli; Kant, Ravi; Smura, Teemu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.12.431018,668

This study aimed to investigate the association of COVID-19 positivity and severity with estrogen exposure in women, in a population based matched cohort study of female users of the COVID Symptom Study application in the UK. Analyses included 152,637 women for menopausal status, 295,689 women for exogenous estrogen intake in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), and 151,193 menopausal women for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Data were collected using the COVID Symptom Study in May-June 2020. Analyses investigated associations between predicted or tested COVID-19 status and menopausal status, COCP use, and HRT use, adjusting for age, smoking and BMI, with follow-up age sensitivity analysis, and validation in a subset of participants from the TwinsUK cohort. Menopausal women had higher rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 0.003). COCP-users had lower rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 8.03E-05), with reduction in hospital attendance (P = 0.023). Menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 2.22E-05) for HRT users alone. The findings support a protective effect of estrogen exposure on COVID-19, based on positive association between predicted COVID-19 with menopausal status, and negative association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19, but the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential unaccounted for confounders and comorbidities.","Costeira, Ricardo; Lee, Karla A.; Murray, Benjamin; Christiansen, Colette; Castillo-Fernandez, Juan; Ni Lochlainn, Mary; Capdevila Pujol, Joan; Macfarlane, Heather; Kenny, Louise C.; Buchan, Iain; Wolf, Jonathan; Rymer, Janice; Ourselin, Sebastien; Steves, Claire J.; Spector, Timothy D.; Newson, Louise R.; Bell, Jordana T.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506535/,668
608582,Community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England: Results from the ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey Pilot,2020-07-07,"In the event of a global infectious pandemic, drastic measures may be needed that limit or require adjustment of ambulatory allergy services. However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual. This expert panel consensus document offers a prioritization rational to help guide decision making when such situations arise and an allergist/immunologist is forced to reduce services or makes the decision on his or her own to do so.","Shaker, Marcus S.; Oppenheimer, John; Grayson, Mitchell; Stukus, David; Hartog, Nicholas; Hsieh, Elena W.Y.; Rider, Nicholas; Dutmer, Cullen M.; Vander Leek, Timothy K.; Kim, Harold; Chan, Edmond S.; Mack, Doug; Ellis, Anne K.; Lang, David; Lieberman, Jay; Fleischer, David; Golden, David B.K.; Wallace, Dana; Portnoy, Jay; Mosnaim, Giselle; Greenhawt, Matthew",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32224232/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.03.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219820302531; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219820302531,668

METHOD: The data of 32 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19, including epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological, were collected from the Blood Purification Department of Wuhan Fourth Hospital from February 3 to 16, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 32 patients, 23 were male, and the median age was 58 years; the median dialysis vintage was 33 months. Two groups were divided according to the patient’s primary renal disease: group 1 (16 patients with diabetic nephropathy), group 2 (12 patients with primary glomerulonephritis, 2 with obstructive kidney disease, 1 with hypertensive renal damage, and 1 with polycystic kidney). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in epidemiological characteristics, blood cell counts, and radiological performance. Hemodialysis patients are susceptible to COVID-19 at all ages, and patients with diabetes may be a high-risk population (50%). Common symptoms included fever (15 cases), cough (21 cases), and fatigue (7 cases). The blood lymphocyte count decreased in 84.6% of the patients (median: 0.765 × 10(9)/L). Chest CT revealed ground-glass-like lesions in 18 cases, unilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, bilateral lung patchiness in 7 cases, and pleural effusion in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: Only 46.875% of the hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had fever in the early stage; and diabetics may be the most susceptible population. A decrease in blood lymphocyte count and ground-glass opacity on chest CT scan is beneficial in identifying the high-risk population.","Du, Xingguo; Li, Hua; Dong, Liping; Li, Xiaojie; Tian, Ming; Dong, Junwu",Clin Exp Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32462378/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10157-020-01904-w,668

OBJECTIVE: To ensure that the objectives of national surveillance are being met, this study aimed to examine the level of usefulness and the performance of the SARI surveillance system in Yemen. METHODS: The updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines were used for the purposes of our evaluation. Related documents and reports were reviewed. Data were collected from 4 central-level managers and stakeholders and from 10 focal points at 4 sentinel sites by using a semistructured questionnaire. For each attribute, percent scores were calculated and ranked as follows: very poor (≤20%), poor (20%-40%), average (40%-60%), good (60%-80%), and excellent (>80%). RESULTS: As rated by the evaluators, the SARI surveillance system achieved its objectives. The system’s flexibility (percent score: 86%) and acceptability (percent score: 82%) were rated as “excellent,” and simplicity (percent score: 74%) and stability (percent score: 75%) were rated as “good.” The percent score for timeliness was 23% in 2018, which indicated poor timeliness. The overall data quality percent score of the SARI system was 98.5%. Despite its many strengths, the SARI system has some weaknesses. For example, it depends on irregular external financial support. CONCLUSIONS: The SARI surveillance system was useful in estimating morbidity and mortality, monitoring the trends of the disease, and promoting research for informing prevention and control measures. The overall performance of the SARI surveillance system was good. We recommend expanding the system by promoting private health facilities’ (eg, private hospitals and private health centers) engagement in SARI surveillance, establishing an electronic database at central and peripheral sites, and providing the National Central Public Health Laboratory with the reagents needed for disease confirmation.","Alkholidy, Ghamdan Gamal; Anam, Labiba Saeed; Almahaqri, Ali Hamoud; Khader, Yousef",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255695/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27621,668

Severe disease typically presents with respiratory failure but Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and a hypercoagulable state can also occur. Early reports suggest that thrombosis may be linked with AKI. We studied the development of AKI and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 taking chronic anticoagulation therapy. METHODS: Electronic records were reviewed for all adult patients admitted to Manchester University Foundation Trust Hospitals between March 10 and April 302,020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with end-stage kidney disease were excluded. AKI was classified as per KDIGO criteria. RESULTS: Of the 1032 patients with COVID-19 studied,164 (15.9%) were taking anticoagulant therapy prior to admission. There were similar rates of AKI between those on anticoagulants and those not anticoagulated (23.8% versus 19.7%) with no difference in the severity of AKI or requirement of renal replacement therapy between groups (1.2% versus 3.5%). Risk factors for AKI included hypertension, pre-existing renal disease and male sex. There was a higher mortality in those taking anticoagulant therapy (40.2% versus 30%). Patients taking anticoagulants were less likely to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (8.5% versus 17.4%) and to receive mechanical ventilation (42.9% versus 78.1%). CONCLUSION: Patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy did not have a reduced incidence or severity of AKI suggesting that AKI is unlikely to be thrombotic in nature. Therapeutic anticoagulation is currently still under investigation in randomised controlled studies to determine whether it has a potential role in COVID-19 treatment.

The purpose of this study was to examine the content of news segments covering COVID-19 posted on-line. METHODS: Using the Google Videos function on a cleared browser, all videos identified from January and February, 2020 were archived by URL for analysis. After applying exclusion criteria, a total of 401 remained, comprising the sample. Content categories derived from trusted sources were applied to assess the content of broadcast news segments pertaining to COVID-19 on Google Videos. RESULTS: The most common topic mentioned across all videos was death and the death rate (43.6%) and many connoted anxieties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak (37.4%). Critically important information about the prevention of COVID-19 spread received little attention. For example, only 3.0% of videos discussed coughing into or blowing one's nose into a tissue and throwing the tissue away, 6.2% talked about wearing a facemask when caring for the ill, and 8.8% covered disinfecting highly touched objects and surfaces. International videos more often presented captions and English subtitles (with and without narration) (7.8% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.018) and even more frequently discussed death and the death rate associated with COVID-19 (56.9% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.04).

612921,Diversity of Coronaviruses in Wild Representatives of the Aves Class in Poland,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Proinflammatory cytokines are correlated with the severity of disease in patients with COVID-19. IL6-mediated activation of STAT3 proliferates proinflammatory responses that lead to cytokine storm promotion. Thus, STAT3 inhibitors may play a crucial role in managing the COVID-19 pathogenesis. The present study discusses a method for predicting inhibitors against the STAT3 signaling pathway. METHOD: The main dataset comprises 1565 STAT3 inhibitors and 1671 non-inhibitors used for training, testing, and evaluation of models. A number of machine learning classifiers have been implemented to develop the models. RESULTS: The outcomes of the data analysis show that rings and aromatic groups are significantly abundant in STAT3 inhibitors compared to non-inhibitors. First, we developed models using 2-D and 3-D chemical descriptors and achieved a maximum AUC of 0.84 and 0.73, respectively. Second, fingerprints are used to build predictive models and achieved 0.86 AUC with an accuracy of 78.70% on the validation dataset. Finally, models were developed using hybrid descriptors, which achieved a maximum of 0.87 AUC with 78.55% accuracy on the validation dataset. CONCLUSION: We used the best model to identify STAT3 inhibitors in FDA-approved drugs and found few drugs (e.g., Tamoxifen and Perindopril) to manage the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: To assess and quantify how people decided whether to present to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic for care unrelated to COVID-19 using conjoint analysis, a form of trade-off analysis that examines how individuals make complex decisions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a nationwide sample from June 1, 2020, during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Included participants were adults aged 18 years or older in the US who self-reported that they had not tested positive for COVID-19. Data were analyzed from July 2020 through May 2021. EXPOSURES: Participants completed a self-administered online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Using a choice-based conjoint analysis survey, the relative importance was assessed for the following attributes for individuals in deciding whether to seek ED care for symptoms consistent with myocardial infarction or appendicitis: reduction in chance of dying because of ED treatment, crowdedness of ED with other patients, and chance of contracting COVID-19 in the ED. We also performed latent class analyses using conjoint data to identify distinct segments of the respondent population with similar choice patterns. Logistic regression was then used to explore whether patient sociodemographics and political affiliations were factors associated with decision-making. RESULTS: Among 1981 individuals invited to participate, 933 respondents (47.1%) completed the survey; participants’ mean (SD) age was 40.1 (13.0) years, and 491 (52.6%) were women. In latent class analyses, 158 individuals (16.9%) with symptoms of myocardial infarction and 238 individuals (25.5%) with symptoms of appendicitis prioritized avoidance of COVID-19 exposure in the ED (ie, chance of contracting COVID-19 in the ED or crowdedness of ED with other patients) over seeking appropriate care for symptoms. Having a usual source of care was a factor associated with lower odds of prioritizing avoidance of COVID-19 exposure (myocardial infarction scenario: adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.32-0.76]; P = .001; appendicitis scenario: adjusted odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40-0.82]; P = .003), but most sociodemographic factors and political affiliations were not factors associated with decision-making. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that up to one-quarter of individuals were willing to forgo potentially life-saving ED care to avoid exposure to COVID-19. These findings suggest that health care systems and public health organizations should develop effective communications for patients and the community at large that reassure and encourage timely health care for critical needs during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other scenarios.","Gale, Rebecca; Eberlein, Samuel; Fuller, Garth; Khalil, Carine; Almario, Christopher V.; Spiegel, Brennan M.R.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34410398/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.20940,668

The respiratory viruses—which include influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses—cause the majority of these illnesses. Some of these viruses cause illness throughout the year, whereas others are most common in winter. All population groups experience these infections and illnesses. As the number of elderly persons and those with underlying disease increases, awareness is growing that these common infections can have serious consequences. This has recently been emphasized for immunocompromised persons. At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), infection surveillance of mostly hospitalized adults with leukemia or a recent bone marrow transplant yielded a respiratory virus from 181 of 668 (27.1%) respiratory illness episodes. In descending order of frequency, infections with RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were detected in each of three surveillance years. High frequencies of nosocomial acquisition occurred, as has been noted in prior reports. Similarly, persistence of infection and high frequencies of pneumonia and death among infected patients occurred, which have also been noted earlier. At MDACC, pneumonia occurred in 58–78% of infected patients, and 22–44% died. The role of the virus infection in many cases of pneumonia is uncertain, but death from pure viral pneumonia is well documented. A number of immune deficiencies in this patient population and options for control of these infections have been described that can, respectively, account for the medical problem and provide ways to approach prevention and treatment.","Couch, MD, Robert B.; Englund, MD, Janet A.",Am J Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000293439700003X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000293439700003X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10868136/,668

Effective vaccines, if successfully developed, have been emphasized to become the most effective strategy in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Basic research advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering have already provided excellent progress and groundbreaking new discoveries in the field of the coronavirus biology and its epidemiology. In particular, for the vaccine development the advances in characterization of a capsid structure and identification of its antigens that can become targets for new vaccines. The development of the experimental vaccines requires a plethora of molecular techniques as well as strict compliance with safety procedures. The research and clinical data integrity, cross-validation of the results, and appropriated studies from the perspective of efficacy and potently side effects have recently become a hotly discussed topic. In this review, we present an update on latest advances and progress in an ongoing race to develop 52 different vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis is focused on registered clinical trials (current as of November 04, 2020) that fulfill the international safety and efficacy criteria in the vaccine development. The requirements as well as benefits and risks of diverse types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are discussed including those containing whole-virus and live-attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, mRNA vaccines, DNA vaccines, live vector vaccines, and also plant-based vaccine formulation containing coronavirus-like particle (VLP). The challenges associated with the vaccine development as well as its distribution, safety and long-term effectiveness have also been highlighted and discussed.","Karpiński, Tomasz M.; Ożarowski, Marcin; Seremak-Mrozikiewicz, Agnieszka; Wolski, Hubert; Wlodkowic, Donald",Theranostics,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.53691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408775/,668

The Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS) / European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Taskforce has developed international recommendations and standards for transitional care and a growing evidence base supports the positive benefits of such care. However, there is also evidence that universal implementation has yet to be realised. In 2020, against this background the COVID-19 pandemic arrived with significant impact on all our lives, young and old, patient, public and professional alike. The unfortunate reality of the pandemic with potential for unfavourable outcomes on healthcare provision during transition was acknowledged by the PReS working groups in a position statement to support healthcare professionals, young people and their caregivers. AIM: The aim of this review is to present the literature which provides the rationale for the recommendations in the PReS Position Statement. SUMMARY: The following areas are specifically addressed: the prime importance of care coordination; the impact of the pandemic on the various aspects of the transition process; the importance of ensuring continuity of medication supply; the pros and cons of telemedicine with young people; ensuring meaningful involvement of young people in service development and the importance of core adolescent health practices such as routine developmental assessment psychosocial screening and appropriate parental involvement during transitional care.","McDonagh, Janet E.; Tattersall, Rachel; Clinch, Jacqui; Swan, Joanne; Foster, Helen E.; McCann, Liza",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12969-021-00609-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34433477/,668
616884,Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 Detection With Nasopharyngeal Swabs,2021-01-26,"Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that plays key roles in integration of cytoskeletal functions, and therefore in basic cellular processes such as cell division and migration. Consequently, vimentin has complex implications in pathophysiology. Vimentin is required for a proper immune response, but it can also act as an autoantigen in autoimmune diseases or as a damage signal. Although vimentin is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, it can also appear at extracellular locations, either in a secreted form or at the surface of numerous cell types, often in relation to cell activation, inflammation, injury or senescence. Cell surface targeting of vimentin appears to associate with the occurrence of certain posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and/or oxidative damage. At the cell surface, vimentin can act as a receptor for bacterial and viral pathogens. Indeed, vimentin has been shown to play important roles in virus attachment and entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), dengue and encephalitis viruses, among others. Moreover, the presence of vimentin in specific virus-targeted cells and its induction by proinflammatory cytokines and tissue damage contribute to its implication in viral infection. Here, we recapitulate some of the pathophysiological implications of vimentin, including the involvement of cell surface vimentin in interaction with pathogens, with a special focus on its role as a cellular receptor or co-receptor for viruses. In addition, we provide a perspective on approaches to target vimentin, including antibodies or chemical agents that could modulate these interactions to potentially interfere with viral pathogenesis, which could be useful when multi-target antiviral strategies are needed.","Ramos, Irene; Stamatakis, Konstantinos; Oeste, Clara L.; Pérez-Sala, Dolores",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21134675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32630064/,668
617743,Has China faced only a herald wave of SARS-CoV-2?,2020-03-27,"Abstract The ever increasing resistance of human pathogens to current anti-infective agents is a serious medical problem, leading to the need to develop novel antibiotic prototype molecules. In the case of viruses, the search for antiviral agents involves additional difficulties, particularly due to the nature of the infectious viral agents. Thus, many compounds that may cause the death of viruses are also very likely to injure the host cell that harbours them. Natural products are increasingly appreciated as leads for drug discovery and development. Screening studies have been carried out in order to find antiviral agents from natural sources, and the occurrence of antiviral activity in extracts of plants, marine organisms and fungi is frequent. The evidence indicates that there may be numerous potentially useful antiviral phytochemicals in nature, waiting to be evaluated and exploited. In addition, other plants, not previously utilized medicinally, may also reveal antivirals. Among natural antiviral agents, recent investigations have reconsidered the interest of phyto-polysaccharides, which act as potent inhibitors of different viruses. This chapter will illustrate a variety of antiviral polysaccharides from natural sources since 1990, with the aim of making this matter more accessible to drug development","Martinez, Maria Jose Abad; Olmo, Luis Miguel Bedoya Del; Benito, Paulina Bermejo",Studies in Natural Products Chemistry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572599505800389; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1572599505800389,668

This study was done to estimate prevalence of OSA in patients with COVID-19 using various screening questionnaires and to assess effect of OSA on outcome of disease. Methodology: In this prospective observational study, consecutive patients with RTPCR confirmed COVID 19 patients were screened for OSA by different questionnaires (STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire, NoSAS and Epworth Scale). Association between OSA and outcome (mortality) and requirement for respiratory support was assessed. Results: In study of 213 patients; screening questionnaires for OSA {STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire (BQ), NoSAS} were more likely to be positive in patients who died compared to patients who survived. On binary logistics regression analysis, age[≥]55 and STOPBANG score [≥]5 were found to have small positive but independent effect on mortality even after adjusting for other variables. Proportion of patients who were classified as high risk for OSA by various OSA screening tools significantly increased with increasing respiratory support (p<0.001 for STOPBANG, BQ, ESS and p=0.004 for NoSAS). Conclusion: This is one of the first prospective studies of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID 19 status who were screened for possible OSA. This study shows that OSA could be an independent risk factor for poor outcome in patients with COVID19.","kar, A.; Saxena, K.; Goyal, A.; Pakhare, A.

In the present study, by using plaque inhibition, luciferase reporter plasmids, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and ELISA assays, we have investigated the effect and mechanism of OMT on influenza A virus (IAV) replication and IAV-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that OMT had excellent anti-IAV activity on eight IAV strains in vitro. OMT could significantly decrease the promoter activity of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, and TRAF6 genes, inhibit IAV-induced activations of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB pathways, and suppress the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and MMP-2/-9. Activators of TLR4, p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways could significantly antagonize the anti-IAV activity of OMT in vitro, including IAV replication and IAV-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE). Furthermore, OMT could reduce the loss of body weight, significantly increase the survival rate of IAV-infected mice, decrease the lung index, pulmonary inflammation and lung viral titter, and improve pulmonary histopathological changes. In conclusion, OMT possesses anti-IAV and anti-inflammatory activities, the mechanism of action may be linked to its ability to inhibit IAV-induced activations of TLR4, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB pathways.","Dai, Jian-Ping; Wang, Qian-Wen; Su, Yun; Gu, Li-Ming; Deng, Hui-Xiong; Chen, Xiao-Xuan; Li, Wei-Zhong; Li, Kang-Sheng",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19040965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570670/,668

Combining WGS with epidemiological links offers surprising new information,2021-08-20,"The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of severely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to evolve. The purpose of this study is to review a multi-institutional clinical experience in 100 consecutive patients, at 20 hospitals, with confirmed COVID-19 supported with ECMO. This analysis includes our first 100 patients with complete data who had confirmed COVID-19 and were supported with ECMO. The first patient in the cohort was placed on ECMO on March 17, 2020. Differences by the mortality group were assessed using χ(2) tests for categorical variables and Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum tests and Welch’s analysis of variance for continuous variables. The median time on ECMO was 12.0 days (IQR = 8–22 days). All 100 patients have since been separated from ECMO: 50 patients survived and 50 patients died. The rate of survival with veno-venous ECMO was 49 of 96 patients (51%), whereas that with veno-arterial ECMO was 1 of 4 patients (25%). Of 50 survivors, 49 have been discharged from the hospital and 1 remains hospitalized at the ECMO-providing hospital. Survivors were generally younger, with a lower median age (47 versus 56.5 years, p = 0.014). In the 50 surviving patients, adjunctive therapies while on ECMO included intravenous steroids (26), anti-interleukin-6 receptor blockers (26), convalescent plasma (22), remdesivir (21), hydroxychloroquine (20), and prostaglandin (15).

Studies covering COVID-19’s severity classification data and COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke were included. Two independent evaluators extracted data, and the random effects model was used to calculate the risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of acute ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19’s severity. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were included, involving 5266 patients. Among all COVID-19 patients, the total incidence of ischemic stroke was 1.76% (95% CI: 0.82–3.01). Severe patients have an increased risk of acute ischemic stroke compared with non-severe patients (RR = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.06–6.07, P < 0.0001; I(2) = 12%).

Breast density is a well-known risk factor and has the potential to improve accuracy of risk prediction models. In this study we reviewed the impact on model performance of adding breast density to clinical breast cancer risk prediction models. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using a pre-specified search strategy for PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from January 2007 until November 2019. Studies were screened using the Covidence software. Eligible studies developed or modified existing breast cancer risk prediction models applicable to the general population of women by adding breast density to the model. Improvement in discriminatory accuracy was measured as an increase in the Area Under the Curve or concordance statistics. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies were identified by the search and one by reference check. Four studies modified the Gail model, four modified the Tyrer-Cuzick model, and five studies developed new models. Several methods were used to measure breast density, including visual, semi- and fully automated methods. Eleven studies reported discriminatory accuracy and one study reported calibration. Seven studies found a statistically significantly increased discriminatory accuracy when including density in the model. The increase in AUC ranged 0.03 to 0.14. Four studies did not report on statistical significance, but reported an increased AUC ranging from 0.01 to 0.06. CONCLUSION: Including mammographic breast density has the potential to improve breast cancer risk prediction models. However, all models demonstrated limited discrimination accuracy.","Vilmun, Bolette Mikela; Vejborg, Ilse; Lynge, Elsebeth; Lillholm, Martin; Nielsen, Mads; Nielsen, Michael Bachmann; Carlsen, Jonathan Frederik",Eur J Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361308/,668

The purpose of the present study was to identify specific profiles of pandemic‐related experiences and their relation to psychosocial functioning using the 92‐item Epidemic‐Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII). Data were collected as part of a cross‐sectional, online survey of adults (18+) residing in the Northeast region of the United States (N = 652) and recruited via online advertisements. Person‐centered latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to 38 pandemic‐related experiences that showed a significant bivariate correlation with perceived stress. Measures of psychosocial risk were also obtained. Results revealed five unique profiles of respondents based on patterns of pandemic‐related experiences. Three profiles representing about 64% of the sample were characterized by moderate to high exposure to adverse experiences during the pandemic and were more likely to screen positive for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These profiles were differentiated by sociodemographic differences, including age, caregiving, and employment status. Two profiles differentiated by age and caregiver status represented about 36% of the sample and were characterized by relatively low exposure to adverse experiences and lower risk for psychosocial impairment. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This research may serve to identify high‐risk subpopulations toward developing public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the context of public health emergencies such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Grasso, Damion J.; Briggs‐Gowan, Margaret J.; Carter, Alice S.; Goldstein, Brandon L.; Ford, Julian D.",Brain Behav,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216110/,668

As the risk factors of lab accidents can be conceptualized as occurring at multiple levels, systematically improving and optimizing lab safety is the crucial route to accident prevention in labs. In this paper, a novel method that integrates a structural equation model (SEM) and system dynamics (SD) is presented to dynamically assess lab safety with the characteristics of insufficient data and uncertainty. On the basis of a questionnaire investigation, the SEM was utilized to determine the influencing factors on lab safety and acquire the path coefficients among these factors, which were embedded into the SD model as the weight of the influencing factors. An illustration was carried out to test and validate the proposed method, and a sensitivity analysis was also conducted to recognize variables contributing the most to the improvement of lab safety. The results demonstrated that the safety input of human and management subsystems is the most effective to improve the lab safety; meanwhile, “safety awareness”, “emergency ability”, “operation skills”, “safety culture” and “safety training” are the top five contributing factors, which can promote lab safety in the shortest time.","Ma, Laihao; Ma, Xiaoxue; Zhang, Jingwen; Yang, Qing; Wei, Kai",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204588/,668

625325,A Scoping Review of the Experience of Implementing Population Testing for SARS-CoV-2,2021-06-26,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers are at very high risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection. This study evaluated anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers in a tertiary care hospital and then correlated seroprevalence with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: The study was approved by our institution’s Joint Research Ethics Committee in June 2020. All volunteers were provided with a consent form, an information leaflet and a questionnaire on the day before phlebotomy. Serum samples were collected from 1176 participants over a 3-month period and analysed using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) which detects total antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein of SARs-COV-2. RESULTS: Overall anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among participating healthcare workers was 17.9%. The rate of confirmed infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction molecular testing prior to participation was 12.2%. Of 211 participants who had a reactive antibody test result, 37% did not have COVID-19 infection confirmed at any point prior to participation in this study, either having had a swab which did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA or having never been tested. Seropositivity was the highest (30%) in the youngest quintile of age (20–29 years old). Staff with more patient contact had a higher seroprevalence of 19.5% compared to 13.4% in staff with less patient contact. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare workers may be asymptomatic or subclinical and thus potentially represent a significant transmission risk to colleagues and patients.","Leonard, Ann; Prior, Anna Rose; Reilly, Phyllis; Murray, Caroline; Brien, Meghan O’; Maguire, Gillian; Ennis, Deborah; Reid, Alex; Rakovac, Ana; Boran, Gerard",Ir J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02690-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195921/,668

The current study aimed to systematically review and meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the level of depression and anxiety in cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus and Web of Sciences databases were searched to retrieve potential studies from January 2020 to 3 January 2021. Summary data on frequency and mean of depression and anxiety were extracted. Random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to estimate overall prevalence, mean and standardized mean difference. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review, of them 21 studies included in meta-analysis. Overall depression and anxiety were 0.37 (0.27, 0.47); I(2) = 99.05%, P value < 0.001 and 0.38 (0.31, 0.46); I(2) = 99.08%, P value < 0.001, respectively. Compared to controls, cancer patients had higher anxiety level [standard mean difference (SMD 0.25 (95% CI 0.08, 0.42)]. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the prevalence of depression and anxiety among patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic can reach considerable levels, although observed substantial heterogeneity should be considered when interpreting the results.

Public health measures to slow down the spread of the virus involve using a face mask, social-distancing, and frequent hand washing. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a global campaign on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curtail the spread of the virus. However, the number of cases, mortality, and hospitalization continue to rise globally, including in the United States. We developed a mathematical model to assess the impact of a public health education program on the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Our simulation showed the prospect of an effective public health education program in reducing both the cumulative and daily mortality of the novel coronavirus.

626133,Saliva is inferior to nose and throat swabs for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in children,2021-08-02,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is stretching medical resources internationally, including creating ventilator shortages that complicate clinical and ethical situations. The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns. This simulation study explores patient compatibility and ventilator settings during multi-patient ventilation without the use of flow compensating resistances. Methods: A whole-body computational physiology model was used to simulate each patient on a ventilator. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. In addition to mechanical ventilation parameters, the full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. Findings: These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and endtidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 cmH2O/mL, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. Interpretation: In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if unavailable, these simulations provide a conceptual framework for clinical patient selection guidelines if ventilator sharing is the only available alternative.","Webb, J.

In Malaysia, policies regulating this food marketing were rated as poor compared to global standards, justifying the need to explore barriers and facilitators during policy development and implementation processes. The case study incorporated qualitative methods, including historical mapping, semi-structured interviews with key informants and a search of cited documents. Nine participants were interviewed, representing the Federal government (n = 5), food industry (n = 2) and civil society (n = 2). Even though the mandatory approach to government-led regulation of food marketing to children was the benchmark, more barriers than facilitators in the policy process led to industry self-regulations in Malaysia. Cited barriers were the lack of political will, industry resistance, complexity of legislation, technical challenges, and lack of resources, particularly professional skills. The adoption of industry self-regulation created further barriers to subsequent policy advancement. These included implementer indifference (industry), lack of monitoring, poor stakeholder relations, and policy characteristics linked to weak criteria and voluntary uptake. These underlying barriers, together with a lack of sustained public health advocacy, exacerbated policy inertia. Key recommendations include strengthening pro-public health stakeholder partnerships, applying sustained efforts in policy advocacy to overcome policy inertia, and conducting monitoring for policy compliance and accountability. These form the key lessons for advocating policy reforms.","Ng, SeeHoe; Kelly, Bridget; Yeatman, Heather; Swinburn, Boyd; Karupaiah, Tilakavati",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574531/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18189607,668
626419,SARS-CoV-2 pharmacologic therapies and their safety/effectiveness according to level of evidence,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has significantly altered health care delivery, requiring clinicians and hospitals to adapt to rapidly changing hospital policies and social distancing guidelines. At our large academic medical center, clinicians reported that existing information on distribution channels, including emails and hospital intranet posts, was inadequate to keep everyone abreast with these changes. To address these challenges, we adapted a mobile app developed in-house to communicate critical changes in hospital policies and enable direct telephonic communication between clinical team members and hospitalized patients, to support social distancing guidelines and remote rounding. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the unique benefits and challenges of adapting an app developed in-house to facilitate communication and remote rounding during COVID-19. METHODS: We adapted moblMD, a mobile app available on the iOS and Android platforms. In conjunction with our Hospital Incident Command System, resident advisory council, and health system innovation center, we identified critical, time-sensitive policies for app usage. A shared collaborative document was used to align app-based communication with more traditional communication channels. To minimize synchronization efforts, we particularly focused on high-yield policies, and the time of last review and the corresponding reviewer were noted for each protocol. To facilitate social distancing and remote patient rounding, the app was also populated with a searchable directory of numbers to patient bedside phones and hospital locations. We monitored anonymized user activity from February 1 to July 31, 2020. RESULTS: On its first release, 1104 clinicians downloaded moblMD during the observation period, of which 46% (n=508) of downloads occurred within 72 hours of initial release. COVID-19 policies in the app were reviewed most commonly during the first week (801 views). Users made sustained use of hospital phone dialing features, including weekly peaks of 2242 phone number dials, 1874 directory searches, and 277 patient room phone number searches through the last 2 weeks of the observation period. Furthermore, clinicians submitted 56 content- and phone number–related suggestions through moblMD. CONCLUSIONS: We rapidly developed and deployed a communication-focused mobile app early during COVID-19, which has demonstrated initial and sustained value among clinicians in communicating with in-patients and each other during social distancing. Our internal innovation benefited from our team’s familiarity with institutional structures, short feedback loops, limited security and privacy implications, and a path toward sustainability provided by our innovation center. Challenges in content management were overcome through synchronization efforts and timestamping review. As COVID-19 continues to alter health care delivery, user activity metrics suggest that our solution will remain important in our efforts to continue providing safe and up-to-date clinical care.","Anyanwu, Emeka C; Ward, R Parker; Shah, Atman; Arora, Vineet; Umscheid, Craig A",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://doi.org/10.2196/24452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513562/,668

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: NHS hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: 47 780 individuals (mean age 65, 55% men) in hospital with covid-19 and discharged alive by 31 August 2020, exactly matched to controls from a pool of about 50 million people in England for personal and clinical characteristics from 10 years of electronic health records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of hospital readmission (or any admission for controls), all cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney, and liver diseases until 30 September 2020. Variations in rate ratios by age, sex, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 140 days, nearly a third of individuals who were discharged from hospital after acute covid-19 were readmitted (14 060 of 47 780) and more than 1 in 10 (5875) died after discharge, with these events occurring at rates four and eight times greater, respectively, than in the matched control group. Rates of respiratory disease (P<0.001), diabetes (P<0.001), and cardiovascular disease (P<0.001) were also significantly raised in patients with covid-19, with 770 (95% confidence interval 758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132), and 126 (121 to 131) diagnoses per 1000 person years, respectively. Rate ratios were greater for individuals aged less than 70 than for those aged 70 or older, and in ethnic minority groups compared with the white population, with the largest differences seen for respiratory disease (10.5 (95% confidence interval 9.7 to 11.4) for age less than 70 years v 4.6 (4.3 to 4.8) for age ≥70, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for non-white v 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for white individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals discharged from hospital after covid-19 had increased rates of multiorgan dysfunction compared with the expected risk in the general population. The increase in risk was not confined to the elderly and was not uniform across ethnicities. The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of post-covid syndrome requires integrated rather than organ or disease specific approaches, and urgent research is needed to establish the risk factors.","Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Khunti, Kamlesh; Nafilyan, Vahé; Maddox, Thomas; Humberstone, Ben; Diamond, Ian; Banerjee, Amitava",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789877/,668

Since the 1950s, IBV has circulated in the Middle East and North Africa, and no tangible evidence has shown any effects of measures taken to control its spread or evolution. Furthermore, new IBV variants are continually discovered. Although several genetic studies on IBV have been conducted, many IBV strains from this region have either been misclassified or remain unclassified. The genotype 23 (GI-23) variant emerged and has prevailed in the Middle East by continuously evolving through inter- and/or intra-genotypic recombination. The GI-23 genotype is currently enzootic throughout Europe and Asia. Although many studies of protection against the circulating strains have been conducted, they have not been standardized according to regulatory requirements. In this review, we provide an overview of the evolution and genetic diversity of IBV genotypes and a genetic classification of IBV strains, with a focus on the GI-23 genotype. The high prevalence of IBV GI-23 strains necessitates the adoption of vaccination schemes using GI-23-based vaccines.

629185,A protease-activatable luminescent biosensor and reporter cell line for authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-06-28,"In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus in the 2002–2003 epidemic. This new disease was named COVID‐19 and the causative virus SARS‐CoV‐2. The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein‐ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro‐inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1–7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self‐powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID‐19 patients prior to development of ARDS. In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open‐label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID‐19 patients (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04355936).","Rothlin, Rodolfo Pedro; Vetulli, Héctor Miguel; Duarte, Mariano; Pelorosso, Facundo Germán",Drug Dev Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/ddr.21679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356926/,668
629309,Heat inactivation of serum interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2,2020-06-28,"OBJECTIVE: Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland that causes destructive thyrotoxicosis and is attributed to a viral or post-viral response. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that caused a global pandemic in 2020. We present a case that suggests that there may be a relationship between SAT and corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We describe the clinical findings, thyroid function tests, and neck ultrasound of a patient presenting with anterior neck pain. RESULTS: A 47-year-old, Filipino female presented with anterior neck pain associated with neck tenderness and goiter. She did not have fever or respiratory symptoms but had right lower lobe pneumonia on chest radiograph. Thyroid function tests were consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism with thyroid-stimulating hormone of 0.05 μIU/mL (reference range is 0.47 to 4.68 μIU/mL), free thyroxine of 1.68 pg/mL (reference range is 0.78 to 2.19 pg/mL), and total triiodothyronine of 1.4 ng/mL (reference range is 0.97 to 1.69 ng/mL). Anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-thyroglobulin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies were negative. Neck ultrasound showed heterogenous thyroid tissues with normal vascularity. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were positive. The patient was diagnosed as having SAT and was treated with mefenamic acid, which was later switched to celecoxib. Ceftriaxone and hydroxychloroquine were started for COVID-19 pneumonia. Complete resolution of symptoms and primary hypothyroidism occurred after 2 months. CONCLUSION: SAT may be a presenting symptom or a sequela of COVID-19. Histopathology studies and definitive documentation of the virus in thyroid tissues may be required to confirm the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.","San Juan, Mari Des J.; Florencio, Mary Queen V.; Joven, Mark Henry",AACE Clin Case Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2376060520306441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244504/; https://doi.org/10.4158/accr-2020-0524; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2376060520306441,668

Environmental pollutants can be categorized based on their characteristics and appearance into the following groups: physical, biological, and chemical. Every single one of them represents a serious threat to the male reproductive tract despite the different modes of action. Male gonads and gametes are especially vulnerable to the effect of exogenous factors; therefore, they are considered a reliable indicator of environmental pollution. The impact of xenobiotics or radiation leads to an irreversible impairment of fertility displayed by histological changes, modulated androgen production, or compromised spermatozoa (or germ cells) quality.

Fifteen puppies were evaluated; the pathology reports and histopathologic slides of these animals were reviewed to determine the pattern of histopathologic lesions. The intralesional identification of antigens of canine (distemper) morbillivirus (CDV), canine adenovirus-1 and -2 (CAdV-1 and -2), canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2), Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum was evaluated by IHC within the histopathologic patterns observed. All puppies contained CDV nucleic acid by molecular testing. The most frequent histopathologic patterns were intestinal crypt necrosis (n = 8), white matter cerebellar demyelination (n = 7), necrohaemorrhagic hepatitis (n = 7), interstitial pneumonia (n = 7), and gallbladder oedema (n = 5). All puppies contained intralesional antigens of CDV in multiple tissues resulting in singular (n = 3), and concomitant dual (n = 3), triple (n = 5) and quadruple (n = 4) infections by CAdV-1, and -2, CPV-2, and N. caninum; T. gondii was not identified.

In response, supportive services in a central London hospital mobilised mental health support specifically for HCWs. AIMS: This rapid evaluation assessed HCW psychological welfare during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and their use of supportive services made available. METHODS: During the acute phase of COVID-19 (April to May 2020) all staff working for the hospital were invited to complete an online survey assessing well-being (self-rated health, moral distress exposure, symptoms of burnout and psychological distress) and use of available supportive services (awareness of, use and perceived helpfulness). Associations among personal characteristics and psychological well-being were explored using correlations and linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 1127 staff participated in the rapid evaluation. On average, psychological distress was high (mean (SD): 22 (7.57)) regardless of role, with 84% of this sample scoring above the general population mean (14.5). Nearly half of the sample reported feeling emotionally drained and a profile emerged displaying higher levels of psychological distress and burnout in those who were younger and exposed to morally distressing situations, with this group also exhibiting greater support service use. Greater levels of burnout were associated with increased psychological distress when controlling for personal factors. During this acute phase of the pandemic, majority of staff used at least one service and rated it as helpful. CONCLUSION: HCWs experienced high levels of psychological distress requiring continued support as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved. Although HCWs were aware of supportive services, uptake varied. In order to mitigate the risk of burnout and post-traumatic stress, long-term, effective strategies that facilitate staff accessing support are urgently required.","Petrella, Anika R; Hughes, Luke; Fern, Lorna A; Monaghan, Lisa; Hannon, Benjamin; Waters, Adam; Taylor, Rachel M",Gen Psychiatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222795/; https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100458,668

They can trigger destruction of homologous mRNA or inhibition of cognate mRNA translation and play an important role in maintaining the stable state of chromosome structure and regulating the expression of protein‐coding genes. Furthermore, the recent research showed that there exists close relationship between small RNAs and human diseases. Several human diseases have surfaced in which miRNAs or their machinery might be implicated, such as some neurological diseases and cancers. The specificity and potency of small RNAs suggest that they might be promising as therapeutic agents.

632541,Peripheral Neuropathy as a Complication of SARS-Cov-2,2020-11-12,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 health crisis has posed an unprecedented challenge for governments worldwide to manage and communicate about the pandemic effectively, while maintaining public trust. Good leadership image in times of a health emergency is paramount to ensure public confidence in governments’ abilities to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify types of image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government in their communication about COVID-19 in the media and analyze public responses to these messages on social media. METHODS: Content analysis was employed to analyze 120 media statements and 382 comments retrieved from Facebook pages of 2 mainstream newspapers—Berita Harian and The Star. These media statements and comments were collected within a span of 6 weeks prior to and during the first implementation of Movement Control Order by the Malaysian Government. The media statements were analyzed according to Image Repair Theory to categorize strategies employed in government communications related to COVID-19 crisis. Public opinion responses were measured using modified lexicon-based sentiment analysis to categorize positive, negative, and neutral statements. RESULTS: The Malaysian government employed all 5 Image Repair Theory strategies in their communications in both newspapers. The strategy most utilized was reducing offensiveness (75/120, 62.5%), followed by corrective action (30/120, 25.0%), evading responsibilities (10/120, 8.3%), denial (4/120, 3.3%), and mortification (1/120, 0.8%). This study also found multiple substrategies in government media statements including denial, shifting blame, provocation, defeasibility, accident, good intention, bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attacking accuser, resolve problem, prevent recurrence, admit wrongdoing, and apologize. This study also found that 64.7% of public opinion was positive in response to media statements made by the Malaysian government and also revealed a significant positive association (P=.04) between image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government and public opinion. CONCLUSIONS: Communication in the media may assist the government in fostering positive support from the public. Suitable image repair strategies could garner positive public responses and help build trust in times of crisis.","Masngut, Nasaai; Mohamad, Emma",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/28074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156967/,668

On March 8, 2020, the Saudi Ministry of Education announced remote learning for public and private schools and universities as a preventive and precautionary measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The objective of this study was to explore the e-learning experience of the students of the colleges of health sciences with regard to the technical preparedness, academic achievements, e-learning advantages and limitations. A well-structured and validated questionnaire on a five-point Likert scale and open-ended questions about their e-learning experience was distributed to a heterogeneous purposive sample of the health sciences students in Saudi Arabian universities. RESULTS: Of the 1288 respondents, of various demographical features a relatively higher proportion of 58.2 % agreed that they had enough information about the online learning. However, the proportion who reported receiving adequate guidance, technical support, and having satisfactory hardware and internet access to online learning were 48.1 %, 42, and 35.4 %, respectively. Of all participants, 40.8 % agreed that they had gained a good understanding of their courses learning outcomes. Only 30.0 % agreed that the quality of the online teaching was similar to traditional classes and 56.1 % agreed that the online learning is unsuitable for the medical sciences studies. E-learning advantages mentioned were the flexible accessibility of the learning materials, time, effort, and money saving, acquiring and improving technical and self-learning skills, health safety, interaction without shyness, and better academic accomplishment. On the other hand, disadvantages and difficulties included inadequate tools to facilitate online learning, poor internet connection, lack of technological skills by the educators and students. In addition, there was inadequate or lack of practical classes, lack of a unified clear policy for the conduct of online classes and exams and grade distribution, limited online exam time. CONCLUSIONS: The sudden shift to e-learning without prior preparedness has revealed some pitfalls that need to be adjusted. The initial findings were considered satisfactory for such a new experience for both learners and students. However, there is a great chance for improving and expanding the e-learning process.","Al Zahrani, Eidan M.; Al Naam, Yaser A.; AlRabeeah, Saad M.; Aldossary, Deemah N.; Al-Jamea, Lamiaa H.; Woodman, Alexander; Shawaheen, Mohammad; Altiti, Osama; Quiambao, Jenifer V.; Arulanantham, Zechariah J.; Elsafi, Salah H.",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02860-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34416889/,668

A lack of physical activity in childhood and deficits in motor performance emphasize the relevance of interventions for promoting basic motor competencies. However, there are research desiderata with regard to such interventions. This article describes an intervention program for promoting basic motor competencies in middle childhood (around 6 to 10 years of age). The intervention was investigated in a longitudinal study from June 2019 to January 2020 (n = 200; 58% girls, M = 8.84 years, SD = 0.63) at three primary schools. The intervention was conducted once a week in physical education (PE). The comparison group participated in regular PE. The intervention showed significant effects on basic motor competencies in object movement but not in self-movement. The results demonstrate that positive effects on basic motor competencies can be achieved with the help of a relatively simple intervention. Further longitudinal studies are desirable as a means of substantiating the results and developing evidence-based concepts to support children in their development in the best possible way.","Strotmeyer, Anne; Kehne, Miriam; Herrmann, Christian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299794/,668

This longitudinal study aimed to estimate the prospective associations between different types of childhood maltreatment and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents, with a particular focus on investigating whether these associations vary by the tendency of coping styles. Data were from the Longitudinal Study of Adolescents’ Mental and Behavioral Well-being Research. The baseline sample included 1957 participants (response rate: 99.03%) and followed up at 1-year later (n = 1836, retention rate: 93.8%). Anxiety symptoms, childhood maltreatment, the tendency of coping styles, morning cortisol level, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and other demographics were measured. Overall, the mean age of the baseline students was 13.6 (SD: 1.5) years. The final results showed that childhood emotional abuse (unstandardized β-estimate = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.07–0.18), physical abuse (unstandardized β-estimate = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.01–0.16), and sexual abuse (unstandardized β-estimate = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.04–0.29) were positively associated with anxiety symptoms at follow-up after adjusting for significant covariates at baseline. Additionally, the stratified analyses demonstrated that only among students with negative coping styles, childhood emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse were associated with subsequent anxiety symptoms; the differences between the positive and negative coping style strata were significant (P < 0.05). Childhood maltreatment appears to be a predictor of anxiety symptoms among adolescents, and the tendency of coping styles may have a moderating role in these longitudinal associations. The efforts to prevent anxiety symptoms are recommended to be focused on adolescents with the experience of childhood maltreatment and negative coping styles.","Guo, Lan; Wang, Wanxin; Li, Wenyan; Zhao, Meijun; Wu, Ruipeng; Lu, Ciyong",Transl Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01463-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34078876/,668

In this paper we focus our analysis on data from Colombia, which presents unique economic, demographic and geological characteristics that favor the study of temperature and humidity upon SARS-CoV-2 transmission: the weather varies dramatically across five natural regions (from the Caribbean coast and the Amazon rainforest to the Andean mountains), there are no pronounced seasons, there is a central port of entry, the use of public transportation dominates inter- and intracity travel, and indoor climate control is rare. While only controlled experiments can precisely quantify the role of temperature and humidity upon SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we observe significant attenuation of transmission in climates with sustained daily maximum temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius and simultaneous mean relative humidity below 78%.

This virus has reached many countries and has paralyzed the lives of many people who have been forced to stay at home in confinement. There have been many studies that have sought to analyze the impact of this pandemic from different perspectives; however, this study will pay attention to how it has affected and how it may affect children between 0 and 12 years in the future after the closure of schools for months. Objective: The objective of this article is to learn about the research carried out on the child population in times of confinement, especially those dealing with the psychological and motor aspects of minors. Methods: To carry out this systematic review, the PRISMA statement has been followed to achieve an adequate and organized structure of the manuscript. The bibliography has been searched in the Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and Dialnet databases, using as keywords: “COVID-19” and “Children.” The criteria that were established for the selection of the articles were (1) articles focusing on an age of up to 12 years, (2) papers relating COVID-19 to children, and (3) studies analyzing the psychological and motor characteristics of children during confinement. Results: A total of nine manuscripts related to the psychological and motor factors in children under 12 have been found. The table presenting the results includes the authors, title, place of publication, and key ideas of the selected manuscripts. Conclusion: After concluding the systematic review, it has been detected that there are few studies that have focused their attention on the psychological, motor, or academic problems that can occur to minors after a situation of these characteristics. Similarly, a small number of studies have been found that promote actions at the family and school level to reverse this situation when life returns to normal. These results may be useful for future studies that seek to expand the information according to the evolution of the pandemic.","Cachón-Zagalaz, Javier; Sánchez-Zafra, María; Sanabrias-Moreno, Déborah; González-Valero, Gabriel; Lara-Sánchez, Amador J.; Zagalaz-Sánchez, María Luisa",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162910/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.569348,668

Given their roles as dynamic linchpins, the discovery of novel BH3-containing proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, without a clearly defined BH3 signature sequence, the BCL-2 family has expanded to include a nebulous group of non-homologous BH3-only proteins, now justified by an intriguing twist. We present evidence that BH3s from both ordered and disordered proteins represent a new class of short linear motifs (SLiMs) or molecular recognition features (MoRFs), and are diverse in their evolutionary histories. The implied corollaries are that BH3s have a broad phylogenetic distribution and could potentially bind to non-BCL-2-like structural domains with distinct functions.","Aouacheria, Abdel; Combet, Christophe; Tompa, Peter; Hardwick, J.

The orthopedic units were also subject to new restrictions and regulations. Therefore, the aim of our research was to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected orthopedic wards in the last year in Poland. We created an online survey, which was sent to 273 members of the Polish Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology. The survey contained 51 questions and was divided into main sections: Preparedness, Training, Stress, Reduction, Awareness. A total of 80 responses to the survey were obtained. In Preparedness section the vast majority of respondents (90%) replied, that they used personal protective equipment during the pandemic, however only 50% of the respondents indicated that their facility received a sufficient amount of personal protective equipment. Most of the respondents indicated that the pandemic negatively affected the quality of training of future orthopedists (69.4%) and that pandemic has had a negative impact on their operating skills (66,7%). In Reduction section most of the doctors indicated that the number of patients hospitalized in their departments decreased by 20–60% (61,2% respondents), while the number of operations performed decreased by 60–100% (60% respondents). The negative impact of pandemic on education was noticeable especially in the group of young orthopedic surgeons: 0–5 years of work experience (p = 0,029). Among the respondents, the level of stress increased over the last year from 4.8 to 6.9 (p <0.001). The greatest increase in the level of stress was observed among orthopedists working in country hospitals (p = 0,03). In section Awareness 36,3% of respondents feel well or very well informed about the latest Covid-19 regulations. In addition, most doctors (82.6%) believe that the Polish health care system was not well prepared to fight the pandemic and that the regulations applied so far are not sufficient to effectively fight the pandemic (66.2%). The COVID-19 pandemic has impact on orthopedics departments in Poland and negatively affected the quality of training of orthopedic surgeons and the level of stress.","Kołodziej, Łukasz; Ciechanowicz, Dawid; Rola, Hubert; Wołyński, Szymon; Wawrzyniak, Hanna; Rydzewska, Kamila; Podsiadło, Konrad",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559826/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257289,668

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy of prolonged corticosteroid therapy in early ARDS. METHODS: We assessed the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases from inception to August 1, 2020. We included RCTs that compared prolonged corticosteroid therapy with control treatment wherein the intervention was started within 72 h of ARDS diagnosis. Two investigators independently screened the citations and conducted the data extraction. The primary outcomes were all-cause 28- or 30-day mortality and 60-day mortality. Several endpoints such as ventilator-free days and adverse events were set as the secondary outcomes. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models were used to report pooled odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Among the 4 RCTs included, all referred to the all-cause 28- or 30-day mortality. In the corticosteroid group, 108 of 385 patients (28.1%) died, while 139 of 357 (38.9%) died in the control group (pooled OR, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44–0.85). Three RCTs mentioned the all-cause 60-day mortality. In the corticosteroid group, 78 of 300 patients (26.0%) died, while 101 of 265 (38.1%) died in the control group (pooled OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83). For secondary outcomes, corticosteroid treatment versus control significantly prolonged the ventilator-free days (4 RCTs: mean difference, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.53–5.95) but caused hyperglycemia (3 RCTs: pooled OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.04–2.21). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged corticosteroid treatment in early ARDS improved the survival outcomes.

Employees’ work engagement was examined using the following survey questions: “Do you feel energized when you are at work? (yes or no)” and “Do you take pride in your work? (yes or no)” After adjusting for potential confounders, Poisson regression was used to examine prevalence ratio and 95% confidence intervals for employees’ work engagement. We analyzed 15,670 individuals (11,894 of whom did not work from home and 3776 of whom worked from home). Their mean age was 45.6 ± 13.8 years, and 58.3% were men. Those who worked from home were younger than those who did not (43.9 ± 13.1 vs. 46.1 ± 13.9, p < 0.001). About 44% of all employees reported high work engagement. Among the employees who worked from home, an increase in sleep hours, effective interactions with supervisors, and working hours of ≤40 h/week were associated with engagement. Sensitivity analysis showed similar results. Close communication with superiors, refraining from working long hours, and obtaining adequate sleep may boost the work engagement of employees working from home.","Amano, Hoichi; Fukuda, Yoshiharu; Shibuya, Katsuhiko; Ozaki, Akihiko; Tabuchi, Takahiro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639795/,668

In this study, we demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein is an important immunogenic site in patients with SARS and rabbits immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Serum samples from convalescent SARS patients and immunized rabbits had potent neutralizing activities against infection by pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV S protein. Depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune sera by immunoadsorption significantly reduced serum-mediated neutralizing activity, while affinity-purified anti-RBD antibodies had relatively higher potency neutralizing infectivity of SARS pseudovirus, indicating that the RBD of S protein is a critical neutralization determinant of SARS-CoV during viral infection and immunization. Two monoclonal antibodies (1A5 and 2C5) targeting at the RBD of S protein were isolated from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Both 1A5 and 2C5 possessed potent neutralizing activities, although they directed against distinct conformation-dependant epitopes as shown by ELISA and binding competition assay. We further demonstrated that 2C5, but not 1A5, was able to block binding of the RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor on targeted cells. These data provide important information for understanding the antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV and for designing SARS vaccines.","He, Yuxian; Zhu, Qingyu; Liu, Shuwen; Zhou, Yusen; Yang, Baoan; Li, Jiaming; Jiang, Shibo",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220500067X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15749124/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220500067X,668
643565,Monitoring of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in mustelids,2021-03-03,"Chorea is caused by a number of conditions, including genetic, metabolic derangements, infections, drugs, toxins, tumors, and disorders of the immune and inflammatory system of the body. Huntington’s disease (HD) is the most common genetic cause of chorea. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition. Common symptoms include oral ulcers, joint pain, malar or discoid rashes, photosensitivity, and blood dyscrasias. It can involve the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. SLE can cause neuropsychiatric manifestations like psychosis, seizures, headache, confusion, and stroke. Chorea is a known symptom of SLE. HD is now recognized to involve more than one system and is associated with a number of comorbid conditions. We report the first case of hereditary choreiform disorder associated with and aggravated by SLE. This is also the first case report of probable Huntington disease from Balochistan, Pakistan. We report a 19-year-old girl with choreiform disorder and a family history of chorea. Choreiform disorder was present in her paternal grandmother and uncles. She presented with fever, cough, and aggravation of choreiform movements of upper and lower limbs for 10 days. She also complained of pain in the small joints of her hands and feet, oral ulcers, hair loss, and aggravation of choreiform movements for two and half months. Probable differential diagnoses of HD, Wilson’s disease, and other types of hereditary chorea, aggravated by infections, SLE, or Covid-19, were made. Her initial lab results revealed pancytopenia, increased D-dimers and serum ferritin, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). Her C(3) and C(4) complement factors were low. The rest of the lab test results, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coronavirus disease (COVID-19), blood culture, and malaria, were negative. Thus, a diagnosis of hereditary chorea associated with and aggravated by SLE was made. Hereditary choreiform disorders can be associated with and aggravated by autoimmune conditions like SLE. Thus, it is recommended to be vigilant and have a low threshold for diagnosing co-existing autoimmune conditions like SLE in patients with hereditary choreiform disorder.","Hussain, Taimoor; Wali, Ahmad; Hafizyar, Farukhzad; Eimal Latif, Abdul Habib; Joyce, John; Walizada, Khalida; Malik, Sheza; Mushtaq, Zahra",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336483/,668
644566,Performance Assessment of First-Generation AntiSARS-CoV-2 Serological Assays,2020-09-24,"1. Parasites and pathogens of wildlife can threaten biodiversity, infect humans and domestic animals, and cause significant economic losses, providing incentives to manage wildlife diseases. Recent insights from disease ecology have helped transform our understanding of infectious disease dynamics and yielded new strategies to better manage wildlife diseases. Simultaneously, wildlife disease management (WDM) presents opportunities for large‐scale empirical tests of disease ecology theory in diverse natural systems. 2. To assess whether the potential complementarity between WDM and disease ecology theory has been realized, we evaluate the extent to which specific concepts in disease ecology theory have been explicitly applied in peer‐reviewed WDM literature. 3. While only half of WDM articles published in the past decade incorporated disease ecology theory, theory has been incorporated with increasing frequency over the past 40 years. Contrary to expectations, articles authored by academics were no more likely to apply disease ecology theory, but articles that explain unsuccessful management often do so in terms of theory. 4. Some theoretical concepts such as density‐dependent transmission have been commonly applied, whereas emerging concepts such as pathogen evolutionary responses to management, biodiversity–disease relationships and within‐host parasite interactions have not yet been fully integrated as management considerations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Theory‐based disease management can meet the needs of both academics and managers by testing disease ecology theory and improving disease interventions. Theoretical concepts that have received limited attention to date in wildlife disease management could provide a basis for improving management and advancing disease ecology in the future.","Joseph, Maxwell B.; Mihaljevic, Joseph R.; Arellano, Ana Lisette; Kueneman, Jordan G.; Preston, Daniel L.; Cross, Paul C.; Johnson, Pieter T.

Motivated by this, we evaluate the economic impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on both national and industrial levels by employing quarterly computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Our results reveal that the epidemic may lower China's economic growth in 2020 by 3.5%, versus 4.4% for final consumption (relative to baseline). The service industry suffers the most from the outbreak, and the Accommodation-Food-Beverage service, Wholesale-Retail Trade, and Transport-Storage-Post are identified as the most vulnerable sectors, with the negative impact on output reaching as high as 14.6%. When moving to 2021, the hit to economy shrinks to 2% (1.2–2.7%), with industry estimated to be the most affected sector instead. This study indicates that implementing effective measures for preventing and controlling the epidemic and policies for post-disease economic recovery play critical role in curbing the potential economic damage.","Duan, Hongbo; Bao, Qin; Tian, Kailan; Wang, Shouyang; Yang, Cuihong; Cai, Zongwu",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043951X21000249; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X21000249?v=s5,668
644696,SARS-CoV-2: big seroprevalence data from Pakistan—is herd immunity at hand?,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND: There are still many unanswered questions about the novel coronavirus; however, a largely underutilized source of knowledge is the millions of people who have recovered after contracting the virus. This includes a majority of undocumented cases of COVID-19, which were classified as mild or moderate and received little to no clinical care during the course of illness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document and glean insights from the experiences of individuals with a first-hand experience in dealing with COVID-19, especially the so-called mild-to-moderate cases that self-resolved while in isolation. METHODS: This web-based survey study called C19 Insider Scoop recruited adult participants aged 18 years or older who reside in the United States and had tested positive for COVID-19 or antibodies. Participants were recruited through various methods, including online support groups for COVID-19 survivors, advertisement in local news outlets, as well as through professional and other networks. The main outcomes measured in this study included knowledge of contraction or transmission of the virus, symptoms, and personal experiences on the road to recovery. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants (female, n=53; male, n=19; age range: 18-73 years; mean age: 41 [SD 14] years) from 22 US states were enrolled in this study. The top known source of how people contracted SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19, was through a family or household member (26/72, 35%). This was followed by essential workers contracting the virus through the workplace (13/72, 18%). Participants reported up to 27 less-documented symptoms that they experienced during their illness, such as brain or memory fog, palpitations, ear pain or discomfort, and neurological problems. In addition, 47 of 72 (65%) participants reported that their symptoms lasted longer than the commonly cited 2-week period even for mild cases of COVID-19. The mean recovery time of the study participants was 4.5 weeks, and exactly one-half of participants (50%) still experienced lingering symptoms of COVID-19 after an average of 65 days following illness onset. Additionally, 37 (51%) participants reported that they experienced stigma associated with contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents preliminary findings suggesting that emphasis on family or household spread of COVID-19 may be lacking and that there is a general underestimation of the recovery time even for mild cases of illness with the virus. Although a larger study is needed to validate these results, it is important to note that as more people experience COVID-19, insights from COVID-19 survivors can enable a more informed public, pave the way for others who may be affected by the virus, and guide further research.","Prioleau, Temiloluwa",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/23009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878012/,668

Pour les couples, les contacts physiques ont diminué et la vie sexuelle en a été altérée. Une sexualité sans risque implique de savoir comment éviter la transmission du virus. La distance physique crée de l’irritabilité, de la peur, et menace la vie sexuelle : il est raisonnable pour un couple vivant sous le même toit d’avoir des relations sexuelles sauf si l’un d’entre eux présentent un risque d’infection. Tous les couples confinés séparément n’ont pas nécessairement envie d’avoir des relations sexuelles en ligne et pour les personnes qui ne sont pas en couple, il est difficile de s’engager dans des relations sexuelles récréatives. En dépit de cela, la pandémie permet d’envisager une nouvelle intimité sexuelle utilisant des sex toys et de la technologie. L’utilisation d’internet pour maintenir une activité sexuelle active semble avoir été une excellente alternative pour pallier la distance physique entre les partenaires. Le conseil le plus couramment donné aux membres de couples confinés seuls était de maintenir un contact électronique constant pour atténuer la nostalgie et compenser le manque d’activité sexuelle. Ceci entraîna l’essor des sextos, des rencontres par webcam ou des appels téléphoniques érotiques contribuant à la désinhibition des couples. L’utilisation de la webcam, associée à l’utilisation de sex toys, permet également d’enrichir le répertoire sexuel. La pratique du sexe en ligne avec le partenaire stable ne vivant pas sous le même toit a aidé certaines personnes à maintenir leur désir et à le satisfaire et préserver celui-ci intact en vue de la fin de la pandémie. L’objectif de ce travail est de passer en revue les données disponibles sur la sexualité pendant les pandémies COVID-19 et de fournir des recommandations pour aider la population à vivre et préserver sa sexualité dans cette période critique. Coronavirus is an infectious disease that has affected many countries, changing daily life. For many individuals, sexual activity has decreased, physical contact within couples has been reduced. Obviously, to maintain a safe sex life, it is essential to know how to avoid the virus transmission. Distance creates irritability, fear, anxiety, endangering sexual life: it is reasonable to have sex between cohabiting partners unless one or both are at risk of infection. Despite this, the pandemic allows us to think of new sexual intimacies mediated by sextoys and technology. Not all distant couples are willing to have sex online, and it is difficult for singles to engage in casual sexual relations, so after the pandemic there will be many couples who will have to remodel and many singles who will seek a partner. Using the Internet to maintain active sexual activity appeared to be an excellent alternative to diminish the distance between partners or to increase online knowledge. The most common advice for separated couples was to maintain constant digital contact to alleviate nostalgia and lack. This was the springboard to use sexting, meeting via webcam or making a hot call that make the couple more uninhibited. Using the webcam, also sometimes with the possibility to use sex toys, could create also the opportunity to enrich the future sexual repertoire. Practicing online sex with the stable partner far from home has helped some to keep their desire active and to satisfy it in order to be able to realize it once the pandemic has ended. The purpose of this narrative review of available evidence on sexuality during COVID-19 pandemics is to provide recommendations to help people facing their sexual life in this critical period.","Eleuteri, S.; Terzitta, G.",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S115813602030116X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S115813602030116X,668

However, there are no effective strategies for controlling the IB virus (IBV) at present. Therefore, development of novel antiviral treatment strategies is urgently required. As reported, astragalus polysaccharides (APS) have potential antiviral effects against several viruses; however, the antiviral effect of APS against IBV remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether APS had the potential to inhibit IBV infectionby utilizing several in vitro experimental approaches. To this end, the effect of APS on the replication of IBV was examined in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. Viral titers were calculated by using the plaque formation assay, and the cytotoxicity of APS was tested by utilizing a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The expression of viral mRNA and cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α) mRNA transcripts was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR(qRT-PCR). IBV titers in infected CEK cells treated with APS were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that APS inhibited IBV replication in vitro. We also found that the decreased viral replication after APS treatment was associated with reduced mRNA levels of the cytokines IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. In conclusion, these results suggest that APS exhibit antiviral activities against IBV and it may represent a potential therapeutic agent for inhibiting the replication of IBV.","Zhang, Pengju; Liu, Xuefeng; Liu, Haiyan; Wang, Weixia; Liu, Xiaohui; Li, Xintao; Wu, Xinghong",Microb Pathog,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401017313979; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401017313979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29170045/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.11.026,668

Early diagnosis is extremely important as the main stay of treatment is surgical excision. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a rare case of bronchial typical carcinoid tumor in a 27-year-old male who presented with a complaint of intermittent dry cough of 2 weeks’ duration associated with shortness of breath and low grade fever. He was initially misdiagnosed as covid-19 pneumonia and was admitted to covid-19 treatment center. Right lung bi-lobectomy with regional lymph node resection was done and he was discharged home in good condition. DISCUSSION: Majority of typical carcinoids are located in the central airways leading to bronchial obstruction with recurrent pneumonia, chest pain and wheezing. In the era of covid-19 pandemic, lung cancer patients are at higher risk of being affected by covid-19 and, early identification and differential diagnosis is extremely difficult in the absence of comprehensive evaluation and work up as the clinical and imaging findings of covid-19 may resemble lung cancer. Although hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are the most common metastatic sites for typical carcinoids most lymphadenopathies are caused by a reactive inflammatory reaction. CONCLUSION: Bronchial carcinoids are rare, malignant neuroendocrine tumors with complete surgical resection being the only curative management. During the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, diagnosing rare lung diseases like carcinoid tumor is real challenge especially in resource limited set up and needs high index of suspicion with meticulous diagnostic work up. The outcome of typical carcinoids with lymph node metastasis is excellent with complete resection.","Mindaye, Esubalew Taddese; Kassahun, Mulugeta; Tigiye, Gulilat",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210261221002030?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.105703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649715/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210261221002030,668

Although the spatial distribution of H5N1 outbreaks and risk factors for virus occurrence has been extensively studied, there have been no comparative studies for H5N6. Data collected through active surveillance of Vietnamese live bird markets (LBMs) between 2011 and 2015 were used to explore and compare the spatiotemporal distributions of H5N1- and H5N6-positive LBMs. Conditional autoregressive models were developed to quantify spatiotemporal associations between agroecological factors and the two HPAI strains using the same set of predictor variables. Unlike H5N1, which exhibited a strong north–south divide, with repeated occurrence in the extreme south of a cluster of high-risk provinces, H5N6 was homogeneously distributed throughout Vietnam. Similarly, different agroecological factors were associated with each strain. Sample collection in the months of January and February and higher average maximum temperature were associated with higher likelihood of H5N1-positive market-day status. The likelihood of market days being positive for H5N6 increased with decreased river density, and with successive Rounds of data collection.

646612,The development of Chinese specific human cytomegalovirus polyepitope recombinant vaccine,2011-12-13,"Background Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Methods This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged ≥18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (≥18-<55 and ≥55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100µg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) response. Results Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investigator occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days post-vaccination one that were higher at the 100 µg dose relative to the 50 µg dose; this difference was less apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated through day 57. Conclusions Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immunogenicity of 50 and 100 ug mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.

647346,Healthcare-Associated SARS-CoV-2 Transmission—Experiences from a German University Hospital,2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the association of suspected versus confirmed infection with the novel SARS-CoV2 virus with the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill children. METHODS: Sequential point-prevalence study of children and young adults aged 7 days to 25 years admitted to intensive care units under investigation for SARS-CoV2 infection. AKI was staged in the first 14 days of enrollment using KDIGO creatinine-based staging. SARS-CoV2 positive (CONFIRMED) were compared to SUSPECTED (negative or unknown). Outcome data was censored at 28-days. RESULTS: In 331 patients of both sexes, 179 (54.1%) were CONFIRMED, 4.2% (14) died. AKI occurred in 124 (37.5%) and severe AKI occurred in 63 (19.0%). Incidence of AKI in CONFIRMED was 74/179 (41.3%) versus 50/152 (32.9%) for SUSPECTED; severe AKI occurred in 35 (19.6%) of CONFIRMED and 28 (18.4%) of SUSPECTED. Mortality was 6.2% (n = 11) in CONFIRMED, but 9.5% (n = 7) in those CONFIRMED with AKI. On multivariable analysis, only Hispanic ethnicity (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.3–0.9) was associated with less AKI development among those CONFIRMED. CONCLUSIONS: AKI and severe AKI occur commonly in critically ill children with SARS-CoV2 infection, more than double the historical standard. Further investigation is needed during this continuing pandemic to describe and refine the understanding of pediatric AKI epidemiology and outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01987921. IMPACT: What is the key message of the article? AKI occurs in children exposed to the novel SARS-CoV2 virus at high prevalence (~40% with some form of AKI and 20% with severe AKI). What does it add to the existing literature? Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs commonly in adult patients with SARS-CoV2 (COVID), very little data describes the epidemiology of AKI in children exposed to the virus. What is the impact? A pediatric vaccine is not available; thus, the pandemic is not over for children. Pediatricians will need to manage significant end-organ ramifications of the novel SARS-CoV2 virus including AKI.","Basu, Rajit K.; Bjornstad, Erica C.; Gist, Katja M.; Starr, Michelle; Khandhar, Paras; Chanchlani, Rahul; Krallman, Kelli A.; Zappitelli, Michael; Askenazi, David; Goldstein, Stuart L.",Pediatr Res,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-021-01667-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331019/,668

649206,"Positivity of SARS-CoV-2, by RT-PCR among workers of a Public Hospital in the city of Santos, SP, Brazil 2020.",2020-07-02,"This paper identifies experiential processes through which social structures become taken for granted, termed processes of “structure marginalization”. Passive processes of structure marginalization relegate social structures to the margin of experience without the use of higher-order cognitive acts such as evaluation and reflection. Examples include adapting to social structures via routine and habitual practices (material reification), a lack of conscious awareness of the complexity, historical formation, and other details of social structures (ignorance), and rendering social structures irrelevant when they are unreflectively judged to be of no value for achieving ends (nullification). Active processes of structure marginalization reflectively and discursively relegate social structures to marginal consciousness. Examples include the use of naturalistic and necessitarian explanations for the social order that implicitly justify it as inalterable or “just the way things are” (discursive reification), normative justifications for the status quo (legitimation), and conscious awareness of one’s powerlessness to control social-structural conditions (helplessness). Active processes of structure marginalization originate in passive processes. The goal of the typology is to explain, at the level of experience, why social structures typically remain unproblematic and unnoticed in everyday life, even during periods of social crisis and change or when existing structures produce harmful effects.","Gunderson, Ryan",Hum Stud,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10746-021-09592-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248233/,668
649259,Evolution of viral variants in remdesivir‐treated and untreated SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected pediatrics patients,2021-09-04,"Ample evidence exists on the role of interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the response against many pathogens, as well as on its remarkable antitumor properties. However, the unexpected toxicity and disappointing results in some clinical trials are prompting the design of new strategies and/or vectors for IL-12 delivery. This study was conceived to further endorse the use of gemini cationic lipids (GCLs) in combination with zwitterionic helper lipid DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl ethanol amine) as nanovectors for the insertion of plasmid DNA encoding for IL-12 (pCMV-IL12) into cells. Optimal GCL formulations previously reported by us were selected for IL-12-based biophysical experiments. In vitro studies demonstrated efficient pCMV-IL12 transfection by GCLs with comparable or superior cytokine levels than those obtained with commercial control Lipofectamine2000*. Furthermore, the nanovectors did not present significant toxicity, showing high cell viability values. The proteins adsorbed on the nanovector surface were found to be mostly lipoproteins and serum albumin, which are both beneficial to increase the blood circulation time. These outstanding results are accompanied by an initial physicochemical characterization to confirm DNA compaction and protection by the lipid mixture. Although further studies would be necessary, the present GCLs exhibit promising characteristics as candidates for pCMV-IL12 transfection in future in vivo applications.","Sánchez-Arribas, Natalia; Martínez-Negro, María; Aicart-Ramos, Clara; Tros de Ilarduya, Conchita; Aicart, Emilio; Guerrero-Martínez, Andrés; Junquera, Elena",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13050729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063469/,668

New, previously unstudied viruses and some specific mutant or recombinant variants of known viruses constantly appear. An example is a variant of coronaviruses (CoV) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), named SARS-CoV-2. Some antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir as well as antiretroviral drugs including darunavir, lopinavir, and ritonavir are suggested to be effective in treating disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2. There are data on the utilization of antiretroviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Since there are many studies aimed at the identification of the molecular mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the development of novel therapeutic approaches against HIV-1, we used HIV-1 for our case study to identify possible molecular pathways shared by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1. We applied a text and data mining workflow and identified a list of 46 targets, which can be essential for the development of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1. We show that SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 share some molecular pathways involved in inflammation, immune response, cell cycle regulation.","Tarasova, Olga; Ivanov, Sergey; Filimonov, Dmitry A.; Poroikov, Vladimir",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604797/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122944,668
651034,Enhanced contact investigations for nine early travel-related cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States,2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Humans are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic of COVID-19. The screening of infected people in the population still mainly depends on clinical symptoms. However, there is limited research on the characteristics of clinical symptoms in different populations, especially in imported cases. METHODS: To retrospectively analyze the clinical data of 494 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Shanghai from January 20, 2020, to March 31, 2020, we compared the clinical manifestations in different populations and their influencing factors in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: (1) Of the 494 patients, 453 (91.7%) had different symptoms at admission, and 39 (7.89%) patients were asymptomatic. (2) We compared the symptoms of patients according to different stratifications and found the following results: a. The proportion of dyspnea was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (P < 0.05). b. The proportions of a stuffy nose, sore throat, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly higher in children than in adult patients (P < 0.05). c. The proportions of fever, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and fatigue were significantly higher in local cases than in imported cases. In comparison, the proportions of nasal congestion, stuffy nose, sore throat, headache, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly lower in imported cases than in imported cases (P < 0.05). d. The proportions of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and dyspnea were significantly higher in severely ill patients than in those with mild symptoms (P < 0.05). (3) Thirty-one asymptomatic patients were significantly younger than symptomatic patients, and they had a higher proportion of imported cases, white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte (LYM) count levels, and fewer abnormal CT cases than the group of symptomatic patients (P < 0.05). (4) The number of days since the onset of the disease needed for the symptoms to disappear was associated with the epidemiological history (imported cases), the number of days until the pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative, the days of hospitalization, the days of onset, and the WBC and LYM count levels (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The majority of COVID-19 patients (91.7%) had early symptoms. whereas 7.89% of COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic. Younger patients had fewer symptoms, mainly the upper respiratory symptoms, and the illness condition was milder, which was more common in imported cases. Elderly male patients had severe symptoms when admitted. The number of days needed for the patient's symptoms to disappear was closely related to the number of days necessary for the pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test to turn negative.","MEI, Xue; ZHANG, Yuyi; ZHU, Hui; LING, Yun; ZOU, Ying; ZHANG, Zhengguo; GUO, Hongying; LIU, Yu; CHENG, Xingxia; LIU, Min; HUANG, Wei; WANG, Jiefei; YI, Zhigang; QIAN, Zhiping; LU, Hongzhou",Am J Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.06.221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645475/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655320306465; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320306465?v=s5,668

We investigated whether sTREM-1 circulating concentrations are associated with the outcome of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to assess the role of this pathway in COVID-19. This observational study was performed in two independent cohorts of patients with COVID-19. Plasma concentrations of sTREM-1 were assessed after ICU admission (pilot cohort) or after COVID-19 diagnosis (validation cohort). Routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected from electronic patient files. Results showed sTREM-1 plasma concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 (161 [129–196] pg/ml) compared to healthy controls (104 [75–124] pg/ml; P<0.001). Patients with severe COVID-19 needing ICU admission displayed even higher sTREM-1 concentrations compared to less severely ill COVID-19 patients receiving clinical ward-based care (235 [176–319] pg/ml and 195 [139–283] pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.017). In addition, higher sTREM-1 plasma concentrations were observed in patients who did not survive the infection (326 [207–445] pg/ml) compared to survivors (199 [142–278] pg/ml, P<0.001). Survival analyses indicated that patients with higher sTREM-1 concentrations are at higher risk for death (hazard ratio = 3.3, 95%CI: 1.4–7.8). In conclusion, plasma sTREM-1 concentrations are elevated in patients with COVID-19, relate to disease severity, and discriminate between survivors and non-survivors. This suggests that the TREM-1 pathway is involved in the inflammatory reaction and the disease course of COVID-19, and therefore may be considered as a therapeutic target in severely ill patients with COVID-19.","de Nooijer, Aline H.; Grondman, Inge; Lambden, Simon; Kooistra, Emma J.; Janssen, Nico A.F.; Kox, Matthijs; Pickkers, Peter; Joosten, Leo A.B.; van de Veerdonk, Frank L.; Derive, Marc; Gibot, Sebastien; Netea, Mihai G.",Biosci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20210940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195785/,668

Moreover, using computational approaches, we assess whether these mutations are associated with changes in viral virulence. We utilize genetic data from 144 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the Cypriot population obtained between March 2020 and January 2021, as well as all data available from GISAID. We combine this with countries’ regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of Cyprus-specific mutations are obtained by mutation tracking analysis. This entails calculating specific mutation frequencies within the Cypriot population and comparing these with their prevalence world-wide throughout the course of the pandemic. We further make use of linear regression models to extrapolate additional information that may be missed through standard statistical analysis. We report a single mutation found in the ORF1ab gene (S6059F) that appears to be significantly enriched within the Cypriot population. We further analyse this mutation using regression models to investigate possible associations with increased deaths and cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutation infers a conformational change to the protein that significantly alters its structure when compared to the reference protein. Investigating Cyprus-specific mutations for SARS-CoV-2 can not only lead to important findings from which to battle the pandemic on a national level, but also provide insights into viral virulence worldwide.","Oulas, Anastasis; Richter, Jan; Zanti, Maria; Tomazou, Marios; Michailidou, Kyriaki; Christodoulou, Kyproula; Christodoulou, Christina; Spyrou, George M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447477,668

GBS is a neurological emergency defined as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The patient responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 44-year-old Hispanic man who came for evaluation of bilateral facial weakness and lack of taste sensation. He had lower motor neuron facial weakness. His head computed tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans did not show any pathological abnormalities. He tested positive for SARSCoV-2 by a nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis via lumbar puncture revealed elevated protein levels, no leukocytes, and a negative Gram stain. The CSF RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. PCR tests of the CSF for other viral infections were negative. A diagnosis of GBS was made, and he was treated successfully with IVIG. After the fourth dose of IVIG, the patient was able to close his eyes, frown, show his teeth, and smile. CONCLUSIONS: Our case is rare because the patient did not present with lower extremity weakness, but only with bilateral Bell’s palsy. Physicians should be aware of GBS because it is a neurological emergency for which COVID-19 can be a risk factor. Early diagnosis and treatment of GBS can prevent neurological disability.","Khaja, Misbahuddin; Roa Gomez, Gabriella P.; Santana, Yaneidy; Hernandez, Nolberto; Haider, Asim; Lara, Jose Luis Perez; Elkin, Rene",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.927956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128540/,668

A modified HD modality named bed‐sided short‐duration renal replacement therapy (BSRRT) was used in noncritical maintenance HD (MHD) patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 in Wuhan due to extreme situation. To determine the safety and efficacy as a substitution for intermittent HD (IHD), we conducted this study. We used the data of 88 noncritical COVID‐19 MHD patients collected from 65 medical units at the hospitals in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to March 10, 2020. t‐test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Fisher exact probability method were used to compare the baseline characteristics, treatment, and death. Log‐rank test and Cox regression multivariate analysis was used to compare the survival of noncritical patients who were transferred to BSRRT modality versus those who were continued on the IHD. Univariate analysis showed the level of reported fatigue symptom at present, bilateral lung computed tomography infiltration and steroid treatment differed between the two groups. The outcome of death of the two groups did not show significant differences in univariate analysis (P = .0563). Multivariate Cox regression analysis dialysis showed modality of treatment after COVID‐19 diagnosis was not a significant predictor of death (P = .1000). These data suggest that for noncritical COVID‐19 MHD patients, the transfer from IHD to BSRRT does not have significant difference in the risk of death compared with IHD group. This finding suggests this modified modality could be an option for the substitution for IHD during the COVID‐19 pandemic period.","Hu, Yanglin; Tu, Can; Dong, Jun‐Wu; Chen, Wen‐Li; Wang, Xiao‐Hui; Luo, Dan; Shi, Ming; Zhou, Mengliang; Song, Yuting; Zhang, Chun; Xiong, Fei",Ther Apher Dial,https://doi.org/10.1111/1744-9987.13590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012089/,668

As of December 3, 2020, the total number of cases reported are around 65,527,000 contagions worldwide, and 1,524,000 deaths affecting 218 countries and territories. In this scenario, Spain is one of the countries that has suffered in a hard way, the ongoing epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, namely COVID-19 disease. In this paper, we present the utilization of phenomenological epidemic models to characterize the two first outbreak waves of COVID-19 in Spain. The study is driven using a two-step phenomenological epidemic approach. First, we use a simple generalized growth model to fit the main parameters at the early epidemic phase; later, we apply our previous finding over a logistic growth model to that characterize both waves completely. The results show that even in the absence of accurate data series, it is possible to characterize the curves of case incidence, and construct a short-term forecast of 60 days in the near time horizon, in relation to the expected total duration of the pandemic.","López, Miguel; Peinado, Alberto; Ortiz, Andrés",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166411/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253004,668

It remains poorly understood how the host immune system responds to the infection during disease progression. We applied microarray analysis of the whole genome transcriptome to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from severe and mild COVID-19 patients as well as healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis of genes associated with COVID-19 severity indicated that disease progression is featured by overactivation of myeloid cells and deficient T cell function. The upregulation of TLR6 and MMP9, which promote the neutrophils-mediated inflammatory response, and the downregulation of SKAP1 and LAG3, which regulate T cells function, were associated with disease severity. Importantly, the regulation of these four genes was absent in patients with influenza A (H1N1). And compared with stimulation with hemagglutinin (HA) of H1N1 virus, the regulation pattern of these genes was unique in PBMCs response to Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Our data also suggested that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection largely silenced the response of type I interferons (IFNs) and altered the proportion of immune cells, providing a potential mechanism for the hypercytokinemia. This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs inflammatory and immune signatures in patients, especially those at severe stage. The potential mechanisms underpinning severe COVID-19 progression include overactive myeloid cells, impaired function of T cells, and inadequate induction of type I IFNs signaling.","Zhang, Qiong; Meng, Yuting; Wang, Kaihang; Zhang, Xujun; Chen, Wenbiao; Sheng, Jifang; Qiu, Yunqing; Diao, Hongyan; Li, Lanjuan",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679778/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.631226,668

Whereas these devices provide excellent protection of the user, there is an added element of risk during doffing and cleaning of the device. An additional layer of barrier protection, in the form of a polypropylene gown, to be worn over the hood and motor belt, can be used to minimise this risk. However, the device entrains air perpendicular to the lie of the gown, resulting in the impermeable material being sucked into the air intake, and partial occlusion of flow. In this report, we describe a clinical‐academic partnership whereby a bespoke filter guard was designed to disrupt airflow and prevent gown entrainment, thereby enabling full barrier protection of both the device and user. This intervention was simple, cheap, scalable and able to be mass produced.","Miles, L. F.; Chuen, J.; Edwards, L.; Hohmann, J. D.; Williams, R.; Peyton, P.; Grayden, D.

The tensions between Dynamic and Static Knowledge in facilitating the transfer and sharing of knowledge arise as compelling research as well as practical topic for organizations. Our paper aims to investigate such tensions by employing a case study. We decided to deepen such dynamics in the healthcare field, given its importance for business and society. In more detail, we analyzed one Emergency Room (ER) department through a series of interviews. Our findings highlight the importance of the right balance between Static and Dynamic Knowledge. On the one hand, the healthcare organization recognized the need to incorporate knowledge into practical and tangible instruments.

Six novel ferrocene-based thiosemicarbazones have been synthesized through the condensation reaction of acetyl ferrocene with differently substituted thiosemicarbazide. Furthermore, we used state-of-the-art computational docking approach to explore the theoretical aspects for possible antiviral potential of our synthesized compounds. All the six compounds were docked with M(pro) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is very crucial protein for viral replication. Among the six derivatives, compounds 2 and 4 showed higher binding affinities with binding energy of − 6.7 and − 6.9 kcal/mol, respectively. The visualization of intermolecular interactions between synthesized derivatives and M(pro) protein illustrated that each of compounds 2 and 4 forms two hydrogen bonds accompanied by important hydrophobic interactions. The comparison of binding affinities with some recently approved drugs like remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine molecules are also made. The calculated binding energies of remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine molecules with M(pro) of COVID-19 was found to be − 7.00, − 5.20 and − 5.60 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding energy of compound 4 (− 6.9 kcal/mol) was almost equal to the remdesivir and greater than the binding energies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

This nationwide survey was conducted to assess online anatomy education during the pandemic for medical students from nonclinical medicine and clinical medicine majors at medical schools in China via WeChat. The total of 356 responders included 293 responders from clinical medicine and 63 respondents from nonclinical medicine majors (i.e., 21 from preventive medicine, 13 from stomatology, and 29 from traditional Chinese medicine). The survey results showed that several aspects of online anatomy education were quite similar in clinical and nonclinical majors’ classes, including theoretical and practical sessions, active learning, assessments and evaluations. However, there were statistically significant differences in class size, implementation of active learning activities prior to the pandemic, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of online learning during the pandemic, between clinical and nonclinical medicine majors. These results indicated that, compared with teachers of anatomy courses in clinical medicine, teachers of nonclinical medicine majors using online learning in medical schools in China had relatively poor preparation for online learning in response to the unforeseen pandemic.","Yan, Yu; Cheng, Xin; Zhou, Changman; Yang, Xuesong; Li, Yun-Qing",Medical education online,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2021.1897267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720807/,668

The revised International Health Regulations [IHR], which entered into force for all 194 World Health Organization member states in 2007, have expanded traditional infectious disease notification to include surveillance for public health events of potential international importance, even if the causative agent is not yet known. However, there are no clearly established guidelines for how countries should conduct this surveillance, which types of emerging disease syndromes should be reported, nor any means for enforcement. DISCUSSION: The commonly established concept of syndromic surveillance in developed regions encompasses the use of pre-diagnostic information in a near real time fashion for further investigation for public health action. Syndromic surveillance is widely used in North America and Europe, and is typically thought of as a highly complex, technology driven automated tool for early detection of outbreaks. Nonetheless, low technology applications of syndromic surveillance are being used worldwide to augment traditional surveillance. SUMMARY: In this paper, we review examples of these novel applications in the detection of vector-borne diseases, foodborne illness, and sexually transmitted infections. We hope to demonstrate that syndromic surveillance in its basic version is a feasible and effective tool for surveillance in developing countries and may facilitate compliance with the new IHR guidelines.","May, Larissa; Chretien, Jean-Paul; Pavlin, Julie A",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19607669/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-242,668

The nitrosation of the sulfhydryl moiety leads to S-nitrosothiols with high and low molecular weight, respectively. The interest in the S-nitrosothiols was motivated by the observation that these compounds form in vivo and may elicit physiological responses that are strongly reminiscent of free NO radicals.

660465,Assessing the Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission via Surgical Electrocautery Plume,2021-05-21,"BACKGROUND: Music therapy is a multifaceted discipline that harnesses the power of music to treat a wide range of patient populations. A therapist who plays music in a private room for a patient is not subject to copyright restrictions on public performances. However, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, music therapy is no longer strictly confined to the face-to-face setting. This study explores music therapists’ perceptions of copyright law with respect to their ability to provide mediated services to their clients. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study were two-fold. The first was to investigate whether concerns about copyright law are hampering the diffusion of telehealth innovations, and the second was whether these concerns are causing music therapists to avoid therapeutically beneficial telehealth interventions. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with credentialed music therapists (n=18) in the United States between May 2020 and June 2020. With participants’ consent, we used video conference technology to record and transcribe the in-depth interviews. The median interview length was 45 (SD 16.37) minutes. This theoretically informed study employed thematic analysis of the interview data. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telehealth interventions to facilitate therapy outside of private face-to-face environments: environments where music therapy practices are largely shielded from copyright infringement concerns. Five main themes emerged, including therapists’ uncertainty about permissible uses of music and therapists’ erring on the side of caution causing lost opportunities for care. Our interview data suggest music therapists have altered telehealth interventions in suboptimal ways to avoid copyright liability in a physically distanced environment. CONCLUSIONS: Some music therapists “drag their feet” on offering therapeutically appropriate telehealth services to clients because of copyright concerns. Our findings suggest innovative mediated therapies were shied away from or abandoned. These findings offer a novel contribution to the public health literature by highlighting copyright law as an unexpected and unwelcome barrier to the diffusion of music therapy practices in technology-mediated settings.","Reid, Amanda; Kresovich, Alex",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/28383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34319241/,668

The data of two emergency physician response units of a northern German region with 1.2 million citizens was analyzed retrospectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the period March 16 to April 16 for the year 2020 when the lockdown took place in Germany and compare the results for the same period for the year 2019 and 2018. 1004 patients were included. Demographic data, the type of rescue missions, the number of missions per day, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Score (NACA-score), the frequency of respiratory emergencies (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 associated), as well as the number of deaths were documented. RESULTS: Mean age was 62.3±24.8 years and 576 (56.5%) were male. Number of missions were 397, 403 and 333 in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively. The control room registered a 22% reduction of rescue missions for the year 2020. Even the amount of emergency calls via the emergency number 112 was reduced by 17.4% between 2018 and 2020. 150 (14.9%) missions were due to respiratory emergencies. In 2020 10 missions (28.6% of respiratory emergencies) were COVID-19 related. In 2020 the NACA score increased significantly. CONCLUSION: We found a decreasing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany on the number of emergency calls as well as missions, and an increase of the severity of cases in preclinical care for a northern German region with 1.2 million citizens.

The primary aim of this interesting research study is to examine and investigate the possible relationship between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the sudden temporary sexual dysfunction in adult males during the pandemic. Some other secondary hypotheses will be also investigated. Material and Methods: With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, we have noticed an intense increase in the number of male patients who have presented to andrologists with new sudden onset of various moderate to severe sexual dysfunction problems (e.g., erectile dysfunction/impotence, infertility, and hypogonadism) in Egypt and USA hospitals and clinics along with telemedicine consultations. The high frequency with which patients present with these sexual problems was extremely unusual. Herein, we described patients who have presented with unexpected moderate to complete loss of their sexual abilities (which did not happen before in that unreasonable way) with the presence of normal and intact sexual desire during a five-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Most of these male patients had either no COVID-19 symptoms or very mild-to-moderate respiratory symptoms known in COVID-19 patients. Although most of patients had normal otolaryngologic exam results, but, surprisingly, almost all tested positive for COVID-19. A strong relationship between COVID-19 and sudden sexual dysfunction in men should certainly be considered and investigated during the pandemic.

The virus expresses proteins containing short contiguous amino acid stretches (5–9aa “vatches” = viralmatches) homologous to APOE4, clusterin, PICALM, and complement receptor 1, and to over 100 other gene products relevant to Alzheimer's disease, which are also homologous to proteins expressed by other pathogens implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Such homology, reiterated at the DNA level, suggests that gene association studies have been tracking infection, as well as identifying key genes, demonstrating a role for pathogens as causative agents. Vatches may interfere with the function of their human counterparts, acting as dummy ligands, decoy receptors, or via interactome interference. They are often immunogenic, and antibodies generated in response to infection may target their human counterparts, producing protein knockdown, or generating autoimmune responses that may kill the neurones in which the human homologue resides, a scenario supported by immune activation in Alzheimer's disease. These data may classify Alzheimer's disease as an autoimmune disorder created by pathogen mimicry of key Alzheimer's disease-related proteins.

LMWH is traditionally used for its anticoagulant and antithrombotic properties, however, its anti-inflammatory effect has not been fully elucidated. A study done by Shastri et al. suggested that LMWH can inhibit the release of different cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-α) [4]. Recent retrospective studies on COVID-19 illustrated that the LMWH (40-60 mg, subcutaneously every day) was associated with better prognosis as measured by (28 days of survival) in severely sick patients meeting sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC≥4) criteria compared to nonusers [5]. The potential role of escalated/therapeutic LMWH (1mg/kg/subcutaneously every 12 hours) remains unclear. This study involves a retrospective analysis of the potential role of an escalated dose of LMWH to alter the hyper-inflammatory state in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compared outcomes to those patients who received a low dose (40-60 mg, subcutaneously every day) of LMWH. Methods:Adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal (NP) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) who were hospitalized from March 1st to April 20, 2020, were included. They were divided into two cohorts based on the dose of LMWH; cohort 1 (40-60 mg, subcutaneously every day) and cohort 2 (1mg/kg/subcutaneously every 12 hours). Categorical variables were compared by conducting a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test while continuous ones were compared by conducting a median two-sample test. Results:The median values of PT, PTT, INR, CRPmax, LDHmax, ferritinmax, D-dimermax, are mentioned in table 1. Incidence of thrombotic events (deep venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism) was higher in cohort 1 (n=3, 4.8%) compared to cohort 2 (n=1, 2.6%). Cohort 2 had a higher number of patients who received ICU level of care (n=24) compared to the 6 patients in cohort 1. Out of 24 patients in cohort 2, 18 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. The median value of length of stay in the hospital (10.0 days) and all-cause mortality (31.6 %) were higher in cohort 2 as compared to cohort 1 (p<0.05). Discussion:Infections have the ability to trigger systemic inflammation [6]. The interplay between the host system and its response to foreign pathogens can lead to the activation of coagulation pathways. SARS-CoV-2 entry via ACE-2 receptors on endothelial cells is likely associated with endothelial dysfunction. This endotheliopathy plays a significant role in COVID-19 related microcirculatory changes [7]. Severe COVID-19, a hyperinflammatory state, is marked by elevated inflammatory markers including D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6, LDH, and CRP levels. Elevated D-dimer levels have been correlated with disease severity and poor outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [8]. The incidence of VTE and pulmonary embolism among COVID-19 ICU patients was higher in a study from France [9]. The patient population who received the escalated dose of LMWH in our study either had SIC score ≥ 4 or D-dimer ≥ 2.2 (FEU). This data indicated that the median value of peak inflammatory markers in cohort 1 was lower (p<0.05) when compared to cohort 2. Patients in cohort 2 were sicker than cohort 1, as evidenced by a statistically significant longer length of hospital stay and a higher rate of ICU admission. However, the potential dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of LMWH was not observed. Additional studies evaluating comorbidities and disease severity in both cohorts may yield different results. Conclusion:Aside from the known anticoagulant benefit of LMWH, there was no additional anti-inflammatory role with higher doses (1mg/kg/subcutaneously every 12 hours) of LMWH.

This has led to the prevailing view that this disease is the result of weak immune responses that cannot control the fungus. However, increasingly, clinical and experimental studies have revealed that the host immune response can contribute to cryptococcal pathogenesis, including the recent study of L. M. Neal et al. (mBio 8:e01415-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01415-17) that reports that CD4(+) T cells mediate tissue damage in experimental murine cryptococcosis. This finding has fundamental implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of cryptococcal disease; it helps explain why immunotherapy has been largely unsuccessful in treatment and provides insight into the paradoxical observation that HIV-associated cryptococcosis may have a better prognosis than cryptococcosis in those with no known immune impairment. The demonstration that host-mediated damage can drive cryptococcal disease provides proof of concept that the parabola put forth in the damage-response framework has the flexibility to depict complex and changing outcomes of host-microbe interaction.","Pirofski, Liise-anne; Casadevall, Arturo",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29233901/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02063-17,668

Recently, use of melatonin, a naturally occurring tryptophan-derivative synthesized in the pineal gland and immune cells, has been suggested as an early treatment option for COVID-19. Melatonin has known anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and protective antioxidant mechanisms that may attenuate the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. The objective of the present narrative review is to discuss the use of melatonin as an early treatment option on the first day of diagnosis for COVID-19. METHODS: The MeSH terms “COVID-19” and “viral diseases” were manually searched on PubMed and relevant articles were included. RESULTS: Results showed that melatonin acts to reduce reactive-oxygen-species mediated damage, cytokine-induced inflammation, and lymphopenia in viral diseases similar to COVID-19.

Intervening on lifestyle behaviors is challenging due to the fact that the consequences associated with unhealthy behaviors are temporally distant and probabilistic, and the aversive functions of covert stimuli may interfere with people’s engagement in healthy, preventative behaviors. This article explores the role of relational framing in the promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviors and summarizes research supporting the use of acceptance and commitment training (ACT) as a framework for prevention and intervention. We explore how ACT alters the context in which rigid patterns of rule following occur. ACT loosens the literal functions of stimuli so that experiential-avoidance behaviors are weakened, and healthy, values-consistent behaviors are strengthened. We propose culture-wide interventions inspired by contextual behavior science so that healthier societies can be cultivated.","Rehfeldt, Ruth Anne; Tyndall, Ian",Behav Anal Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34306541/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-021-00592-6,668

The evolution of such antibodies during convalescence from COVID-19 is largely unknown. We developed novel assays to measure Fc-dependent antibody functions against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-expressing cells in serial samples from a cohort of 53 subjects primarily with mild-moderate COVID-19, out to a maximum of 149 days post-infection. We found that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging dimeric Fc{gamma}RIIa and Fc{gamma}RIIIa decayed linearly over time. S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declined linearly as well, in line with the decay of S-specific IgG. Although there was significant decay in S-specific plasma ADCC and ADP activity, they remained readily detectable by all assays in 94% of our cohort at the last timepoint studied, in contrast with neutralisation activity which was only detectable in 70% of our cohort by the last timepoint. Our results suggest that Fc effector functions such as ADCC and ADP could contribute to the durability of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, particularly late in convalescence when neutralising antibodies have waned. Understanding the protective potential of antibody Fc effector functions is critical for defining the durability of immunity generated by infection or vaccination.","Lee, W. S.; Selva, K.

Designing optimal community responses (social distancing, vaccination) is dependent on the stage of the disease progression, discovery of asymptomatic individuals, changes in virulence of the pathogen, and current levels of herd immunity. Community strategies may have severe and undesirable social and economic side effects. Modeling is the only available scientific approach to develop effective strategies that can minimize these unwanted side effects while retaining the effectiveness of the interventions. METHODS: : We extended the agent-based model, SpatioTemporal Human Activity Model (STHAM), for simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. RESULTS: : Here we present preliminary STHAM simulation results that reproduce the overall trends observed in the Wasatch Front (Utah, United States of America) for the general population. The results presented here clearly indicate that human activity patterns are important in predicting the rate of infection for different demographic groups in the population.

Aims: This study assessed the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese students during the COVID-19 pandemic and explored potential moderating factors. Methods: We searched English and Chinese databases using pertinent keywords for articles published and unpublished, up until November 2020. The estimate of the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression was conducted through a random-effects model. Results: A total of 31 cross-sectional studies were included. The overall prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese students during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.0% (95% CI [20.0–29.0%]) and 22.0% (95% CI [18.0–27.0%]) respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that Chinese middle school students were at heightened risk of anxiety, while university students were at heightened risk of depression. Students who lived in higher-risk areas presented severe anxiety and depression, especially during the late period of the COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusions: Overall, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a high prevalence of anxiety in Chinese students and a high prevalence of depression among Chinese students in high-risk areas. Therefore, comprehensive and targeted psychological interventions should be developed to address the mental health of students in different grades, especially in high-risk areas and during the late period of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Yaoyao; Bao, Xiuqin; Yan, Jiaxin; Miao, Hualing; Guo, Cheng",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.697642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485228/,668

674138,A novel biparatopic antibody-ACE2 fusion that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection: implications for therapy,2020-06-15,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the three-dimensional structures of several of the replicase/transcriptase components of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the non-structural proteins (Nsps), have been determined. However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARS-unique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389–652 (“SUD(core)”) of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD(core) forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD(core) as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy- as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of G-quadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5–6 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 3′-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell's response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.","Tan, Jinzhi; Vonrhein, Clemens; Smart, Oliver S.; Bricogne, Gerard; Bollati, Michela; Kusov, Yuri; Hansen, Guido; Mesters, Jeroen R.; Schmidt, Christian L.; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19436709/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000428,668

Being male, having completed more dental coursework, and perceiving a smoother transition were associated with lower PSS scores; more concern about academic progress was associated with higher PSS. Faculty support mediated the relationship between a smoothness of transition and concern about academic progress and PSS scores CONCLUSION: Stress caused by the pandemic may be alleviated by smoother transition and good faculty support.","Klaassen, Hannah; Ashida, Sato; Comnick, Carissa L.; Xie, Xian Jin; Smith, Becky M.; Tabrizi, Maryam; Arsenault, Karin; Capin, Oriana R.; Scully, Allison C.; da Mata, Cristiane; Soto, Annetty P.; Dias Ribeiro, Ana Paula; Prince, David; Christensen, Angela; Giner‐Tarrida, Lluís; Satorres Nieto, Marta; León, Soraya; Gambetta‐Tessini, Karla; Santos, Mateus B.

675207,Massive application of the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test: simulation of its effect on the evolution of the epidemic in Spain,2020-09-29,"The antiviral protein kinase R (PKR) is an important host restriction factor, which poxviruses must overcome to productively infect host cells. To inhibit PKR, many poxviruses encode a pseudosubstrate mimic of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), designated K3 in vaccinia virus. Although the interaction between PKR and eIF2α is highly conserved, some K3 orthologs from host-restricted poxviruses were previously shown to inhibit PKR in a species-specific manner. To better define this host range function, we compared the sensitivity of PKR from 17 mammals to inhibition by K3 orthologs from closely related orthopoxviruses, a genus with a generally broader host range. The K3 orthologs showed species-specific inhibition of PKR and exhibited three distinct inhibition profiles. In some cases, PKR from closely related species showed dramatic differences in their sensitivity to K3 orthologs. Vaccinia virus expressing the camelpox virus K3 ortholog replicated more than three orders of magnitude better in human and sheep cells than a virus expressing vaccinia virus K3, but both viruses replicated comparably well in cow cells. Strikingly, in site-directed mutagenesis experiments between the variola virus and camelpox virus K3 orthologs, we found that different amino acid combinations were necessary to mediate improved or diminished inhibition of PKR derived from different host species. Because there is likely a limited number of possible variations in PKR that affect K3-interactions but still maintain PKR/eIF2α interactions, it is possible that by chance PKR from some potential new hosts may be susceptible to K3-mediated inhibition from a virus it has never previously encountered. We conclude that neither the sensitivity of host proteins to virus inhibition nor the effectiveness of viral immune antagonists can be inferred from their phylogenetic relatedness but must be experimentally determined.","Park, Chorong; Peng, Chen; Rahman, M.

We develop a multiplex network approach to model how adherence to health-protective behaviours that impact COVID-19 spread are shaped by perceived risks and resulting community norms. We focus on three synergistic dynamics governing individual behavioural choices: (i) social construction of concern, (ii) awareness of disease incidence, and (iii) reassurance by lack of disease. We show why policies enacted early or broadly can cause communities to become reassured and therefore unwilling to maintain or adopt actions. Public health policies for which success relies on collective action should therefore exploit the behaviourally receptive phase; the period between the generation of sufficient concern to foster adoption of novel actions and the relaxation of adherence driven by reassurance fostered by avoidance of negative outcomes over time.","Silk, M.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories. Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls. Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments. Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out. RESULTS: The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. Overall, 446 different patients’ WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities. Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer. Actions taken by oncologists are also reported. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the WhatsApp instant messaging system has been occasionally used in other medical settings with controversial results. In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.","Gebbia, Vittorio; Piazza, Dario; Valerio, Maria Rosaria; Borsellino, Nicolò; Firenze, Alberto",JCO Glob Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412811/,668

As of 30th June 2020, over 6,190 cases had been reported with a case fatality of 3.2%. Previous Coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of Cardiovascular disease. For COVID-19, however, there has been no direct reference to potential long-term cardiovascular effects, especially in Africa where atherosclerotic diseases are an emerging challenge. This article, therefore, aims at describing possible long-term effects on the burden of atherosclerotic disease among Kenyans. Available data indicate that COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease share pathomechanisms and risk factors which include ACE2 receptor invasion and renin-angiotensin system signaling, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Further, SAR-COV-2 infection causes dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, kidney, and liver disease. These mechanisms and diseases constitute risk factors for the initiation, progression, and complications of atherosclerosis. In Kenya, the common risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 comprising Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity, Cigarette Smoking, Respiratory Tract Infections, Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and Renal disease are not uncommon and continue to increase. In essence, the prevalence of the common risk factors/comorbidities, between COVID-19 and CVD occurrence of ACE2 receptors on the endothelium, and hence pathomechanisms of SARS-COV-2 infection imply that COVID-19 may increase the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Kenya. All due care should be taken, to prevent and effectively manage the disease, to avert an imminent epidemic of atherosclerotic disease.","Ogeng’o, Julius; Karau, Paul Bundi; Misiani, Musa; Cheruiyot, Isaac; Olabu, Beda; Kariuki, Brian Ngure",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282075/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.24762,668

METHODS: A group of behavioural and social scientists advising the UK government on COVID‐19 contributed to the analysis and writing of advice through the Government Office for Science. The question was as follows: What are the options for increasing adherence to social distancing (staying at home except for essential journeys and work) and shielding vulnerable people (keeping them at home and away from others)? This was prior to social distancing legislation being implemented. The first two authors produced a draft, based on analysis of the current government guidance and the application of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework to identify and evaluate the options. RESULTS: For promoting social distancing, 10 options were identified for improving adherence. They covered improvements in ways of achieving the BCW intervention types of education, persuasion, incentivization, and coercion. For promoting shielding of vulnerable people, four options were identified covering the BCW intervention types of incentivization, coercion, and enablement. CONCLUSIONS: Responding to policymakers very rapidly as has been necessary during the COVID‐19 pandemic can be facilitated by using a framework to structure the thinking and reporting of multidisciplinary academics and policymakers.","Michie, Susan; West, Robert; Rogers, M.

Yet the epidemiology of human fusariosis is still cloudy due to the rapidly evolving taxonomy. The Mass Spectrometry Identification database (MSI) has been developed since 2017 in order to allow a fast, accurate and free-access identification of fungi by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization—time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Taking advantage of the MSI database user network, we aim to study the species distribution of Fusarium spp. isolates in an international multicenter prospective study. This study also allowed the assessment of the abilities of miscellaneous techniques to identify Fusarium isolates at the species level. The identification was performed by PCR-sequencing and phylogenic-tree approach. Both methods are used as gold standard for the evaluation of mass spectrometry. Identification at the species complex was satisfactory for all the tested methods. However, identification at the species level was more challenging and only 32% of the isolates were correctly identified with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) DNA database, 20% with the Bruker MS database and 43% with the two MSI databases. Improvement of the mass spectrometry database is still needed to enable precise identification at the species level of any Fusarium isolates encountered either in human pathology or in the environment.","Normand, Anne-Cécile; Imbert, Sébastien; Brun, Sophie; Al-Hatmi, Abdullah M.

This article details the Collaborative Systems of Care (CSC) program, a novel, nurse-led care coordination program identifying and connecting veterans presenting for care in a Federally Qualified Health Center to VA behavioral health and other services based upon the veteran’s preferences and eligibility. The CSC program systematically identifies veteran patients, screens for common behavioral health issues, explores VA eligibility for interested veterans, and facilitates coordination with VA to improve healthcare access. While the present program focuses on behavioral health, there is a unique emphasis on assisting veterans with the eligibility and enrollment process and coordinating additional care tailored to the patient. As VA expands its presence in community care, opportunities for VA-community care coordination will increase, making the development and implementation of such interventions important.","Howren, M.

They have rightfully prioritised reducing the spread of the virus through social distancing interventions. However, shuttered business and widespread restrictions on travel and mobility have led to an economic collapse with increasing uncertainty of how quickly recovery will be achieved. METHODS: The authors carried out a review of publicly available information on the economic intervention’s countries have put in place to ameliorate the impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: The strategies and scale of economic interventions have been broad, ranging from 2.5% to a reported 50% of Gross Domestic Product. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions and restart economies in different ways. There is therefore evolving, real-world data that should be used dynamically by governments and policymakers. The strategies on restarting the economy must be balanced against the uncertainty of a possible second wave of COVID-19. A nuanced approach to easing restrictions needs to take into account not only immediate risk to life but longer-term risks of widening inequalities and falling life expectancy.","Danielli, Shaun; Patria, Raman; Donnelly, Patrice; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",J Public Health (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657341/,668

In this study, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect containment-related behaviour in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this relationship is mediated by political trust, preference for saving the economy or for saving lives. The data were collected at two time points, at the beginning of the epidemic and after the state of emergency was introduced. The sample consisted of 790 adults from Serbia (349 at time 1 and 441 at time 2), of which around 60% were female, with a mean age of around 33. The results indicate that holding more conspiracy beliefs is related to less adherence to containment-related behaviour, both directly and indirectly, via decreased political trust. Preference for saving lives has a direct effect on containment-related behaviour, while preference for saving economy plays no important role in this relationship, although it has a negative zero-order association with containment-related behaviour. The findings are interpreted in light of the importance of governmental pandemic management for containing, i.e. preventing the spread of infectious diseases.","Karić, Tijana; Međedović, Janko",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531725/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110697; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921000726?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886921000726,668

Specifically it looked at how Covid-19 pandemic affected programming for obstetric fistula repair and characterized participants of the fistula camp held in November to December 2020 at one of the repair centers. A review of the dataset and surgical log sheets for the camp and national obstetric fistula dataset was conducted. Variables of interest were extracted onto an excel spreadsheet and analyzed for frequencies and proportions. Data were presented in charts, tables and narratives. The study noted that Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected performance of fistula repairs greatly with only 25 women repaired in 2020 as compared to 313 in 2019. Ninety women were called to come for repairs but 52 did not manage to attend due to reasons related to the restriction of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Two thirds of those women suffered from urinary incontinence while the other third had fecal incontinence. The successful repair rate was 92%.

683858,Predictors of severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 reinfection,2021-02-12,"Infectious diseases continue to inflict a high global disease burden. The consensus is that vaccination is the most effective option against infectious diseases. Oral vaccines have unique advantages in the prevention of global pandemics due to their ease of use, high compliance, low cost, and the ability to induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. However, challenges of adapting vaccines for oral administration remain significant. Foremost among these is enzymatic and pH-dependent degradation of antigens in the stomach and intestines, the low permeability of mucus barrier, the nonspecific uptake of antigens at the intestinal mucosal site, and the immune suppression result from the elusive immune tolerance mechanisms. Innovative delivery techniques promise great potential for improving the flexibility and efficiency of oral vaccines. A better understanding of the delivery approaches and the immunological mechanisms of oral vaccine delivery systems may provide new scientific insight and tools for developing the next-generation oral vaccine. Here, an overview of the advanced technologies in the field of oral vaccination is proposed, including mucus-penetrating nanoparticle (NP), mucoadhesive delivery vehicles, targeting antigen-presenting cell (APC) nanocarriers and enhanced paracellular delivery strategies. Meanwhile, the mechanisms of delivery vectors interact with mucosal barriers are discussed.","Dong Zhang, Yuan; Li, Man; Sheng Du, Guang; Yan Chen, Xiao; Sun, Xun",Advanced drug delivery reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411689/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2021.113928,668

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II genes are essential for the immune defence against pathogens from intracellular (e.g. viruses) and extracellular (e.g. helminths) origins, respectively. Serosurvey studies in Namibian cheetahs (Acinonyx juabuts) revealed higher exposure to viral pathogens in individuals from north-central than east-central regions. Here we examined whether the observed differences in exposure to viruses influence the patterns of genetic variation and differentiation at MHC loci in 88 free-ranging Namibian cheetahs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genetic variation at MHC I and II loci was assessed through single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequencing. While the overall allelic diversity did not differ, we observed a high genetic differentiation at MHC class I loci between cheetahs from north-central and east-central Namibia. No such differentiation in MHC class II and neutral markers were found. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that MHC class I variation mirrors the variation in selection pressure imposed by viruses in free-ranging cheetahs across Namibian farmland. This is of high significance for future management and conservation programs of this species.","Castro-Prieto, Aines; Wachter, Bettina; Melzheimer, Joerg; Thalwitzer, Susanne; Hofer, Heribert; Sommer, Simone",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23145096/,668

The coypu Myocastor coypus, introduced from South America for fur farms, has become one of the most invasive rodents in Europe. Introduced coypus may affect crop productions, as well as natural vegetation and the breeding success of wading birds. In this study, we examined activity data collected through intensive camera-trapping in three Italian areas, including two natural areas in Northern and Central Italy, and a suburban area in Central Italy. Coypus were mostly diurnal in areas characterised by low predator pressure and, at night, they are mostly active in bright moonlight. Conversely, where predators, human pressure or numerical control programmes are present, coypus remarkably shift their behaviour towards crepuscular and night hours. In these last areas, nocturnal activity increased as moonlight decreased, possibly to reduce predation risk or encounters with humans. Where winter temperature are low, diurnal habits may have developed as a physiological adaptation and a strategy to preserve energy, potentially achieving a cost/effective thermal balance.

A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that oral administration of nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for five days reduced the duration of clinical symptoms and reduced viral shedding compared to placebo in persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The same study also suggested a potential benefit for subjects with influenza-like illness who did not have influenza or other documented respiratory viral infection. From a chemical perspective, nitazoxanide is the scaffold for a new class of drugs called thiazolides. These small-molecule drugs target host-regulated processes involved in viral replication. Nitazoxanide is orally bioavailable and safe with extensive post-marketing experience involving more than 75 million adults and children. A new dosage formulation of nitazoxanide is presently undergoing global Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of influenza. Nitazoxanide inhibits a broad range of influenza A and B viruses including influenza A(pH1N1) and the avian A(H7N9) as well as viruses that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors. It is synergistic with neuraminidase inhibitors, and combination therapy with oseltamivir is being studied in humans as part of ongoing Phase 3 clinical development. Nitazoxanide also inhibits the replication of a broad range of other RNA and DNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus in cell culture assays. Clinical trials have indicated a potential role for thiazolides in treating rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis and chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C.

688085,The flexibility of ACE2 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020-11-13,"Background: While there was a lack of pharmacological interventions proven to be effective in early, outpatient settings for COVID-19, in a prospective, open-label observational study (pre-AndroCoV Trial) the use of nitazoxanide, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated similar effects, and apparent improvement of outcomes compared to untreated patients. The unexpected apparent positive results led to ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis with two control-groups. Materials and methods: Active group (AG) consisted of mild-to-moderate early stage COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Pre AndroCoV-Trial, treated with nitazoxanide ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine in selected cases, in association with azithromycin. Vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants, when clinically recommended. Control Group 1 (CG1) consisted of a retrospectively obtained group of untreated patients from the same population as those from the Pre-AndroCoV Trial, and Control Group 2 (CG2) resulted from a precise prediction of clinical outcomes, based on a thorough and structured review of articles indexed in PubMed and MEDLINE and statements by official government agencies and specific medical societies. For both CGs, patients were matched for proportion between sex, age, obesity and other comorbidities. Results: Compared to CG1 and CG2, AG showed a reduction of 31.5 to 36.5% in viral shedding (p < 0.0001), 70 to 85% and 70 to 73% in duration of COVID-19 clinical symptoms when including and not including anosmia and ageusia, respectively ((p < 0.0001 for both), and 100% in respiratory complications through the parameters of the Brescia COVID-19 Respiratory Scale (p < 0.0001). For every 1,000 confirmed cases for COVID-19, a minimum of 140 patients were prevented from hospitalization (p < 0.0001), 50 from mechanical ventilation, and five deaths, when comparing to age-, sex- and comorbidity-matched non-treated patients with similar initial disease severity at the moment of diagnosis. Conclusion: Apparent benefits of the combination between early detection and early pharmacological approaches for COVID-19 demonstrated to be consistent when when compared to different control groups of untreated patients. The potential benefits could allow a large number of patients prevented from hospitalizations, deaths and persistent symptoms after COVID-19 remission. The potential impact on COVID-19 disease course and numbers of negative outcomes and the well-established safety profile of the drugs proposed by the Pre-AndroCoV Trial led to ethical questions regarding the conduction of further placebo control randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for early COVID-19. Early pharmacological approaches including azithromycin in combination with any of the options between nitazoxanide, ivermectin or optionally hydroxychloroquine should be considered for those diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting less than seven days of symptoms. Of the three drugs, we opted for nitazoxanide, due to more extensive demonstration of in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity, proven efficacy against other viruses in humans, and steadier safety profile.","Cadegiani, F.

In this review, we explore the likely mechanisms for heparin failure with particular relevance to COVID-19. We also explore the role of anti-Xa assays and global hemostatic tests in this context. The current controversy of dosing heparin in this disease is detailed with some possible mechanistic reasons for anticoagulant failure.

To date, there are rapidly spreading new “variants of concern” of SARS-CoV-2, the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the South African (B.1.351) or Brasilian (P.1) variant. All of them contain multiple mutations in the ACE2 receptor recognition site of the spike protein, compared to the original Wuhan sequence, which is of great concern, because of their potential for immune escape. Here we report on the efficacy of common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) to block protein-protein interaction of spike S1 to the human ACE2 cell surface receptor. This could be shown for the original spike D614, but also for its mutant forms (D614G, N501Y, and mix of K417N, E484K, N501Y) in human HEK293-hACE2 kidney and A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 lung cells. High molecular weight compounds in the water-based extract account for this effect. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles was efficiently prevented by the extract and so was virus-triggered pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 secretion. Modern herbal monographs consider the usage of this medicinal plant as safe. Thus, the in vitro results reported here should encourage further research on the clinical relevance and applicability of the extract as prevention strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Significance statement SARS-CoV-2 is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. This might eventually lead the virus into evading existing therapeutic and prophylactic approaches aimed at the viral spike. We found effective inhibition of protein-protein interaction between the human virus cell entry receptor ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike, including five relevant mutations, by water-based common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) extracts. This was shown in vitro using human kidney (HEK293) and lung (A549) cells, overexpressing the ACE2 and ACE2/TMPRSS2 protein, respectively. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus was efficiently prevented by the extract. The results deserve more in-depth analysis of dandelions’ effectiveness in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and now require confirmatory clinical evidence.","Tran, Hoai Thi Thu; Le, Nguyen Phan Khoi; Gigl, Michael; Dawid, Corinna; Lamy, Evelyn",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.435959,668

The spike glycoprotein of IBV is essential for host cell attachment, neutralization, and is involved in the induction of protective immunity. Previously obtained sequence data of the spike gene of IBV QX-like and Massachusetts strains were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. FINDINGS: On analysis of potential phosphorylation sites, the Ser542 and Ser563 sites were not present in Massachusetts strains, while QX-like isolates did not have the Ser534 site. Massachusetts and QX-like strains showed different cleavage site motifs. The N-glycosylation sites ASN-XAA-SER/THR-55, 147, 200 and 545 were additionally present in QX-like strains. The leucine-rich repeat regions in Massachusetts strains consisted of stretches of 63 to 69 amino acids, while in the QX-like strains they contained 59 amino acids in length. An additional palmitoylation site was observed in CK/SWE/082066/2010 a QX-like strain. Primary structure data showed difference in the physical properties and hydrophobic nature of both genotypes. The comparison of secondary structures revealed no new structural domains in the genotypic variants. The phylogenetic analyses based on avian and mammalian coronaviruses showed the analysed IBV as closely related to turkey coronaviruses and distantly related to thrush and munia coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that spike glycoprotein of the Massachusetts and the QX-like variants of IBV are molecularly distinct and that this may reflect in differences in the behavior of these viruses in vivo.","Abro, Shahid Hussain; Ullman, Karin; Belák, Sándor; Baule, Claudia",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992336/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-211,668

However, little is known about this practice, including potential motivating factors. OBJECTIVE: To examine individual reasons for accessing medication abortion through an online telemedicine service as well as associations between state- and county-level factors and the rate of requests. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cross-sectional study examined all requests for self-managed medication abortion through an online consultation form available from Aid Access, a telemedicine service in the US, between March 20, 2018, and March 20, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Individual-level reasons for accessing the telemedicine service were examined as well as the rate of requests per 100 000 women of reproductive age by state. Zip code data provided by individuals making requests were used to examine county-level factors hypothesized to be associated with increased demand for self-managed abortion: distance to a clinic (calculated using location data for US abortion clinics) and the population proportion identifying as a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, living below the federal poverty level, and having broadband internet access (calculated using census data). RESULTS: During the 2-year study period, 57 506 individuals in 2458 counties in 50 states requested self-managed medication abortion; 52.1% were aged 20 to 29 years (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [6.7] years), 50.0% had children, and 99.9% were 10 weeks’ pregnant or less. The most common reasons cited by individuals making requests were the inability to afford in-clinic care (73.5%), privacy (49.3%), and clinic distance (40.4%). States with the highest rate of requests were Louisiana (202.7 per 100 000 women) and Mississippi (199.9 per 100 000 women). At the county level, an increase of 1 SD (47 miles) in distance to the nearest clinic was significantly associated with a 41% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31-1.51; P < .001), and a 10% increase in the population living below the federal poverty level was significantly associated with a 20% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13-1.28; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, clinic access barriers were the most commonly cited reason for requesting self-managed medication abortion using an online telemedicine service. At the county level, distance to an abortion clinic and living below the federal poverty level were associated with a higher rate of requests. State and federal legislation could address these access barriers.","Aiken, Abigail R.
