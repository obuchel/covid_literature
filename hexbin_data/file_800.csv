Many companies are moving towards crowdsourcing, and have already adopted Agile Software Development (ASD). However, CSSD differs from ASD in many ways due to its distributed nature. Although there is little research on the integration of these two approaches, whereas at the same time the combination of the two is advocated by some. It is deemed necessary to identify and resolve the issues emerged while integrating CSSD and ASD. This study hence intends to explore the issues emerged as a result of integrating agile and CSSD and propose a Crowd Agile model that will help in effective software development.","Qayyum, Shamaila; Imtiaz, Salma; Khan, Huma Hayyat",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming - Workshops,800,4

Teleworking practices and policies could play a significant and essential role of any business continuity plan in time of risk that prohibits employees from performing their working tasks at their regular workplace or offices. Hence, telework gives those employees the opportunity to perform their work tasks remotely and keep the organization operational. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on promoting telework practices. This study discusses the transition to telework during the COVID‐19 pandemic and the continuity of teleworking practices after the pandemic. Furthermore, the study discusses what elements and interventions that are necessary to maximize the potential gains for more widespread telework for employers and employees. Adopting telework in this circumstance can reduce the negative impact of the pandemic and be a mitigating measure for the economy and inequality. This research is important because it analyses the benefits of implementing telework practices in a time of risk.","Abulibdeh, Ammar",,800,1

We investigated associations between blood groups and circulating inflammation-related molecules in 3537 non-Hispanic white participants selected from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Whole-genome scans were used to infer blood types for 12 common antigen systems based on well-characterized single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Serum levels of 96 biomarkers were measured on multiplex fluorescent bead-based panels. We estimated marker associations with blood type using weighted linear or logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and principal components of population substructure. Bonferroni correction was used to control for multiple comparisons, with two-sided p values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Among the 1152 associations tested, 10 were statistically significant. Duffy blood type was associated with levels of CXCL6/GCP2, CXCL5/ENA78, CCL11/EOTAXIN, CXCL1/GRO, CCL2/MCP1, CCL13/MCP4, and CCL17/TARC, whereas ABO blood type was associated with levels of sVEGFR2, sVEGFR3, and sGP130. Post hoc pairwise t-tests showed that individuals with type Fy(a+b−) had the lowest mean levels of all Duffy-associated markers, while individuals with type A blood had the lowest mean levels of all ABO-associated markers.

The inflammatory conditions due to TBI are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Taurine has been reported to have immune-modulatory effects. Thus, the aim of this study was to survey the effect of taurine supplementation in TBI patients. METHODS: In this study, 32 patients with TBI were randomized into two groups. The treatment group received 30 mg/kg/day of taurine in addition to the Standard Entera Meal and the control group received Standard Entera Meal for 14 days. Prior to and following the intervention, the patients were investigated in terms of serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, hs-CRP and TNF-α as well as APACHEII, SOFA and NUTRIC scores, Glasgow coma scale and weight. In addition, the length of Intensive Care Unit stay, days of dependence on ventilator and 30-day mortality were studied. SPSS software (version 13.0) was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Taurine significantly decreased the serum levels of IL-6 (p = 0.04) and marginally APACHEII score (p = 0.05). In addition, weight loss was significantly lower in taurine group (p = 0.03). Furthermore, taurine significantly increased the GCS (p = 0.03). The groups were not different significantly in terms of levels of IL-10, hs-CRP, and TNF-α, SOFA and NUTRIC scores, 30-day mortality, length of ICU stay and days of dependence on ventilator. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the present study, taurine supplementation can reduce the IL-6 levels as one of the important inflammatory markers in these patients; and enhances the clinical outcomes too.

Numerous published studies have compared online learning with traditional methods in pharmacy. However, no such studies have been published in pharmacy. This study's objective is to compare first-professional year student preferences for computer-based vs. traditional paper-and-pencil testing for a required social and administrative pharmacy class. METHODS All students enrolled in the class were invited to complete one brief survey at the end of the semester to determine their testing preference. RESULTS Of the 138 first-professional year students completing the survey, 79% (109 of 138) preferred computer-based testing, 9% had no preference, 6% (8 of 138) preferred paper-and-pencil testing, and the remainder (8 of 138) stated it depended on what was being tested. Ninety-one percent of students did not perceive the testing method to impact their grades. Students preferred computer-based testing over traditional paper-and-pencil as a convenient testing method (mean 4.73 vs. 3.4, P < .001), providing immediate feedback (mean 4.87 vs. 1.91, P < .001), and as a more effective testing method (mean 4.57 vs. 3.96, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS First-professional year students preferred computer-based over traditional paper-and-pencil testing for a social and administrative science class, with the method of testing not perceived to impact grade. This finding is timely, given the recent required transitioning of all pharmacy classes and subsequent testing to an online format due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic.","Franic, Duska M; Palmer, Russ; Fulford, Michael",Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning,800,27

This pilot study examined the feasibility of providing an in-person nutrition intervention for families at high risk of developing prediabetes or type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk-factors. METHODS Eligible families had at least one member with a non-communicable disease (NCD) or metabolic risk factor, fluency in English, willingness to attend all three educational sessions and complete questionnaires as a family unit. Sessions included didactic and experiential activities on food label reading, portion sizing, physical activity and modifiable lifestyle factors to reduce NCD risk. Demographics and fruit and vegetable screeners were collected from all participants at baseline and after completion of sessions. Families participated in focus groups to evaluate the program. RESULTS Twelve families (n=35;17 adults;18 children) were recruited from New York City. Participants self-identified as Asian, Hispanic or Black. Adults had a mean age of 40y, BMI of 32.29kg/m2, household income of $35,000-$49,000y, and 13 of 17 adult participants had college degrees. Children ranged from 1-17y. Based on focus group feedback, three sessions were acceptable, families reported enjoying interactive activities and group learning and requested child-friendly activities. They reported improved knowledge of food labels, strategies for grocery shopping, portion-sizing, and increased awareness of the links between diet quality and NCDs. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The study met recruitment goals within 4 months. The educational intervention was acceptable and may be scaled-up for future studies on NCD prevention, particularly prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.","Parekh, Niyati; Khalife, Gabrielle; Hellmers, Natalie; D'Eramo Melkus, Gail",The Diabetes educator,800,12

While the focus on developing smartphone-based contact tracing applications or apps has been on privacy concerns stemming from the use of such apps, an important question that has not received sufficient attention is: How reliable will such smartphone-based electronic contact tracing be? This is a technical question related to how two smartphones reliably register their mutual proximity. Here, we examine in detail the technical prerequisites required for effective smartphone-based contact tracing. The underlying mechanism that any contact tracing app relies on is called Neighbor Discovery (ND), which involves smartphones transmitting and scanning for Bluetooth signals to record their mutual presence whenever they are in close proximity. The hardware support and the software protocols used for ND in smartphones, however, were not designed for reliable contact tracing. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate how reliably can smartphones do contact tracing. Our results point towards the design of a wearable solution for contact tracing that can overcome the shortcomings of a smartphone-based solution to provide more reliable and accurate contact tracing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that quantifies, both, the suitability and also the drawbacks of smartphone-based contact tracing. Further, our results can be used to parameterize a ND protocol to maximize the reliability of any contact tracing app that uses it.","Kindt, Philipp H.; Chakraborty, Trinad; Chakraborty, Samarjit",,800,20

This is a secondary analysis of patient records in a confined area of eastern England, covering persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through end May 2020, including dates of death and residence area. We obtained residence area data on air quality, deprivation levels, care home bed capacity, age distribution, rurality, access to employment centers, and population density. We considered these covariates as risk factors for excess cases and excess deaths in the 28 days after confirmation of positive Covid status relative to the overall case load and death recorded for the study area as a whole. We used the conditional autoregressive Besag-York-Mollie model to investigate the spatial dependency of cases and deaths allowing for a Poisson error structure. Structural equation models were applied to clarify relationships between predictors and outcomes. Excess case counts or excess deaths were both predicted by the percentage of population age 65 years, care home bed capacity and less rurality: older population and more urban areas saw excess cases. Greater deprivation did not correlate with excess case counts but was significantly linked to higher mortality rates after infection. Neither excess cases nor excess deaths were predicted by population density, travel time to local employment centers, or air quality indicators. Only 66% of mortality was explained by locally high case counts. Higher deprivation clearly linked to higher COVID-19 mortality separate from wider community prevalence and other spatial risk factors.","Brainard, Julii; Rushton, Steve; Winters, Tim; Hunter, Paul R",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,800,14

With the declaration of a global emergency, a test to rapidly detect the SARS-CoV-2 was developed to ensure swift isolation of infected persons to prevent spread of disease. Currently, the gold standard for test is Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR); however, patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 can sometimes have multiple negative tests. We discuss a patient under investigation (PUI) who had classic findings of COVID-19 but repeatedly tested negative from nasopharyngeal swabs until a fifth sample obtained from a deep suctioning was tested.","Wiseman, Jessica; D'Amico, Timothy A.; Zawadzka, Sabina; Anyimadu, Henry",Respir Med Case Rep,800,14
