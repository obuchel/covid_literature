2562,Operationalising resilience in longitudinal studies: a systematic review of methodological approaches,2016-08-08,"Over the life course, we are invariably faced with some form of adversity. The process of positively adapting to adverse events is known as ‘resilience’. Despite the acknowledgement of 2 common components of resilience, that is, adversity and positive adaptation, no consensus operational definition has been agreed. Resilience operationalisations have been reviewed in a cross-sectional context; however, a review of longitudinal methods of operationalising resilience has not been conducted. The present study conducts a systematic review across Scopus and Web of Science capturing studies of ageing that posited operational definitions of resilience in longitudinal studies of ageing. Thirty-six studies met inclusion criteria. Non-acute events, for example, cancer, were the most common form of adversity identified and psychological components, for example, the absence of depression, the most common forms of positive adaptation. Of the included studies, 4 used psychometrically driven methods, that is, repeated administration of established resilience metrics, 9 used definition-driven methods, that is, a priori establishment of resilience components and criteria, and 23 used data-driven methods, that is, techniques that identify resilient individuals using latent variable models. Acknowledging the strengths and limitations of each operationalisation is integral to the appropriate application of these methods to life course and longitudinal resilience research.","Cosco, T D; Kaushal, A; Hardy, R; Richards, M; Kuh, D; Stafford, M",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5256275/,361
5092,In Search of Global Health Justice: A Need to Reinvigorate Institutions and Make International Law,2015-06-26,"The current outbreak of Ebola virus infection in West Africa continues to spread. Several patients have now been treated in the United States and preparations are being made for more. Because of the strict isolation required for their care, questions have been raised about what diagnostic and therapeutic interventions should be available. I discuss the ethical challenges associated with caring for patients in strict isolation and personnel wearing bulky protective gear with reduced dexterity and flexibility, the limitations this may place on available treatments and the permissibility of consequent departures from the standards of care. Restricting access to some interventions such as surgery requiring an operating room, advanced imaging, etc. is reasonable due to concern for protecting other patients, visitors and staff. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a special case and the implications for withholding this intervention in situations where it may be desired is discussed, especially with respect to those patients who have suspected, but not proven, infection. These same restrictions are also considered under conditions where there are scarce resources and thus limited numbers of patients may receive care. While it is to be hoped that there is only limited and sporadic infection with Ebola virus in the US, careful thought must be given to the care of these patients under the unusual circumstances demanded by their isolation. I argue that an altered standard of care is reasonable and ethically acceptable under certain conditions.","Rosoff, Philip M.",HEC Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087695/,361
5866,Massive rhabdomyolysis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome caused by leptospirosis,2000,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiological features, course, and outcomes of critically ill pediatric patients with Influenza A (H1N1) virus. DESIGN: Prospective cohort of children in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) due to Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. SETTING: Seventeen medical-surgical PICUs in tertiary care hospital in Argentina. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients admitted to the PICUs with influenza A (H1N1) viral infection from 15 June to 31 July 2009. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 437 patients with acute lower respiratory infection in PICUs, 147 (34%) were diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) related to critical illness. The median age of these patients was 10 months (IQR 3–59). Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 117 (84%) on admission. The rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 80% (118 of 147 patients). Initial non-invasive ventilation failed in 19 of 22 attempts (86%). Mortality at 28 days was 39% (n = 57). Chronic complex conditions (CCCs), acute renal dysfunction (ARD) and ratio PaO(2)/FiO(2) at day 3 on MV were independently associated with a higher risk of mortality. The odds ratio (OR) for CCCs was 3.06, (CI 95% 1.36–6.84); OR for ARD, 3.38, (CI 95% 1.45–10.33); OR for PaO(2)/FiO(2), 4 (CI 95% 1.57–9.59). The administration of oseltamivir within 24 h after admission had a protective effect: OR 0.2 (CI 95% 0.07–0.54). CONCLUSIONS: In children with ARDS, H1N1 as an etiologic agent confers high mortality, and the presence of CCCs in such patients increases the risk of death.","Farias, Julio A.; Fernández, Analía; Monteverde, Ezequiel; Vidal, Nilda; Arias, Pilar; Montes, María J.; Rodríguez, Gabriela; Allasia, Mariela; Ratto, Maria E.; Jaén, Roxana; Meregalli, Claudia; Fiquepron, Karina; Calvo, Ana R.; Siaba, Alejandro; Albano, Lidia; Poterala, Rossana; Neira, Pablo; Esteban, Andrés",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095244/,361

13071,Medical Insurance Information Systems in China: Mixed Methods Study,2020-09-01,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a fundamental regulator of blood pressure and has emerged as an important player in the control of inflammatory processes. Accordingly, imbalance on RAS components either systemically or locally might trigger the development of inflammatory disorders by affecting immune cells. At the same time, alterations in the dopaminergic system have been consistently involved in the physiopathology of inflammatory disorders. Accordingly, the interaction between the RAS and the dopaminergic system has been studied in the context of inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), kidney, and intestine, where they exert antagonistic actions in the regulation of the immune system. In this review, we summarized, integrated, and discussed the cross talk of the dopaminergic system and the RAS in the regulation of inflammatory pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. We analyzed the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between both systems in the CNS and in systemic pathologies. Moreover, we also analyzed the impact of the commensal microbiota in the regulation of RAS and dopaminergic system and how it is involved in inflammatory disorders. Furthermore, we summarized the therapeutic approaches that have yielded positive results in preclinical or clinical studies regarding the use of drugs targeting the RAS and dopaminergic system for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Further understanding of the molecular and cellular regulation of the RAS-dopaminergic cross talk should allow the formulation of new therapies consisting of novel drugs and/or repurposing already existing drugs, alone or in combination, for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.","Campos, Javier; Pacheco, Rodrigo",Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7526080/,361

14699,Self-reported challenges to border screening of travelers for Ebola by district health workers in northern Ghana: An observational study,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease that may progress into, in the absence of proper treatment, severe liver damage. While the optimal pharmacotherapy for NAFLD remains uncertain and the adherence to lifestyle interventions is challenging, the use of herbal medicines such as traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) to manage the condition is common. The evidence about TCMs in the management of NAFLD is continuously developing through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This study aims to identify and evaluate the emerging evidence about the efficacy and safety of TCMs for NAFLD. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify RCTs which investigated TCMs in the management of NAFLD published in 6 electronic databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and China National Knowledge Infrastructure since inception to September 2020. RCTs comparing TCMs with no treatment, placebo, non-pharmacological and/or pharmacological interventions were included irrespective of language or blinding. The quality of reporting was evaluated using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement extensions for Chinese herbal medicine Formulas (CONSORT-CHM). Risk-of-bias for each study was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: A total of 53 RCTs involving 5997 participants with NAFLD were included in this review. Each included RCT tested a different TCMs giving a total of 53 TCMs identified in this study. Based on the evaluation of the RCT results, TCMs might have various beneficial effects such as improving TCM syndrome score, liver function, and body lipid profile. A range of non-serious, reversible adverse effects associated with the use of TCMs were also reported. However, no conclusion about the efficacy and safety of TCMs in NAFLD can be made. The quality of reporting was generally poor and the risks of bias was mostly uncertain in all trials. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence from RCTs that supported the effectiveness and safety of TCMs for NAFLD. However, no conclusive recommendations can be made due to the questionable quality of the RCTs. Improvement in the RCT protocol, the use of a larger sample size, a setting of multicenter, and a more focused approach in selecting TCMs are recommended for developing high quality evidence about the use of TCMs in managing NAFLD.","Liang, Zuanji; Chen, Xianwen; Shi, Junnan; Hu, Hao; Xue, Yan; Ung, Carolina Oi Lam",Chin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7802307/,361
15707,Validation of the Prevention Impacts Simulation Model (PRISM),2021-02-04,"Paragonimiasis is caused by zoonotic trematodes of Paragonimus spp., found in Asia, the Americas and Africa, particularly in tropical regions. These parasites have a complex, multi-host life cycle, with mammalian definitive hosts and larval stages cycling through two intermediate hosts (snails and freshwater decapod crustaceans). In Africa, paragonimiasis is particularly neglected, and remains the only human parasitic disease without a fully characterised life cycle. However paragonimiasis has potentially significant impacts on public health in Africa, and prevalence has likely been underestimated through under-reporting and misdiagnosis as tuberculosis due to a similar clinical presentation. We identified the need to synthesise current knowledge and map endemic foci for African Paragonimus spp. together with Poikilorchis congolensis, a rare, taxonomically distant trematode with a similar distribution and morphology. We present the first systematic review of the literature relating to African paragonimiasis, combined with mapping of all reported occurrences of Paragonimus spp. throughout Africa, from the 1910s to the present. In human surveys, numerous reports of significant recent transmission in Southeast Nigeria were uncovered, with high prevalence and intensity of infection. Overall prevalence was significantly higher for P. uterobilateralis compared to P. africanus across studies. The potential endemicity of P. africanus in Côte d’Ivoire is also reported. In freshwater crab intermediate hosts, differences in prevalence and intensity of either P. uterobilateralis or P. africanus were evident across genera and species, suggesting differences in susceptibility. Mapping showed temporal stability of endemic foci, with the majority of known occurrences of Paragonimus found in the rainforest zone of West and Central Africa, but with several outliers elsewhere on the continent. This suggests substantial under sampling and localised infection where potential host distributions overlap. Our review highlights the urgent need for increased sampling in active disease foci in Africa, particularly using molecular analysis to fully characterise Paragonimus species and their hosts.","Rabone, Muriel; Wiethase, Joris; Clark, Paul F.; Rollinson, David; Cumberlidge, Neil; Emery, Aidan M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7891758/,361
16482,A comparison of the different anthropometric indices for assessing malnutrition among older people in Turkey: a large population-based screening,2021-03-30,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of selective digestive tract decontamination (SDD) application three times daily (t.i.d.) compared to the standard four times daily (q.i.d.). Retrospective equivalence (combined non-inferiority and non-superiority design) study with a before-and-after design on a tertiary ICU in which the SDD frequency was reduced from q.i.d. to t.i.d. All patients with ICU admissions ≥72h and with ≥2 surveillance cultures collected on different dates were included in this study. We compared successful decontamination of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Furthermore, time to decontamination, ICU-acquired GNB bacteraemia and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups. In total 1958 ICU admissions (1236 q.i.d., 722 t.i.d). Decontamination was achieved during the first week of admission in 77% and 76% of patients receiving SDD q.i.d and t.i.d., respectively. Successful decontamination within 14 days (without consecutive acquisition of Gram-negative bacteria) was achieved in 69.3% of the admissions with q.i.d. versus 66.8% in t.i.d. SDD (p-value = 0.2519). The proportions of successful decontamination of GNB were equivalent in both groups (−0.025, 98% CI: −0.087; 0.037). There was no significant difference in time to decontamination between the two regimens (log-rank test p-value = 0.55). Incidence (episodes/1000 days) of ICU-acquired GNB bacteraemia was 0.9 in both groups, and OR for death at day 28 in the t.i.d. group compared to the q.i.d. group was 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.80–1.21). This study shows that a t.i.d. application regimen achieves similar outcomes to the standard q.i.d. regime, for both microbiological and clinical outcome measures.

Pain experienced by these patients significantly impacts their quality of life and ability to perform everyday tasks. Patients with Fabry disease suffer from peripheral neuropathy, sensory abnormalities, acute pain crises, and lifelong ongoing pain. Although treatment of pain through medication and enzyme replacement therapy exists, pain persists in many of these patients.

Still, it is unclear how pain and sensory abnormalities arise in patients with Fabry disease and how these can be targeted with therapeutics. Our knowledge is limited in part due to the lack of adequate preclinical models to study the disease. This review will detail the types of pain, sensory abnormalities, influence of demographics on pain, and current strategies to treat pain experienced by patients with Fabry disease. In addition, we discuss the current knowledge of Fabry pain pathogenesis and which aspects of the disease preclinical models accurately recapitulate.

17346,"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Status, Chronic Conditions, and Behavioral Risk Factors Among Prostate Cancer Survivors, United States, 2015",2021-04-22,"RNA 2′-O-methylation is widely distributed and plays important roles in various cellular processes. Mycoplasma genitalium RNase R (MgR), a prokaryotic member of the RNase II/RNB family, is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and is particularly sensitive to RNA 2′-O-methylation. However, how RNase R interacts with various RNA species and exhibits remarkable sensitivity to substrate 2′-O-methyl modifications remains elusive. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of MgR in apo form and in complex with various RNA substrates. The structural data together with extensive biochemical analysis quantitively illustrate MgR’s ribonuclease activity and significant sensitivity to RNA 2′-O-methylation. Comparison to its related homologs reveals an exquisite mechanism for the recognition and degradation of RNA substrates. Through structural and mutagenesis studies, we identified proline 277 to be responsible for the significant sensitivity of MgR to RNA 2′-O-methylation within the RNase II/RNB family. We also generated several MgR variants with modulated activities. Our work provides a mechanistic understanding of MgR activity that can be harnessed as a powerful RNA analytical tool that will open up a new venue for RNA 2′-O-methylations research in biological and clinical samples.","Abula, Abudureyimu; Li, Xiaona; Quan, Xing; Yang, Tingting; Liu, Yue; Guo, Hangtian; Li, Tinghan; Ji, Xiaoyun",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8096214/,361
17577,"The Burdens of Orthopedic Patients and the Value of the HEPAS Approach (Healthy Eating, Physical Activity, and Sleep Hygiene)",2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Efforts to study the biology of Plasmodium vivax liver stages, particularly the latent hypnozoites, have been hampered by the limited availability of P. vivax sporozoites. Anopheles stephensi is a major urban malaria vector in Goa and elsewhere in South Asia. Using P. vivax patient blood samples, a series of standard membrane-feeding experiments were performed with An. stephensi under the US NIH International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) for Malaria Evolution in South Asia (MESA). The goal was to understand the dynamics of parasite development in mosquitoes as well as the production of P. vivax sporozoites. To obtain a robust supply of P. vivax sporozoites, mosquito-rearing and mosquito membrane-feeding techniques were optimized, which are described here. METHODS: Membrane-feeding experiments were conducted using both wild and laboratory-colonized An. stephensi mosquitoes and patient-derived P. vivax collected at the Goa Medical College and Hospital. Parasite development to midgut oocysts and salivary gland sporozoites was assessed on days 7 and 14 post-feeding, respectively. The optimal conditions for mosquito rearing and feeding were evaluated to produce high-quality mosquitoes and to yield a high sporozoite rate, respectively. RESULTS: Laboratory-colonized mosquitoes could be starved for a shorter time before successful blood feeding compared with wild-caught mosquitoes. Optimizing the mosquito-rearing methods significantly increased mosquito survival. For mosquito feeding, replacing patient plasma with naïve serum increased sporozoite production > two-fold. With these changes, the sporozoite infection rate was high (> 85%) and resulted in an average of ~ 22,000 sporozoites per mosquito. Some mosquitoes reached up to 73,000 sporozoites. Sporozoite production could not be predicted from gametocyte density but could be predicted by measuring oocyst infection and oocyst load. CONCLUSIONS: Optimized conditions for the production of high-quality P. vivax sporozoite-infected An. stephensi were established at a field site in South West India. This report describes techniques for producing a ready resource of P. vivax sporozoites. The improved protocols can help in future research on the biology of P. vivax liver stages, including hypnozoites, in India, as well as the development of anti-relapse interventions for vivax malaria.

18817,Healthcare worker training to improve quality of care for sexual and gender minority people in sub‐Saharan Africa: learning from efforts in Uganda,2021-06-30,"This paper uses measurements of learning inequality to explore whether learning interventions that are aimed at improving means also reduce inequality, and if so, under what conditions. There is abundant evidence that learning levels are generally low in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), but there is less knowledge about how learning achievement is distributed within these contexts, and especially about how these distributions change as mean levels increase. We use child-level data on foundational literacy outcomes to quantitatively explore whether and how learning inequality using metrics borrowed from the economics and inequality literature can help us understand the impact of learning interventions. The paper deepens recent work in several ways. First, it extends the analysis to six LMIC, displaying which measures are computable and coherent across contexts and baseline levels. This extension can add valuable information to program evaluation, without being redundant with other metrics. Second, we show the large extent to which the disaggregation of inequality of foundational skills between- and within-schools and grades varies by context and language. Third, we present initial empirical evidence that, at least in the contexts of analysis of foundational interventions, improving average performance can reduce inequality as well, across all levels of socioeconomic status (SES). The data show that at baseline, the groups with the highest internal inequality tend to be the groups with lowest SES and lowest reading scores, as inequality among the poor themselves is higher than among their wealthier counterparts. Regardless of which SES groups benefit more in terms of a change in mean levels of reading, there is still a considerable reduction in inequality by baseline achievement as means increase. These results have policy implications in terms of targeting of interventions: much can be achieved in terms of simultaneously improving averages and increasing equality. This seems particularly true when the initial learning levels are as low as they currently are the developing world.","Rodriguez-Segura, Daniel; Campton, Cole; Crouch, Luis; Slade, Timothy S.",Int J Educ Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8246531/,361

20503,Where Do Online Games Fit into the Health Behaviour Ecology of Emerging Adults: A Scoping Review,2021-08-23,"In the last decades, optimizing implant properties in terms of materials and biointerface characteristics represents one of the main quests in biomedical research. Modifying and engineering polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as scaffolds becomes more and more attractive to multiples areas of bio-applications (e.g., bone or cochlear implants). Nevertheless, the acceptance of an implant is affected by its inflammatory potency caused by surface-induced modification. Therefore, in this work, three types of nano-micro squared wells like PVDF structures (i.e., reversed pyramidal shape with depths from 0.8 to 2.5 microns) were obtained by replication, and the influence of their characteristics on the inflammatory response of human macrophages was investigated in vitro. FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the maintaining chemical structures of the replicated surfaces, while the topographical surface characteristics were evaluated by AFM and SEM analysis. Contact angle and surface energy analysis indicated a modification from superhydrophobicity of casted materials to moderate hydrophobicity based on the structure’s depth change. The effects induced by PVDF casted and micron-sized reversed pyramidal replicas on macrophages behavior were evaluated in normal and inflammatory conditions (lipopolysaccharide treatment) using colorimetric, microscopy, and ELISA methods. Our results demonstrate that the depth of the microstructured surface affects the activity of macrophages and that the modification of topography could influence both the hydrophobicity of the surface and the inflammatory response.","Dumitrescu, Luminita Nicoleta; Icriverzi, Madalina; Bonciu, Anca; Roșeanu, Anca; Moldovan, Antoniu; Dinca, Valentina",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400858/,361

In order to develop novel therapeutic approaches to control the progression of metastatic RCC, it is of urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying RCC metastasis and identify prognostic markers of metastatic risk. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been known to be closely associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, which plays a highly active role in tumor metastasis. Recent studies have shown that immunophilin FK-506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) may be important for the regulation of ECM function, and exert effects on the invasion and migration of tumor cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these activities remain unclear. The present study detected the role of FKBP51 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common subtype of RCC, and found that FKBP51 significantly promotes ccRCC invasion and migration by binding with the TIMP3, connecting TIMP3 with Beclin1 complex and increasing autophagic degradation of TIMP3.

26333,"Behavioral Health Support for Patients, Families, and Healthcare Workers",2018-07-07,"Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Both hyperinflammation and immune suppression ensue, to an extent that is harmful to the host. The inflammatory balance is disturbed, and this is associated with a failure to return to homeostasis. All pathogens with sufficient load and virulence can cause sepsis, after they succeed to adhere and pass the mucosal barrier of the host. The host defense system can recognize molecular components of invading pathogens, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), with specialized receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Through several signaling pathways, overstimulation of PRRs has proinflammatory and immune suppressive consequences. Hyperinflammation is characterized by activation of target genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines (leukocyte activation), inefficient use of the complement system, activation of the coagulation system, and concurrent downregulation of anticoagulant mechanisms and necrotic cell death. The release of endogenous molecules by injured cells, called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, leads to deterioration in a vicious cycle by further stimulation of PRRs. Features of immune suppression are massive apoptosis and thereby depletion of immune cells, reprogramming of monocytes and macrophages to a state of a decreased capacity to release proinflammatory cytokines and a disturbed balance in cellular metabolic processes.","van Engelen, Tjitske S.

Through these, smear campaigns can be generated, aimed for example at trying to change the political orientation of some people. Twitter has become one of the main spreaders of fake news in the network. Therefore, in this paper, we present a solution based on Text Mining that tries to find which text patterns are related to tweets that refer to fake news and which patterns in the tweets are related to true news. To test and validate the results, the system faces a pre-labelled dataset of fake and real tweets during the U.S. presidential election in 2016. In terms of results interesting patterns are obtained that relate the size and subtle changes of the real news to create fake news. Finally, different ways to visualize the results are provided.","Diaz-Garcia, Jose A.; Fernandez-Basso, Carlos; Ruiz, M.

35484,Expanding access to radiotherapy in sub-Saharan Africa,2020-06-25,"In recent years, many technologies were racing to deliver the best service for human being. Emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies made birth to the notion of smart infrastructures such as smart grid, smart factories or smart hospitals. These infrastructures rely on interconnected smart devices collecting real-time data in order to improve existing procedures and systems capabilities. A critical issue in smart infrastructures is the information protection which may be more valuable than physical assets. Therefore, it is extremely important to detect and deter any attacks or breath to the network system for information theft. One of these attacks is the rank attack that is carried out by an intruder node in order to attract legitimate traffic to it, then steal personal data of different persons (both patients and staffs in hospitals). In this paper, we propose an anomaly based rank attack detection system against an IoT network using Support Vector Machines. As a use case, we are interested in the healthcare sector and in particular in smart hospitals which are multifaceted with many challenges such as service resilience, assets interoperability and sensitive information protection. The proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) is implemented and evaluated using Conticki Cooja simulator. Results show a high detection accuracy and low false positive rates.","Said, Abd Mlak; Yahyaoui, Aymen; Yaakoubi, Faicel; Abdellatif, Takoua",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313290/,361

40684,Hike in Student Suicides – Consequence of Online Classes?,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting different aspects of our society and brand-new conditions are expected after the lockdown. Italy was the first European country that entered a nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. METHODS: The COvid COllateral ImpactS (COCOS) project was a national cross-sectional survey performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires were online and included items on socio-demographics, behaviours, and healthcare access. Depression was assessed through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, anxiety through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants referring sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. Descriptive analyses, univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed (p-value<0.05 significant). RESULTS: The sample size was 1515. Females were 65.6%, and the median age was 42 years (IQR=23). Depression and anxiety symptoms prevalence were 24.7% and 23.2%. The 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, increased time spent on internet, and avoidance of activities for peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one of mental health outcomes. Increasing age, not experiencing work-related troubles, being married/cohabitant reduced such probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions resulted positively associated with sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a high prevalence of mental health issues. Since the impact might be long-lasting, it is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies for more vulnerable groups, e.g. youths, and considering the role of internet. KEY MESSAGES: A high prevalence of mental issues and sleep disturbances was recorded during the last week of the lockdown. Age, gender, marital status and the time spent on internet affected mental health while gender and presence of chronic conditions were predictors of sleep disturbances.","Voglino, G; Gualano, M R; Lo Moro, G; Bert, F; Siliquini, R",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543509/,361
41395,Impact of Social Isolation Due to COVID-19 on Health in Older People: Mental and Physical Effects and Recommendations,2020-09-25,"Purpose: There is a need for bedside methods to monitor oxygen delivery in the microcirculation. Near-infrared spectroscopy commonly measures tissue oxygen saturation, but does not reflect the time-dependent variability of microvascular hemoglobin content (MHC) that attempts to match oxygen supply with demand. The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of MHC monitoring in critically ill patients using high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy to assess perfusion in the peripheral microcirculation. Methods: Prospective observational cohort of 36 patients admitted within 48 h at a tertiary intensive care unit. Perfusion was measured on the quadriceps, biceps, and/or deltoid, using the temporal change in optical density at the isosbestic wavelength of hemoglobin (798 nm). Continuous wavelet transform was applied to the hemoglobin signal to delineate frequency ranges corresponding to physiological oscillations in the cardiovascular system. Results: 31/36 patients had adequate signal quality for analysis, most commonly affected by motion artifacts. MHC signal demonstrates inter-subject heterogeneity in the cohort, indicated by different patterns of variability and frequency composition. Signal characteristics were concordant between muscle groups in the same patient, and correlated with systemic hemoglobin levels and oxygen saturation. Signal power was lower for patients receiving vasopressors, but not correlated with mean arterial pressure. Mechanical ventilation directly impacts MHC in peripheral tissue. Conclusion: MHC can be measured continuously in the ICU with high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, and reflects the dynamic variability of hemoglobin distribution in the microcirculation. Results suggest this novel hemodynamic metric should be further evaluated for diagnosing microvascular dysfunction and monitoring peripheral perfusion.

METHODS: The cases of 184 consecutive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who underwent minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (109 with RAME, 75 with VAME) performed by a single surgical group between June 2017 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, 59.8% (110/181) patients (70 treated with RAME, 40 treated with VAME; 64.2% vs. 53.3%, respectively, p = 0.139) underwent complete LND around the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) by pathological assessment. Cumulative sum plots showed increased numbers of LND around the left RLN (3.6 ± 2.0 vs. 5.4 ± 2.7, p = 0.008) and a decreased incidence of recurrent nerve injury (27.9% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.037) after RAME learning curve. Despite similar overall LND results (30.6 ± 10.2 vs. 28.1 ± 10.2, p > 0.05), RAME yielded more LND (5.4 ± 2.7 vs. 4.4 ± 2.2, p = 0.016) and a greater proportion of lymph node metastases (37.0% vs. 7.5%) around the left RLN but induced a lower proportion of recurrent nerve injuries (7.4% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.178) compared with VAME. Further analysis revealed that the complete LND around the left RLN was associated with recurrent nerve injury in the RAME (20.0% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.035) and VAME (22.5% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.041) groups but did not affect other clinical outcomes including surgical duration, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and other complications. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with ESCC, RAME has great advantages in LND around the left RLN and recurrent nerve protection after learning curve of robotic esophagectomy.","Duan, Xiaofeng; Yue, Jie; Chen, Chuangui; Gong, Lei; Ma, Zhao; Shang, Xiaobin; Yu, Zhentao; Jiang, Hongjing",Surg Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7586865/,361

This research note analyses differences in contraceptive method mix across Sustainable Development Goal regions and applies assumed method-specific declines in use (from 0 per cent to 20 per cent) to produce an illustrative scenario of the potential impact of COVID-19 on contraceptive use and on the proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods. Globally, it had been estimated that 77 per cent of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) would have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods in 2020. However, taking into account the potential impact of COVID-19 on method-specific use, this could fall to 71 per cent, resulting in around 60 million fewer users of modern contraception worldwide in 2020. Overall declines in contraceptive use will depend on the methods used by women and their partners and on the types of disruptions experienced. The analysis concludes with the recommendation that countries should include family planning and reproductive health services in the package of essential services and develop strategies to ensure that women and couples are able to exercise their reproductive rights during the COVID-19 crisis.","Dasgupta, Aisha; Kantorová, Vladimíra; Ueffing, Philipp",Gates Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720714/,361

However, in the face of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), social distancing was prescribed as a potentially lifesaving measure, particularly for older adults. In this session, MIT AgeLab researchers will present findings from a mixed methods study with the MIT AgeLab 85+ Lifestyle Leaders, a panel study of octogenarians and nonagenarians that began in September 2015. In March 2020, AgeLab researchers began conducting a series of telephone interviews (n=15) with Lifestyle Leaders and collected quantitative data via an online survey (n=25). Together, the interviews and survey inquired about Lifestyle Leaders’ attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19, as well as their uses of technology throughout the crisis. Findings suggest that fears about the impacts of coronavirus transcended multiple domains of the Lifestyle Leaders’ lives, including their physical, socioemotional, and financial wellbeing. Lifestyle Leaders were asked about functional and emotional repercussions of social distancing and other precautions they had taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to protect themselves from contracting the virus. Special attention was paid to differences in lived experiences of the COVID-19 crisis among Lifestyle Leaders who were living independently versus those who were living in assisted living or continuing care retirement communities. Findings from this study suggest that socially-connected emergency preparedness measures will become increasingly important for the growing number of octogenarians and nonagenarians.","Miller, Julie; Patskanick, Taylor; D’Ambrosio, Lisa; Raue, Martina; Balmuth, Alexa; Coughlin, Joseph",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742501/,361

To achieve such an open innovation approach, several initiatives have been launched in order to leverage potential distributed knowledge sources that go beyond those available to any single organization. A particular tool that has gained some momentum during COVID‐19 times is hackathons, which have been used to unleash the innovation potential of individuals who voluntarily came together, for a relatively short period of time, with the aim to solve specific problems. In this paper, we describe and analyze the case of the hackathon EUvsVirus, led by the European Innovation Council. EUvs Virus was a 3‐day online hackathon to connect civil society, innovators, partners, and investors across Europe and beyond in order to develop innovative solutions to coronavirus‐related challenges. We have identified four dimensions to explore hackathons as a crowdsourcing tool for practicing effective open innovation in the face of COVID‐19: broad scope, participatory architecture, online setting, and community creation. We discuss how these four elements can play a strategic role in the face of grand challenges, which require, as in the case of the COVID‐19 pandemic, both urgent action and long‐term thinking. Our case analysis also suggests the need to look beyond the ‘usual suspects’, through knowledge recombination with atypical resources (e.g., retired experts, graduate students, and the general public). On this basis, we call for a broader perspective on open innovation, to be extended beyond openness across organizational boundaries, and to explore the role of openness at societal level.","Bertello, Alberto; Bogers, Marcel L.A.M.; De Bernardi, Paola",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8013650/,361

55357,Adverse mental health effects of COVID‐19 on children and teens,2021-04-21,"Post‐pandemic recovery must address the systemic inequality that has been revealed by the coronavirus crisis. The roots of this inequality predate the pandemic and even the global financial crisis. They lie rather in the uneasy relationship between labor and capital under conditions of declining economic growth, such as those who have prevailed in advanced economies for almost half a century. This paper explores the dynamics of that relationship using a simple stock‐flow consistent (SFC) macroeconomic model of a closed economy. It examines in particular the role of two key factors—the savings rate and the substitutability (elasticity of substitution) between labor and capital—on the severity of systemic inequality under conditions of declining growth. The paper goes on to test the efficacy of three redistributive measures—a graduated income tax, a tax on capital and a universal basic income—under two distinct structural scenarios for an economy with a declining growth rate. We find that none of these measures is sufficient to control structural inequality when institutions aggressively favor capital over labor (hyper‐capitalism). Taken in combination, however, under conditions more favorable to wage labor (proto‐socialism), these same measures have the potential to eliminate inequality, almost entirely, even as the growth rate declines.","Jackson, Tim; Victor, Peter A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242820/,361

Meanwhile, local ablation using photodynamic therapy (PDT) has shown increasing promise in the realm of lung cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to explore an alternative ablation method using PDT with SuperDimension ENB localization in a hybrid operating theater. Methods Our study includes patients with primary or metastatic lung cancer who underwent PDT via ENB in the hybrid operating room (OR) of National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2016 and January 2017. ENB with the SuperDimension Navigation System (7th edition) was performed before PDT ablation to localize the target lesions. PDT ablation was performed with the assistance of intraoperative Dyna-computed tomography (Dyna-CT). Tumor response was evaluated by CT 3 months after the procedure. Results Three patients underwent lung interstitial PDT via the aid of ENB during the study period. The mean size of the nodules was 21.3 mm. The mean navigation time was 14.3 minutes. In all cases, the target pulmonary nodule was ablated by PDT successfully. No major procedure-related complications occurred. One patient suffered from skin hypersensitivity one month after the procedure. The follow-up CT showed significant tumor shrinkage for all the patients. They were all discharged without incident a few days after the procedure as scheduled.

The drug is given intrathecally at 12 mg, beginning with 3 loading doses at 2-week intervals, a fourth loading dose 30 days thereafter, and maintenance doses at 4-month intervals. This population pharmacokinetic model was developed to clarify how to maintain targeted nusinersen exposure after an unforeseen one-time delay or missed dose. Simulations demonstrated that the impact of a one-time delay in dosing or a missed dose on median cerebrospinal fluid exposures depended on duration of interruption and the regimen phase in which it occurred. Delays in loading doses delayed reaching the peak trough concentration by approximately the duration of the interruption. Resumption of the regimen as soon as possible resulted in achieving steady state trough concentration upon completion of the loading phase. A short delay (30-90 days) during the maintenance phase led to prolonged lower median cerebrospinal fluid concentration if all subsequent doses were shifted by the same 4-month interval. However, administration of the delayed dose, followed by the subsequent dose as originally scheduled, rapidly restored trough concentration. If a dose must be delayed, patients should return to the original dosing schedule as soon as possible.","MacCannell, Drew; Berger, Zdenek; East, Lilly; Mercuri, Eugenio; Kirschner, Janbernd; Muntoni, Francesco; Farrar, Michelle A; Peng, Joanna; Zhou, Jie; Nestorov, Ivan; Farwell, Wildon; Finkel, Richard S",Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2021.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781694/,361

OBJECTIVE The aim of this work was to study the prevalence of ABCG5/G8 genetic variants in mutation-negative FH, as defects in these genes relate to intestinal hyperabsorption of cholesterol and thus ABCG5/G8 variants could explain in part the mechanism of hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS We sequenced the ABCG5/G8 genes in 214 mutation-negative FH and 97 controls. Surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption (5α-cholestanol, β-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and sitostanol) were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in both studied groups. RESULTS We found 8 mutation-negative FH patients (3.73%) with a pathogenic mutation in ABCG5/G8 genes. We observed significantly higher concentration of surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption in mutation-negative FH than in controls. In addition, we found significantly higher concentrations of cholesterol absorption markers in mutation-negative FH with ABCG5/G8 defects than in mutation-negative, ABCG5/G8-negative FH. A gene score reflecting the number of common single nucleotide variants associated with hypercholesterolemia was significantly higher in cases than in controls (P = .032). Subjects with a gene score above the mean had significantly higher 5α-cholestanol and stigmasterol than those with a lower gene score. CONCLUSIONS Mutation-negative FH subjects accumulate an excess of rare and common gene variations in ABCG5/G8 genes. This variation is associated with increased intestinal absorption of cholesterol, as determined by surrogate makers, suggesting that these loci contribute to hypercholesterolemia by enhancing intestinal cholesterol absorption.","Lamiquiz-Moneo, Itziar; Baila-Rueda, Lucía; Bea, Ana M; Mateo-Gallego, Rocío; Pérez-Calahorra, Sofía; Marco-Benedí, Victoria; Martín-Navarro, Antonio; Ros, Emilio; Cofán, Montserrat; Rodríguez-Rey, José Carlos; Pocovi, Miguel; Cenarro, Ana; Civeira, Fernando",Journal of clinical lipidology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacl.2017.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29066094/,361

Background: The government's guidelines affected people with COPD on different levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to belonging to a group of particularly vulnerable persons, they had to adapt their health behaviours, in particular physical activity, to recommendations provided in order to prevent negative effects on disease progression. There is little knowledge regarding how this group of patients coped with these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE To describe the health behaviours and needs people with COPD convey during nursing phone consultations and which nursing interventions have been carried out. METHODS A document analysis of 50 nursing phone consultations was performed. The data were summarised descriptively and analysed thematically. RESULTS The main topics were the adaptation of physical activity, the implementation of the recommendations to the individual life situation, the detection of a COVID-19 infection and questions concerning the planning of medical appointments. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic poses additional challenges to the disease management of people with COPD. The increased need for care brought on by the pandemic was able to be met by the knowledge provided in the nursing phone consultations.

Here, five new species are described from soil samples collected in Madagascar. These species-Cavenderia basinodulosa, C. canoespora, Heterostelium radiatum, H. versatile, and Raperostelium stabile-are described based on both morphological characteristics and molecular data, with sequence data from the rDNA small subunit (SSU). The five new species are morphologically disparate, ranging from relatively small, robust taxa such as R. stabile to taxa with variable morphologies such as the larger H. radiatum and H. versatile and the yellow-tinted and irregularly branched species C. canoespora and C. basinulosa. These new species, together with earlier work where 13 other species were described from the island, suggest that there is a range of genetically diverse and highly morphologically variable dictyostelid taxa occurring on Madagascar, suggesting biogeographic patterns even within these very small organisms.","Perrigo, Allison L; Vadell, Eduardo M; Cavender, James C; Landolt, John C; Liu, Pu; Stephenson, Steven L",Mycologia,https://doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2020.1802641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006910/,361

RECENT FINDINGS In new human and nonhuman primate (NHP) vaccine trials as well as studies of natural infection, Fc-mediated effector responses have sometimes been observed to correlate with decreased risk of infection or with better clinical outcomes, suggesting a potential role for these responses in HIV-1 prevention and therapy. Recent highlights include use of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-sensitizing CD4-induced mimetic compounds, novel V1V2 immunogens, passive transfer studies, and vaccine regimens that successfully elicited Fc-mediated responses and were reported to decrease risk of infection in challenge studies in NHPs. Lastly, detailed studies of IgG3 forms of HIV-specific antibodies have reported that both neutralizing and Fc-mediated responses can be increased relative to the more prevalent IgG1 subclass. SUMMARY Successful harmonization of neutralizing and Fc-mediated responses may make key contributions to the goal of reducing HIV-1 infection via active and passive vaccination. New studies continue to highlight the importance of Fc-mediated antibody responses as correlates of decreased risk of infection and suggest enhanced phagocytosis is a potential mechanism of reduced risk of infection associated with human IgG3 responses. Results from recent studies may help guide the rational design of therapies and vaccines that aim to specifically leverage antibody effector function.","Carpenter, Margaret C; Ackerman, Margaret E",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/coh.0000000000000638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32675573/,361
65095,Ethical Frameworks for Quality Improvement Activities: An Analysis of International Practice.,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND Absence of interlobar collateral ventilation is key to successful endobronchial valve treatment in patients with severe emphysema and can be functionally assessed using the Chartis® measurement. Chartis has been validated during spontaneous breathing, undergoing procedural sedation (PS), but can also be performed under general anesthesia (GA). Performing Chartis under PS is often challenging because of coughing, mucus secretion and difficulties in maintaining an adequate level of sedation. The study objective was to investigate whether there is a difference in Chartis measurement outcomes between PS and GA. METHODS In this prospective study patients underwent Chartis measurements under both PS and GA. Study outcomes were Chartis measurement duration, number of measurements, feasibility and success rate. RESULTS We included 30 patients with severe emphysema (mean age 62 years and median FEV1 29% of pred.). Chartis measurement duration was significantly longer under PS than under GA (mean 20.3±4.2 minutes versus 15.1±4.4, P<0.001). There was no difference in the number of measurements performed (median 2 (range 1-3) for PS versus 1 (1-3) for GA, P=1.00). Chartis measurement was more feasible during GA (median sum of all feasibility scores: 12 (range 6-26) for PS versus 7 (5-13) for GA, P<0.001), with no statistical difference in success rate: 77% of cases for PS versus 97% under GA, P=0.07. CONCLUSION This study shows that Chartis measurement under general anesthesia is faster and more feasible to perform compared to procedural sedation, without affecting measurement outcomes.","Welling, Jorrit B A; Klooster, Karin; Hartman, Jorine E; Kerstjens, Huib A M; Franz, Ina; Struys, Michel M R F; Absalom, Anthony R; Slebos, Dirk-Jan; Barends, Clemens R M",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2019.07.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421111/,361

In contrast to sphenoid meningoceles arising from a persistent lateral craniopharyngeal canal (Sternberg-Cruveilhier, medial to V2), their occurrence seems to be generated by addition of erosive processes to the constitutively thin bony shell underneath the semilunar ganglion, lateral to the round foramen (and V2). The developmental and anatomical relationships of trigeminal meningoceles to the sphenoid bone are depicted, and in a review of the literature we present the different surgical approaches employed for sealing the dura leak. In view of these techniques we discuss an unusual case of therapy-resistant rhinoliquorrhea with left-sided trigeminal meningocele involving the Meckel cave at the lateral sphenoid and reaching the superior orbital fissure and the medial orbital space. In contrast to patients who have lateral sphenoidal meningoceles with a persistent lateral craniopharyngeal canal (Sternberg-Cruveilhier), who can be treated successfully using an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach (recurrence rate 13.7%), the recurrence rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) efflux for trigeminal meningoceles lies much higher (endoscopically 66%, open craniotomy 33%). The surgical strategy thus has to be chosen individually, taking into account specific anatomical situations and eventually preceding operations.","Preuss, Matthias; Steinhoff, Alexander; Zühlke, Constantin J; Schulz, Dirk; Stein, Marco; Nestler, Ulf; Christophis, Petros",Journal of neurological surgery reports,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1348955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24303342/,361

As a monthly intramuscular (IM) injection, this therapy constitutes a major departure from the traditional paradigm of oral therapy requiring (at least) daily administration that has defined HIV treatment for decades. Composed of a second-generation integrase inhibitor (INSTI) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), CAB/RPV has achieved high rates of sustained virologic suppression with a favorable safety profile for treatment-experienced PLWH following oral lead-in (OLI) during several clinical trials. In addition to the clinical benefits of this agent, patient-reported outcomes associated with convenience, confidentiality, and the tolerability of the injections have consistently reflected positive perceptions of CAB/RPV. The novel nature of this therapy in the field of HIV presents logistical challenges. Clinics will need to address barriers related to management of clinic workflow, procurement, reimbursement, and nonadherence.

Two different concepts of self-adhering meshes were directly compared in this study. Adhesix(®) (AH) is coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), whereas Parietene Progrip(®) (PP) relies on the mechanical principle of micro grips made of polylactic acid (PLA). These meshes are the main competitors in the field. METHODS AH and PP were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats at 14 and 90 days. Four groups were operated (n = 8 animals per group). Two meshes were implanted per animal in an operation model of onlay hernia repair. Dislocation, tissue integration and foreign-body reaction were evaluated. RESULTS AH dislocated significantly more frequently (every second mesh) at both time points of observation than PP. Tissue integration was good with PP and could not be reliably assessed in AH due to frequent dislocation. Histologic examination revealed only a mild foreign body reaction in all groups. CONCLUSIONS In our hands, PP (mechanical grip fixation) was superior to hydrogel fixation with PEG and PVP in AH in an onlay model. The reason for dislocation of AH requires further clarification as well as the impact of long-term degradation of the PLA grips.","Gruber-Blum, S; Riepl, N; Brand, J; Keibl, C; Redl, H; Fortelny, R H; Petter-Puchner, A H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-014-1258-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797638/,361

We present a unique scoping needs analysis of staff and client well-being, staff attitudes and the social-therapeutic climate in a UK-based homeless prevention organisation (prior to PIE implementation). Our aims were: (a) to apply a robust framework to pinpoint need and target forthcoming PIE initiatives and (b) to establish a validated needs baseline that informs and measures efficacy of PIE for its future development. Four established personal and practice well-being measures were administered to 134 (predominantly 'frontline') staff and 50 clients. Staff completed the: Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), Professional Quality of Life Scale (measuring compassion satisfaction [CS], burnout [BO] and secondary traumatic stress [STS]), Attitudes related to Trauma-informed Care Scale (ARTIC-10; measuring practice attitudes towards trauma-informed values) and the Essen Climate Evaluation Schema (EssenCES; measuring perceptions of client cohesion, safety and practitioner relationships in housing projects). Clients completed the WEMWBS and EssenCES. Vulnerability to STS was evident in nearly two-thirds of frontline staff and it was a statistically significant predictor of BO. It was not, however, associated with lesser levels of CS. We discuss this complex dynamic in relation to highlighted strategic recommendations for the PIE framework, and the identified potential challenges in implementing trauma-informed and reflective practice in the organisation. We conclude with a critique of the value and the lessons learnt from our efforts to integrate stronger empirical substance into the PIE approach.","Schneider, Christel; Hobson, Christopher W; Shelton, Katherine H",Health & social care in the community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057251/,361

69531,Health and Healing.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Patient-oriented research affords individuals with opportunities to genuinely contribute to health care research as members of research teams. While checklists and frameworks can support academic researchers' awareness of patient engagement methods, less guidance appears available to support their understanding of how to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with their patient partners. This knowledge is essential as patient partners report that the social atmospheres of research teams significantly impacts the quality of their experiences. This study sought to develop theory regarding how academic researchers support and sustain patient engagement in patient-oriented research. METHODS A six-step, rapid realist review was conducted: (1) research question development, (2) preliminary theory development, (3) search strategy development; (4) study selection and appraisal, (4) data extraction, analysis and synthesis (5) identification of relevant formal theories, and (6) theory refinement with stakeholders. Findings were additionally distilled by collective competence theory. RESULTS A program theory was developed from 62 international studies which illuminated mechanisms supporting academic researchers to engage patient partners, contexts supporting these mechanisms, and resources that enabled mechanism activation. Interaction between seven contexts (patient-oriented research belief, prior interaction with a healthcare system, prior interaction with a particular academic researcher, educational background of patient partner, prior experience with patient-oriented research, study type, and time lived in a rural-urban setting) and seven mechanisms (deciding to become involved in patient-oriented research, recognizing valuable experiential knowledge, cultural competence, reducing power differentials, respectful team environment, supporting patient partners to feel valued, and readiness to research) resulted in an intermediate outcome (sense of trust). Trust then acted as an eighth mechanism which triggered the final-level outcome (empowered patient-centred lens). CONCLUSIONS Our theory posits that if patient partners trust they are a member of a supportive team working alongside academic researchers who authentically want to incorporate their input, then they are empowered to draw upon their experiential knowledge of health care systems and contribute as researchers in patient-oriented research. Our theory extends conceptual thinking regarding the importance of trust on patient-oriented research teams, how patient partners' trust is shaped by team interactions, and the role that academic researchers have within those interactions.","Zibrowski, Elaine; Carr, Tracey; McDonald, Shelagh; Thiessen, Heather; van Dusen, Ray; Goodridge, Donna; Haver, Charlene; Marciniuk, Darcy; Stobart, Christine; Verrall, Tanya; Groot, Gary",Research involvement and engagement,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40900-021-00299-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629118/,361

DESIGN Case report. SETTING University hospital. PATIENT(S) A 36-year-old amenorrheic patient was referred for fertility preservation (FP) counseling with a diagnosis of autoimmune POI. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (21.0 and 36.3 mIU/mL) and luteinizing hormone (35.0 and 60.0 mIU/mL) levels taken 4 weeks apart were around the menopausal range. Although serum antimüllerian hormone level was low (0.76 and 0.65 ng/mL), total counts of antral follicles remained unexpectedly normal (24 and 22). Significant levels of serum antiperoxidase, anti-21-hydroxylase, and antiovary antibodies led to the diagnosis of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. Due to the unknown time before follicular exhaustion, we undertook a FP program. INTERVENTION(S) After unsuccessful follicular growth following a trial of ovarian stimulation using recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (300 IU/day for 10 days), we decided to try IVM of immature oocytes aspirated from the remaining antral-stage follicles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Obtention of immature oocyte capable of maturing in vitro in a context of acute ovarian dysfunction. RESULT(S) Two cycles of IVM were performed, leading, after human chorionic gonadotropin priming, to six and 10 cumulus-oocyte complexes recovered and four and eight metaphase II oocytes. Finally, after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a total of eight cleavage-stage embryos were frozen. When the patient presented in the clinic 1 year later for reutilization of the cryopreserved embryos, thyroid and adrenal functions were controlled with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone. Endometrium was primed with 17ß-estradiol (2 mg/day, vaginally) for 14 days. Progesterone (600 mg/day, vaginally) was subsequently combined with E2. Two embryos were thawed and further transferred into the uterus. The patient became pregnant and uneventfully delivered two baby boys at term. CONCLUSION(S) We report the first pregnancy and live birth achieved using IVM for FP in a woman diagnosed with autoimmune POI. The confirmation of our results would lead to modification in the management of young women diagnosed with autoimmune POI, who are usually not considered candidates for FP and often referred for egg donation when seeking pregnancy.","Grynberg, Michaël; Jacquesson, Laetitia; Sifer, Christophe",Fertility and sterility,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.04.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709383/,361

75023,Health care seeking due to COVID-19 related symptoms and health care cancellations among older Brazilian adults: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative.,2020,"INTRODUCTION The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is the most widely used protocol for activating a stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and other stress-mediating systems. A number of variants of the TSST exist, including ones for children, groups, and virtual reality. All of these versions, though, require in-person assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has made in-person assessment impossible or extremely difficult and potentially dangerous. The purpose of this study was to validate a completely remote, online, version of the TSST for children. METHOD A sample of 68 (27 female) 15- and 16-year old participants were administered the TSST-Online (TSST-OL) during the late afternoon hours (3-6 p.m. start time). The participants, judges (one male, one female), and experimenter (female) all joined the assessment from their own homes via the online platform, ZOOM™. Two sessions were conducted, one to obtain consent, explain procedures, work with the family to arrange the computer and room set-up for the TSST-OL and one within two weeks to conduct the procedure. The participants were trained to take their own saliva samples and a saliva sampling kit was mailed to the home in between the first and second session. The samples were then mailed to the researchers within a day of collection. The participant was observed during saliva collection to determine correct procedures were followed. Salivary cortisol, salivary α-amylase and self-reports of stress were measured multiple times over the second session. RESULTS rmANOVAs yielded a significant effect of trials, for cortisol, F(1.37,90.46) = 15.13, p = .001, sAA, F(2.75,146.68) = 6.91, p = .001, and self-rated stress, F(3.43,222.69) = 118.73, p = .001. There were no significant sex by trials interactions for any measure, although females reported more stress than males, F(1,65) = 9.14, p = .004. For cortisol, from baseline to expected peak (30 min after the onset of speech preparation), the Cohen's effect size was dz = 0.57. Using 1.5 nmol/l (or 0.54 μg/dl) as the criterion for a response (Miller, Plessow, Kirschaum, & Stalder, 2013), 63% of the participants produced a significant increase in cortisol. CONCLUSIONS The responses to the TSST-OL are consistent with in-person responses among children and adolescents (see recent meta-analysis (Seddon et al., 2020). The protocol is a viable way of assessing reactivity of the HPA axis and other stress systems without needing to bring the participant into the research laboratory. This method will be useful during periods of widespread infection. It should also work to study populations who all live too far from the research laboratory to be assessed in person.","Gunnar, Megan R; Reid, Brie M; Donzella, Bonny; Miller, Zachary R; Gardow, Samantha; Tsakonas, Nikola C; Thomas, Kathleen M; DeJoseph, Meriah; Bendezú, Jason José",Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.105111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33341502/,361
75069,The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Individuals With and Without Mental Health Disorders.,2021-06-21,"Generation of antiviral IgM is usually considered as a marker of a short-lived initial antibody response that is replaced by hypermutated and more-efficient IgG. However, once viruses have established a particular niche for their persistence (e.g., within the CNS), the immune system has to specifically mobilize a broad range of antimicrobial effectors to contain the pathogen in the long term. Infection of the CNS with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) provides a unique model situation in which the extent of inflammatory CNS disease is determined by the balance between antiviral immune control, viral replication, and immune-mediated damage. We show here that whereas antibody- or B cell-deficient mice failed to contain MHV CNS infection and developed progressive demyelinating disease, germline IgM produced in activation-induced cytidine deaminase-deficient mice (aicda(-/-)) provided long-term protection against the chronic multiple sclerosis-like disease. Furthermore, we found that appropriate B-cell activation within the CNS-draining lymph node and subsequent CXCR3-mediated migration of antiviral IgM-secreting cells to the infected CNS was dependent on CD40-mediated interaction of B cells with T helper cells. These data indicate that the CD40-mediated collaboration of T and B cells is critical to secure neuroprotective IgM responses during viral CNS infection.","Gil-Cruz, Cristina; Perez-Shibayama, Christian; Firner, Sonja; Waisman, Ari; Bechmann, Ingo; Thiel, Volker; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Ludewig, Burkhard",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1115154109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22232667/,361
75514,The impact of shift work schedules on PVT performance in naturalistic settings: a systematic review.,2021-03-11,"Viral infection typically originates from a limited number of virions known as transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses. Studies of cross-species transmission, and intra-species transmission of antigenically variable viruses, indicates T/F variants may express distinct, transmissibility enhancing phenotypes. However, with evidence that transmissibility is associated with not only intrinsic virological features, such as virion composition, but also extrinsic factors, such as viral population structure, the challenge of resolving T/F signatures that can be targeted by rational vaccine or antiviral design is substantial. Nonetheless, failure to develop vaccines for antigenically variable viruses, such as HIV/HCV, and the ongoing risk of cross-species transmission with pandemic potential, recommends development of T/F targeting vaccines. In this commentary, the T/F phenomena is introduced, explored in both the classical (HIV) and non-canonical (coronaviruses) instances, and discussed in relation to rational and preemptive vaccine design.","Mosa, Alexander I",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1861878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33377822/,361

The effectiveness of biodegrading the organic portion of FW via microorganisms existing in FW improved by 38.80% by controlling rates of FW loading and air-flow. In one stage of the on-site biological treatment, the major bacterial community was identified to be mesophilic and facultative; Lactobacillus was the most dominant genus, accounting for 78.1% of bacterial community. Total mass reduction of FW approached 90.15% by increasing removal of both moisture and the organic portion of FW. In addition, the solids and liquids of the final by-products have the potential to be recycled into resources such as fertilizer, a bio-solid refuse fuel or external carbon sources for wastewater treatment plants.

The enhanced precautions required to safely care for COVID-19 patients impacted the performance of even routine critical care procedures. Meanwhile, staff were stretched to care for exponentially rising case volume as COVID intensive care units (ICUs) expanded. Simulation was used to bridge these gaps-first to familiarize personnel within the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care with revised COVID-19 care procedures, then to orient noncritical care clinicians volunteering from other specialties for COVID ICU deployment to general critical care and COVID-19 care principles. Using mannequin-based simulation scenarios followed by comprehensive debriefing sessions, simulation participants received high-intensity, high-fidelity training in respiratory failure, circulatory failure, bedside ultrasound, bedside ICU procedures, and elements of COVID-19-specific care. More than 200 physicians and advanced practice practitioners completed simulation training in preparation for deployment, supplementing and enhancing the ICU workforce at a decisive time during the outbreak.","Nair, Sunil S; Kaufman, Brian",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,https://doi.org/10.1097/sih.0000000000000513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003128/,361

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage after thoracic esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction using a posterior mediastinal route. About 50 of 365 patients (13.7%) with esophageal cancer and postoperative anastomotic leak after curative esophagectomy was investigated. Beginning in June 2009, naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage by inserting a naso-esophageal aspiration tube into the abscess cavity when percutaneous abscess drainage was introduced which was ineffective or technically impossible. Twenty-five patients underwent naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage concomitantly with enteral nutrition. Twenty-one (84%) patients had major leaks, one (4%) minor leak and three (12%) had endoscopically proven conduit necrosis. None of the naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage cases (100%) required reintervention or reoperation and all experienced complete cure (100%) during hospitalization. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was performed for four patients after discharge because of anastomotic stricture. Patients with leaks were divided into two groups: current group (n = 32), treated after June 2009, and preceding group (n = 18), treated prior to the introduction of naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage. Significantly more patients in the preceding group suffered respiratory failure (28% vs. 61%, p = 0.024), and higher reoperation rate (0% vs. 17%, p = 0.042) and hospital mortality (0% vs. 22%, p = 0.013). In the current group, 31 (97%) patients experienced complete cure during hospitalization. Naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage and concomitant enteral nutritional support are less invasive, and effective and powerful methods to treat even major leakage after esophagectomy. These methods may be an alternative management to improve mortality for patients with esophageal cancer.","Shuto, Kiyohiko; Kono, Tsuguaki; Akutsu, Yasunori; Uesato, Masaya; Mori, Mikito; Matsuo, Kenichi; Kosugi, Chihiro; Hirano, Atsushi; Tanaka, Kuniya; Okazumi, Shinich; Koda, Keiji; Matsubara, Hisahiro",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,https://doi.org/10.1111/dote.12492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27862613/,361

More robust evidence is needed to facilitate choice of procedure. In this systemic review, we aim to investigate the comparative long-term effectiveness in inducing remission of type 2 diabetes, halting diabetic complications, reducing mortality and the safety of conventional and emerging bariatric surgeries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Databases including Cochrane Central Register, EMBASE, MEDLINE and clinical trial registries will be searched for randomised controlled trials with at least 3 years of follow-up, including direct and/or indirect evidence regarding primary bariatric surgeries in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, from inception of each database to 2019, with no language or publication type limits imposed. Dual selection of studies, data extraction and risk of bias assessments will be performed. Primary outcomes include full diabetes remission, composite outcome of full or partial diabetes remission and adverse event profiles. Secondary outcomes include anthropometric measurements, cardiovascular risk factor burden, medication burden, diabetic complications and all-cause mortality. Given sufficient homogeneity, network meta-analyses will be performed in a random-effects model based on the Bayesian framework, while assessing for consistency between direct and indirect estimates. Heterogeneities of studies will be explored through meta-regression analysis, and robustness of findings will be checked by sensitivity analysis, and an alternative method under a frequentist framework. All statistical analysis and graphical presentations will be conducted by R software V.3.3.3 (The R Project for Statistical Computing). The overall quality of the evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria for each outcome.

To date, there are no consensus criteria on how to define IA in the ICU population, although several criteria are used, including the AspICU criteria and new consensus criteria to categorize COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). In this review, we describe the epidemiology of IA in critically ill patients, most common definitions used to define IA in this population, and most common clinical specimens obtained for establishing a mycological diagnosis of IA in the critically ill. We also review the most common diagnostic tests used to diagnose IA in this population, and lastly discuss the most common clinical presentation and imaging findings of IA in the critically ill and discuss areas of further needed investigation.","Jenks, Jeffrey D; Nam, Hannah H; Hoenigl, Martin",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33760284/,361

As we learn more about the effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with the recognition that olfactory dysfunction is a key symptom of this disease process, there is now a greater need for evidence-based management for post infectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD). OBJECTIVE To provide an evidence based practical guide to the management of PIOD (including post-covid cases) for both primary care practitioners and hospital specialists. METHODS A systematic review was performed on the treatment options available for the management of PIOD. The written systematic review was then circulated among the members of the Clinical Olfactory Working Group (COWoG) for their perusal prior to round table expert discussion of the treatment options. The group also undertook a survey to determine their current clinical practice with regards to treatment of PIOD. RESULTS The search resulted in 467 citations from which 107 articles were fully reviewed and analysed for eligibility; 40 citations fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 11 of which were randomised controlled trials. In total, 15 of the articles specifically looked at PIOD whilst the other 25 included other aetiologies for olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS The COWoG members made an overwhelming recommendation for olfactory training and none recommended monocycline antibiotics. The diagnostic role of oral steroids is discussed and there were some in favour of vitamin A drops.

81701,Becoming Anti-Racist Occupational Therapy Practitioners: A Scoping Study.,2021-06-02,"INTRODUCTION In the field of hernia prevention, the prophylactic mesh-reinforcement of stoma-sites is one of the most controversially discussed issues. The incidence of parastomal hernias in the literature reported to be up to 48.1% after end colostomy and up to 30.8% after loop of colostomy, but still remains uncertain due to diagnostic variety of clinical or radiological methods, heterogeneous patient groups and variable follow-up intervals. Anyway, the published data regarding the use of synthetic or bio-prostethic meshes in the prevention of parastomal hernia at the primary operation are very scarce. METHODS A literature search of the Medline database in terms of biological prophylactic mesh implantation in stoma creation identified six systematic reviews, two randomized controlled trials (RCT), two case-controlled studies, and one technical report. RESULTS In a systematic review focusing on the prevention of parastomal hernia including only RCTs encompassing one RCT using bio-prosthetic mesh the incidence of herniation was 12.5% compared to 53% in the control group (p < 0.0001). In one RCT and two case-control studies, respectively, there was a significant smaller incidence of parastomal herniation as well as a similar complication rate compared to the control group. Only in one RCT, no significant difference regarding the incidence of parastomal hernia was reported with comparable complication rates. CONCLUSION Thus, so far two RCT and two case-control studies are published with prophylactic bio-prosthetic reinforcement in stoma sites. The majority revealed significant better results in terms of parastomal herniation and without any mesh-related complications in comparison to the non mesh group. Further, multicenter RCT are required to achieve a sufficient level of recommendation.","Fortelny, René H; Hofmann, Anna; May, Christopher; Köckerling, Ferdinand",Frontiers in surgery,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2015.00053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26557646/,361
82335,COVID-19 and Intrinsic Capacity.,2020,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belonging to Gammacoronavirus, is an economically important respiratory virus affecting poultry industry worldwide. The virus can infect chickens at all ages, whereas young chickens (less than 15 day old) are more susceptible to it. The present study was conducted to investigate effects of dietary supplementation of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.) larvae (BSFL) on immune responses in IBV infected 10-day-old chickens. BSFL were ground to powder and mixed with commercial fodder (1%, 5%, and 10 % [mass] BSFL powder) to feed 1-day-old yellow broilers for ten days and then challenged with IBV. Our results indicated that commercial fodder supplemented with 10 % BSFL [mass] reduced mortalities (20 %) and morbidities (80 %), as well as IBV viral loads in tracheas (65.8 %) and kidneys (20.4 %) from 3-day post challenge (dpc), comparing to that of IBV-infected chickens fed with non-additive commercial fodder. Furthermore, at 3-day post challenge (dpc), 10 % BSFL [mass] supplemented chickens presented more CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and a rise in interferon-g (IFN-γ) at both mRNA and protein levels in spleens, comparing with chickens fed with commercial fodder. Furthermore, the mRNA abundance of MHC-I, Fas, LITAF, and IL-2 in the spleens of 10 % BSFL [mass] supplemented chickens increased at different time points after challenge. The present results suggest that supplemental BSFL could improve CD8+ T lymphocytes proliferation, thus benefit young chickens to defend against IBV infection.","Zhang, Yun; Yang, Chen-Yu; Li, Chujun; Xu, Zhichao; Peng, Peng; Xue, Chunyi; Tomberlin, Jeffery K; Hu, Wenfeng; Cao, Yongchang",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34237662/,361

This study examined the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized-controlled trial of online acceptance and commitment therapy (""ACT OPEN"") for neuropathic pain in PLWH. METHODS Using a parallel-groups design, thirty-eight participants were randomized to ACT OPEN or a waitlist control (2:1). Participants completed standard self-report outcome measures at baseline, and two- and five-months post-randomization. Participants were aware of their allocation, but assessment was blinded. RESULTS Twenty-five participants were randomized to ACT OPEN and 13 to the control (of 133 referrals). ACT OPEN completion was 69% and two-month trial retention was 82%. Treatment credibility and satisfaction scores for ACT OPEN were comparable to scores reported in previous trials of cognitive-behavioural treatments for pain. Four adverse events were reported during the study, including one serious adverse event; all of these were unrelated to the research procedures. Small to moderate effects and 95% confidence intervals suggest that the true effect may favour ACT OPEN for improvements in pain intensity/interference and depression.

85393,"ECG abnormalities among HIV infected children placed on ART at Enugu, South East of Nigeria.",2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Effective endoscopic management is fundamental for the treatment of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC). However, current biliary stents that are widely used in clinical practice showed no antitumor effect. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) may achieve a combination of local chemotherapy and biliary drainage to prolong stent patency and improve prognosis. AIM To develop novel DESs coated with gemcitabine (GEM) and cisplatin (CIS)-coloaded nanofilms that can maintain the continuous and long-term release of antitumor agents in the bile duct to inhibit tumor growth and reduce systemic toxicity. METHODS Stents coated with different drug-eluting components were prepared by the mixed electrospinning method, with poly-L-lactide-caprolactone (PLCL) as the drug-loaded nanofiber membrane and GEM and/or CIS as the antitumor agents. Four different DESs were manufactured with four drug-loading ratios (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), including bare-loaded (PLCL-0), single-drug-loaded (PLCL-GEM and PLCL-CIS), and dual-drug-loaded (PLCL-GC) stents. The drug release property, antitumor activity, and biocompatibility were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to confirm the feasibility and efficacy of this novel DES for ECC. RESULTS The in vitro drug release study showed the stable, continuous release of both GEM and CIS, which was sustained for over 30 d without an obvious initial burst, and a higher drug-loaded content induced a lower release rate. The drug-loading ratio of 10% was used for further experiments due to its ideal inhibitory efficiency and relatively low toxicity. All drug-loaded nanofilms effectively inhibited the growth of EGI-1 cells in vitro and the tumor xenografts of nude mice in vivo; in addition, the dual-loaded nanofilm (PLCL-GC) had a significantly better effect than the single-drug-loaded nanofilms (P < 0.05). No significant differences in the serological analysis (P > 0.05) or histopathological changes were observed between the single-loaded and drug-loaded nanofilms after stent placement in the normal porcine biliary tract. CONCLUSION This novel PLCL-GEM and CIS-eluting stent maintains continuous, stable drug release locally and inhibits tumor growth effectively in vitro and in vivo. It can also be used safely in normal porcine bile ducts. We anticipate that it might be considered an alternative strategy for the palliative therapy of ECC patients.","Xiao, Jing-Bo; Weng, Jun-Yong; Hu, Yang-Yang; Deng, Gui-Long; Wan, Xin-Jian",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i31.4589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884219/,361

RESULTS The authors identified 13 eligible controlled trials that randomized over 5400 participants to prespecified treatments of interest. Comparison with pooled historical data suggested a numerical advantage for CT-P13 SC over intravenous infliximab for almost every prespecified efficacy outcome evaluated, including Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (C-reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate), Clinical/Simplified Disease Activity Index scores, American College of Rheumatology responses, and multiple measures of disease remission and low disease activity; for the majority of outcomes, there was no overlap in 95% confidence intervals between groups. A numerical advantage for CT-P13 SC was also observed for safety outcomes (adverse events, infections and discontinuations). Similar, but less marked, trends were observed for comparison with historical efficacy and safety data for adalimumab/etanercept.

An immunosuppressant host response to a primary disease can facilitate spreading of a subsequent emergent pathogen among the population. Social contact patterns within the substrate populace can be modeled using complex networks and it has been shown that contact patterns vastly influence the emergent disease dynamics. In this paper, we consider the effect of contact clustering on the coinfection dynamics of two pathogens spreading over a network. We use the generating function formulation to describe the expected outbreak sizes of each pathogen and numerically study the threshold criteria that permit the coexistence of each strain among the network. We find that the effects of clustering on the levels of coinfection are governed by the details of the contact topology.","Mann, Peter; Smith, V Anne; Mitchell, John B O; Dobson, Simon",Physical review.

Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15). Conclusions and Relevance This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity. These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.","Mehta, Neil; Kalra, Ankur; Nowacki, Amy S; Anjewierden, Scott; Han, Zheyi; Bhat, Pavan; Carmona-Rubio, Andres E; Jacob, Miriam; Procop, Gary W; Harrington, Susan; Milinovich, Alex; Svensson, Lars G; Jehi, Lara; Young, James B; Chung, Mina K",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369097/,361
87222,[The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health].,2020-04-08,"OBJECTIVE Despite the widespread use of noninvasive ventilation in children and in children with acute lung injury and pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, there are few scientific data on the utility of this therapy. In this review, we examine the literature regarding noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and use the Research ANd Development/University of California, Los Angeles appropriateness methodology to provide strong or weak recommendations for the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. DATA SOURCES Electronic searches were made in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus with the following specific keywords: noninvasive ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, and high-flow nasal cannula. STUDY SELECTION Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included 10 or more children between 1 month and 18 years old. Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, concurrent cohort studies, interrupted time series studies, historically controlled studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and uncontrolled longitudinal studies were included for data synthesis. DATA SYNTHESIS The literature provides a solid physiological rationale for the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. The addition of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can improve gas exchange and potentially prevent intubation and mechanical ventilation in some children with mild pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is not indicated in severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be performed only in acute care setting with experienced team, and patient-ventilator synchrony is crucial for success. An oronasal interface provides superior support, but close monitoring of children is required due to the risk of progressive respiratory failure and the potential need for intubation. The use of high-flow nasal cannula is a promising treatment for respiratory disease; however, at this time, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula compared with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is unknown. CONCLUSION Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can be beneficial in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, particularly in those with milder disease. However, further research is needed into the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in children.","Essouri, Sandrine; Carroll, Christopher",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000000437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035360/,361

The field of adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapy was significantly reshaped by tumor neoantigens and is now moving towards the genetic engineering of T cells with neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs). Yet, the identification of neoantigen-reactive TCRs remains challenging and the process needs to be adapted to clinical timelines. In addition, the state of recipient T cells for TCR transduction is critical and can affect TCR-ACT efficacy. Here we provide an overview of the main strategies for TCR-engineering, describe the selection and expansion of optimal carrier cells for TCR-ACT and discuss the next-generation methods for rapid identification of relevant TCR candidates for gene transfer therapy.","Arnaud, Marion; Bobisse, Sara; Chiffelle, Johanna; Harari, Alexandre",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.701636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394096/,361

(i) To assess reproducibility of PI and (ii) To determine whether there is a difference between simultaneously obtained limb measurements of PI in newborns <32 weeks GA in the transitional period. METHODS Perfusion Index was measured in newborns <32 weeks during the first 48 h of life. To examine reproducibility, the pulse oximetry probe was replaced on the same limb consecutively by the same operator. Upper and lower limbs were then simultaneously evaluated over a 5-min period. Heart rate, blood pressure, birth weight, ventilation requirement, inotrope use, lactate, PCO2 and CRIB-II score were also recorded. RESULTS Thirty infants were assessed. Intraclass correlation coefficient for reproducibility in the same limb was high (r value = 0.982 p < 0.001). Measurements obtained in the right upper limb were consistently higher than either lower limb. The median (IQR) PI for the entire cohort was 0.70 (0.29-1.35). No correlation existed between gestational age, birth weight, CRIB scores, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure and median PI values. CONCLUSION Perfusion Index measurement is reproducible, and values are highest in the right upper limb. Wide differences between right upper and lower limb readings are most likely related to transitional circulatory changes.","Kinoshita, Meredith; Hawkes, Colin Patrick; Ryan, C Anthony; Dempsey, Eugene Michael",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.12322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23772960/,361

Additive manufacturing (AM), the most efficient-material processing technology to date, has likewise made great strides to promote sustainable industrial solutions to our needs in engineered products. Bringing lignin research to AM has prompted the emergence of the nascent ""lignin 3D printing"" field. This review presents the recent state of art of this promising field and highlights its challenges and opportunities. Following a review of the industrial availability, molecular attributes, and associated properties of technical lignins, we review R&D efforts at implementing lignin systems in extrusion-based and stereolithography (SLA) printing technologies. Doing so underlines the adage of lignin research that ""all lignins are not created equal,"" and stresses the opportunity nested in this chemical diversity created mostly by differences in isolation conditions to molecularly select and tune the attributes of technical lignin systems towards desirable properties, be it by modification or polymer blending. Considering the AM design process in its entirety, we finally propose onward routes to bring the full potential to this emerging field. We hope that this review can help promote the unique value and overdue industrial role of lignin in sustainable engineered materials and products.","Ebers, L-S; Arya, Aditi; Bowland, C C; Glasser, W G; Chmely, S C; Naskar, A K; Laborie, M-P",Biopolymers,https://doi.org/10.1002/bip.23431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974275/,361

94172,COVID-19 and Children: The Mental & Physical Reverberations of the Pandemic.,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND Adverse events after rhinoplasty vary in etiology and severity, a fact that is reflected in the current American Society of Plastic Surgeons Rhinoplasty Consent. However, there is currently no literature providing a comprehensive summation of evidence-based quantifiable risk of adverse events after rhinoplasty. Given this limitation, patients considering rhinoplasty are unable to fully ascertain pre-operative risk, and the ability of physicians to obtain true informed consent is similarly flawed. This systematic review provides the first rigorous, comprehensive and quantitative reporting of adverse events after rhinoplasty. METHODS This review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018081826) in April 2018. Eligible articles were published in peer-reviewed journals with available abstracts and full-text articles. Interventions included primary functional, aesthetic, and combined functional/aesthetic rhinoplasty. The following data were extracted: Study size, population characteristics, indication, surgical approach, concomitant procedures, and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS A search yielded 3,215 publications for title and abstract screening. Two hundred and ninety-nine were eligible for full-text review. Thirty-six met final inclusion criteria. A total of 14 adverse events were reported among these studies, and included: need for revision, 0-10.9%; infection, 0-4%; dehiscence, 0-5%; bleeding, 0-4.1%; septal perforation, 0-2.6%; nasal airway obstruction requiring revision, 0-3%; hypertrophic scarring, 0-1.5%. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review presents the first comprehensive and quantitative reporting of adverse event frequency after rhinoplasty. This is a crucial tool for pre-operative patient counseling and an essential adjunct in the acquisition of informed consent. Future investigations will benefit from transparency and standardization of reporting to further quantify adverse event rates.","Sharif-Askary, Banafsheh; Carlson, Anna R; Van Noord, Megan G; Marcus, Jeffrey R",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000006561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31860512/,361

Objective To assess whether a correlation exists between COVID-19 incidence and chilblains incidence. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective cohort study was conducted within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020; health plan members of all ages were included. Exposure COVID-19 incidence in 207 location-months, representing 23 geographic locations in northern California across 9 months. Main Outcome and Measures Chilblains incidence was the main outcome. The association of chilblains incidence with COVID-19 incidence across the 207 location-months was measured using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results Of 780 patients with chilblains reported during the pandemic, 464 were female (59.5%); mean (SD) age was 36.8 (21.8) years. COVID-19 incidence was correlated with chilblains incidence at 207 location-months (Spearman coefficient 0.18; P = .01). However, only 17 of 456 (3.7%) patients with chilblains tested during the pandemic were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only 9 of 456 (2.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 6 weeks of the chilblains diagnosis. Test results of 1 of 97 (1.0%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Latinx patients were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 but not by chilblains. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that in northern California, the incidence of chilblains increased during the pandemic but was correlated weakly with the incidence of COVID-19 across 207 location-months. These findings may have resulted from a causal role of COVID-19, increased care-seeking by patients with chilblains during the pandemic, or changes in behavior during shelter in place.","McCleskey, Patrick E; Zimmerman, Bree; Lieberman, Amara; Liu, Liyan; Chen, Cynthia; Gorouhi, Farzam; Jacobson, Christine C; Lee, David S; Sriram, Achyuth; Thornton, Amanda; Herz, Arnd M; Mirmirani, Paradi; Herrinton, Lisa J",JAMA dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2021.2120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160569/,361

A total of 1,288 college students from four universities in Wuhu city participated in the study. LCA was used to identify the classes of sleep behaviors. Differences in class membership related to selected research factors were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis.Four distinct classes of behaviors were identified: (1) good sleep (Class 1, 31.8%), (2) prolonged sleep latency (Class 2, 49.1%), (3) sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction (Class 3, 6.8%), (4) multiple poor sleep behavior (Class 4, 12.3%). The latent classes of sleep behavior were correlated with the DBAS-16 total score (rs = -0.109, P < 0.001). Learning pressure and mental state during the day could affect overall sleep (Class 2, Class 3 and Class 4), and female students were at higher risk of severe sleep problems (Class 3 and Class 4), while bedtime exercised could improve mild sleep problems (Class 2).

Yet, the drivers and patterns of microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) in wild animals remain largely unexplored. One hypothesised outcome of stress on animal microbiomes is a destabilised microbial community that is characterised by an increase in inter-individual differences compared with microbiomes of healthy animals, which are expected to be (i) temporally stable and (ii) relatively similar among individuals. This set of predictions for response of microbiomes to stressors is known as the Anna Karenina principle (AKP) for animal microbiomes. We examine the AKP in a wild mammal inhabiting disturbed environments by conducting a capture-mark-recapture survey of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in areas that contrast in levels of radionuclide contamination (Chernobyl, Ukraine). Counter to key predictions of the AKP, bank voles that are not exposed to radionuclides harbour variable (increased inter-individual differences) and temporally dynamic gut microbiota communities, presumably tracking the natural spatio-temporal variation in resources. Conversely, bank voles exposed to radionuclides host more similar gut microbiota communities that are temporally stable, potentially due to a dysbiosis or selection (on host or bacteria) imposed by chronic radiation exposure. The implication of these data is that environmental stress (radiation exposure) can constrain the natural spatial and temporal variation of wild animal gut microbiota.","Lavrinienko, Anton; Tukalenko, Eugene; Kesäniemi, Jenni; Kivisaari, Kati; Masiuk, Sergii; Boratyński, Zbyszek; Mousseau, Timothy A; Milinevsky, Gennadi; Mappes, Tapio; Watts, Phillip C",The Journal of animal ecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939769/,361

MATERIALS AND METHODS The robot was used for CT-guided insertion of four ablation needles, namely a single internally cooled radiofrequency ablation (RFA) needle (Cool-tip), a multi-tined expandable RFA needle (LeVeen), a cryoablation needle (IceRod), and an internally cooled microwave ablation needle (Emprint). One author remotely operated the robot with the operation interface in order to orient and insert the needles under CT guidance. Five insertions of each type of ablation needle towards 1.0-mm targets in the liver, kidney, lung, and hip muscle were attempted on the plane of an axial CT image in six swine. Accuracy of needle insertion was evaluated as the three-dimensional length between the target centre and needle tip. The accuracy of needle insertion was compared according to the type of needle used and the location using one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS The overall mean accuracy of all four needles in all four locations was 2.8 mm. The mean accuracy of insertion of the Cool-tip needle, LeVeen needle, IceRod needle, and Emprint needle was 2.8 mm, 3.1 mm, 2.5 mm, and 2.7 mm, respectively. The mean accuracy of insertion into the liver, kidney, lung, and hip muscle was 2.7 mm, 2.9 mm, 2.9 mm, and 2.5 mm, respectively.

Objective To report practice patterns for common ocular complaints during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic among comprehensive ophthalmology practices in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cross-sectional study, 40 private practices and 20 university centers were randomly selected from 4 regions across the US. Data were collected on April 29 and 30, 2020. Interventions Investigators placed telephone calls to each ophthalmology practice office. Responses to 3 clinical scenarios-refraction request, cataract evaluation, and symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment-were compared regionally and between private and university centers. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary measure was time to next appointment for each of the 3 scenarios. Secondary measures included use of telemedicine and advertisement of COVID-19 precautions. Results Of the 40 private practices, 2 (5%) were closed, 24 (60%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 14 (35%) remained open to all patients. Of the 20 university centers, 2 (10%) were closed, 17 (85%) were only seeing urgent patients, and 1 (5%) remained open to all patients. There were no differences for any telemedicine metric. University centers were more likely than private practices to mention preparations to limit the spread of COVID-19 (17 of 20 [85%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]; mean difference, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26-0.65; P < .001). Private practices had a faster next available appointment for cataract evaluations than university centers, with a mean (SD) time to visit of 22.1 (27.0) days vs 75.5 (46.1) days (mean difference, 53.4; 95% CI, 23.1-83.7; P < .001).

100673,Novel impacts of saliva with regard to oral health.,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND Migraines are a chronic disease for millions worldwide and have been hypothesized to be hormonally mediated due to their higher prevalence in females and menstrual associations. Estrogen has been commonly implicated in migraine pathogenesis, yet its exact role in the pathophysiology of migraines has yet to be fully understood. METHOD We conducted a scoping review of the literature regarding estrogen's role in migraine pathogenesis and included 19 studies out of an initial 202 in the final review. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from included studies based on predetermined inclusions and exclusion criteria. RESULTS The estrogen withdrawal hypothesis, discussed by 12 of the reviewed studies, is the most discussed theory about estrogen's role in migraine physiology and describes the association of migraine onset with natural declines in estrogen levels, particularly when estrogen levels fall below 45-50 pg/mL after an extended period of priming. Additional findings suggest that women with a history of migraine have an increased sensitivity to physiologic fluctuations in estradiol levels. Several studies suggest that migraines are associated with menstruation. CONCLUSION It appears that estrogen is very likely to play a key role in migraine pathogenesis, but seems to affect patients in different ways depending on their past medical history, age, and use of hormonal therapy. Further research is warranted to isolate the effects of estrogen in each unique patient population, and we believe that studies comparing menstruating women to postmenopausal women could help shed light in this area.","Reddy, Nihaal; Desai, Miraj N; Schoenbrunner, Anna; Schneeberger, Steven; Janis, Jeffrey E",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01618-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33691790/,361
100802,Job Insecurity and Financial Concern during the COVID-19 Pandemic are Associated with Worse Mental Health.,2020-07-14,"Virus-induced membrane structures support the assembly and function of positive-strand RNA virus replication complexes. The replicase proteins of arteriviruses are associated with double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which were previously proposed to derive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using electron tomography, we performed an in-depth ultrastructural analysis of cells infected with the prototypic arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV). We established that the outer membranes of EAV-induced DMVs are interconnected with each other and with the ER, thus forming a reticulovesicular network (RVN) resembling that previously described for the distantly related severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Despite significant morphological differences, a striking parallel between the two virus groups, and possibly all members of the order Nidovirales, is the accumulation in the DMV interior of double-stranded RNA, the presumed intermediate of viral RNA synthesis. In our electron tomograms, connections between the DMV interior and cytosol could not be unambiguously identified, suggesting that the double-stranded RNA is compartmentalized by the DMV membranes. As a novel approach to visualize and quantify the RNA content of viral replication structures, we explored electron spectroscopic imaging of DMVs, which revealed the presence of phosphorus in amounts equaling on average a few dozen copies of the EAV RNA genome. Finally, our electron tomograms revealed a network of nucleocapsid protein-containing protein tubules that appears to be intertwined with the RVN. This potential intermediate in nucleocapsid formation, which was not observed in coronavirus-infected cells, suggests that arterivirus RNA synthesis and assembly are coordinated in intracellular space.","Knoops, Kèvin; Bárcena, Montserrat; Limpens, Ronald W A L; Koster, Abraham J; Mommaas, A Mieke; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06677-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22190716/,361
101959,Older Adults' Risk Perception during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Lombardy Region of Italy: A Cross-sectional Survey.,2021-01-03,"Blood blister-like aneurysms (BBA) were described for the first time in the 1990s, as small hemispherical bulges arising from a very fragile arterial wall. Until 2008, it was thought that this type of aneurysm almost exclusively affected the internal carotid artery, in particular, its dorsal portion. Subsequently, it was discovered that a BBA may also be present on the anterior communicating artery and on the vessels of the posterior cranial fossa. However, we found no reports in English-language literature of BBA arising from the middle cerebral artery (MCA). In this article, we present three cases of MCA BBA and discuss the unique diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of this vascular lesion. In our retrospective, multicenter review of 1330 patients with non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to our services from 2000 to 2013, we found three cases (all in men) of MCA BBA. The patients' outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin scale. All three patients underwent angio-computed tomography, which did not reveal any aneurysms. Digital subtraction angiography performed within 24-48 h after admission, in all cases, demonstrated a very small aneurysm (<2 mm), with a triangular shape and abroad base, at non-branching sites of MCA. All the aneurysms were treated: one by wrapping + clipping, one by wrapping + flow-diverter stent, and one with coils. At the time of surgery, the aneurysms appeared on the surface of the parent artery without any involvement of the branches. All presented as blister-like aneurysms that were thin-walled and lacked a surgical neck. At the time of discharge, the outcome was good in one patient and poor in the other two. Our cases demonstrate that BBA can also arise from the MCA, despite the lack of previous reports of this occurrence; a BBA should be suspected, particularly in cases of non-perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage in which the presence of a MCA aneurysm is suspected but not revealed by digital subtraction angiography or angio-computed tomography.","Peschillo, Simone; Missori, P; Piano, M; Cannizzaro, D; Guidetti, G; Santoro, A; Cenzato, M",Neurosurgical review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10143-014-0581-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323097/,361

Anticoagulation can prevent pregnancy morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the addition of immune suppressants to anticoagulation can prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss in UCTD patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and low-dose prednisone on recurrent pregnancy loss for women with UCTD. METHODS The Immunosuppressant for Living Fetuses (ILIFE) Trial is a three-arm, multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial with the primary objective of comparing hydroxychloroquine combined with low-dose prednisone and anticoagulation with anticoagulation alone in treating UCTD women with recurrent spontaneous abortion. The third arm of using hydroxychloroquine combined with anticoagulant for secondary comparison. A total of 426 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to each of the three arms with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome is the rate of live births. Secondary outcomes include adverse pregnancy outcomes and progression of UCTD. DISCUSSION This is the first multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial which evaluates the efficacy of immunosuppressant regimens on pregnancy outcomes and UCTD progression. It will provide evidence on whether the immunosuppressant ameliorates the pregnancy prognosis in UCTD patients with RSA and the progression into defined connective tissue disease.

AREAS COVERED The authors review evidence on IL-6 and IL-6 blockade in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and discuss the pathophysiological and prognostic roles of this cytokine and the clinical impact of pharmacological blockade of IL-6 blockade. Material includes original articles and reviews published from March 2020 to March 2021 and searched on PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. EXPERT OPINION IL-6 is one the most prominent inflammatory cytokines. Increased levels were recorded in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe-to-critical disease. Evidence is accumulating on the relevance of IL-6 as a prognostic marker in COVID-19, including need for mechanical ventilation and death. Since IL-6 is a druggable target for several inflammatory diseases, blockers of the IL-6 signaling pathway were repurposed to block the abnormal SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine release. Data are limited to few randomized controlled trials that reported encouraging, though not conclusive, results, indicating the usefulness of IL-6 blockade early in the course of disease in patients with hyperinflammation and no or limited organ damage. Further research is warranted to explore the role of IL-6 in different COVID-19 phenotypes and identify subgroups of patients who may mostly benefit from IL-6 pathway inhibition.","Potere, Nicola; Batticciotto, Alberto; Vecchié, Alessandra; Porreca, Ettore; Cappelli, Antonella; Abbate, Antonio; Dentali, Francesco; Bonaventura, Aldo",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2021.1919086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33874829/,361

METHODS The medical records of 500 consecutive patients who underwent laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery performed by a single surgeon for benign disease from August 2008 to October 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The surgeries included hysterectomy (n = 239), adnexectomy (n = 212), and myomectomy (n = 51). The indications for surgery included adnexal lesions (48.1%), uterine fibroids (37.8%), preinvasive cervical disease (7.5%), and endometrial pathology (6.6%). Twenty-nine percent of the first 100 cases were single-port laparoscopic surgeries. The percentages increased in the second (62%), third (72%), fourth (71%), and last (86%) 100 cases. The percentages of laparotomy and multiport laparoscopy were 23% and 48%, respectively, in the first 100 cases; however, in the last 100 cases, the percentages dropped to 4% and 10%, respectively. A significant reduction in estimated blood loss and length of hospital stay was observed for all diseases. No differences were identified in the median operative time or complication rate over the study period. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery can be applied to most benign gynecologic surgery without detrimental effects on clinical outcomes.","Lee, Maria; Kim, Sang Wun; Nam, Eun Ji; Yim, Ga Won; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Young Tae",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2030-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22044982/,361

105557,Should Sensory Impairment Be Considered in Frailty Assessment? A Study in the GAZEL Cohort.,2016,"OBJECTIVES We compared 2 imaging modalities in patients suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Blinded to the results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, lung ultrasound (LUS) examinations and chest computed tomography (CT) were performed, and the specific characteristics of these imaging studies were assessed. METHODS From March 15, 2020, to April 15, 2020, 63 consecutive patients were enrolled in this prospective pilot study. All patients underwent hematochemical tests, LUS examinations, chest CT, and confirmatory rRT-PCR. The diagnostic performance of LUS and chest CT was calculated with rRT-PCR as a reference. The interobserver agreement of radiologists and ultrasound examiners was calculated. Ultrasound and CT features were compared to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Positive and negative likelihood ratios measured the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS Nineteen (30%) patients were COVID-19 negative, and 44 (70%) were positive. No differences in demographics and clinical data at presentation were observed among positive and negative patients. Interobserver agreement for CT had a κ value of 0.877, whereas for LUS, it was 0.714. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia were 93%, 90%, 85%, and 95%, respectively; whereas for LUS, they were 68%, 79%, 88%, and 52%. On receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve values were 0.834 (95% confidence interval, 0.711-0.958) and 0.745 (95% confidence interval, 0.606-0.884) for chest CT and LUS. CONCLUSIONS Lung ultrasound had good reliability compared to chest CT. Therefore, our results indicate that LUS may be used to assess patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia.","Fonsi, Giovanni Battista; Sapienza, Paolo; Brachini, Gioia; Andreoli, Chiara; De Cicco, Maria Luisa; Cirillo, Bruno; Meneghini, Simona; Pugliese, Francesco; Crocetti, Daniele; Fiori, Enrico; Mingoli, Andrea",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jum.15487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894583/,361

The aim of our study was to analyze incidence and outcomes of AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Our study prospectively followed about 198 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), Al Adan Hospital, Kuwait, for developing AKI and outcomes. Age, gender, nationality, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, bronchial asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were analyzed. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, inotropes, and medications was recorded. Causes of AKI, indication of dialysis, dialysis modality, dialysis outcomes, and mortality were analyzed. Our study reported that61 out of 198 (30.8%) ICU patients positive for COVID-19, developed AKI according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definition of AKI. Forty-eight out of 61 (79%) patients need continuous renal replacement therapy using continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Thirty-seven (61%) out of 61 patients were with severe sepsis syndrome. The most common cause of AKI was sepsis, cytokine storm, hypovolemia, heart failure, MV, and nephrotoxic drugs. Twenty-four patients (39%) out of 61 patients died, and the most common cause of death was sepsis, cytokine storm with respiratory failure, heart failure, and AKI. The outcome of AKI was as follows: six patients (10%) had complete recovery, five patients had partial recovery (8%), and 26 (43%) patients became dialysis dependent. Incidence of AKI is high in ICU COVID-19 patients and is associated with poor outcomes and high mortality. Early detection and specific therapy of kidney changes, including adequate hemodynamic support and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, may help to improve critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Abdallah, Emad; Al Helal, Bassam; Asad, Reem; Hemida, Mohamed; Nawar, Ehab; Kamal, Mohammad; Reda, Mahmoud; Baharia, Ahmed; Galal, Ahmed; Hassan, Ali; Awaga, Ahmed; Salam, Mostafa; Shama, Abdelfatah","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",https://doi.org/10.4103/1319-2442.318551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145117/,361

Scalp necrosis is very rare due to its rich vascularity. However, any post-traumatic wounds with secondary infection can lead to scalp necrosis. CASE PRESENTATION We report a case of a 77-year-old Azerbaijani man with a history of diabetes who had a car accident and sustained a scalp wound. He underwent reconstructive surgery for the scalp wound. The wound became infected, and scalp necrosis developed following the surgery. There was no progress in wound healing in spite of conventional wound therapy. We combined maggot debridement therapy with negative-pressure wound therapy and amniotic membrane grafting for 7 months. Necrotic tissues began to be eliminated after the second use of larva therapy, and the wound became free of necrotic tissues with clear increase of granulated tissues after four treatments with maggot debridement therapy. Then, we applied negative-pressure wound therapy and amniotic membrane grafting to accelerate wound healing and improve wound closure. The patient's scalp wound recovered well, and he was discharged to home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Medical and wound care teams can benefit from this combination therapy when dealing with nonhealing necrotic wounds.","Hajmohammadi, Kazem; Esmaeili Zabihi, Roghayeh; Akbarzadeh, Kamran; Parizad, Naser",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-020-02450-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814571/,361

However, little is known about the relationships between the measures of digital health intervention engagement and physical activity or sedentary behavior. OBJECTIVE This study aims to describe the direction and strength of the association between engagement with digital health interventions and physical activity or sedentary behavior in adults and explore whether the direction of association of digital health intervention engagement with physical activity or sedentary behavior varies with the type of engagement with the digital health intervention (ie, subjective experience, activities completed, time, and logins). METHODS Four databases were searched from inception to December 2019. Grey literature and reference lists of key systematic reviews and journals were also searched. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they examined a quantitative association between a measure of engagement with a digital health intervention targeting physical activity and a measure of physical activity or sedentary behavior in adults (aged ≥18 years). Studies that purposely sampled or recruited individuals on the basis of pre-existing health-related conditions were excluded. In addition, studies were excluded if the individual engaging with the digital health intervention was not the target of the physical activity intervention, the study had a non-digital health intervention component, or the digital health interventions targeted multiple health behaviors. A random effects meta-analysis and direction of association vote counting (for studies not included in meta-analysis) were used to address objective 1. Objective 2 used vote counting on the direction of the association. RESULTS Overall, 10,653 unique citations were identified and 375 full texts were reviewed. Of these, 19 studies (26 associations) were included in the review, with no studies reporting a measure of sedentary behavior. A meta-analysis of 11 studies indicated a small statistically significant positive association between digital health engagement (based on all usage measures) and physical activity (0.08, 95% CI 0.01-0.14, SD 0.11). Heterogeneity was high, with 77% of the variation in the point estimates explained by the between-study heterogeneity. Vote counting indicated that the relationship between physical activity and digital health intervention engagement was consistently positive for three measures: subjective experience measures (2 of 3 associations), activities completed (5 of 8 associations), and logins (6 of 10 associations). However, the direction of associations between physical activity and time-based measures of usage (time spent using the intervention) were mixed (2 of 5 associations supported the hypothesis, 2 were inconclusive, and 1 rejected the hypothesis). CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate a weak but consistent positive association between engagement with a physical activity digital health intervention and physical activity outcomes. No studies have targeted sedentary behavior outcomes. The findings were consistent across most constructs of engagement; however, the associations were weak.","Mclaughlin, Matthew; Delaney, Tessa; Hall, Alix; Byaruhanga, Judith; Mackie, Paul; Grady, Alice; Reilly, Kathryn; Campbell, Elizabeth; Sutherland, Rachel; Wiggers, John; Wolfenden, Luke",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/23180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605897/,361

The use of disposable surgical masks is common for patients, doctors, and even the general public in highly risky areas. However, the current surgical masks cannot self-sterilize in order to reuse or be recycled for other applications. The resulting high economic and environmental costs are further damaging societies worldwide. Herein, we reported a unique method for functionalizing commercially available surgical masks with outstanding self-cleaning and photothermal properties. A dual-mode laser-induced forward transfer method was developed for depositing few-layer graphene onto low-melting temperature nonwoven masks. Superhydrophobic states were observed on the treated masks' surfaces, which can cause the incoming aqueous droplets to bounce off. Under sunlight illumination, the surface temperature of the functional mask can quickly increase to over 80 °C, making the masks reusable after sunlight sterilization. In addition, this graphene-coated mask can be recycled directly for use in solar-driven desalination with outstanding salt-rejection performance for long-term use. These roll-to-roll production-line-compatible masks can provide us with better protection against this severe virus. The environment can also benefit from the direct recycling of these masks, which can be used for desalinating seawater.","Zhong, Hong; Zhu, Zhaoran; Lin, Jing; Cheung, Chi Fai; Lu, Vivien L; Yan, Feng; Chan, Ching-Yuen; Li, Guijun",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c02250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329600/,361

However, while some citizens panicked about the looming health crisis, others remained calm, offering explanations for why a rapid spread of the virus was unlikely. Examining the distinctions between these different reactions can contribute to a better understanding of the coping strategies citizens use when facing a health crisis. We consider how citizens respond to fear by focusing on whether or not hyperbolic rhetoric was used as a means for processing and managing fear. Approximately 400 tweets and Facebook posts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the White House, and The Alex Jones Show were examined to make conclusions about how citizens respond to messages from these mediated forums. At the intersection of health communication and critical rhetoric, we advance an operational definition of health hyperbolism derived from public response to opinion leaders.

Here, we describe 3 different maneuvers to achieve greater access to orbital contents through an expanded endonasal approach (EEA). METHODS Four human cadaver heads were dissected bilaterally (n = 8). EEA to the medial intraconal orbit was executed. The following 3 maneuvers were performed: (1) anterior: extraocular muscles control (EOM); (2) posterior: annulus of Zinn (AZ) release; and (3) anterior/posterior combined. Measurements of the inferior and medial rectus corridor at the level of anterior ethmoidal artery (AEA) and posterior ethmoidal artery (PEA) and extent of optic nerve and medial rectus visualization was performed before and after each maneuver. RESULTS Medial rectus length (MRL) and optic nerve length (ONL) achieved were 1.72 ± 0.28 cm and 0.85 ± 0.2 cm, respectively. Mean caudal-rostral distances between the rectus muscles at the level of the AEA and PEA were 3.45 ± 0.7 mm and 1.30 ± 0.3 mm, respectively. After EOM control, mean caudal-rostral distances at the same level were as follows: AEA 4.90 ± 1.15 mm (p = 0.009) and PEA 1.70 ± 0.20 mm (p = 0.016). With AZ release, MRL was 2.20 ± 0.7 cm (p = 0.002) and ONL was 1.30 ± 0.2 cm (p = 0.003), with mean rostral-caudal distance at the level of AEA at 4.03 ± 0.8 mm (p = 0.16) and PEA at 1.71 ± 0.36 mm (p = 0.039). Mean caudal-rostral distances achieved with AZ release and EOM control were as follows: AEA 5.6 ± 1.2 mm (p = 0.001) and PEA 2.15 ± 0.4 mm (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION Progressive access to the orbital contents is afforded with the 3 delineated maneuvers. The magnitude of access is optimized with the combined maneuver. The actual anterior/posterior location of the target will determine which maneuvers are required.","Lemos-Rodriguez, Ana M; Farzal, Zainab; Overton, Lewis J; Rawal, Rounak B; Eftekhari, Kian; Sasaki-Adams, Deanna; Ewend, Matthew; Thorp, Brian D; Ebert, Charles S; Zanation, Adam M",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.22271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576084/,361
108465,The impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on mental health in general population in different areas in China.,2020-12-10,"RATIONALE To open new ways for MALDI-MS-based patient screening, blood serum is the most preferred specimen because of its richness in patho-physiological information and due to ease of collection. To overcome deleterious freeze/thaw cycles and to reduce high costs for shipping and storage, we sought to develop a procedure which enables MALDI-MS protein profiling of blood serum proteins without the need for serum freezing. METHODS Blood sera from patients/donors were divided into portions which after pre-incubation were fast frozen. Thawed aliquots were deposited on filter paper discs and air dried at room temperature. Intact serum proteins were eluted with acid-labile detergent-containing solutions and were desalted by employing a reverse-phase bead system. Purified protein solutions were screened by MALDI-MS using standardized instrument settings. RESULTS MALDI mass spectra from protein solutions which were eluted from filter paper discs and desalted showed on average 25 strong ion signals (mass range m/z 6000 to m/z 10,000) from intact serum proteins (apolipoproteins, complement proteins, transthyretin and hemoglobin) and from proteolytic processing products. Semi-quantitative analysis of three ion pairs: m/z 6433 and 6631, m/z 8205 and 8916, as well as m/z 9275 and 9422 indicated that the mass spectra from either pre-incubated fast-frozen serum or pre-incubated dried serum spot eluted serum contained the same information on protein composition. CONCLUSIONS A workflow that avoids the conventional cold-chain and yet enables to investigate intact serum proteins and/or serum proteolysis products by MALDI-MS profiling was developed. The here described protocol tremendously broadens clinical application of MALDI-MS and simultaneously allows to reduce the costs for storage and shipping of serum samples. This will pave the way for clinical screening of patients also in areas with limited access to health care systems, and/or specialized laboratories.","Okai, Charles A; Wölter, Manja; Russ, Manuela; Koy, Cornelia; Petre, Brindusa A; Rath, Werner; Pecks, Ulrich; Glocker, Michael O",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.9121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955049/,361
109591,Health Workers' Risks for Respiratory Virus.,2016,"Background Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding has not been well characterized. Methods In our study, 652 patients in Wuhan Designated Hospital were recruited, and their clinical and laboratory findings were extracted and analyzed. Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 23 days [interquartile range (IQR), 18 days] from symptom onset. Compared to patients with early viral RNA clearance (<23 days after illness onset), we found that patients with late viral RNA clearance (≥23 days) had a higher proportion of clinical features, as follows: symptoms, including fever, dry cough, and sputum production; comorbidities, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, uremia, chronic liver disease, anemia, hyperlipidemia, and bilateral lung involvement; complications, such as liver injury; delayed admission to hospital; laboratory parameters at baseline, including higher eosinophils, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, and lower hemoglobin; and less treatment with arbidol, chloroquine, or any antivirals. After generalized linear regression, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was independently associated with younger age; delayed admission to hospital; symptoms including fever, shivering, and sputum production; comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, anemia, hyperlipidemia, uremia, and lung involvement; and higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid, and cholesterol levels at baseline. Conclusions In conclusion, the factors mentioned above are associated with the negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A deeper insight into virological dynamics will be helpful for establishing patient discharge and quarantine release criteria.","Zhou, Yan; Ding, Fengming; Bao, Wuping; Xue, Yishu; Han, Lei; Zhang, Xue; Zhang, Pengyu; Ji, Yong; Yin, Dongning; Bao, Aihua; Luo, Shan; Xu, Zengchao; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Min",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-21-445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987363/,361
111999,Mental Health and COVID-19: The Psychological Implications of a Pandemic for Nurses.,2021-02-01,"SARS-CoV-2 continues to infect thousands of people around the world. It has been established that the main transmission mechanism of this virus is via airborne route, which is why it initially infects the respiratory tract. Currently, the effectiveness of medications used against COVID-19 is limited, and although immunization programs have been initiated, there is international inequality in the distribution of vaccines. Accordingly, the search for adjuvant therapies continues to be an alternative for research. Supplementation with vitamin A has been associated to the decrease of mortality from infection; this effect could be mediated by retinoic acid (RA), which is the active metabolite of vitamin A that exerts immunomodulatory functions. According to preclinical studies, RA favors the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the respiratory tract. In addition to this, the retinol-binding protein has been correlated with the concentration of IgA and neutralizing antibodies in patients with influenza. Therefore, this review aims to address the involvement of vitamin A in the production of secretory IgA in the respiratory epithelium in order to highlight its potential protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Turrubiates-Hernández, Francisco Javier; Hernández-Bello, Jorge; Oregón-Romero, Edith; González-Estevez, Guillermo; Muñoz-Valle, José Francisco",Revista alergia Mexico,https://doi.org/10.29262/ram.v68i3.977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634849/,361
112494,Transformative health promotion: what is needed to advance progress?,2021-06-23,"BACKGROUND Worldwide Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) treatment is of great challenge due to increased antibiotic resistance. The burden of H. pylori antibiotic resistance in Africa is high with unclear information regarding the real magnitude. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the magnitude of H.pylori antibiotic resistance in Africa to gain insight of the extent of the problem among H.pylori naïve treatment patients. METHOD The search was performed in the academic databases, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science and Africa Wide Information. ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, Scopus, Ethos, Africa Index Medicus (WHO), BioMed Central Proceedings, BASE, British Library, Open grey, Library of Congress and the New York Academy of Grey Literature Report were additionally searched for grey literature. Published articles from Africa on H.pylori antibiotic resistance between 1986 and June 2017 were systematically reviewed to estimate the H. pylori extent of resistance to macrolides, quinolones, amoxicillin, tetracycline and metronidazole. RESULTS In 26 articles a total of 2085 isolates were tested for metronidazole, 1530 for amoxicillin, 1277 for tetracycline, 1752 for clarithromycin and 823 for quinolones.The overall pooled proportion of H.pylori resistance to quinolones, clarithromycin, tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin were: (17.4%, 95%CI 12.8 - 21.9), (29.2%, 95%CI:26.7-31.8), (48.7%, 95%CI: 44.5-52.9), (75.8%, 95% CI: 74.1-.77.4) and (72.6%, 95% CI: 68.6-76.6), respectively. The commonest mutation detected were A2143G (49/97) for clarithromycin, RdxA (41/56) for metronidazole and D87I (16/40) for quinolones. CONCLUSION Prevalence of metronidazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin resistance is high in developing world including Africa. This could impair the first line triple therapy of the H.pylori infection. There is a need of conducting surveillance of H.pylori susceptibility pattern in Africa for dual and triple resistance which can be used for the empirical treatment.","Jaka, Hyasinta; Rhee, Jee Ah; Östlundh, Linda; Smart, Luke; Peck, Robert; Mueller, Andreas; Kasang, Christa; Mshana, Stephen E",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3099-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29699490/,361

Melamine sponge was utilized as seawater transportation medium since its porous structure is excellent in channeling the seawater. Whereas carbonized rice husk was used as the photothermal conversion material for its efficient heat absorption due to its black color and porous structure. Implementing air gap between the seawater body and solar absorber, and restricted water pathway assisted in localizing heat on the top surface of solar absorber. Clean water was generated under direct solar radiation during the day at an open space with average solar intensity around 1.1 ∼ 1.2 kW/m2 (slightly higher than 1 sun) for about four hours. Efficiency of the solar absorber was calculated, while the quality of the generated clean water was observed in terms of salinity and pH value. Insulated solar still with carbon-coated sponge showed the highest efficiency at about 54.74%. Salinity of the collected clean water significantly reduced to consumable level which was approximately 55 ppm, and the pH value at about 6.63 where it was within the safe limit of the drinkable water pH.","Karen, Wong Min Jin; Wong, C Y; Wang, Zhipeng; Liew, Willey Y H; Melvin, G J H",Environmental technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2021.1970820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407722/,361
114227,Increased importance of digital medicine and eHealth during the Covid-19 pandemic.,2020-06-02,"During a disaster, all hospitals are expected to function as ""social critical institutions"" that protect the lives and health of people. In recent disasters, numerous hospitals were damaged, and this hampered the recovery of the affected communities. Had these hospitals business continuity plans (BCPs) to recover quickly after the disaster, most of the damage could have been avoided. This study conducted a scoping review of the historical trend and regional differences in hospital BCPs to validate the improvement of the BCP concept based on our own experience at Tohoku University Hospital, which was affected by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami (GEJET). We searched PubMed by using keywords related to BCP and adapted 97 articles for our analysis. The number of articles on hospital BCPs has increased in the 2000s, especially after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. While there are regional specificity of hazards, there were many common topics and visions for BCP implementation, education, and drills. From our 2011 GEJET experience, we found that BCPs assuming region-specific disasters are applicable in various types of disasters. Thus, we suggest the following integral and universal components for hospital BCPs: (1) alternative methods and resources, (2) priority of operation, and (3) resource management. Even if the type and extent of disasters vary, the development of BCPs and business continuity management strategies that utilize the abovementioned integral components can help a hospital survive disasters in the future.","Sasaki, Hiroyuki; Maruya, Hiroaki; Abe, Yoshiko; Fujita, Motoo; Furukawa, Hajime; Fuda, Mikiko; Kamei, Takashi; Yaegashi, Nobuo; Tominaga, Teiji; Egawa, Shinichi",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.251.147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641641/,361

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS 46 medium- to large-breed dogs with primary lung tumors. PROCEDURES Medical records of dogs that underwent a lung lobectomy via VATS (n = 22) or OT (24) for resection of primary lung tumors between 2004 and 2012 were reviewed. Dogs were included if they weighed > 10 kg (22 lb) and resection of a primary lung tumor was confirmed histologically. Tumor volumes were calculated from preoperative CT scans where available. Surgical time, completeness of excision, time in the ICU, indwelling thoracic drain time, postoperative and total hospitalization time, incidence of major complications, and short-term survival rate were evaluated. RESULTS VATS was performed with a 3-port (n = 12) or 4-port (10) technique and 1-lung ventilation (22). In 2 of 22 (9%) dogs, VATS was converted to OT. All dogs survived to discharge from the hospital. There were no significant differences between the VATS and OT groups with regard to most variables. Surgery time was significantly longer for VATS than for OT (median, 120 vs 95 minutes, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In medium- to large-breed dogs, short-term outcomes for dogs that underwent VATS for lung lobectomy were comparable to those of dogs that underwent OT.

114613,Setting priority areas for WPA's new triennium.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Prior studies have demonstrated a correlation between surgical skill and complication rates after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. However, the impact of surgical skill on a similar but less technically challenging procedure such as sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is unknown. METHODS Practicing bariatric surgeons (n = 25) participating in a statewide quality improvement collaborative submitted an unedited deidentified video of a representative laparoscopic SG. Videos were obtained between 2015 and 2016 and were rated by bariatric surgeons in a blinded fashion using a validated instrument that assesses surgical skill. Overall scores were based on a 5-point Likert scale with 5 representing a ""master surgeon"" and 1 representing a ""surgeon-in-training."" Risk-adjusted 30-day complication rates, 1-year weight loss among cases performed during the study period, and operative technique were compared between surgeons rated in the top and bottom quartiles according to skill. RESULTS Surgeon ratings for skill varied between 2.73 and 4.60. Ratings for skill did not correlate with overall 30-day risk-adjusted complication rates (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.213, P = 0.303). However, surgeons with higher skill ratings had lower rates of specific surgical complications, including postoperative obstruction (0.13% vs 0.3%, P = 0.017), hemorrhage (0.85% vs 1.27%, P = 0.005), and reoperation (0.24% vs 0.92%, P < 0.0001). Surgeons ranked in the top quartile for skill had faster operating times for SG (59.0 vs 82.1 min, P < 0.0001) and higher annual case volumes for both SG and any bariatric procedure (224.3 cases/yr vs 73.4 cases/yr, P = 0.009 and 244.9 cases/yr and 93.9 cases/yr, P = 0.009) when compared with surgeons in the bottom quartile. When comparing operative technique, top rated surgeons were noted to have a higher likelihood of using buttressing (83.3% vs 0%, P = 0.0041) and intraoperative endoscopy (83.3% vs 0%, P = 0.0041). CONCLUSIONS Peer ratings for surgical skill varied for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy but did not have a significant impact on overall complication rates. Top rated surgeons had lower rates of obstruction, hemorrhage, and reoperation; however, severe morbidity remained extremely low among all surgeons.","Varban, Oliver A; Thumma, Jyothi R; Finks, Jonathan F; Carlin, Arthur M; Ghaferi, Amir A; Dimick, Justin B",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000003385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31188214/,361

When using the Onyx, it is essential to wait for the creation of a plug around the tip of the catheter, which enables the effective forward penetration of Onyx. Recent reports have shown that the introduction of a dimethyl sulfoxide compatible dual-lumen balloon microcatheter improves the efficiency of AVM embolization. We report our recent experience of two cases of intracranial AVM embolization using Onyx and the transarterial balloon-assisted technique. In both cases, the procedures were successfully performed and the nidus of the AVM was totally occluded in a relatively short time. This technique may enable immediate forward flow and penetration of Onyx without concern about reflux. It may also reduce the procedure time and increase the angiographic occlusion rate.

116889,Therapist self-disclosure: Let's tackle the elephant in the room.,2021-02-11,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and control of local bioavailability of free IGF by the IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) are important regulators of both mammary development and breast cancer. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified small nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce the expression of IGFBP-5 as a risk factor of developing breast cancer. This observation suggests that genetic alterations leading to a decreased level of IGFBP-5 may also contribute to breast cancer. In the current review, we focus on Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), a protease involved in the degradation of IGFBP-5. PAPP-A is overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers but its role in cancer has only begun to be explored. More specifically, this review aims at highlighting the role of post-partum involution in the oncogenic function of PAPP-A. Notably, we summarize recent studies indicating that PAPP-A plays a role not only in the degradation of IGFBP-5 but also in the deposition of collagen and activation of the collagen receptor discoidin 2 (DDR2) during post-partum involution. Finally, considering the immunosuppressive microenvironment of post-partum involution, we also discuss the unexpected finding made in Ewing Sarcoma that PAPP-A plays a role in immune evasion. While the immunosuppressive role of PAPP-A in breast cancer remains to be determined, collectively these studies highlight the multifaced role of PAPP-A in cancer that extends well beyond its effect on IGF-signaling.","Jenkins, Edmund Charles; Brown, Samantha O; Germain, Doris",Journal of mammary gland biology and neoplasia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10911-020-09456-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901383/,361

Objective To examine whether use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants To examine outcomes among patients with COVID-19, a retrospective cohort study using data from Danish national administrative registries was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 from February 22 to May 4, 2020, were identified using ICD-10 codes and followed up from day of diagnosis to outcome or end of study period (May 4, 2020). To examine susceptibility to COVID-19, a Cox regression model with a nested case-control framework was used to examine the association between use of ACEI/ARBs vs other antihypertensive drugs and the incidence rate of a COVID-19 diagnosis in a cohort of patients with hypertension from February 1 to May 4, 2020. Exposures ACEI/ARB use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date. Main Outcomes and Measures In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe COVID-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis. Results In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years [interquartile range, 40.9-72.0]; 47.9% men). There were 895 users (20.0%) of ACEI/ARBs and 3585 nonusers (80.0%). In the ACEI/ARB group, 18.1% died within 30 days vs 7.3% in the nonuser group, but this association was not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and medical history (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-1.03]). Death or severe COVID-19 occurred in 31.9% of ACEI/ARB users vs 14.2% of nonusers by 30 days (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]). In the nested case-control analysis of COVID-19 susceptibility, 571 patients with COVID-19 and prior hypertension (median age, 73.9 years; 54.3% men) were compared with 5710 age- and sex-matched controls with prior hypertension but not COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 86.5% used ACEI/ARBs vs 85.4% of controls; ACEI/ARB use compared with other antihypertensive drugs was not significantly associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.80-1.36]). Conclusions and Relevance Prior use of ACEI/ARBs was not significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with hypertension or with mortality or severe disease among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19.

The present study aimed to find out the association between viral infection in exacerbated and stable patients with COPD as well as evaluating the frequency of respiratory viruses in the Iranian exacerbated patients. METHODS The study included 170 patients as the sample group with acute exacerbations and a control group consisting of 96 stable patients over a period of 3 years. Reverse transcription- nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR) and nested PCR methods were used to diagnose the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. RESULTS Viral infection was detected in 81 (47.6%) exacerbations and 24 (25%) stable patients (p < 0.05). Adenovirus was more frequent among the exacerbated patients than the stable patients (p < 0.05). Furthermore, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and enterovirus turned out to be the most common viruses in both groups. Moreover, respiratory viral co-infection has a possible role in exacerbation, severity, and longer hospitalization. Muscle pain and fever were found as significant symptoms in the infected patients with exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS The current study investigated the probable roles of the respiratory viruses, and dual infections during acute exacerbations of COPD. Since climate-dependent respiratory viral incidence patterns in Iran are often dissimilar, preparing a comprehensive global model of respiratory infections with seasonal details in different geographical zones might decrease the morbidity and mortality rate in exacerbations of COPD.","Hosseini, Seyedeh Somayeh; Ghasemian, Ehsan; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Tabaraie, Bahman; Amini, Zeynab; Cox, Kelsey",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3109/23744235.2015.1022873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25800059/,361

Because of differences in patient demographics and stroke disease pattern in Asia, outcomes of ticagrelor versus aspirin were assessed among Asian patients in a prespecified exploratory analysis. METHODS Baseline demographics, treatment effects, and safety of ticagrelor and aspirin were assessed among Asian patients. Differences in outcomes between groups were assessed using Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS A total of 3858 (29.2%) SOCRATES participants were recruited in Asia. Among the Asian patients, the primary end point event occurred in 186 (9.6%) of the 1933 patients treated with ticagrelor, versus 224 (11.6%) of the 1925 patients treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.99). The exploratory P value for treatment-by-region interaction was 0.27. The primary end point event rate in the Asian subgroup was numerically higher than that in the non-Asian group (10.6% versus 5.7%; nominal P<0.01). Among the Asian patients, the rate of PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)-defined major bleeding was similar in the ticagrelor group and the aspirin group (0.6% versus 0.8%; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-1.61). CONCLUSIONS The event rates were numerically higher in the Asian patients. Among the Asian patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attacks, there was a trend toward a lower hazard ratio in reducing risk of the primary end point of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death in the ticagrelor group.

To identify themes, gaps, and sources of evidence from the literature regarding the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA) to inform practice and additional areas for research in pharmacy education.Findings. Nineteen articles describing the administration and use of PCOA were identified. Since PCOA was made a curricular requirement by the Accreditation Council of Pharmacy Education in 2016, the focus of literature related to the PCOA has shifted from administration practices (four articles published before 2016 vs two articles published since) to determining models that may predict student performance on the assessment (two vs five articles) or how the examination might be used to predict future performance (one vs seven articles), especially on the North American Pharmacist Licensing Examination. While there is a growing body of literature focused on the PCOA's utility for measuring performance, few variables have been consistently used.Summary. This review found no studies with objectives that aligned with the initial intended use of the PCOA as defined by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, which included tracking individual student performance throughout the curriculum, benchmarking programs against other programs, and evaluating whether a program was meeting their desired outcomes. Additionally, no consensus across the Academy was found as to the proper use of the PCOA, and a paucity of literature exists regarding how the PCOA informs schools and colleges about the effectiveness of their curriculum. There is a need for the Academy to establish a uniform application for the PCOA in pharmacy schools, assess the resources that programs need to administer this required assessment, and determine the utility of the PCOA to measure curricular effectiveness and/or student performance.","Nelson, Nicholas R; Anderson, Sarah M; Zeeman, Jacqueline M; Rhoney, Denise H",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34615626/,361

We present here a protocol for the identification of PDIs in vitro using protein microarray technology. The procedure involves double-stranding synthesized DNA oligonucleotides with a fluorescent-labeled primer, binding the labeled double-stranded DNA directly to the protein microarray, and analyzing binding of the resulting PDIs. This approach provides simultaneous identification of PDIs for thousands of proteins, and multiple carefully designed DNA probes can be tested in parallel, which enables a rapid mapping of PDIs on a proteome-wide scale.","Hu, Shaohui; Xie, Zhi; Blackshaw, Seth; Qian, Jiang; Zhu, Heng",Cold Spring Harbor protocols,https://doi.org/10.1101/pdb.prot5614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536762/,361

FitSkills was developed to support young people with disability to exercise. The primary aims are to investigate if FitSkills can be scaled up from a small, university-led programme to run as a larger community-university partnership programme, and to determine its effectiveness in improving physical activity participation and health-related quality of life for young people with disability. The secondary aims are to evaluate cost-effectiveness, changes in attitudes towards disability and other health-related outcomes for young people with disability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial using a cohort design and embedded health economic evaluation will compare the effect of FitSkills with a control phase. FitSkills matches a young person with disability with a student mentor and the pair exercise together at their local gymnasium for 1 hour, two times per week for 12 weeks (24 sessions in total). One hundred and sixty young people with disability aged 13 to 30 years will be recruited. Eight community gymnasia will be recruited and randomised into four cluster units to have FitSkills introduced at 3-month intervals. Primary (feasibility, participation and health-related quality of life) and secondary outcomes will be collected longitudinally every 3 months from trial commencement, with eight data collection time points in total. The Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model will be used to support knowledge translation and implementation of project findings into policy and practice.

At the same time there has been a growing increase in antibiotic resistant so-called ""superbugs."" We examine here the potential role of body temperature measurement in these adverse trends. Electronic based thermometers have replaced traditional mercury (and other liquid-in-glass type) thermometers for reasons of safety rather than superiority. Electronic thermometers are in general less robust from a measurement perspective than their predecessors. We illustrate the implications of unreliable temperature measurement on the diagnosis and management of disease, including COVID-19, through statistical calculations. Since a return to mercury thermometers is both undesirable and impractical, we call for better governance in the current practice of clinical thermometry to ensure the traceability and long-term accuracy of electronic thermometers and discuss how this could be achieved.","Machin, Graham; Brettle, David; Fleming, Susannah; Nutbrown, Rebecca; Simpson, Rob; Stevens, Richard; Tooley, Mark",Journal of medical engineering & technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03091902.2021.1873441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632055/,361

We intend to screen for crucial genes and potential molecular mechanisms in FT1D in this study. Method We downloaded GSE44314, which includes six healthy controls and five patients with FT1D, from the GEO database. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by NetworkAnalyst. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of DEGs were screened by an online tool-Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integration Discovery (DAVID). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and hub genes among DEGs were analyzed by NetworkAnalyst. And we also use NetworkAnalyst to find out the microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) which regulate the expression of DEGs. Result We identified 130 DEGs (60 upregulated and 70 downregulated DEGs) between healthy controls and FT1D patients. GO analysis results revealed that DEGs were mostly enriched in generation of precursor metabolites and energy, neurohypophyseal hormone activity, and mitochondrial inner membrane. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that DEGs were mostly involved in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Results indicated that NCOA1, SRF, ERBB3, EST1, TOP1, UBE2S, INO80, COX7C, ITGAV, and COX6C were the top hub genes in the PPI network. Furthermore, we recognized that LDLR, POTEM, IFNAR2, BAZ2A, and SRF were the top hub genes in the miRNA-target gene network, and SRF, TSPAN4, CD59, ETS1, and SLC25A25 were the top hub genes in the TF-target gene network. Conclusion Our study pinpoints key genes and pathways associated with FT1D by a sequence of bioinformatics analysis on DEGs. These identified genes and pathways provide more detailed molecular mechanisms of FT1D and may provide novel therapeutic targets.","Ye, Xiaofeng; Zeng, Tianshu; Kong, Wen; Chen, Lu-Lu",Journal of immunology research,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1025857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083497/,361
125622,Investigation of varicella outbreak among residents and healthcare workers in psychiatric hospital- Saudi Arabia.,2020-08-24,"AIMS To investigate the feasibility and reliability of the seven-day pad test (7DPT), the correlation between 7DPT and 24-hour pad test (24HPT), and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) questionnaire, and the different categorization by the severity of each pad test. Pad weighting tests have been recommended in the evaluation of post-radical prostatectomy urinary incontinence severity, being considered the 24HPT gold standard. Some authors consider that the longer the testing, the better assessment. We propose a self-filled pad weight, the 7DPT. METHODS A prospective study of incontinent male patients after radical prostatectomy. We carried out the study in two phases. All patients underwent urodynamic study. The first phase evaluated the feasibility and reliability of 7DPT. The second evaluated the correlation between 7DPT, 24HPT, and ICIQ-SF questionnaire in a larger sample. RESULTS First phase: 32 patients were recruited. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with good agreement between mean 7DPT and 24HPT. The number of pads and mean 7DPT showed a good correlation. Second phase: 72 patients were screened, 51 (71%) met inclusion criteria. Mean 7DPT and 24HPT showed a strong association. Mean 7DPT and 24HPT correlated moderately with ICIQ-SF score. 7DPT and 24HPT agreement with ICIQ-SF groups was slight. As 7DPT captures better days with maximum urinary leakage, up to 12 patients would have been misclassified according to 24HPT (number need to treat for 7DPT was seven). CONCLUSIONS 7DPT is a feasible and reliable tool to evaluate post-radical prostatectomy urinary incontinence, with a strong correlation with the 24HPT and moderate with the ICIQ-SF.","Martínez-Cuenca, Esther; Sánchez, Jose Vicente; Bonillo, Miguel Ángel; Morán, Eduardo; Broseta, Enric; Arlandis, Salvador",Neurourology and urodynamics,https://doi.org/10.1002/nau.24655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739536/,361

In temperate geographies, HCoV activity peaks between December and March. The epidemiology and manifestations of HCoV infections have not been previously reported from Ecuador. METHODS Children <5 years who presented with ≥2 symptoms consistent with an acute respiratory tract infection were eligible for enrollment. After obtaining informed consent, demographic data and details regarding the acute illness were recorded. Secretions collected with a nasopharyngeal swab underwent diagnostic testing using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS A total of 850 subjects were enrolled. A total of 677 (80%) tested positive for at least 1 pathogen, including 49 (7.2%) who tested positive for ≥1 HCoV type. HCoV-NL63 was the most frequent type detected (39%), followed by HCoV-OC43 (27%), 229E (22%) and HKU1 (12%). Nearly all subjects who tested positive for HCoV had nasal congestion or secretions (47/49; 96%). The most frequent syndromic diagnosis was common cold (41%), followed by bronchiolitis (27%). We found no association between the infecting HCoV type and subject's syndromic diagnosis (P > 0.05) or anatomic location of infection (upper vs. lower respiratory tract; P > 0.05). The 2018-2019 peak HCoV activity occurred from October to November; the 2019-2020 peak occurred from January to February. CONCLUSIONS HCoVs were detected in ~7% of outpatient Ecuadorean children <5 years of age with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. The most frequently detected HCoV types, and the period of peak HCoV activity differed for the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 seasons.","Sippy, Rachel; Prado, Esteban Ortiz; Pizarro Fajardo, Freddy; Hidalgo, Iván; Aguilar, Guillermo Victoriano; Bonville, Cynthia A; Aponte, Cinthya Cueva; Gómez, Mariuxi Salazar; Aponte, Jorge Luis Carrillo; Cordova, Mercy Borbor; Polo, Gladys Rincón; Suryadevara, Manika; Domachowske, Joseph B",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002840; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773657/,361

One population that has received little attention in terms of medical education are d/Deaf and hard of hearing patients, although there is much evidence to support health care disparities in this population. Several major contributing factors include differing views of deafness between medical professionals and those who are culturally Deaf, a lack of understanding of Deaf Culture and American Sign Language (ASL) by medical professionals, a lack of educational resources in ASL, and poor experiences in health care. To address this need, a Deaf Culture Applied Anatomy session was incorporated into the first-year curriculum at Morehouse School of Medicine while medical students were studying anatomy of the ear and hearing. Panelists, who were culturally Deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing children of deaf adults, shared their experiences in healthcare, including challenges they faced with communication and care. Surveys were provided to students before and after the panel session. Surveys indicated a lack of knowledge prior to this session, while also demonstrating that this 90-minute session improved students' understanding of effective communication with future patients and issues related to deafness. Qualitative feedback also suggested that the students found the session to be personally and professionally beneficial. Implementing the Deaf Culture session was an effective means for introducing students to Deaf culture and working with d/Deaf and hard of hearing patients. This article is protected by copyright.

126629,ICD-11-related educational activities.,2021-10-01,"OBJECTIVE Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with its new quantitative mapping techniques has proved to be an essential diagnostic tool for detecting myocardial injury associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This systematic review sought to assess the important imaging features on CMR in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic literature review within the PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and WHO databases for articles describing the CMR findings in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS A total of 34 studies comprising 199 patients were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Of the CMRs 21% were normal. Myocarditis (40.2%) was the most prevalent diagnosis. T1 (109/150; 73%) and T2 (91/144; 63%) mapping abnormalities, edema on T2/STIR (46/90; 51%), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (85/199; 43%) were the most common imaging findings. Perfusion deficits (18/21; 85%) and extracellular volume mapping abnormalities (21/40; 52%), pericardial effusion (43/175; 24%), and pericardial LGE (22/100; 22%) were also seen. LGE was most commonly seen in the subepicardial location (81%) and in the basal-mid part of the left ventricle in inferior segments. In most of the patients, ventricular functions were normal. Kawasaki-like involvement with myocardial edema without necrosis/LGE (4/6; 67%) was seen in children. CONCLUSION CMR is useful in assessing the prevalence, mechanism, and extent of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients. Myocarditis is the most common imaging diagnosis, with the common imaging findings being mapping abnormalities and myocardial edema on T2, followed by LGE. As cardiovascular involvement is associated with poor prognosis, its detection warrants prompt attention and appropriate treatment.","Ojha, Vineeta; Verma, Mansi; Pandey, Niraj N; Mani, Avinash; Malhi, Amarinder S; Kumar, Sanjeev; Jagia, Priya; Roy, Ambuj; Sharma, Sanjiv",Journal of thoracic imaging,https://doi.org/10.1097/rti.0000000000000574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306666/,361
126940,Addressing the mental health concerns of migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: An experiential account.,2020-06-29,"Prisional health is, in its essence, public health. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to the world and has shown that preventing the disease escalation in prisons integrates the novel corona virus clash in society in general. Up to this moment, the most effective known measure to curb the disease spread is social isolation. Nevertheless, in penal institutions, often overcrowded, social isolation becomes difficult to carry out and, when it happens, it takes the enclosed population to overisolation, with consequences to their mental health. Besides, prisoners suffer with clogged up environment, lack of materials for personal hygiene, poor basic sanitary conditions and difficulties in accessing health services. This paper deals with a narrative review on the pandemic effects in prisons and how government and civil society have organized themselves in order to reduce the disease consequences at those places. The text has been divided into three sections: the first with literature review on the current health theme; the second discusses how different countries have been dealing with the prison situation in the pandemic context, and, the last part focuses on how the Brazilian Penal System has reacted to the new disease.","Carvalho, Sérgio Garófalo de; Santos, Andreia Beatriz Silva Dos; Santos, Ivete Maria",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.15682020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876243/,361

We sought to assess the accuracy of ultrasound measurement of tracheal diameter, and to determine the relationship between tracheal wall pressure (TWP), cuff inflation volume (CIV), and the degree of tracheal deformation. METHODS Our study comprised two parts: the first included 45 porcine tracheas, the second 41 porcine tracheas. Each trachea was intubated with a cuffed ETT, which was connected to an injector and the manometer via a three-way tap. The cuff was inflated and the cuff pressure recorded before and after intubation. The tracheal diameter was measured using ultrasound. This included three separate measurements: outer transverse diameter (OTD), internal transverse diameter (ITD), and anterior tracheal wall thicknesses (ATWT). A precision electronic Vernier caliper was also used to measure tracheal diameter. We calculated TWP and the percentage change of tracheal diameter. The Bland-Altman method, linear regression, and locally weighted regression (LOESS) were used to analyze the data. RESULTS There were strong correlation and agreement for OTD (r = 0.97, P < 0.001) and ITD (r = 0.90, P < 0.001) as measured by ultrasound and by precision electronic Vernier caliper, but a poor correlation for ATWT (r = 0.58, P < 0.001). There was a strong correlation between the percentage change of OTD (OTD%, r = 0.75, P < 0.001) and CIV, the percentage change of ITD (ITD%, r = 0.77, P < 0.001) and CIV, TWP (r = 0.75, P < 0.001) and CIV. And a strong correlation was also found between TWP and OTD% (r = 0.84, P < 0.001), TWP and ITD% (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Use of ultrasound to measure OTD and ITD is accurate, but is less accurate for ATWT. There is a close correlation between OTD%, ITD%, CIV and TWP.","Ye, Ran; Cai, Feifei; Guo, Chengnan; Zhang, Xiaocheng; Yan, Dan; Chen, Chengshui; Chen, Bin",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-021-01398-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167482/,361

In this study, eight specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting different genomic regions of EMCV BJC3 were designed and their ability to inhibit virus replication in BHK-21 cells was investigated. The results showed that BHK-21 cells transfected with siRNA duplexes to 2C gene (JH-4,666, BJC-1,739), 2B gene (BJC-807), 3C gene (BJC-2,363) and 3D gene (BJC-3269) were specifically resistant to EMCV infection when exposed to 500 times the 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID(50)) of EMCV. The levels of the 3D gene in the transfected cells were obviously decreased. IFA and Western blotting analysis confirmed that the expression of VP1 protein in cell culture transfected with the siRNAs was apparently reduced. Of the five siRNAs, JH-4,666, BJC-2,363 and BJC-3,269 were the most effective. Combination of the siRNA duplexes enhanced the inhibition of EMCV replication. Our data indicated that specific siRNAs are able to inhibit the replication of porcine encephalomyocarditis virus in BHK-21 cells, suggesting that RNAi might provide a new approach to prevent EMCV infection.","Jia, Hong; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Yang, Hanchun; Yu, Kangzhen; Chen, Zhenhai; Chen, Yanhong; Cha, Zhenlin",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18243347/,361

Here we describe a series of artificial life simulations that reveal a close relationship between the evolution of cellularity, the evolution of metabolism, and the richness of the environment. When environments are rich in processing energy, a resource that the digital organisms require to both process their genomes and replicate, populations evolve toward a state of non-cellularity. But when processing energy is not readily available in the environment and organisms must produce their own processing energy from food puzzles, populations always evolve both a proficient metabolism and a high level of cellular impermeability. Even between these two environmental extremes, the population-averaged values of cellular impermeability and metabolic proficiency exhibit a very strong correlation with one another. Further investigations show that non-cellularity is selectively advantageous when environmental processing energy is abundant because it allows organisms to access the available energy, while cellularity is selectively advantageous when environmental processing energy is scarce because it affords organisms the genetic fidelity required to incrementally evolve efficient metabolisms. The selection pressures favoring either non-cellularity or cellularity can be reversed when the environment transitions from one of abundant processing energy to one of scarce processing energy. These results have important implications for when and why cellular organisms evolved following the origin of life.","Takagi, Yuta A; Nguyen, Diep H; Wexler, Tom B; Goldman, Aaron D",Journal of molecular evolution,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00239-020-09961-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809045/,361

We reviewed our outcomes for fMMC repair from referral and evaluation through surgery, delivery and neonatal discharge. MATERIAL AND METHODS All patients referred for potential fMMC repair were reviewed from January 1, 2011 through March 7, 2014. Maternal and neonatal data were collected on the 100 patients who underwent surgery. RESULTS 29% of those evaluated met the criteria and underwent fMMC repair (100 cases). The average gestational age was 21.9 weeks at evaluation and 23.4 weeks at fMMC repair. Complications included membrane separation (22.9%), preterm premature rupture of membranes (32.3%) and preterm labor (37.5%). Average gestational age at delivery was 34.3 weeks and 54.2% delivered at ≥35 weeks. The perinatal loss rate was 6.1% (2 intrauterine fetal demises and 4 neonatal demises); 90.8% of women delivered at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and 3.4% received transfusions.

This study evaluated the effects of direct wound treatment with allogeneic stem cells, in terms of gross, histologic, and transcriptional features of healing. Three full-thickness cutaneous wounds were created on each distal forelimb in six healthy horses, for a total of six wounds per horse. Umbilical cord-blood derived equine MSCs were applied to each wound 1 day after wound creation, in one of four forms: (a) normoxic- or (b) hypoxic-preconditioned cells injected into wound margins, or (c) normoxic- or (d) hypoxic-preconditioned cells embedded in an autologous fibrin gel and applied topically to the wound bed. Controls were one blank (saline) injected wound and one blank fibrin gel-treated wound per horse. Data were collected weekly for 6 weeks and included wound surface area, thermography, gene expression, and histologic scoring. Results indicated that MSC treatment by either delivery method was safe and improved histologic outcomes and wound area. Hypoxic-preconditioning did not offer an advantage. MSC treatment by injection resulted in statistically significant increases in transforming growth factor beta and cyclooxygenase-2 expression at week 1. Histologically, significantly more MSC-treated wounds were categorized as pro-healing than pro-inflammatory. Wound area was significantly affected by treatment: MSC-injected wounds were consistently smaller than gel-treated or control wounds. In conclusion, MSC therapy shows promise for distal extremity wounds in horses, particularly when applied by direct injection into the wound margin.

131498,Prospective Evaluation of Health Outcomes in a Nationwide Sample of Aeromedical Evacuation Casualties: Methods From a Pilot Study.,2021-08-04,"AIM The aim of this retrospective study was to assess and compare the clinical results of three hysterectomy techniques: abdominal hysterectomy (AH), vaginal hysterectomy (VH), and laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH). METHODS A total of 2163 patients having undergone AH (n = 1226), VH (n = 426), and LH (n = 511) procedures were analyzed. The mean age, body mass index (BMI), parity, uterus weight, operation time, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, analgesic needs, intra- and postoperative complications, and indications for hysterectomy were analyzed and compared. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups with respect to the BMI, parity, and intra- or postoperative major and minor complications. The operation time was significantly shorter in the VH group than in the other two groups (p < 0.001), and the blood loss was significantly lower in the LH group than in the others (p < 0.001). The duration of hospitalization and analgesic needs were the shortest in the LH group (p < 0.001), while the uterus weight and previous intra-abdominal surgery rate were the lowest in the VH group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S) Despite the fact that the LH exhibited a longer operation time than the VH, the LH was considered to be a safe and effective surgical procedure due to the lesser blood loss, hospital stay, and analgesic needs.","Inal, Z O; Inal, H A",Irish journal of medical science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-017-1660-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28726032/,361

The World Health Organization officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With the global spread of COVID-19, similar cases have appeared in other areas of China, and there are a few reports of pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE SUMMARY A 7-year-old girl was diagnosed with COVID-19 and presented with irregular fever, sore throat and diarrhea. Chest computed tomography revealed patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities in multiple areas. The lesions were mainly distributed in the bronchial bundles or subpleural areas of both lungs, particularly in the right lower lobe. The patient also presented with diarrhea, mild kidney injury, and live coronavirus was found in her feces. She was given antiviral agents (lopinavir and ritonavir), and follow-up detection showed that these abnormalities were markedly decreased within 3 d. CONCLUSION The clinical symptoms and prognosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients may be different from those in adult patients, and the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered.","Chen, Xing; Zou, Xiao-Jie; Xu, Zhen",World journal of clinical cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i11.2345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32548166/,361

METHODS A 61-year-old man developed bilateral symblephara and severe ocular surface inflammation from Stevens-Johnson syndrome/TEN secondary to allopurinol. Eight days after admission, he was treated with placement of custom-designed symblepharon rings, designed by one of the authors (A.A.), covered with amniotic membrane. This method was used to allow for efficient placement of the membrane and to minimize operative time and perioperative risks due to his worsening systemic condition. RESULTS On postoperative day 49, his visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. Both eyes were quiet with only small symblephara noted temporally. CONCLUSIONS The use of amniotic membrane suture-fixated to custom-designed symblepharon rings provides sufficient coverage of the ocular surface, leading to excellent visual and clinical outcomes by reducing inflammation and protecting the ocular surface from the cicatrizing sequelae associated with ocular-involving TEN. This novel technique is less invasive, more time efficient, and likely safe for even the most critically ill patients with significant risk for mortality, thus allowing any treating ophthalmologist to comfortably perform this important sight-saving procedure.","Cheung, Crystal S Y; Ali, Asim; Chew, Hall F",Cornea,https://doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000000770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26863497/,361

We consider the limitations of these approaches and review more recent research that has focused on the heterogeneity of outcomes following aversive events. Using both traditional analytic tools and sophisticated latent trajectory modeling, this research has identified a set of prototypical outcome patterns. Typically, the most common outcome following PTEs is a stable trajectory of healthy functioning or resilience. We review research showing that resilience is not the result of a few dominant factors, but rather that there are multiple independent predictors of resilient outcomes. Finally, we critically evaluate the question of whether resilience-building interventions can actually make people more resilient, and we close with suggestions for future research on resilience.","Bonanno, George A; Westphal, Maren; Mancini, Anthony D",Annual review of clinical psychology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21091190/,361

Current treatment in adults is extrapolated from the HLH-2004 protocol that specifies a regimen of etoposide, dexamethasone and cyclosporine. However, HLH presents as a spectrum of disease severity. A therapeutic challenge arises for milder cases where the harms of potent chemotherapy such as etoposide may outweigh its benefit. We present a case of an adult with HLH who developed significant pancytopenia but was otherwise not critically ill and who responded to treatment with a chemotherapy-sparing approach consisting of intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids alone. The case illustrates that tailored therapy may allow effective treatment of the disorder while minimising therapy-related toxicities.","Chen, Evan C; Stefely, Jonathan A; Dey, Bimalangshu R; Dzik, Walter H",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-234490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376661/,361

This trend will continue because a number of factors, including the increased global population, aging, travel, urbanization, and climate change, favor the emergence, evolution, and spread of new pathogens. The approach used so far for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) does not work from the technical point of view, and it is not sustainable. However, the advent of platform technologies offers vaccine manufacturers an opportunity to develop new vaccines faster and to reduce the investment to build manufacturing facilities, in addition to allowing for the possible streamlining of regulatory processes. The new technologies also make possible the rapid development of human monoclonal antibodies that could become a potent immediate response to an emergency. So far, several proposals to approach EIDs have been made independently by scientists, the private sector, national governments, and international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO). While each of them has merit, there is a need for a global governance that is capable of taking a strong leadership role and making it attractive to all partners to come to the same table and to coordinate the global approach.","Bloom, David E; Black, Steven; Rappuoli, Rino",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1701410114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28396438/,361
137016,Modelling CD4 counts before and after HAART for HIV infected patients in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa.,2020-12-01,"PURPOSE Ventral hernia repair can be performed safely using meshes which are primarily stable upon dynamic intermittent straining (DIS) at recommended overlap. In specific clinical situations, e.g., at bony edges, bridging of the hernial orifice with reduced overlap might be necessary. To gain insight into the durability of various applications, two different meshes with the best tissue grip known so far were assessed. METHODS The model uses dynamic intermittent strain and comprises the repetition of submaximal impacts delivered via a hydraulically driven plastic containment. Pig tissue simulates a ventral hernia with a standardized 5 cm defect. Commercially available meshes classified as primarily stable at recommended overlap were used to bridge this defect at recommended and reduced overlap. RESULTS Using Parietex Progrip®, the peritoneum adds sufficient stability at least to a 2.5 cm overlap. Using Dynamesh Cicat®, four gluing spots with Glubran® are sufficient to stabilize a 3.75 cm overlap. A 2.5 cm overlap is stabilized with eight bonding spots Glubran® and 8 bonding spots combined with four sutures stabilize a 1.25 cm overlap. Here again, an intact peritoneum stabilizes the reconstruction significantly. CONCLUSIONS Based on a pig tissue model, a total of 23 different conditions were tested. A DIS class A mesh can be easily stabilized bridging a 5 cm hernial orifice with reduced overlap. Caution must be exerted to extend these results to other DIS classes and larger hernial orifices. Further DIS investigations can improve the durability of hernia repair.","Kallinowski, F; Harder, F; Silva, T G; Mahn, A; Vollmer, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-017-1583-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28132109/,361

This study compared the prognostic factors and treatment effectiveness of GKRS and EVT for different CSDAVF types. METHODS The charts of 200 patients undergoing GKRS and 105 patients undergoing EVT were reviewed for data on symptoms (e.g. orbital, cavernous, ocular, and cerebral). The CSDAVFs were classified into proliferative, restrictive, and late restrictive types. The prognostic factors for complete obliteration (CO) were evaluated in both the GKRS and EVT groups and the latent period to CO was measured. For statistical analysis χ2-tests were used to compare final CO rates for EVT and GKRS across the three CSDAVF types. RESULTS The EVT and cavernous symptoms were significant independent predictors of CO. The CO rate after EVT (97.9%) was significantly higher than that after GKRS (63.5%) for restrictive CSDAVFs (P < 0.001) but not for proliferative or late restrictive types. In the GKRS group, cavernous symptoms (hazard ratio, HR: 0.557) and target volume (HR: 0.853) predicted CO, but only target volume remained significant in multivariate analysis. In the EVT group, the latent period to CO was shortest for restrictive CSDAVFs (3.2 ± 1.6 months, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION Angioarchitecture did not affect treatment outcomes. Cavernous symptoms were strongly associated with lower complete obliteration rates in the GKRS but not the EVT group. The EVT method remains the treatment of choice, especially for restrictive CSDAVFs; however, compared to EVT, GKRS had lower complication rates and similar therapeutic effects for proliferative type fistulas.","Yang, Huai-Che; Lin, Chung-Jung; Luo, Chao-Bao; Lee, Cheng-Chia; Wu, Hsiu-Mei; Guo, Wan-Yuo; Chung, Wen-Yuh; Liu, Kang-Du",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-019-00787-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31098665/,361

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is feasible as two-stage treatment for high-risk patients. However, its efficacy as a stand-alone procedure in super-super obese (SSO) patients is controversial. The study objective was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of LSG in super-obese (SO) and SSO patients. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive patients undergoing LSG. The patients were classified into three groups: morbidly obese (MO), SO, and SSO. The patients' data, including each patient's characteristics, body mass index (BMI), preoperative comorbidities, postoperative complications, the resolution of comorbidities, percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), and total weight loss (%TWL) were compared between groups. RESULTS Of the 186 patients, 163 (87.6%) were followed up for 41.2 ± 7.3 months (range 33-54 months). The mean BMI was 52.6 kg/m2. Eighty-three patients (50.9%) were MO, 52 (31.9%) were SO, and 28 (17.2%) were SSO. The groups were similar in terms of preoperative characteristics and postoperative complications. The mean %TWL were lower for the SSO group with no significant difference. The mean %TWL at 12, 24, 36, and 41.2 months postoperatively was 34.7, 34.4, 31.4, and 29.6% in SSO group, respectively. Also, the %EWL for the SSO group was significantly lower (48.3%) at the end of the follow-up period. However, the rate of significant improvement or complete resolution of comorbidities was similar in all groups. CONCLUSION Although %EWL was lower in the SSO group, LSG was a feasible and safe stand-alone bariatric surgical procedure for the resolution of comorbidities in MO, SO, and SSO patients.","Ece, Ilhan; Yilmaz, Huseyin; Alptekin, Husnu; Yormaz, Serdar; Colak, Bayram; Yilmaz, Farise; Sahin, Mustafa",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-3053-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235011/,361

We discuss the role myocardial microvascular pericytes expressing the ACE-2 receptor and their potential for an organ-specific cardiac involvement with COVID-19. Dysfunctional microvascular support by pericytes or endothelial cells may increase the propensity for AF via increased myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, increased tissue edema, and interstitial hydrostatic pressure. All of these factors can lead to electrical perturbances at the tissue and cellular level. We also consider the contribution of Angiotensin, pulmonary hypertension, and regulatory T cells as additional contributors to AF during COVID-19 infection. Finally, reference is given to two common drugs, corticosteroids and metformin, in COVID-19 and how they might influence AF incidence.","Stone, Elijah; Kiat, Hosen; McLachlan, Craig S",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202001613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078484/,361

This systematic review aimed to study the effect of the timing of initiating complementary feeding on overweight in preterm infants. Predefined search items included preterm infants, complementary feeding, overweight, and their synonyms. SUMMARY The search identified 15,749 articles, of which 5 articles were included. Three studies presented data of randomized controlled trials and 2 studies were cohort studies. Two randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in body mass index (BMI) Z-score between the intervention groups at 12 months of age. One randomized controlled trial presented a significant greater mean rate of growth in length per week until 12 months in the preterm weaning strategy-group compared with the current best practices. One observational study concluded that each month the infants received complementary food later, the Z-score for length and weight was reduced by 0.1.

DESIGN Pilot randomised control trial. SETTING University physiotherapy clinic, participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS Forty people with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease, mean age 72 (6.9). INTERVENTION In Block 1 (5 weeks) all participants completed predominantly centre-based exercise plus a self-management program. Participants were then randomised to continue the centre-based exercise (n = 20) or to a home-based program with telehealth (n = 20) for Block 2 (5 weeks). The exercises targeted balance and gait. OUTCOMES The primary outcomes were the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were balance, gait speed and freezing of gait. RESULTS Adherence was high in Block 1 (93%), and Block 2 (centre-based group = 93%, home-based group = 84%). In Block 2, the physiotherapist spent 6.4 hours providing telehealth to the home-based group (mean 10 (4) minutes per participant) and 32.5 hours delivering the centre-based exercise classes (98 minutes per participant). Participants reported that exercise was helpful, they could follow the home program and they would recommend exercising at home or in a group. However, exercising at home was less satisfying and there was a mixed response to the acceptability of the self-management program. There was no difference between groups in any of the secondary outcome measures (preferred walking speed mean difference -0.04 (95% CI: -0.12 to 0.05).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrate the presence of enriched Ba2CoO4 phase at 400 °C and multiphase structures: BaCoO3, BaCoO3-δ, and Co3O4 with a decrease in the amount of Ba2CoO4 at 500 °C. The prepared powders are characterized by a high specific surface area (SSA) values which are reflected to the mode of synthesis that leads to produce materials with massive active sites. The SSA of BC4 is higher than that of BC5 which can be correlated to the difference in the microstructure analysis of BC4 and BC5 as given from scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) studies. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy as an effective method for the characterization of vacancy-rich nanostructures indicates that the presence of oxygen vacancies is related mainly to BaCoO3, BaCoO3-δ, and Co3O4 phases while the effective oxygen vacancies is in BaCoO3 and BaCoO3-δ. The nanocrystalline structures of BC4 and BC5 as novel nano-adsorbents are the first time to be tested.

AREAS COVERED Entry of enveloped viruses into their target cells is triggered by the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with cellular (co)receptor(s) and depends on obligatory conformational changes in these viral envelope glycoproteins and/or cellular receptors. For some viruses, these conformational changes are mediated by cell surface-associated cellular oxidoreductases, which mediate disulfide bridge reductions in viral envelope glycoprotein(s). Therefore, targeting these oxidoreductases using oxidoreductase inhibitors might yield an interesting strategy to block viral entry of these viruses. Furthermore, since viral infections are often associated with systemic oxidative stress, contributing to disease progression, the enhancement of the cellular antioxidant defense systems might have potential as an adjuvant antiviral strategy, slowing down disease progression. EXPERT OPINION Promising antiviral data were obtained for both strategies. However, potential pitfalls have also been identified for these strategies, indicating that it is important to carefully assess the benefits versus risks of these antiviral strategies.","Mathys, Leen; Balzarini, Jan",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,https://doi.org/10.1517/14728222.2015.1068760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26178644/,361

144493,Health Care Heroes of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-04-20,"Purpose We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the incidence of radiation induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP) and the associated radiotherapy doses to this structure. Methods Databases were queried without language restriction for cohort studies reporting RIBP incidence and associated brachial plexus dose maximum dose (bpDmax). Studies specifying RIBP relative risk (RR) effect size were selected for meta-analysis. RRs for RIBP from each study were converted to a regression coefficient (β) and standard error corresponding to a continuous representation of bpDmax. The adjusted β from individual studies were combined using a random effects model and weighted by inverse variance (1/SE2). The trim and fill approach was used to assess publication bias. Results We identified 25 studies that included 37 unique patient cohorts eligible for analysis. Seventeen cohorts experienced an RIBP incidence ≤5%, of which 6 cohorts exceeded conventional plexus constraints of 60 Gy for bpDmax. Five of the 6 cohorts were simulated with 3D-CT techniques. Meta-analysis of eligible studies demonstrated a significant increase in RIBP risk for each Gy increase in bpDmax (RR, 1.11; 95% CI 1.07-1.15). Results remained significant after adjustment for publication bias and when sensitivity analysis was performed. Conclusions Our results suggest that current brachial plexus constraints of 60-66 Gy are safe. Meta-analysis provides a log-linear model to quantify the association of brachial plexus dose and RIBP risk, and thus inform the therapeutic ratio for dose escalation. Further prospective studies reporting dosimetric data can better refine this model and inform brachial plexus constraint guidelines.","Yan, Michael; Kong, Weidong; Kerr, Andrew; Brundage, Michael",Clinical and translational radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2019.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309161/,361
144500,[Primary care paediatrics facing health inequalities and social exclusion].,2021-01-22,"INTRODUCTION Approximately 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression. The COVID-19 crisis may dramatically increase these numbers. Severe side effects and resistance development limit the use of standard antidepressants. The steroidal lactone withanolide A (WA) from Withania somnifera may be a promising alternative. Caenorhabditis elegans was used as model to explore WA's anti-depressive and anti-stress potential. METHODS C. elegans wildtype (N2) and deficient strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109 and MT9772) were used to assess oxidative, osmotic or heat stress as measured by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), determination of lifespan, and mRNA expression of serotonin receptor (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter genes (mod-5). The protective effect of WA was compared to fluoxetine as clinically established antidepressant. Additionally, WA's effect on lifespan was determined. Furthermore, the binding affinities and pKi values of WA, fluoxetine and serotonin as natural ligand to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, Mod-5 and their human orthologues proteins were calculated by molecular docking. RESULTS Baseline oxidative stress was higher in deficient than wildtype worms. WA and fluoxetine reduced ROS levels in all strains except MT9772. WA and fluoxetine prolonged survival times in wildtype and mutants under osmotic stress. WA but not fluoxetine increased lifespan of all heat-stressed C. elegans strains except DA2100. Furthermore, WA but not fluoxetine extended lifespan in all non-stressed C. elegans strains. WA also induced mRNA expression of serotonin receptors and transporters in wildtype and mutants. WA bound with higher affinity and lower pKi values to all C. elegans and human serotonin receptors and transporters than serotonin, indicating that WA may competitively displaced serotonin from the binding pockets of these proteins. CONCLUSION WA reduced stress and increased lifespan by ROS scavenging and interference with the serotonin system. Hence, WA may serve as promising candidate to treat depression.","Naß, Janine; Abdelfatah, Sara; Efferth, Thomas",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611213/,361

Both preterm birth and fetal inflammation are independently associated with elevated risks of subsequent short- and long-term respiratory, gastro-intestinal and neurological complications. Despite numerous clinical and experimental studies to investigate localised and systemic fetal inflammation following exposure to microbial agonists, there is minimal data to describe which fetal organ(s) drive systemic fetal inflammation. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E.coli in an instrumented ovine model of fetal inflammation and conducted a series of experiments to assess the systemic pro-inflammatory capacity of the three major fetal surfaces exposed to inflammatory mediators in pregnancy (the lung, gastro-intestinal tract and skin/amnion). Exposure of the fetal lung and fetal skin/amnion (but not gastro-intestinal tract) caused a significant acute systemic inflammatory response characterised by altered leucocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated plasma MCP-1 levels and inflammation of the fetal liver and spleen. These novel findings reveal differential fetal organ responses to pro-inflammatory stimulation and shed light on the pathogenesis of fetal systemic inflammation after exposure to chorioamnionitis.","Kemp, Matthew W; Kannan, Paranthaman Senthamarai; Saito, Masatoshi; Newnham, John P; Cox, Tom; Jobe, Alan H; Kramer, Boris W; Kallapur, Suhas G",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23691033/,361

Previous research has reported an increased risk of mental health issues and suicidal ideation among older people living in residential care settings. However, there is little information on the actual prevalence of depression, self-harm, and suicidal behavior in this population, how it is measured and how care homes respond to these issues. METHOD This systematic review of international literature addressed three research questions relating to; the prevalence of mental health problems in this population; how they are identified and; how care homes try to prevent or respond to mental health issues. RESULTS Findings showed higher reported rates of depression and suicidal behavior in care home residents compared to matched age groups in the community, variation in the use of standardised measures across studies and, interventions almost exclusively focused on increasing staff knowledge about mental health but with an absence of involvement of older people themselves in these programmes. CONCLUSION We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of addressing mental health difficulties experienced by older people in residential care and future research in this area.","Gleeson, Helen; Hafford-Letchfield, Trish; Quaife, Matthew; Collins, Daniela A; Flynn, Ann",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2018.1501666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392380/,361

A systematic review of recent research on the influence of PRR politicians on the health and welfare policies shows that health is not a policy arena that these politicians have much experience in. In office, their effects can be destructive, primarily because they subordinate health to their other goals. Brazil, the US and the UK all show this pattern. PRR politicians in opposition such as the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in Austria or the Lega in Italy, said very little during the actual health crisis, but once the public no longer appeared afraid they lost no time in reactivating anti-European Union (EU) sentiments.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the changes in poisoning cases regarding distribution, types, and characteristics for better framing and planning of the role of our field in responding to pandemics. METHODS Study of telephone consultation calls and toxicology analysis records of poisoning cases referred to the Dammam Poison Control Center in Saudi Arabia during the first half of 2020. Their distribution according to frequencies, causes, and other characteristics was compared to the first half of 2019. RESULTS Analysis of telephone consultation calls revealed that the proportion of exposure to disinfectants and hand sanitizers during first half of 2020 increased to 20.4% (n = 496) and 3.4% (n = 83), respectively, compared to 9.8% (n = 215) and 0.4% (n = 10) for surface disinfectants and hand sanitizers, respectively, during the first half of 2019. In 2020, exposure to disinfectants and hand sanitizers dominated in preschool children (0-5 years). The total number of cases suspected for drugs/drugs of abuse overdose during the first 6 months of 2020 (n = 783) showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001) compared to the first 6 months of 2019 (n = 1086). CONCLUSION The increased availability and use of disinfectants and sanitizers significantly increased the risk of poisoning, especially in preschool-aged children.

153177,Can Physical Activity While Sedentary Produce Health Benefits? A Single-Arm Randomized Trial.,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND First-episode psychosis typically has its onset during adolescence. Prolonged deficits in social functioning are common in FEP and yet often variance in functioning remains unexplained. Developmental psychology frameworks may be useful for understanding these deficits. Eudaimonic well-being (EWB), or positive self-development, is a developmental psychology construct that has been shown to predict mental health outcomes across multiple populations but has not been systematically reviewed in FEP. AIM Our aim was to systematically review the evidence for: the predictors of EWB, the effectiveness of EWB interventions and to examine the quality of this research in FEP. METHODS Selected studies measured either composite or components of EWB. A systematic search produced 2876 abstracts and 122 articles were identified for full screening which produced 17 final papers with 2459 participants. RESULTS Studies comprised six RCTs, eight prospective follow-up studies and three case-controlled studies. Self-esteem and self-efficacy were the most commonly measured components. A meta-analysis of RCTs revealed no statistically significant effect of interventions on self-esteem. The extant research indicates that character strengths may be associated with higher EWB. Self-esteem may be lower in FEP compared with age matched controls but not different from ultra-high risk patients. Self-esteem appears to be associated with poorer insight and improved therapeutic alliance. Significant problems with both external and internal validity of reviewed studies were apparent. CONCLUSIONS The hypotheses that lowered EWB is a risk factor for both onset of FEP and for poorer functional outcomes warrant further investigation. There is currently no evidence for effective interventions for EWB in FEP.","Gleeson, John F M; Eleftheriadis, Dina; Santesteban-Echarri, Olga; Koval, Peter; Bastian, Brock; Penn, David L; Lim, Michelle H; Ryan, Richard M; Alvarez-Jimenez, Mario",Early intervention in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33037789/,361

METHODS This was a cross-sectional observational study that evaluated critically ill adults with diseases of low or moderate severity. The following were measured: total sleep volume and time, deep sleep volume and time, continuous sleep volume and time, sleep onset latency, and environmental sound pressure level. The subjective perception of sleep was evaluated with the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire the morning after each night of observation. RESULTS Patients had a low total sleep time (234 minutes), a predominance of superficial sleep stages, and little deep sleep (1.7 minutes). The total, deep, and continuous sleep volumes were 3,679, 9.4, and 3,143 (bispectral index units × minutes), respectively. The sleep latency was 94 minutes. The mean score of the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire was 57.9. Total sleep volume, total sleep time, and continuous sleep volume were weakly correlated with the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire depth of sleep domain score, overall sleep quality domain score, and total score. Total volume, total time, and continuous volume were moderately correlated with the occurrence of awakenings domain score. CONCLUSION The bispectral index is an instrument with limited viability to monitor the sleep of lucid patients and patients with low to moderate disease severity in the intensive care unit. Patients with higher total sleep volume, total sleep time, and continuous sleep volume had better overall sleep perception.","Pedrão, Rodolfo Augusto Alves; Riella, Rodrigo Jardim; Richards, Kathy; Valderramas, Silvia Regina",Revista Brasileira de terapia intensiva,https://doi.org/10.5935/0103-507x.20200083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263704/,361
154998,How Did the COVID-19 Confinement Period Affect Our Physical Activity Level and Sedentary Behaviors? Methodology and First Results From the French National ONAPS Survey.,2021-02-13,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating insult with few effective treatments. Edema and raised intracranial pressure contribute to poor outcome after ICH. Glibenclamide blocks the sulfonylurea 1 transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Sur1-Trpm4) channel implicated in edema formation. While glibenclamide has been found to improve outcome and reduce mortality in animal models of severe ischemic stroke, in ICH the effects are less clear. In our previous study, we found no benefit after a moderate-sized bleed, while others have reported benefit. Here we tested the hypothesis that glibenclamide may only be effective in severe ICH, where edema is an important contributor to outcome. Glibenclamide (10 μg/kg loading dose, 200 ng/h continuous infusion) was administered 2 hours post-ICH induced by collagenase injection into the striatum of adult rats. A survival period of 24 hours was maintained for experiments 1-3, and 72 hours for experiment 4. Glibenclamide did not affect hematoma volume (~81 μL) or other safety endpoints (e.g., glucose levels), suggesting the drug is safe. However, glibenclamide did not lessen striatal edema (~83% brain water content), ionic dyshomeostasis (Na+, K+), or functional impairment (e.g., neurological deficits (median = 10 out of 14), etc.) at 24 hours. It also did not affect edema at 72 h (~86% brain water content), or overall mortality rates (25% and 29.4% overall in vehicle vs. glibenclamide-treated severe strokes). Furthermore, glibenclamide appears to worsen cytotoxic edema in the peri-hematoma region (cell bodies were 46% larger at 24 h, p = 0.0017), but no effect on cell volume or density was noted elsewhere. Overall, these findings refute our hypothesis, as glibenclamide produced no favorable effects following severe ICH.","Kung, Tiffany F C; Wilkinson, Cassandra M; Dirks, Christine A; Jickling, Glen C; Colbourne, Frederick",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081746/,361

We aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a trivalent vaccine formulation (P2-VP8-P[4],[6],[8]). METHODS A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase 1/2 study was done at three South African research sites. Healthy adults (aged 18-45 years), toddlers (aged 2-3 years), and infants (aged 6-8 weeks, ≥37 weeks' gestation, and without previous receipt of rotavirus vaccination), all without HIV infection, were eligible for enrolment. In the dose-escalation phase, adults and toddlers were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of five) to receive 30 μg or 90 μg of vaccine, or placebo, and infants were randomly assigned in blocks (block size of four) to receive 15 μg, 30 μg, or 90 μg of vaccine, or placebo. In the expanded phase, infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 15 μg, 30 μg, or 90 μg of vaccine, or placebo, in block sizes of four. Participants, parents of participants, and clinical, data, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment assignment. Adults received an intramuscular injection of vaccine or placebo in the deltoid muscle on the day of randomisation (day 0), day 28, and day 56; toddlers received a single injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on day 0. Infants in both phases received an injection of vaccine or placebo in the anterolateral thigh on days 0, 28, and 56, at approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Primary safety endpoints were local and systemic reactions (grade 2 or worse) within 7 days and adverse events and serious adverse events within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one injection. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were analysed in infants in either phase who received all planned injections, had blood samples analysed at the relevant timepoints, and presented no major protocol violations considered to have an effect on the immunogenicity results of the study, and included serum anti-P2-VP8 IgA, IgG, and neutralising antibody geometric mean titres and responses measured 4 weeks after the final injection in vaccine compared with placebo groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02646891. FINDINGS Between Feb 15, 2016, and Dec 22, 2017, 30 adults (12 each in the 30 μg and 90 μg groups and six in the placebo group), 30 toddlers (12 each in the 30 μg and 90 μg groups and six in the placebo group), and 557 infants (139 in the 15 μg group, 140 in the 30 μg group, 139 in the 90 μg group, and 139 in the placebo group) were randomly assigned, received at least one dose, and were assessed for safety. There were no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events, or unsolicited adverse events, between vaccine and placebo groups. There were no serious adverse events within 28 days of injection in adults, whereas one serious adverse event occurred in a toddler (febrile convulsion in the 30 μg group) and 23 serious adverse events (four in placebo, ten in 15 μg, four in 30 μg, and five in 90 μg groups) occurred among 20 infants, most commonly respiratory tract infections. One death occurred in an infant within 28 days of injection due to pneumococcal meningitis. In 528 infants (130 in placebo, 132 in 15 μg, 132 in 30 μg, and 134 in 90 μg groups), adjusted anti-P2-VP8 IgG seroresponses (≥4-fold increase from baseline) to P[4], P[6], and P[8] antigens were significantly higher in the 15 μg, 30 μg, and 90 μg groups (99-100%) than in the placebo group (10-29%; p<0·0001). Although significantly higher than in placebo recipients (9-10%), anti-P2-VP8 IgA seroresponses (≥4-fold increase from baseline) to each individual antigen were modest (20-34%) across the 15 μg, 30 μg, and 90 μg groups. Adjusted neutralising antibody seroresponses in infants (≥2·7-fold increase from baseline) to DS-1 (P[4]), 1076 (P[6]), and Wa (P[8]) were higher in vaccine recipients than in placebo recipients: p<0·0001 for all comparisons.

155231,Social Disconnection and Living Arrangements among Older Adults: The Singapore Chinese Health Study.,2021-06-16,"The administration of test substances into a single lung, or lung lobe, allows the remaining untreated lung to act as an experimental control and effectively halves the number of animals required in a given experiment. It reduces the likelihood of early fatal pulmonary failure when noxious substances are studied which may lessen the need for replacement animals. However, the ease of substance administration and the subsequent analysis of its effects, for example by bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchoscopy, depend critically on the size of the animal model. The advantages of using minipigs; ease of handling, reduced housing requirements, genetic homogeneity, etc. are reduced if their diminutive size makes lung studies difficult. This article describes the use of a bronchial blocking device and a sheathed bronchoscope which enabled sterile endobronchial substance administration in Göttingen minipigs, and allowed pulmonary aspiration studies to be conducted with each animal acting as its own control.","Hulse, E; Reed, F C; Eddleston, M; Etherington, R; Clutton, R E",Laboratory animals,https://doi.org/10.1177/0023677213518526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496573/,361

Guidelines regarding the antibiotic prophylaxis in EESBS have not been developed yet, and today, there are no universally accepted protocols. In this article, we investigated the efficacy of our new ultra-short antibiotic prophylaxis protocol for EESBS guided by the cultural results of preoperative microbiological nasal swabs. METHODS We defined as ""nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol"" the administration of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin 2 g) in patients whose nasal swabs revealed the presence of normal nasal flora or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the administration of vancomycin 1 g intravenously in patients whose nasal swabs revealed the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or with reported cephalosporin/penicillin allergy. This case-control study included 120 patients who underwent EESBS. The case group included 60 cases who received the ""nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol,"" while the control group included 60 cases who received the ""standard hospital antibiotic protocol"" used in neurosurgery (cefazolin 2 g plus metronidazole 500 mg at induction, and 2 g of cefazolin repeated after 180 min). RESULTS The preoperative microbiological nasal swabs showed normal nasal flora in 42 patients (70%), MSSA in 17 patients (28.3%), and MRSA in 1 patient (1.6%). During the study period, no cases of meningitis or sinusitis occurred in the case group (""nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol""), while two infections (3.3%, 1 sinusitis and 1 meningitis) were reported in the control group (""standard hospital antibiotic protocol""). Mean length of hospitalization was 6.5 days for the case group and 8.5 days in the control group. ""Standard hospital antibiotic protocol"" is less expensive (range, 2.88-5.42 euros) compared with our new ""nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol"" (range, 10.02-32.56 euros), but in line with other antibiotic prophylaxis protocols reported in literature. DISCUSSION The low complication rates of our case series (0%) is comparable to complication rates reported in literature (1.6% for meningitis and 8% for sinusitis). Compared with other perioperative antibiotic regimens reported in literature, the ""nasal swab-related antibiotic protocol"" is cheap and at least equally effective. We discuss the rationale on which we based the choice of chemoprophylaxis, the timing, and the length of our regimen. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirmed the safety and efficacy of our easily applicable and low-cost antibiotic prophylaxis protocol.","Ceraudo, M; Prior, A; Balestrino, A; Anania, P; Camera, M; Fiaschi, P; Gatto, F; Riccardi, N; Zona, G; Criminelli Rossi, D",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04560-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901395/,361

156864,Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior of Elderly Populations during Confinement: Results from the FRENCH COVID-19 ONAPS Survey.,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND Supplemental oxygen is frequently administered to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including ARDS secondary to viral illness such as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). An up-to-date understanding of how best to target this therapy (e.g. arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) aim) in these patients is urgently required. OBJECTIVES To address how oxygen therapy should be targeted in adults with ARDS (particularly ARDS secondary to COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses) and requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit, and the impact oxygen therapy has on mortality, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, requirement for renal replacement therapy, and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to 15 May 2020 for ongoing or completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA Two review authors independently assessed all records in accordance with standard Cochrane methodology for study selection. We included RCTs comparing supplemental oxygen administration (i.e. different target PaO2 or SpO2 ranges) in adults with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We excluded studies exploring oxygen administration in patients with different underlying diagnoses or those receiving non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen, or oxygen via facemask. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author performed data extraction, which a second review author checked. We assessed risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to judge the certainty of the evidence for the following outcomes; mortality at longest follow-up, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, and requirement for renal replacement therapy. MAIN RESULTS We identified one completed RCT evaluating oxygen targets in patients with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. The study randomized 205 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to either conservative (PaO2 55 to 70 mmHg, or SpO2 88% to 92%) or liberal (PaO2 90 to 105 mmHg, or SpO2 ≥ 96%) oxygen therapy for seven days. Overall risk of bias was high (due to lack of blinding, small numbers of participants, and the trial stopping prematurely), and we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. The available data suggested that mortality at 90 days may be higher in those participants receiving a lower oxygen target (odds ratio (OR) 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 3.27). There was no evidence of a difference between the lower and higher target groups in mean number of days ventilated (14.0, 95% CI 10.0 to 18.0 versus 14.5, 95% CI 11.8 to 17.1); number of days of catecholamine use (8.0, 95% CI 5.5 to 10.5 versus 7.2, 95% CI 5.9 to 8.4); or participants receiving renal replacement therapy (13.7%, 95% CI 5.8% to 21.6% versus 12.0%, 95% CI 5.0% to 19.1%). Quality of life was not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We are very uncertain as to whether a higher or lower oxygen target is more beneficial in patients with ARDS and receiving mechanical ventilation in an intensive care setting. We identified only one RCT with a total of 205 participants exploring this question, and rated the risk of bias as high and the certainty of the findings as very low. Further well-conducted studies are urgently needed to increase the certainty of the findings reported here. This review should be updated when more evidence is available.","Cumpstey, Andrew F; Oldman, Alex H; Smith, Andrew F; Martin, Daniel; Grocott, Michael Pw",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870512/,361

Discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), capable of cleaving RAS effector peptide angiotensin (Ang) II into biologically active Ang-(1-7), has increased the complexity of our knowledge of the RAS. ACE2 expression is abundant in the kidney and is thought to provide protection against injury. This review emphasizes current experimental and clinical findings that examine ACE2 in the context of kidney injury and its potential therapeutic impact for treatment of kidney disease. RECENT FINDINGS Clinical studies have reported upregulation of ACE2 in urine from diabetic patients, which may be reflective of pathological shedding of renal ACE2 as suggested by mechanistic experiments. Studies in experimental models have investigated the feasibility of pharmacological induction of ACE2 for improvement of renal function, inflammation, and fibrosis. SUMMARY Emerging concepts about the RAS indicate that ACE2 is a critical regulator of angiotensin peptide metabolism and the pathogenesis of renal disease. Human recombinant ACE2 is available and may be a practical clinical approach to enzyme replacement. Elucidating precise roles of ACE2 throughout disease progression will enrich our view of the RAS and help identify novel targets and appropriate strategies for intervention.","Williams, Vanessa R; Scholey, James W",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnh.0000000000000378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045335/,361

Leachate samples were collected, at a sanitary landfill, immediately after the exit from the landfill, i.e. raw leachate (collection point A), after conventional treatment (point B) and after treatment by wetlands (point C). D. parodizi specimens were exposed to 3%, 10% and control (0%) dilutions of leachate from these collection points for 7 days. Markers of antioxidant defences and cell damage were analysed. At point B, the gills of D. parodizi showed higher glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity; the latter is a supplier of glutathione reductase (GSH). The low GST activity at point A was associated with the hormesis effect. Higher levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) occurred at point A. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was inhibited at the points with the highest pollutant load and at the highest leachate dilutions. Higher levels of markers at point A may be related to the high pollutant charge and specific compounds present in the untreated leachate. The multi-xenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR), metallothionein-like proteins (MT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) did not vary among treatments. The biomarker responses showed negative effects of the leachate on the freshwater bivalve and simultaneously showed that the wetland treatment employed at the Caximba sanitary landfill is effective.","Prestes, Juliani Giselli; De Souza, Maria Rosa Dmengeon Pedreiro; Kandalski, Priscila Krebsbach; Herrerias, Tatiana; Machado, Cintia; de Arruda Martins, Elen; Dos Anjos, Vanessa Abelaira; Neundorf, Ananda Karla Alves; Pereira, Diego Mauro Carneiro; Moura, Maurício Osvaldo; Donatti, Lucelia",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08721-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418097/,361

METHODS Treatment-related data regarding RF ablation of lung malignancies at our institution was collected using a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant ablation database. Institutional review board waiver was obtained for this study. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue extracted from the electrodes after lung tumor RF ablation was performed for proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (caspase-3). Patient, tumor demographics, and ablation parameters were recorded. Local tumor progression-free survival (LPFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Multivariate analysis determined factors affecting these oncological outcomes. RESULTS A total of 47 lung tumors in 42 patients were ablated; 30 specimens were classified as coagulation necrosis (CN) and 17 as Ki-67-positive (+) tumor cells (viable). Tumor sizes were similar in the CN and Ki-67+ groups (P = 0.32). Median LPFS was 10 versus 16 months for Ki-67+ and CN groups, and 1-year LPFS was 34 and 75 %, respectively (P = 0.003). Median OS was 20 and 46 months (P = 0.12), and median DSS was 20 and 68 months (P = 0.01) for the Ki-67 + and CN groups, respectively. Identification of Ki-67+ tumor cells more than tripled the risk of death from cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.65; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 1.34-9.95; P = 0.01] and tripled the risk of local tumor progression (LTP) (HR = 3.01; 95 % CI, 1.39-6.49; P = 0.005).

In particular, the access to and control of environmental and geospatial data is fundamental to identify and understand global issues and trends. Also immediate crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate the importance of accurate health data such as infection statistics and the relevance of digital tools like video conferencing platforms. However, today much of the data is collected and processed by private actors. Thus, governments and researchers depend on data platforms and proprietary systems of big tech companies such as Google or Microsoft. The market capitalization of the seven largest US and Chinese big tech companies has grown to 8.7tn USD in recent years, about twice the size of Germany's gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, their market power is enormous, allowing them to dictate many rules of the digital space and even interfere with legislations. Based on a literature review and nine expert interviews this study presents a framework that identifies the risks and consequences along the workflow of collecting, processing, storing, using of data. It also includes solutions that governmental and multilateral actors can strive for to alleviate the risks. Fundamental to this framework is the novel concept of""data colonialism""which describes today's trend of private companies appropriating the digital sphere. Historically, colonial nations used to grab indigenous land and exploit the cheap labor of slave workers. In a similar way, today's big tech corporations use cheap data of their users to produce valuable services and thus create enormous market power.","Sturmer, Matthias; Nussbaumer, Jasmin; Stockli, Pascal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01662v1.pdf,361

The role of a mother in a family encompasses the livelihood of the family members, which extends to the family's financial standing. A mother's role in a family ranges from a homemaker and, to a certain extent, a financial provider. In Malaysia, it was reported in 2018 that 60.2% of entrepreneurs are housewives. However, it is believed that many women are working at and from home with high cost of living, especially in urban areas. They become home-based entrepreneurs, especially during this unprecedented pandemic, i.e. Covid-19, and restricted by the Movement Control Order (MCO). This study adopted an exploratory qualitative study whereby six (6) mompreneurs who are operating their businesses from home were interviewed to understand how the pandemic and the lockdown have affected their lives. This paper further examines their coping mechanism to the pandemic and financial income during this crisis. Mompreneurs' financial literacy is also observed in this paper to explore their financial understanding. This research is an exploratory study, and it only provides general ideas on how a home-based businesswoman survive and cope during the lockdown. The findings from this paper are suitable to be used as a benchmark for an extensive quantitative study in the future to further understand the behaviour of the mompreneurs, especially in Malaysia.","Yusoff, S.

The family is a key system in relation to child development, and when birth families are unable to meet their child's needs, foster carers become an important source of support in their development. The Double ABC-X Model of family stress and adaptation considers that a family's capacity to cope with stressful situations is influenced by pile-up of stressors, family resources and perception of the situation. Following this model, the study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on family stress and functioning. The sample comprised 347 Spanish adults (100 with foster families and 247 with non-foster families) who completed a survey during lockdown. The results showed that certain sociodemographic variables (gender, income, working from home, characteristics of the home and children with special educational needs) were associated with stressors during lockdown, perception of the lockdown, and family adaptation to stress during lockdown. Associations were also found between stressors, family resources, perception of lockdown, and family adaptation in foster and non-foster families, with the former having a more positive perception of the lockdown experience. The relevance of the results and their implications are discussed.","Bernedo, Isabel M.; Oliver, Jesús Urbano-Contreras Antonio González-Pasarín Lucía",Child & Family Social Work,https://doi.org/10.1111/cfs.12871,361

Particularly, the geometric unimodal shape of the epidemic curve is not what is generally observed. This work introduces the {beta}SEIR model, which adds to the classical SEIR model a differential law to model the variation in the transmission rate. It considers two opposite thrives generally found in a population: first, reaction to disease presence that may be linked to mitigation strategies, which tends to decrease transmission, and second, the urge to return to normal conditions that pulls to restore the initial value of the transmission rate. Our results open a wide spectrum of dynamic variabilities in the curve of new infected, which are justified by reaction and restoration thrives that affect disease transmission over time.

170240,Comparison of mental health and sleep quality of military and nonmilitary people during COVID-19 lockdown in Abdanan city,2021,"Several carbohydrate-based drugs are currently being used to treat a number of diseases in humans worldwide. Thus, our research group has focused on the synthesis of new methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (MDM) derivatives and their antimicrobial evaluation through computational studies. A series of MDM derivatives (2-6) were synthesized through facile regioselective acylation, using the direct method affording 6-O-(3-chlorobenzoyl) derivatives. This isolated 6-O-derivative was further transformed to 2,3,4-tri-O-acyl derivatives, bearing a wide variety of functionalities in a single molecular framework. The structures of the newly designed molecules were elucidated with the aid of IR, H-1 NMR, mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The prediction of the activity spectra for the compounds (PASS) and their in vitro antimicrobial evaluation were performed, demonstrating them to be potential antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial tests demonstrated that the compounds 3 and 5 were the most potent with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, ranging from 0.312 +/- 0.01 to 1.25 +/- 0.03 mg/mL, and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values, ranging from 0.625 +/- 0.02 to 2.50 +/- 0.05 mg/mL. A quantum chemical study was performed to calculate the thermodynamic, molecular orbital and electrostatic potential properties of the designed compounds. Molecular docking simulation was carried out against SARS-CoV-2 M-pro protein 7BQY and 6Y84 to investigate their binding energy and binding tactics with the viral protein, and better binding affinity than that of the parent drug was observed. Also, pharmacokinetic prediction revealed an improved drug-likeness profile for all MDM derivatives.","Yasmin, F.; Amin, M. R.; Hosen, M. A.; Bulbul, M. Z. H.; Dey, S.; Kawsar, S. M.

170476,Pandemic sees steady alcohol and marijuana use in youth,2021,"Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD) appear to be effective research tools, which may address the problem of ecological validity in neuropsychological testing. However, their widespread implementation is hindered by VR induced symptoms and effects (VRISE) and the lack of skills in VR software development. This study offers guidelines for the development of VR software in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, by describing and discussing the stages of the development of Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment Lab (VR-EAL), the first neuropsychological battery in immersive VR. Techniques for evaluating cognitive functions within a realistic storyline are discussed. The utility of various assets in Unity, software development kits, and other software are described so that cognitive scientists can overcome challenges pertinent to VRISE and the quality of the VR software. In addition, this pilot study attempts to evaluate VR-EAL in accordance with the necessary criteria for VR software for research purposes. The VR neuroscience questionnaire (VRNQ; Kourtesis et al., 2019b) was implemented to appraise the quality of the three versions of VR-EAL in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Twenty-five participants aged between 20 and 45 years with 12-16 years of full-time education evaluated various versions of VR-EAL. The final version of VR-EAL achieved high scores in every sub-score of the VRNQ and exceeded its parsimonious cut-offs. It also appeared to have better in-game assistance and game mechanics, while its improved graphics substantially increased the quality of the user experience and almost eradicated VRISE. The results substantially support the feasibility of the development of effective VR research and clinical software without the presence of VRISE during a 60-minute VR session.","Kourtesis, Panagiotis; Korre, Danai; Collina, Simona; Doumas, Leonidas A.A.; MacPherson, Sarah E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08166v1.pdf,361

Accordingly, this study aims to provide unique and important policy insights on trends and drivers of participation in physical exercises by academic community in Sri Lankan universities.Design/methodology/approachFor this purpose, we collected cross-sectional data (n = 456) in 2020 using a survey, and first, estimated a double-hurdle model to uncover covariates influencing likelihood and intensity of physical exercises overall. Second, count-data models are estimated to capture regularity of key exercises.FindingsThe results reveal that about 50% of members do not participate in any general physical exercise. Older members (marginal effect (ME) = 3.764, p &lt; 0.01), non-Buddhists (ME = 54.889, p &lt; 0.01) and alcohol consumers (ME = 32.178, p &lt; 0.05) exhibit a higher intensity of participating in exercises overall. The intensity is lower for rural members (ME = −63.807, p &lt; 0.01) and those with health insurance covers (ME = −31.447, p &lt; 0.05). Individuals diagnosed for chronic illnesses show a higher likelihood of exercising but, their time devotion is limited. The number of children the academic staff members have as parents reduces the likelihood, but for those who choose to exercise have higher time devotion with increased number of children. The covariates play a similar role in determining regularity of key exercises: walking, jogging and exercising on workout machines.Research limitations/implicationsThe results imply a need to promote exercising in general and particularly among younger, healthy, insured and female individuals living in rural sector.Originality/valueThe study covers an under-researched professional sub-group in an under-researched developing context, examining both the likelihood and regularity of exercising as both dimensions are equally important for individuals to maintain healthy lives.","Kumara, Ajantha Sisira Vilani Sachitra",Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1108/he-02-2021-0031,361
172074,Reduction in Hrqol with Increasing Voc Frequency among Patients with Scd,2020,"Aim/Purpose The purposes of this research are to analyze online learning management activities conducted by the principals of junior high schools in Indonesia in facing COVID-19 as well as to discuss their perspective and expectations towards online learning activities when facing COVID-19 and after COVID-19 has passed. Background Due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indonesian Minister of Education and Culture instructed that teaching and learning activities for all levels of education in Indonesia must be carried out online from home. There have been comprehensive reports about the various forms of online learning, its effects on students, the challenges, the learning transition from offline to online, and teachers' views on this new approach. Very few, if any, focus on how principals act upon the transition during this COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this research focuses on how principals overcome various problems that arise in the implementation of online learning activities. Methodology As many as 309 principals of junior high school from twelve districts in Indonesia were asked to give their responses to a set of questionnaires. The reliability of the questionnaire was analyzed using Cronbach's Alpha with the help of SmartPLS 3.0 software. The percentage was mainly used in the descriptive analysis. To obtain the influence among variables, the statistical inferential analysis was used. Contribution Although the sample size of this research is limited, the results may contribute to the existing theory and practice related to the implementation of online learning in Indonesia. The findings of this research could be a guide for principals to manage online learning in the future. Findings The data analysis showed that the constructs of organizing and monitoring-evaluation were found to play an important role as a mediator between the variables of planning with implementation of principal management in online learning. Path analysis demonstrated that the implementation variable was significantly influenced by the variables of planning, organizing and monitoring-evaluation, with a contribution value of 78.20%. Thus, it indicated that the planning, organizing and monitoring-evaluation variables contributed directly or indirectly to the implementation of principal management in online learning. Generally, the online learning management activities conducted by the principals of junior high schools in Indonesia have been carried out well, especially in the Implementing aspect. However, the aspects of Planning, as well as Monitoring and Evaluation, still need to be improved. Recommendations for Practitioners The government is recommended to provide adequate online learning supporting facilities as well as to facilitate teachers to increase insight and knowledge in terms of technology use, especially in designing, implementing, and providing assessments of online learning. So far, the government has provided some facilities and conveniences to principals and teachers. However, some information and ICT related trainings from the government during the COVID-19 pandemic is not widely known by the principals and the teachers. Socialization about these is needed. Recommendations for Researchers This work offers a theoretical understanding of the problems faced by school principals in facing COVID-19. Further research on how principals and teachers manage online learning activities needs to be carried out to solve various problems which might arise during the process of implementation. Impact on Society This research suggests that the principals in Indonesia have good online learning management. However, to reach the stated learning objectives efficiently and effectively, the principals need to collaborate with the teachers as the main facilitators of the teaching and learning process. Cooperation with parents is also highly recommended. Future Research Further research should focus on how the application of online learning can improve students' achievement through good management and collaboration with teachers, other administration staff at schools, and parents.","Hadriana, Mahdum Isjoni Futra D.; Primahardani, I.",Journal of Information Technology Education-Research,https://doi.org/10.28945/4819,361
172118,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and work-related burnout among healthcare workers at an academic center,2021,"Background Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise as a non-invasive alternative to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with implantable devices, which has been used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression. Prior work has used functional MRI to investigate the brain response to taVNS, and more recent work has also demonstrated potential therapeutic effects of high-frequency sub-threshold taVNS in rheumatoid arthritis. However, no studies to date have measured the effects of high-frequency sub-threshold taVNS on cerebral blood flow (CBF). Objective/Hypothesis The objective of this study was to determine whether high-frequency (20 kHz) sub-threshold taVNS induces significant changes in CBF. Methods Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scans were performed on 20 healthy subjects in a single-blind placebo-controlled repeated measures experimental design. The ASL scans were performed before and after 15 minutes of either sub-threshold taVNS treatment or a sham control. Results taVNS induced significant changes in CBF in the superior posterior cerebellum that were largely localized to bilateral Crus I and Crus II. Post hoc analyses showed that the changes were driven by a treatment-related decrease in CBF. Conclusions Fifteen minutes of high-frequency sub-threshold taVNS can induce sustained CBF decreases in the bilateral posterior cerebellum in a cohort of healthy subjects. This study lays the foundation for future studies in clinical popluations to assess whether similar effects can be observed and are related to treatment outcomes.","Chen, Conan; Mao, Yixiang; Falahpour, Maryam; MacNiven, Kelly H.; Heit, Gary; Sharma, Vivek; Alataris, Konstantinos; Liu, Thomas T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.451709,361

We analysed data from 18 survey organisations with measures on political trust (general, leadership, and COVID-19-related) spanning the period December 2019–October 2020. We examined the percentage of trust and distrust across time, identifying where significant changes coincide with national events. Levels of political trust were low following the 2019 UK General Election. They rose at the onset of UK lockdown imposed in March 2020 but showed persistent gradual decline throughout the remainder of the year, falling to pre-COVID levels by October 2020. Inability to sustain the elevated political trust achieved at the onset of the pandemic is likely to have made the management of public confidence and behaviour increasingly challenging, pointing to the need for strategies to sustain trust levels when handling future crises.","Davies, Ben Lalot Fanny Peitz Linus Heering Maria S.; Ozkececi, Hilal Babaian Jacinta Davies Hayon Kaya Broadwood Jo Abrams Dominic",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00850-6,361

Hal tersebut membuat minat investasi di Indonesia selama empat tahun terakhir berkembang sangat pesat. Akan tetapi, peningkatan jumlah investor dan banyaknya keuntungan yang ditawarkan tidak menggambarkan secara nyata kinerja investasi para investor itu sendiri. Kinerja investasi yang baik juga memiliki korelasi kuat dengan pengambilan keputusan investasi yang baik dan rasional. Seorang investor yang baik biasanya akan membuat suatu keputusan investasi yang rasional, tetapi nyatanya para investor sering kali membuat keputusan investasi yang buruk akibat pengaruh faktor psikologis dalam diri mereka sendiri. Sebagai contohnya, pada masa pandemi COVID-19 ini, IHSG Indonesia bahkan seluruh negara mengalami penurunan drastis akibat kepanikan para investor. Dari contoh tersebut dapat kita ketahui bahwa peran faktor psikologis sangatlah penting. Penelitian ini dibuat dengan tujuan untuk mencari tahu dan menguji faktor-faktor behavioural finance yang memiliki pengaruh kepada para investor di Kepulauan Riau dalam proses pengambilan keputusan investasi. Faktor-faktor behavioural finance yang diuji pada penelitian ini adalah representativeness bias, availability bias, overconfidence bias, loss aversion bias, dan anchoring and adjustment bias. Sampel yang digunakan sebagai bahan pengujian berjumlah 133 responden yang merupakan investor aktif di Kepulauan Riau.

Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.","Leng, Jiewu; Zhou, Man; Xiao, Yuxuan; Zhang, Hu; Liu, Qiang; Shen, Weiming; Su, Qianyi; Li, Longzhang",Journal of Cleaner Production,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652621014979; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652621014979,361
174279,The interrelation between proactive coping and job stressors subjective evaluation in healthcare professionals during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Serious games have been investigated for their use in multiple forms of rehabilitation for decades. The rising trend to use games for physical fitness in more recent years has also provided more options and garnered more interest for their use in physical rehabilitation and motor learning. In this paper, we report the results of an opinion survey of serious games in upper limb prosthetic training. Objective: This study investigates and contrasts the expectations and preferences for game based prosthetic rehabilitation of people with limb difference and researchers. Methods: Both participant groups answered open and closed questions as well as a questionnaire to assess their user types. The distribution of the user types was compared with a Pearson's {chi}2 test against a sample population. The data was analysed with the thematic framework method; answers fell within the themes of usability, training, and game design. Researchers shared their views on current challenges and what could be done to tackle these. Results: A total of 14 people with limb difference and 12 researchers took part in this survey. The open questions resulted in an overview of the different views on prosthetic training games between the groups. The user types of people with limb difference and researchers were both significantly different from the sample population with {chi}2=12.31 and {chi}2=26.50, respectively. Conclusions: We found that the respondents show a general willingness and tentative optimism towards the topic, but also acknowledge hurdles limiting the adoption of these games by both clinics and users. Results indicate a noteworthy difference between researchers and limb different people in their game preferences, which could lead to design choices that do not represent the target audience. Furthermore, focus on long-term in-home experiments is expected to shed more light onto the validity of games in upper limb prosthetic rehabilitation.","Garske, C.

Memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7–9 years), young adults (18–30 years), and older adults (65–76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, we distinguished memory for the specific items versus the general categories. We identified repetition suppression in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects, which did not differ between groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. Our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.","Sommer, Verena R.; Mount, Luzie; Weigelt, Sarah; Werkle-Bergner, Markus; Sander, Myriam C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.14.295972,361

Using a mixed methodology with statistical methods, social media analysis, natural language processing and qualitative content analysis, this study seeks to investigate which sources and stakeholders were referenced and the narratives that structured the arguments of far-right supporters who defended the use of hydroxychloroquine. The results highlight the use of sources that are ideologically aligned to the right and a reconfiguration of scientific authority that was supported by illiberal values. Among the main discourses, we observed an epistemic challenge with a partisan bias, which led to the scientific authority legitimising some arguments and discrediting others.

183132,Responding to COVID-19 in eye health,2020-09-01,"To pursue a more mechanistic understanding of the neural control of behavior, many neuroethologists study animal behavior in controlled laboratory environments. One popular approach is to measure the movements of restrained animals while presenting controlled sensory stimulation. This approach is especially powerful when applied to genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, where modern genetic tools enable unprecedented access to the nervous system for activity monitoring or targeted manipulation. While there is a long history of measuring the behavior of body- and head-fixed insects walking on an air-supported ball, the methods typically require complex setups with many custom components. Here we present a compact, simplified setup for these experiments that achieves high-performance at low cost. The simplified setup combines existing hardware and software solutions with new component designs. We replaced expensive optomechanical and custom machined components with off-the-shelf and 3D-printed parts. We built the system around an inexpensive camera that achieves 180 Hz imaging and use an inexpensive tablet computer for presenting view-angle-corrected stimuli updated through a local network. We quantify the performance of the integrated system and characterize the visually guided behavior of flies in response to a range of visual stimuli. The improved system is thoroughly documented. This publication is accompanied by CAD files, parts lists, source code, and step-by-step instructions for setting up the system and analyzing behavioral data. We detail a complete ~$.300 system, including a cold-anesthesia tethering stage, that is ideal for hands-on teaching laboratories. This represents a nearly 50-fold cost reduction as compared to a typical system used in research laboratories, yet is fully featured and yields excellent performance. We report the current state of this system, which started with a one-day teaching lab for which we built seven parallel setups and continues towards a setup in our lab for larger-scale analysis of visual-motor behavior in flies. Because of the simplicity, compactness, and low cost of this system, we believe that high-performance measurements of tethered insect behavior should now be widely accessible and suitable for integration into many systems. This access enables broad opportunities for comparative work across labs, species, and behavioral paradigms.","Loesche, Frank; Reiser, Michael B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442008,361
183133,How to make hand sanitiser gel,2020-09-01,"T cell aging is a complex process combining the emergence of cellular defects with activation of adaptive mechanisms. Generation of T cell memory is impaired, while a low-inflammatory state is induced, in part due to effector T cells. To determine whether age-associated changes in T cell fate decisions occur early after T cell activation, we profiled the longitudinal transcriptional and epigenetic landscape induced by TCR stimulation comparing naïve CD4+ T cells from young and older adults. In spite of attenuated TCR signaling, activation-induced remodeling of the epigenome increased with age, culminating in heightened BATF and BLIMP1 activity. Single cell studies, integrating ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, identified increases in dysfunctional and in effector T cells and a decrease in BACH2-expressing memory cell precursors. STAT5 activation, in part due to a decline in HELIOS and aberrant IL-2 receptor expression, accounted for the induction of transcription factor networks favoring effector cell differentiation.","Zhang, Huimin; Jadhav, Rohit R.; Cao, Wenqiang; Goronzy, Isabel N.; Jin, Jun; Greenleaf, William J.; Weyand, Cornelia M.; Goronzy, Jörg J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.27.457205,361

185036,School Closures and Mental Health Concerns for Children and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020,"This qualitative study compared school leaders’ perspectives towards their leadership practices in times of emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of twenty-seven school leaders from public and private schools across five Arab countries (Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, and Qatar) participated in the study. Following Turbulence Theory and an ecological framework, the study adopted in-depth semi-structured interviews to respond to the following queries: (1) What were the major actions taken by school leaders during the crisis? (2) What were the resemblances and disparities between school leaders’ practices across the five countries? Findings of the study revealed different levels of turbulence among school leaders within the same country and across the five countries. In addition, participants revealed valuable insight pertaining to changed leadership and educational practices in their schools in a post-COVID era. Further conclusions and implications are fully discussed.

The morbidity rate concerned with COVID-19 also shoots up in the case of individuals with a weak immune system such as children, older patients, or sufferers with already have health-related problems. In the present, herbal medicinal products can serve as healing agents, to assist human beings in combating the COVID-19 infection through boosting their immune responses. Herbal remedies must fulfill the regulatory standards of quality, safety, and efficacy to get market approval. At present, the requirements and regulations of herbal remedies differ based on the regulatory requirement of country, which raises a dispute for the manufacturing of standardized herbal remedies in the global market. The main intention of this review article is to compile and discuss various traditional herbal medicine and their remedies to assist in strengthening the immune system and even plays the better role in fighting against coronavirus.","Arun Pandiyan, E.; Srinivasan, M.

187353,The importance of planning in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in Paraguay.,2020,"Antibodies raised against baculovirus-expressed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) recognized a 95-kDa antigen and two smaller proteins in sucrose-purified Leishmania virus particles isolated from infected parasites. The 95-kDa antigen is similar in size to one predicted by translation of the RDRP open reading frame (ORF) alone. In an effort to reconcile in vitro observations of translational frameshifting on Leishmania RNA virus 1-4 transcripts, we have developed an in vitro cleavage assay system to explore the possibility that the fusion polyprotein is proteolytically processed. We show that coincubation a synthetic Cap-Pol fusion protein with lysates from Leishmania parasites yields major cleavage products similar in size to those encoded by the individual capsid and RDRP genes as well as the antigens detected in vivo. The major 82- and 95-kDa major cleavage products are specifically immunoprecipitated by capsid- or polymerase-specific antibodies, respectively, showing that cleavage occurs at or near the junction of the two functional domains. Protease inhibitor studies suggest that a cysteine-like protease is responsible for cleavage in the in vitro assay system developed here. From these results, we suggest that failure to detect a capsid-polymerase fusion protein produced by translational frameshifting in vivo may be due to specific proteolytic processing.","Ro, Y T; Scheffter, S M; Patterson, J L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9371554/,361

METHODS In this study, 132 COVID-19 patients were classified as good outcome (n=62) and poor outcome (n=70) groups. Laboratory parameters were evaluated on admission and within 5-7 days after hospitalization. RESULTS Baseline levels of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer and LDH were higher (p<0.01); lymphocyte count was lower in the poor outcome patients. During follow-up there was a larger decrease in lymphocyte count and more prominent increases in other biomarkers (p<0.001). In ROC analysis, the AUCs strongly indicated the poor outcome on days 5-7 of the hospitalization.

Each group was inoculated with a fecal isolate of bovine coronavirus via different routes: orally/intranasally OR/IN, No. 1 through 8, group 1 calves; OR, No. 9 through 13, group 2 calves; IN, No. 14 through 18, group 3 calves. Nasal swab specimens and fecal specimens were collected daily and were examined for coronavirus antigen by use of direct immunofluorescent staining (nasal epithelial cells) or by use of immune electron microscopy (fecal specimens). All but 4 calves (No. 11, 13, 17, and 18) were euthanatized on postinoculation days (PID) 3 to 7. Calves 11 and 17 became severely dehydrated and died at PID 5. Calves 13 and 18 were evaluated for nasal and fecal shedding of coronavirus through PID 14. Distribution of coronavirus antigen in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of the 14 euthanatized calves was evaluated by use of direct immunofluorescent staining. All calves developed profuse diarrhea by PID 2 to 4; however, calves did not develop clinical signs of respiratory tract disease before euthanasia or death. Inoculated calves shed coronavirus in their feces as detected by use of immune electron microscopy. Infected nasal epithelial cells were detected in all but 2 orally inoculated calves (No. 9 and 10). Route of inoculation influenced the sequence of initial detection of coronavirus antigen from fecal specimens or nasal swab specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Saif, L J; Redman, D R; Moorhead, P D; Theil, K W",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3017160/,361

190770,What's in this issue.,2004,"All coronaviruses possess small open reading frames (ORFs) between structural genes that have been hypothesized to play important roles in pathogenesis. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) ORF 3a is one such gene. It is highly conserved among group 3 coronaviruses, suggesting that it has an important function in infection. IBV 3a protein is expressed in infected cells but is not detected in virions. Sequence analysis predicted that IBV 3a was a membrane protein; however, only a fraction behaved like an integral membrane protein. Microscopy and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that IBV 3a localized to the cytoplasm in a diffuse pattern as well as in sharp puncta in both infected and transfected cells. These puncta did not overlap cellular organelles or other punctate structures. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that IBV 3a puncta lined up along smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules and, in a significant number of instances, were partially surrounded by these tubules. Our results suggest that IBV 3a is partially targeted to a novel domain of the smooth ER.","Pendleton, Amanda R; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857999/,361

Vimentin bound to PRRSV nucleocapsid protein and anti-vimentin antibodies showed PRRSV-blocking activity. Vimentin was expressed on the surface of MARC-145, a PRRSV-susceptible cell line. Simian vimentin rendered BHK-21 and CRFK, nonsusceptible cell lines, susceptible to PRRSV infection.

Rabbit antisera were prepared using full-length N and M proteins and eight expressed fragments covering the S protein. Antisera to S and M proteins were found to have different neutralizing titres towards SARS-CoV infection in vivo, ranging from 1:35 to 1:128. Antiserum to the N protein did not contain neutralizing antibodies. Epitopes inducing protective humoral responses to virus infection were located mainly in the M protein and a region spanning residues 13-877 of the S protein. The neutralizing ability of antisera directed against the expressed structural proteins was greater than that of convalescent patient antisera, confirming that, as immunogens, the former induce strong, SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. The in vitro neutralization assay has important implications for the design of an effective, protein-based vaccine preventing SARS-CoV infection.","Pang, Hai; Liu, Yinggang; Han, Xueqing; Xu, Yanhui; Jiang, Fuguo; Wu, Donglai; Kong, Xiangang; Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15448374/,361

Mental Health Linkages.,2021,"Introduction Raising knowledge over cardiac complications and managing them can play a key role in their recovery. In this study, we aim to investigate the evidence regarding the prevalence of cardiac complications and the resulting mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Method Search was conducted in electronic databases of Medline (using PubMed), Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, in addition to the manual search in preprint databases, and Google and Google scholar search engines, for articles published from 2019 until April 30th, 2020. Inclusion criterion was reviewing and reporting cardiac complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Results The initial search resulted in 853 records, out of which 40 articles were included. Overall analysis showed that the prevalence of acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiac arrest were 19.46% (95% CI: 18.23-20.72), 19.07% (95% CI: 15.38-23.04) and 3.44% (95% CI: 3.08-3.82), respectively. Moreover, abnormal serum troponin level was observed in 22.86% (95% CI: 21.19-24.56) of the COVID-19 patients. Further analysis revealed that the overall odds of mortality is 14.24 (95% CI: 8.67-23.38) times higher when patients develop acute cardiac injury. The pooled odds ratio of mortality when the analysis was limited to abnormal serum troponin level was 19.03 (95% CI: 11.85-30.56). Conclusion Acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum troponin level were the most prevalent cardiac complications/abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. The importance of cardiac complications is emphasized due to the higher mortality rate among patients with these complications. Thus, troponin screenings and cardiac evaluations are recommended to be performed in routine patient assessments.","Toloui, Amirmohammad; Moshrefiaraghi, Donya; Madani Neishaboori, Arian; Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Haji Aghajani, Mohammad",Archives of academic emergency medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870205/,361

195494,Letter To The Editor - The Covid-19 Pandemic And Mental Health As Issues Considered Within The Context Of Adjustment Disorder And Psychosocial Interventions.,2020,"Turtles and other reptiles are reservoirs of Salmonella and have long been a recognized source of Salmonella infection in humans. Small turtles have posed a particular danger to young children because these turtles might not be perceived as health hazards and can be handled like toys. Salmonella infections in children can be severe and can result in hospitalization and occasionally in death. The association between Salmonella infection in children and exposure to turtles led to a 1975 law prohibiting the sale or distribution of small turtles (i.e., those with a carapace of <4 inches in length) in the United States. That prohibition led to a substantial decline in human salmonellosis cases associated with turtles. However, because the prohibition is not fully enforced and contains exceptions (e.g., sales for educational purposes), human turtle-associated cases continue to occur. This report describes several recent cases of turtle-associated salmonellosis reported to CDC by state and local health departments since September 2006, including a fatal case in an infant. These cases illustrate that small turtles remain a source of human Salmonella infections. Although ongoing public education measures aimed at preventing reptile-acquired Salmonella infections are helpful, prohibiting the sale of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.",,MMWR.

196651,Mental Health Crisis in Pregnant Women during Current COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020,"INTRODUCTION The Resources for Infection Control in Hospitals (RICH) project assessed infection control programs and rates of antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999. In the meantime, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the concern over pandemic influenza have stimulated considerable government and healthcare institutional efforts to improve infection control systems in Canada. METHODS In 2006, a version of the RICH survey similar to the original RICH instrument was mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian acute care hospitals with 80 or more beds. Chi-square, ANOVA, and analysis of covariance analyses tested for differences between the 1999 and 2005 samples for infection control program components and ARO rates. RESULTS 72.3% of Canadian acute care hospitals completed the RICH survey for 1999 and 60.1% for 2005. Hospital size was controlled for in analyses involving AROs and surveillance and control intensity levels. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates increased from 1999 to 2005 (F = 9.4, P = 0.003). In 2005, the MRSA rate was 5.2 (SD 6.1) per 1,000 admissions and in 1999 was 2.0 (SD 2.9). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) rates, trended up from 1999 to 2005 (F = 2.9, P = 0.09). In 2005, the mean CDAD rate was 4.7 (SD 4.3) and in 1999 it was 3.8 (SD 4.3). The proportion of hospitals that reported having new nosocomial Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) cases was greater in 2005 than in 1999 (X = 10.5, P = 0.001). In 1999, 34.5% (40 of 116) hospitals reported having new nosocomial VRE cases and in 2005, 61.0% (64 of 105) reported new cases. Surveillance intensity index scores increased from 61.7 (SD 18.5) in 1999 to 68.1 (SD 15.4) in 2005 (F = 4.1, P = 0.04). Control intensity index scores, trended upwards slightly from 60.8 (SD 14.6) in 1999 to 64.1 (12.2) in 2005 (F = 3.2, P = 0.07). ICP full time equivalents (FTEs) per 100 beds increased from 0.5 (SD 0.2) in 1999 to 0.8 (SD 0.3) in 2005 (F = 90.8, P < 0.0001). However, the proportion of ICPs in hospitals certified by the Certification Board of Infection Control (CBIC) decreased from 53% (SD 46) in 1999 to 38% (SD 36) in 2005 (F = 8.7, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continued to fall short of expert recommendations for human resources and surveillance and control activities. Meanwhile, Nosocomial MRSA rates more than doubled between 1999 and 2005 and hospitals reporting new nosocomial VRE cases increased 77% over the same period. While investments have been made towards infection control programs in Canadian acute hospitals, the rapid rise in ICP positions has not yet translated into marked improvements in surveillance and control activities. In the face of substantial increases in ARO rates in Canada, continued efforts to train ICPs and support hospital infection control programs are necessary.","Zoutman, Dick E; Ford, B Douglas",The Canadian journal of infection control : the official journal of the Community & Hospital Infection Control Association-Canada = Revue canadienne de prevention des infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19697536/,361

There appearto be hierarchies in terms of the type of organism being modified, the purpose of the application, the means to attain particular ends, and the nature of the benefits obtained. While general awareness of biotechnology and its specific applications remains low to moderate, this article presents data regarding public acceptance of a variety of applications. These range from the use of animals as disease models and as sources for tissues and organs, to the use of transgenic animals for disease control, for food, and for the production of pharmaceutical and industrial products. Case-by-case judgments are evident, but at the same time, the application of criteria such as the nature of the organism being modified, the animal welfare aspects and the ethical-moral concerns are additional criteria for public judgments.

199975,Factors associated with mental health and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil,2021,"The heptad repeat (HR), a conserved structural motif of class I viral fusion proteins, is responsible for the formation of a six-helix bundle structure during the envelope fusion process. The insect baculovirus F protein is a newly found budded virus envelope fusion protein which possesses common features to class I fusion proteins, such as proteolytic cleavage and the presence of an N-terminal open fusion peptide and multiple HR domains on the transmembrane subunit F(1). Similar to many vertebrate viral fusion proteins, a conserved leucine zipper motif is predicted in this HR region proximal to the fusion peptide in baculovirus F proteins. To facilitate our understanding of the functional role of this leucine zipper-like HR1 domain in baculovirus F protein synthesis, processing, and viral infectivity, key leucine residues (Leu209, Leu216, and Leu223) were replaced by alanine (A) or arginine (R), respectively. By using Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) as a pseudotype expression system, we demonstrated that all mutant F proteins incorporated into budded virus, indicating that leucine substitutions did not affect intercellular trafficking of F. Furin-like protease cleavage was not affected by any of the leucine substitutions; however, the disulfide bridging and N-linked glycosylation patterns were partly altered. Single substitutions in HR1 showed that the three leucine residues were critical for F fusogenicity and the rescue of AcMNPV infectivity. Our results support the view that the leucine zipper-like HR1 domain is important to safeguard the proper folding, glycosylation, and fusogenicity of baculovirus F proteins.","Long, Gang; Pan, Xiaoyu; Vlak, Just M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094156/,361
202881,Telemedicine in Neurology: A Scoping Review of Key Outcomes in Movement Disorders,2021,"Deep learning had a remarkable impact in different scientific disciplines during the last years. This was demonstrated in numerous tasks, where deep learning algorithms were able to outperform the state-of-art methods, also in image processing and analysis. Moreover, deep learning delivers good results in tasks like autonomous driving, which could not have been performed automatically before. There are even applications where deep learning outperformed humans, like object recognition or games. Another field in which this development is showing a huge potential is the medical domain. With the collection of large quantities of patient records and data, and a trend towards personalized treatments, there is a great need for an automatic and reliable processing and analysis of this information. Patient data is not only collected in clinical centres, like hospitals, but it relates also to data coming from general practitioners, healthcare smartphone apps or online websites, just to name a few. This trend resulted in new, massive research efforts during the last years. In Q2/2020, the search engine PubMed returns already over 11.000 results for the search term $'$deep learning$'$, and around 90% of these publications are from the last three years. Hence, a complete overview of the field of $'$medical deep learning$'$ is almost impossible to obtain and getting a full overview of medical sub-fields gets increasingly more difficult. Nevertheless, several review and survey articles about medical deep learning have been presented within the last years. They focused, in general, on specific medical scenarios, like the analysis of medical images containing specific pathologies. With these surveys as foundation, the aim of this contribution is to provide a very first high-level, systematic meta-review of medical deep learning surveys.","Egger, Jan; Gsxaner, Christina; Pepe, Antonio; Li, Jianning",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14881v1.pdf,361

The respondents were proposed to fill in remotely an anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the experience of prescribing medicines off-label to adult patients.Results Prescribing medicines not in consistence with the officially approved instruction for medical use (off-label or ""outside instruction"") is a relevant issue of global medical care since convincing scientific evidence for safety of such use is scarce. Analysis of information about off-label prescription is one of current tasks of national medical research centers according to the Federal Project ""Development of a network of national medical research centers and implementation of innovative medical technologies"". According to the responses about the frequency of off-label prescriptions 67.5â% of respondents reported of no experience of off-label prescription, 27.7â% said ""rarely"" or ""sometimes"", and 4.8â% said ""frequently"" and ""very frequently"". Specialties of physicians who have more often used medicines off-label (50% and more) included obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, rheumatology, hematology, and pulmonology. Cardiologists, neurologists and clinical pharmacologists use medicines off-label relatively rarely (19.6%, 28.6â%, and 22.2â%, respectively). 40â% of medicines used off-label were those designed for the treatment of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2. The medicines most frequently used off-label included metformin, rituximab, and thioctic acid. 65â% of respondents assessed their knowledge of off-label prescription as insufficient. In addition, 75â% of respondents consider it useful to receive additional information about risks and benefits of off-label prescription in clinical practice.Conclusion The survey revealed the need of physicians for information about risks of the off-label use of medicines in clinical practice.","Drapkina, O M; Shepel, R N; Martsevich, S Yu; Kutishenko, N P; Berns, S A; Bulgakova, E S; Orlov, D O; Belkin, I A",Kardiologiia,,361
204468,Occupational Therapy in the Community and Population Health Practice,2020,"Background: On 11th March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as Pandemic. The estimation of transmission dynamics in the initial days of the outbreak of disease is crucial to control its spread in a new area. The serial interval is one of the significant epidemiological measures that determine the spread of infectious disease. It is the time interval between the onset of symptoms in the primary and secondary case. Objective: The present study aimed at the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the currently available evidence for the serial interval of COVID-19. Methodology: Data on serial intervals were used from 11 studies by implementing inclusion and exclusion criteria after initial screening. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled estimate of the serial interval. The heterogeneity and bias in the included studies were tested by various statistical measures and tests, including I2 statistic, Cochran's Q test, Egger's test, and Beggs's test. Result: The pooled estimate for the serial interval was 5.40 (5.19, 5.61) and 5.19 (4.37, 6.02) by the fixed and random effects model, respectively. The heterogeneity between the studies was found to be 89.9% by I2 statistic. There is no potential bias introduced in the meta-analysis due to small study effects. Conclusion: The present review provides sufficient evidence for the estimate of serial interval of COVID-19, which can help in understanding the epidemiology and transmission of the disease. The serial interval can be useful for policy makers including contract tracing and monitoring community transmission of COVID-19.","Rai, Balram; Shukla, Anandi; Dwivedi, Laxmi Kant",,,361

Low birth weight (LBW) alters cardiovascular and lung development and predisposes to adult disease. We hypothesized that LBW is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in non-elderly subjects. We analyzed a prospective cohort of 397 patients (18-70 years) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection attended in a tertiary hospital, where 15% required admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Perinatal and current potentially predictive variables were obtained from all patients and LBW was defined as birth weight &#8804; 2.500 g. Age (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.04 [1-1.07], P = 0.012), male sex (aOR 3.39 [1.72-6.67], P < 0.001), hypertension (aOR 3.37 [1.69-6.72], P = 0.001), and LBW (aOR 3.61 [1.55-8.43], P = 0.003) independently predicted admission to ICU. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of this model was 0.79 [95% CI, 0.74-0.85], with positive and negative predictive values of 29.1% and 97.6% respectively. Results were reproduced in an independent cohort, from a web-based survey in 1822 subjects who self-reported laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, where 46 patients (2.5%) needed ICU admission (AUC 0.74 [95% CI 0.68-0.81]).

207257,COVI-Prim survey: Challenges for Austrian and German general practitioners during initial phase of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest a higher incidence of COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers (HCW). However, information about the long-term complications affecting this population is lacking. AIMS: Investigation of long-term impact of COVID-19 in HCW. METHODS: Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated for the majority of HCW in an English teaching hospital 2 months following the peak of COVID-19 first wave. A questionnaire investigating the long-term complications was sent through global e-mail to HCW 4 months following the peak of the wave enquiring about the persistent health issues still affecting them at that point. RESULTS: Out of 3759 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 932 were positive (24%). Forty-five per cent of 138 HCW responding to the questionnaire reported persistent symptoms with 32% struggling to cope 3-4 months following the peak of the wave. Moderate-to-severe fatigue stood out as the most disabling symptom (39%) but mild-to-moderate shortness of breath, anxiety and sleep disturbance were almost universal in the subjects still struggling with symptoms. Only 16% consulted their general practitioner (GP) about their symptoms with only 2% taking sick leave after recovering from the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that about a third of HCW who responded to the survey were still struggling to cope with the symptoms of what is now known as long covid several months after the acute COVID-19 infections. The overwhelming majority of this group seem to be reluctant to neither seek medical advice nor take sick leave.","Gaber, T A-Z K; Ashish, A; Unsworth, A",Occup. med,,361

209587,Social Determinants of Health Are Needed in COVID-19 Risk Assessments for the Workforce,2020,"Objectives: To explain and demonstrate a new approach for rapidly developing a decision-support tool for prioritizing patients with coronovirus 2019 disease for admission to ICUs. Design: An expert group used multi-criteria decision analysis methods to specify criteria and weights, representing their relative importance, for prioritizing patients with coronovirus 2019 disease with respect to likely clinical benefit. Specialized multi-criteria decision analysis software, implementing the ""Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives"" method to determine the weights, was used. Social equity considerations for prioritizing patients were also identified as important. Setting: The prioritization tool was developed in New Zealand. Subjects: An expert group comprising specialists from intensive care medicine and nursing, Maori (New Zealand's indigenous population) health, infectious diseases, and neonatology was formed. The group's work was supported by health economists and decision analysts and overseen by an ethicist and a senior representative from the New Zealand Ministry of Health. Interventions: Multi-criteria decision analysis to create a prioritization tool. Measurements and Main Results: The prioritization tool comprised eight criteria with respect to likely clinical benefit. In decreasing order of importance (weights in parentheses): Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (15.7%), preexisting cardiovascular conditions (15.7%), functional capacity (15.7%), age (12.4%), preexisting respiratory conditions (11.1%), immunocompromised (11.1%), body mass index (9.2%), and other relevant medical conditions (9.2%). Two social equity considerations were also included in the overarching decision framework to be used alongside the clinical criteria: prioritizing Maori and Pacific people (and, potentially, other at-risk groups), and healthcare and other frontline workers. Conclusions: The criteria and weights in the prioritization tool can be easily revised as new evidence emerges. The approach for developing the tool could be used in other countries whose ICUs are at risk of being overwhelmed by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic to rapidly develop their own prioritization tools. In the event that future crises threaten to overload ICUs, other prioritization tools could also be rapidly developed.","Roy, Melyssa; Hansen, Paul; Sullivan, Trudy; Ombler, Franz; Kiore, Mathew; Stapleton, Andrew; Carr, Craig",Crit Care Explor,,361

By March 16th, physical distancing and confinement measures were implemented by the Brazilian government. Little is known about how these measures were followed up by the Brazilian people and their impact on daily routine. METHODS: In early April 2020, using an online platform, we organized an online survey among adults living in Brazil about their COVID-19 preventive behavior and impact on their daily routine. RESULTS: Data from 23,896 respondents were analyzed (mean age: 47.4 years). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, half (51.1%) of the professionals reported working from home. Regular handwashing was practiced by 98.7% of participants; 92.6% reported adhering to the 1.5-2 m physical distancing rule, but only 45.5% wore a face mask when going outside. While 29.3% of respondents found it relatively easy to stay at home, indoor confinement was extremely difficult for 7.9% of participants. Moreover, 11% of participants were extremely worried about their health during the COVID-19 epidemic. Younger people, male, persons living in a rural area/village or popular neighbourhoods, students and workers reported less preventive behaviour. CONCLUSION: Restrictive measures markedly affected the daily and professional routines of Brazilians. Participants showed a satisfactory level of adherence to national COVID-19 prevention guidelines.

213616,Substance consumption styles during the COVID-19 lockdown for socially integrated people who use drugs,2021,"Endothelial dysfunction is implicated in the thrombotic events reported in COVID-19 patients, but underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Circulating levels of the coagulation cascade activator PAI-1 are substantially higher in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory dysfunction than in patients with bacterial-sepsis and ARDS. Indeed, the elevation of PAI-1 is recognized as an early marker of endothelial dysfunction. Here, we report that recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S1 stimulated robust production of PAI-1 by HPMEC. We examined the role of protein degradation in this SARS-CoV-2-S1 induction of PAI-1 and found that the proteasomal degradation inhibitor bortezomib inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S1 mediated changes in PAI-1. Our data further show that bortezomib upregulated KLF2, a shear-stress-regulated transcription factor that suppresses PAI-1 expression. Aging and metabolic disorders are known to increase the mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients. We therefore examined the role of ZMPSTE24, a metalloprotease with a demonstrated role in host defense against RNA viruses that is decreased in the elderly and in metabolic syndrome, in the induction of PAI-1 in HPMEC by SARS-CoV-2-S1. Indeed, overexpression of ZMPSTE24 blunted enhancement of PAI-1 production in spike protein-exposed HPMEC. Additionally, we found that membrane expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 was reduced by ZMPSTE24-mediated cleavage and shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, leading to accumulation of ACE2 decoy fragments that may bind SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate that decreases in ZMPSTE24 with age and comorbidities may increase vulnerability to vascular endothelial injury by SARS-CoV-2 viruses and that enhanced production of endothelial PAI-1 might play role in prothrombotic events in COVID-19 patients.

216070,COVID-19: Implications for healthcare managers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early studies have reported various electrolyte abnormalities at admission in patients who progress to the severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As electrolyte imbalance may not only impact patient care, but provide insight into the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we aimed to analyse all early data reported on electrolytes in COVID-19 patients with and without severe form. METHODS: An electronic search of Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus and Web of Science was performed for articles comparing electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium) between COVID-19 patients with and without severe disease. A pooled analysis was performed to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Five studies with a total sample size of 1415 COVID-19 patients. Sodium was significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.91 mmol/L [95% CI: -1.33 to -0.50 mmol/L]). Similarly, potassium was also significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with severe disease (WMD: -0.12 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.18 to -0.07 mmol/L], I2=33%). For chloride, no statistical differences were observed between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (WMD: 0.30 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.41 to 1.01 mmol/L]). For calcium, a statistically significant lower concentration was noted in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.20 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.25 to -0.20 mmol/L]). CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis confirms that COVID-19 severity is associated with lower serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium. We recommend electrolytes be measured at initial presentation and serially monitored during hospitalization in order to establish timely and appropriate corrective actions.","Lippi, Giuseppe; South, Andrew M; Henry, Brandon Michael",Ann Clin Biochem,,361

216212,Comorbidities and the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Africa,2020,"As at mid-October 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been continuing on the rise across the globe, including in India. Historically, homeopathy has been used in a number of epidemics/pandemics. The development of homeopathic medicines is approached uniquely through ""drug provings"" and clinical verification; these two intrinsic processes establish the background for the application of homeopathic medicines, regardless of nosological diagnosis. This article reflects research initiatives on COVID-19 in India and identifies studies listed in the Clinical Trial Registry-India database. We identified 29 studies being undertaken in different settings, including those in conventional medicine: 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 observational studies. Fifteen studies are aimed at prophylaxis and 14 are aimed at treatment. Amongst the treatment studies, 11 are focused on efficacy or comparative effectiveness. The findings might provide evidence for clinically repurposing some of homeopathy's medicines, an approach that is intrinsic to the therapy, enabling their use in COVID-19 as an adjuvant or stand-alone to help reduce costs and improve patient recovery.","Varanasi, Roja; Nayak, Debadatta; Khurana, Anil",Homeopathy,,361

Another factor on which investors can make investment decisions is through sentiment analysis of news headlines, the sole purpose of this study. Natural Language Processing techniques are typically used to deal with such a large amount of data and get valuable information out of it. NLP algorithms convert raw text into numerical representations that machines can easily understand and interpret. This conversion can be done using various embedding techniques. In this research, embedding techniques used are BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT, GloVe, and FastText, and then fed to deep learning models such as RNN and LSTM. This work aims to evaluate these model's performance to choose the robust model in identifying the significant factors influencing the prediction. During this research, it was expected that Deep Leaming would be applied to get the desired results or achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art.

The consumption of these medicines can be unsafe, as incorrect self-diagnosis or the ingestion of inappropriate doses can lead to side effects and the occurrence of adverse reactions and drug-drug interactions. A cross-sectional descriptive observational study was carried out, targeting the entire Spanish population by using an online questionnaire. The results showed that 78.9% of the subjects had previously taken or were currently taking OTC drugs. This consumption decreased as the age of the subjects increased, with a prevalence of 36.4% of subjects aged &#8805; 71 taking OTC drugs. Analgesics were the most consumed OTC drugs (49.1%) especially in women, youngsters with non-formal educational qualifications, and individuals of a low-medium socioeconomic level residing in urban areas.

220574,From telehealth to virtual primary care in Australia? A Rapid scoping review,2021,"As calls for fair and unbiased algorithmic systems increase, so too does the number of individuals working on algorithmic fairness in industry. However, these practitioners often do not have access to the demographic data they feel they need to detect bias in practice. Even with the growing variety of toolkits and strategies for working towards algorithmic fairness, they almost invariably require access to demographic attributes or proxies. We investigated this dilemma through semi-structured interviews with 38 practitioners and professionals either working in or adjacent to algorithmic fairness. Participants painted a complex picture of what demographic data availability and use look like on the ground, ranging from not having access to personal data of any kind to being legally required to collect and use demographic data for discrimination assessments. In many domains, demographic data collection raises a host of difficult questions, including how to balance privacy and fairness, how to define relevant social categories, how to ensure meaningful consent, and whether it is appropriate for private companies to infer someone's demographics. Our research suggests challenges that must be considered by businesses, regulators, researchers, and community groups in order to enable practitioners to address algorithmic bias in practice. Critically, we do not propose that the overall goal of future work should be to simply lower the barriers to collecting demographic data. Rather, our study surfaces a swath of normative questions about how, when, and even whether this data should be collected.","Andrus, McKane; Spitzer, Elena; Brown, Jeffrey; Xiang, Alice",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02282v1.pdf,361

Objectives: To assess factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes for patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter cohort study assessed 2215 adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 65 hospitals across the US from March 4 to April 4, 2020. Exposures: Patient-level data, including demographics, comorbidities, and organ dysfunction, and hospital characteristics, including number of ICU beds. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality. Multilevel logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and to examine interhospital variation in treatment and outcomes. Results: A total of 2215 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.5 [14.5] years; 1436 [64.8%] male; 1738 [78.5%] with at least 1 chronic comorbidity) were included in the study. At 28 days after ICU admission, 784 patients (35.4%) had died, 824 (37.2%) were discharged, and 607 (27.4%) remained hospitalized. At the end of study follow-up (median, 16 days; interquartile range, 8-28 days), 875 patients (39.5%) had died, 1203 (54.3%) were discharged, and 137 (6.2%) remained hospitalized. Factors independently associated with death included older age (&#8805;80 vs <40 years of age: odds ratio [OR], 11.15; 95% CI, 6.19-20.06), male sex (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19-1.90), higher body mass index (&#8805;40 vs <25: OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.01-2.25), coronary artery disease (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07-2.02), active cancer (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.35-3.43), and the presence of hypoxemia (Pao2:Fio2<100 vs &#8805;300 mm Hg: OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.11-4.08), liver dysfunction (liver Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 2 vs 0: OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.30-5.25), and kidney dysfunction (renal Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 4 vs 0: OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.46-4.05) at ICU admission. Patients admitted to hospitals with fewer ICU beds had a higher risk of death (<50 vs &#8805;100 ICU beds: OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 2.16-4.99). Hospitals varied considerably in the risk-adjusted proportion of patients who died (range, 6.6%-80.8%) and in the percentage of patients who received hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and other treatments and supportive therapies. Conclusions and Relevance: This study identified demographic, clinical, and hospital-level risk factors that may be associated with death in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and can facilitate the identification of medications and supportive therapies to improve outcomes.","Gupta, Shruti; Hayek, Salim S; Wang, Wei; Chan, Lili; Mathews, Kusum S; Melamed, Michal L; Brenner, Samantha K; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Schenck, Edward J; Radbel, Jared; Reiser, Jochen; Bansal, Anip; Srivastava, Anand; Zhou, Yan; Sutherland, Anne; Green, Adam; Shehata, Alexandre M; Goyal, Nitender; Vijayan, Anitha; Velez, Juan Carlos Q; Shaefi, Shahzad; Parikh, Chirag R; Arunthamakun, Justin; Athavale, Ambarish M; Friedman, Allon N; Short, Samuel A P; Kibbelaar, Zoe A; Abu Omar, Samah; Admon, Andrew J; Donnelly, John P; Gershengorn, Hayley B; Hernán, Miguel A; Semler, Matthew W; Leaf, David E",JAMA intern. med.

During the pandemic caused by COVID-19 and the lockdown established, people have reduced considerably their mobility and motor activity, which has led to an increase in unhealthy lifestyle habits, raising the risk of suffering from diseases. This paper consists of reviewing the existing scientific literature on recommendations of physical activity during the pandemic and to establish specific guidelines according to the type of population to which the activity would be directed. A search strategy has been carried out in the different databases: Embase, PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science (WoS), including all the articles published until 14 May 2020, to find essays with recommendations on aerobic activity, muscle strengthening, flexibility-stretching, meditation-relaxation, and balance exercises. The articles found have been evaluated considering the following criteria: type of publication, proposals for physical exercise, language, and, if it appears, volume of activity, frequency, intensity, and rest. The results obtained 29 articles that discuss patterns of physical activity, although there is no common consensus on such recommendations during confinement, nor are they suitable for all people. From these results, we can conclude that physical activity is widely recommended during the confinement caused by COVID-19, mainly through the performance of aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance exercises.","Polero, Patricia; Rebollo-Seco, Carmen; Adsuar, José C; Pérez-Gómez, Jorge; Rojo-Ramos, Jorge; Manzano-Redondo, Fernando; Garcia-Gordillo, Miguel Ángel; Carlos-Vivas, Jorge",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,361

224678,Evaluating access to health and care services during lockdown by the COVID-19 survey in five UK national longitudinal studies,2021,"COVID-19 is a pandemic viral disease with catastrophic global impact. This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided.","Larsen, Joseph R.; Martin, Margaret R.; Martin, John D.; Kuhn, Peter; Hicks, James B.",Front.

We evaluate the role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected preeclamptic women. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the potential of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), dolutegravir (DTG) and remdesivir (RDV) in drug repurposing and their safety in pregnancy complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In HIV infection, the trans-activator of transcription protein, which has homology with vascular endothelial growth factor, impairs angiogenesis, leading to endothelial injury and possible PE development despite neutralization of their opposing immune states. Markers of ED show strong evidence supporting the adverse role of ART in PE development and mortality compared to treatment-naïve pregnancies. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) to induce ED and hypertension, thereby mimicking angiotensin II-mediated PE in severe cases of infection. Upregulated ACE 2 in pregnancy is a possible risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent PE development. The potential effectiveness of LPV/r against COVID-19 is inconclusive; however, defective decidualization, along with elevated markers of ED, was observed. Therefore, the safety of these drugs in HIV-positive pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 requires attention. Despite the observed endothelial protective properties of DTG, there is a lack of evidence of its effects on pregnancy and COVID-19 therapeutics. Understanding RDV-ART interactions and the inclusion of pregnant women in antiviral drug repurposing trials is essential.

225758,Immunological Implications of Physical Inactivity among Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the quantitative parameters derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in differentiating lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenomas (LGPAs) from lacrimal gland malignant epithelial tumors (LGMETs). METHODS: Seventy-seven cases with LG epithelial tumors confirmed by histopathology (47 LGPAs and 30 LGMETs) underwent DWI and DCE-MRI. The quantitative parameters including the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the volume transfer constant (Ktrans), the efflux rate constant from the extravascular extracellular space (EES) to blood plasma (Kep), and the extravascular extracellular volume fraction (Ve) were used to differentiate LGPAs from LGMETs. Independent-samples t test was conducted to compare these parameters. The diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Compared with LGPAs, LGMETs had significantly lower ADC value (1.090 ± 0.169mm2/s) (P < 0.001), higher Ktrans value (0.892 ± 0.517/min) (P = 0.001), and Kep value (1.300 ± 1.131/min) (P = 0.002). ADC as a diagnostic index showed a better diagnostic efficacy in predicting malignant tumors (AUC 0.914, sensitivity 90.0%, specificity 85.1%, and accuracy 87.0%) than Ktrans and Kep alone. The combination of ADC and Ktrans presented the optimal diagnostic performance for the differentiation (AUC 0.938, sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 87.2%, accuracy 89.6%). CONCLUSION: The quantitative parameters including ADC, Ktrans, and Kep derived from DWI and DCE-MRI might be potential imaging biomarkers in differentiating LGPAs from LGMETs. The combination of ADC and Ktrans is superior to other quantitative parameters in distinguishing LGPAs from LGMETs.","Wang, Yongzhe; Song, Liyuan; Guo, Jian; Xian, Junfang",Neuroradiology,,361

When returning to the dental practice or training, staff and students alike should abide by the new rules and regulations. In the process of controlling viral spread, clinical dental facilities face a higher risk of disease transmission among patients as well as clinical and non-clinical staff. Aerosols formation and diffusion into the surrounding air can be a real concern of viral transmission, if no protective measures are established. We aim in this review to present the currently implemented measures and propose changes in clinical dental facilities to minimize the risk of transmission. Dental professionals should be prepared to treat every patient as a suspected COVID-19 carrier and be ready to receive and manage an overwhelming number of patients. We suggest that dental practices establish a sensible workforce shift schedule, improve ventilation levels, reduce dental aerosol generating procedures, and develop a comprehensive guidance to Healthcare Workers to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Al Kawas, Sausan; Al-Rawi, Natheer; Talaat, Wael; Hamdoon, Zaid; Salman, Basheer; Al Bayatti, Saad; Jerjes, Waseem; Samsudin, A B Rani",BMC Oral Health,,361
226879,Public Oral Health Care During COVID-19: Time for Reflection and Action,2021,"In this paper we propose a second--order method for solving \emph{linear composite sparse optimization problems} consisting of minimizing the sum of a differentiable (possibly nonconvex function) and a nondifferentiable convex term. The composite nondifferentiable convex penalizer is given by $\ell_1$--norm of a matrix multiplied with the coefficient vector. The algorithm that we propose for the case of the linear composite $\ell_1$ problem relies on the three main ingredients that power the OESOM algorithm \cite{dlrlm07}: the minimum norm subgradient, a projection step and, in particular, the second--order information associated to the nondifferentiable term. By extending these devices, we obtain a full second--order method for solving composite sparse optimization problems which includes a wide range of applications. For instance, problems involving the minimization of a general class \emph{differential graph operators} can be solved with the proposed algorithm. We present several computational experiments to show the efficiency of our approach for different application examples.","Merino, Pedro; Reyes, Juan Carlos De Los",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01878v1.pdf,361

Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is considered particularly at risk of disease transmission due to aerosol generation during surgical interventions, patient proximity and operating environment. On day 2 (26th March, 2020) of when severe restrictions in population movement were instigated in the United Kingdom, we began a study to prospectively monitor the presentation and management of maxillofacial emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data was collected onto an online live database fed through a smartphone application. Of the total 529 patients over six weeks, 395 attended for face-to-face consultations and 134 patients received remote consultations via telephone or video link. There were 255 trauma related cases, 221 infection and 48 cases of postoperative complications. Most trauma cases were minor soft tissue injury related to slip, trip or fall at home.

227542,Framework for Solid-Organ Transplantation During COVID-19 Pandemic in Europe,2021,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted business and viability of firms in the hospitality sector. This paper aims to examine the impact of perceived vulnerability of employees in this sector related to job loss and satisfaction with life. Additionally, it tests whether the impact is reduced for an individual possessing high emotional and financial well-being. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses cross-sectional data obtained through a survey of 312 hospitality sector employees. Using PLS-SEM, hypothesized relationships between constructs are tested. Findings: Perceived vulnerability of job loss negatively impacts satisfaction with life;however, this negative impact gets significantly reduced in the presence of emotional and financial well-being. Research limitations/implications: The results provide an impetus to focus on emotional and financial well-being to reduce employees’ vulnerabilities and improve their life satisfaction. In the absence of specific relief programs by the Government and with reduced business activity, employers need to look for innovative ways for ensuring their own sustenance and employee well-being. Originality/value: This study is one of the initial works on examining how perceived vulnerability of job loss induced by the pandemic on hospitality sector employees’ impacts their satisfaction with life. It also makes a novel attempt to examine emotional well-being and financial well-being, as mediators in this relationship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Singh, N.; Bhatia, S.; Nigam, S.",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,,361

228841,Never Let a Crisis Go to Waste: Implementing Virtual Innovations During the COVID-19 Pandemic for a Better Tomorrow in Health Care,2020,"BACKGROUND: After the 2002/2003 SARS outbreak, 30% of survivors exhibited persisting structural pulmonary abnormalities. The long-term pulmonary sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are yet unknown, and comprehensive clinical follow-up data are lacking. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, observational study, we systematically evaluated the cardiopulmonary damage in subjects recovering from COVID-19 at 60 and 100â days after confirmed diagnosis. We conducted a detailed questionnaire, clinical examination, laboratory testing, lung function analysis, echocardiography, and thoracic low-dose computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: Data from 145 COVID-19 patients were evaluated, and 41% of all subjects exhibited persistent symptoms 100â days after COVID-19 onset, with dyspnea being most frequent (36%). Accordingly, patients still displayed an impaired lung function, with a reduced diffusing capacity in 21% of the cohort being the most prominent finding. Cardiac impairment, including a reduced left ventricular function or signs of pulmonary hypertension, was only present in a minority of subjects. CT scans unveiled persisting lung pathologies in 63% of patients, mainly consisting of bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or reticulation in the lower lung lobes, without radiological signs of pulmonary fibrosis. Sequential follow-up evaluations at 60 and 100â days after COVID-19 onset demonstrated a vast improvement of both, symptoms and CT abnormalities over time. CONCLUSION: A relevant percentage of post-COVID-19 patients presented with persisting symptoms and lung function impairment along with pulmonary abnormalities more than 100â days after the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, our results indicate a significant improvement in symptoms and cardiopulmonary status over time.","Sonnweber, Thomas; Sahanic, Sabina; Pizzini, Alex; Luger, Anna; Schwabl, Christoph; Sonnweber, Bettina; Kurz, Katharina; Koppelstätter, Sabine; Haschka, David; Petzer, Verena; Boehm, Anna; Aichner, Magdalena; Tymoszuk, Piotr; Lener, Daniela; Theurl, Markus; Lorsbach-Köhler, Almut; Tancevski, Amra; Schapfl, Anna; Schaber, Marc; Hilbe, Richard; Nairz, Manfred; Puchner, Bernhard; Hüttenberger, Doris; Tschurtschenthaler, Christoph; Aßhoff, Malte; Peer, Andreas; Hartig, Frank; Bellmann, Romuald; Joannidis, Michael; Gollmann-Tepeköylü, Can; Holfeld, Johannes; Feuchtner, Gudrun; Egger, Alexander; Hoermann, Gregor; Schroll, Andrea; Fritsche, Gernot; Wildner, Sophie; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Kirchmair, Rudolf; Helbok, Raimund; Prosch, Helmut; Rieder, Dietmar; Trajanoski, Zlatko; Kronenberg, Florian; Wöll, Ewald; Weiss, Günter; Widmann, Gerlig; Löffler-Ragg, Judith; Tancevski, Ivan",Eur. respir. j,,361

Medical physicists (MPs) are key healthcare professionals in maintaining safe and effective RT. This study reports on MPs experience during the first pandemic peak and explores the consequences on their work. Methods A 39-question survey on changes in departmental and clinical practice and on the impact for the future was sent to the global MP community. A total of 433 responses were analysed by professional role and by country clustered on the daily infection numbers. Results The impact of COVID-19 was bigger in countries with high daily infection rate. The majority of MPs worked in alternation at home/on-site. Among practice changes, implementation and/or increased use of hypofractionation was the most common (47% of the respondents). Sixteen percent of respondents modified patient-specific quality assurance (QA), 21% reduced machine QA, and 25% moved machine QA to weekends/evenings. The perception of trust in leadership and team unity was reversed between management MPs (towards increased trust and unity) and clinical MPs (towards a decrease). Changes such as home-working and increased use of hypofractionation were welcomed. However, some MPs were concerned about pressure to keep negative changes (e.g. weekend work). Conclusion COVID-19 affected MPs through changes in practice and QA procedures but also in terms of trust in leadership and team unity. Some changes were welcomed but others caused worries for the future. This report forms the basis, from a medical physics perspective, to evaluate long-lasting changes within a multi-disciplinary setting.","Bertholet, Jenny Aznar Marianne C.; Garibaldi, Cristina Thwaites David Gershkevitsh Eduard Thorwarth Daniela Verellen Dirk Heijmen Ben Hurkmans Coen Muren Ludvig Røe Redalen Kathrine Siebert Frank-André Schwarz Marco Van Elmpt Wouter Georg Dietmar Jornet Nuria Clark Catharine H.",Physics and Imaging in Radiation Oncology,,361

The present study aims to adapt and validate a Japanese-version Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with a sample of adolescent students from Japan. To this end, the Japanese-version FCV-19S, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVDS) were administered to a sample of Japanese adolescents in schools. The results of statistical analyses revealed that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a bi-factor model consisting of the emotional response factor and the physiological response factor, with high reliability (emotional: &#945; = .71; physiological: &#945; = .82). Constructive validity was shown by the significant positive correlation between the GAD-7 and emotional (r = .11) and physiological response (r = .25), between PHQ-A and physiological response (r = .19), and between both factors and the PVDS subscale (rs > .16).

To this end, we apply inequality indices over regions to incidences, infection related mortality, and infection fatality rates. If avoiding of inequality in health is an important political goal, a metric must be implemented to track geographical inequality over time. METHODS: The relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size. RESULTS: Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices). CONCLUSIONS: The use of inequality indices to monitor changes in geographic inequality over time for key health indicators is a valuable tool to inform public health policies. The absolute and relative Gini index behave complementary and should be reported simultaneously in order to gain a meta-perspective on very complex dynamics.","Manz, Kirsi M; Mansmann, Ulrich",PLoS One,,361

Among patients with malignant diseases, those with hematologic neoplasms are at a higher risk for poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to register treatment modifications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and their short-term consequences in Latin America. METHODS: Multicenter, prospective, observational, cohort study including patients older than 14 years from 14 centers in four countries (Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and Panama) who had a confirmed diagnosis of acute leukemia, and who were undergoing active treatment since the first COVID-19 case in each country until the cutoff on July 15, 2020. RESULTS: We recruited 635 patients. Treatment modifications because of the COVID-19 pandemic were reported in 40.8% of cases. The main reason for such modifications was logistic issues (55.0%) and the most frequent modification was chemotherapy delay (42.0%). A total of 13.1% patients developed COVID-19 disease, with a mortality of 37.7%. Several factors were identified as independently associated with mortality, including a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (odds ratio 2.38 [95% CI, 1.47 to 3.84]; P < .001), while the use of telemedicine was identified as a protective factor (odds ratio 0.36 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.82]; P = .014).

Severity of COVID-19 presentation is highly variable among infected individuals with increasingly recognized risk factors. Although observational studies suggested lower COVID-19 severity in populations consuming fermented foods, no controlled study investigated the role of diet. Yogurt, a fermented dairy product, exhibits interesting properties related to the presence of bioactive peptides and probiotics that may play a beneficial role in COVID-19 presentation and outcome. Peptides contained in yogurt are responsible for angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory, bradykinin potentiating, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antioxidant effects. The types and activity of these peptides vary widely depending on their amino acid sequence, on the probiotics used in yogurt production and on intestinal digestion. Additionally, probiotics used in yogurt exhibit direct angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory, antiviral and immune boosting activities. Since COVID-19 pathogenesis involves angiotensin II accumulation and bradykinin deficiency, yogurt bioactive peptides appear as potentially beneficial. Therefore, epidemiological investigations and randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate the exact role of yogurt consumption on COVID-19 manifestations and outcome should be encouraged.","Gouda, Ahmed S; Adbelruhman, Fatima G; Sabbah Alenezi, Hamedah; Mégarbane, Bruno",,,361

This study performed a multidimensional association analysis to explore the correlation between the GHS Index and COVID-19-associated morbidity, mortality, and disease increase rate (DIR) in 178 countries (regions). METHODS: The GHS Index and COVID-19 pandemic data - including total cases per million (TCPM), total deaths per million (TDPM), and daily growth rate - were extracted from online databases. The Spearman correlation coefficient was applied to describe the strength of the association between the GHS Index, sociological characteristics, and the epidemic situation of COVID-19. DIRs were compared, and the impact of the GHS Index on the DIR by the time of ""lockdown"" was visualized. RESULTS: The overall GHS Index was positively correlated with TCPM and TDPM, with coefficients of 0.34 and 0.41, respectively. Countries categorized into different GHS Indextiers had different DIRs before implementing lockdown measures. However, no significant difference was observed between countries in the middle and upper tiers after implementing lockdown measures. The correlation between GHS Index and DIR was positive five days before lockdown measures were taken, but it became negative 13 days later. CONCLUSIONS: The GHS Index has limited value in assessing a country's capacity to respond to a global pandemic. Nevertheless, it has potential value in determining the country's ability to cope with a local epidemic situation.","Ji, Ye; Shao, Jun; Tao, Bilin; Song, Huan; Li, Zhongqi; Wang, Jianming",Int J Infect Dis,,361

However, the difference in the sociocultural contexts between countries requires the specific adjustment of these estimates to each scenario. This article analyses the main elements used for the construction of models from epidemiological patterns, to describe the interaction, explain the dynamics of infection and recovery, and to predict possible scenarios that may arise with the introduction of public health measures such as social distancing and quarantines, specifically in the case of the pandemic unleashed by the new SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 virus. Comment: Mathematical models are highly relevant for making objective and effective decisions to control and eradicate the disease. These models used for COVID-19 have supported and will continue to provide information for the selection and implementation of programs and public policies that prevent associated complications, reduce the speed of the virus spread and minimize the occurrence of severe cases of the disease that may collapse health systems.","Grillo Ardila, Elvia Karina; Santaella-Tenorio, Julián; Guerrero, Rodrigo; Bravo, Luis Eduardo",Colomb. med,,361

244457,"Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Information Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia",2021,"Wuhan City (WH) in China was the first place to report COVID-19 in the world and the outbreak of COVID-19 was controlled in March of 2020 in WH. It is unclear what percentage of people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and what percentage of population is carriers of SARS-CoV-2 in WH. We retrospectively analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibody positive rates in 63,107 healthy individuals from WH and other places of China using commercial colloidal gold detection kits from March 6 to May 3, 2020. Statistical approaches were utilized to explore the difference and correlation for the seropositive rate of IgG and IgM antibody on the basis of sex, age group, geographic region and detection date. The total IgG and IgM antibody positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 1.68% (186/11,086) in WH, 0.59% (226/38,171) in Hubei Province without Wuhan (HB), and 0.38% (53/13,850) in the nation except for Hubei Province (CN), respectively. The IgM positive rate was 0.46% (51/11,086) in WH, 0.13% (51/38,171) in HB, and 0.07% (10/13,850) in CN. The incidence of IgM positive rates in healthy individuals increased from March 6 to May 3, 2020 in WH. Female and older age had a higher probability of becoming infected than males (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.08-1.65) or younger age (OR = 2.25; 95% CI: 1.06-4.78). The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively low in WH and other places of China, but it is significantly high in WH than other places of China; a large amount of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 existed after elimination of clinical cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan City. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may exist in a population without clinical cases for a long period.","Duan, Shuhui; Zhou, Meiying; Zhang, Wen; Shen, Jianwei; Qi, Rui; Qin, Xiangrong; Yu, Hao; Zhou, Chuanmin; Hu, Qing; Yu, Xue-Jie",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,361

246246,Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on health care professionals and workers,2020,"This study aims to assess anakinra's safety and efficacy for treating severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Numerous electronic databases were searched and finally 15 studies with a total of 3,530 patients, 757 in the anakinra arm, 1,685 in the control arm were included. The pooled adjusted odds ratio (OR) for mortality in the treatment arm was 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 - 0.54, I² = 48%), indicating a significant association between anakinra and mortality. A significant association was found regarding mechanical ventilation requirements in anakinra group compared to the control group OR, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.49 - 0.95, I² = 50%). For the safety of anakinra, we evaluated thromboembolism risk and liver transaminases elevation. Thromboembolism risk was OR, 1.59 (95% CI, 0.65 - 3.91, I² = 0%) and elevation in liver transaminases with OR was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.61 - 3.03, I² = 76%). Both were not statistically significant over the control group. Anakinra is beneficial in lowering mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, these non-significant differences in the safety profile between the anakinra and control groups may have been the result of baseline characteristics of the intervention group, and further studies are essential in evaluating anakinra's safety profile.","Somagutta, Manoj Kumar Reddy; Lourdes Pormento, Maria Kezia; Hamid, Pousette; Hamdan, Alaa; Khan, Muhammad Adnan; Desir, Rockeven; Vijayan, Rupalakshmi; Shirke, Saloni; Jeyakumar, Rishan; Dogar, Zeryab; Makkar, Sarabjot Singh; Guntipalli, Prathima; Ngardig, Ngaba Neguemadji; Nagineni, Manasa Sindhura; Paul, Trissa; Luvsannyam, Enkhmaa; Riddick, Chala; Sanchez-Gonzalez, Marcos A",Infect Chemother,,361

Of the 342 HCWs who completed the two-dose vaccination, 265 (77.5%) responded to the survey at least once. Overall, the rates of adverse reactions were higher after the second dose compared with the first dose (89.1% vs. 80.1%, P = 0.006). The most common systemic reactions were muscle ache (69.1%), fatigue (65.7%), headache (48.7%), chills (44.2%), and fever (32.1%), and were notably more common after the second dose vaccine as well. We also noted a sex difference in which the frequency of adverse reactions after the second dose of the vaccine was significantly higher in females, which was not observed after the first dose. The rates of adverse reactions were lower in older age groups, and the rates and severities of the adverse reactions decreased during the 3-day period following vaccination.","Lee, Yun Woo; Lim, So Yun; Lee, Ji Hyang; Lim, Joon Seo; Kim, Miseo; Kwon, Seonhee; Joo, Jiyeon; Kwak, Sun Hee; Kim, Eun Ok; Jung, Jiwon; Kwon, Hyouk Soo; Kim, Tae Bum; Kim, Sung Han; Bae, Seongman",J Korean Med Sci,,361
247194,Trauma-Informed Care in Primary Health Settings—Which Is Even More Needed in Times of COVID-19,2020,"Objective: To identify differences in short-term outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) according to various racial/ethnic groups. Design: Analysis of Cerner de-identified COVID-19 dataset. Setting: A total of 62 health care facilities. Participants: The cohort included 49,277 adult COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized from December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was non-routine discharge (discharge to destinations other than home, such as short-term hospitals or other facilities including intermediate care and skilled nursing homes). Methods: We compared patients' age, gender, individual components of Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities, medical complications, use of do-not-resuscitate, use of palliative care, and socioeconomic status between various racial and/or ethnic groups. We further compared the rates of in-hospital mortality and non-routine discharges between various racial and/or ethnic groups. Results: Compared with White patients, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher among African American (OR 1.5; 95%CI:1.3-1.6, P<.001), Hispanic (OR1.4; 95%CI:1.3-1.6, P<.001), and Asian or Pacific Islander (OR 1.5; 95%CI: 1.1-1.9, P=.002) patients after adjustment for age and gender, Elixhauser comorbidities, do-not-resuscitate status, palliative care use, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Our study found that, among hospitalized patients with COVID-2019, African American, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander patients had increased mortality compared with White patients after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and do-not-resuscitate/palliative care status. Our findings add additional perspective to other recent studies.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Baskett, William I; Huang, Wei; Shyu, Daniel; Myers, Danny; Lobanova, Iryna; Naqvi, S Hasan; Thompson, Vetta S; Shyu, Chi-Ren",Ethn Dis,,361

247356,COVID-19 pandemic danger: Acute alcohol intoxication in a 5-year-old following ingestion of an ethyl-alcohol-based hand sanitiser,2020,"In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, public health scientists have produced a large and rapidly expanding body of literature that aims to answer critical questions, such as the proportion of the population in a geographic area that has been infected; the transmissibility of the virus and factors associated with high infectiousness or susceptibility to infection; which groups are the most at risk of infection, morbidity and mortality; and the degree to which antibodies confer protection to re-infection. Observational studies are subject to a number of different biases, including confounding, selection bias, and measurement error, that may threaten their validity or influence the interpretation of their results. To assist in the critical evaluation of a vast body of literature and contribute to future study design, we outline and propose solutions to biases that can occur across different categories of observational studies of COVID-19. We consider potential biases that could occur in five categories of studies: (1) cross-sectional seroprevalence, (2) longitudinal seroprotection, (3) risk factor studies to inform interventions, (4) studies to estimate the secondary attack rate, and (5) studies that use secondary attack rates to make inferences about infectiousness and susceptibility.","Accorsi, Emma K; Qiu, Xueting; Rumpler, Eva; Kennedy-Shaffer, Lee; Kahn, Rebecca; Joshi, Keya; Goldstein, Edward; Stensrud, Mats J; Niehus, Rene; Cevik, Muge; Lipsitch, Marc",Eur J Epidemiol,,361

248585,Factors affecting the anxiety levels of adolescents in home-quarantine during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although many viral respiratory illnesses are transmitted within households, the evidence base for SARS-CoV-2 is nascent. We sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission within US households and estimate the household secondary infection rate (SIR) to inform strategies to reduce transmission. METHODS: We recruited laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and their household contacts in Utah and Wisconsin during March 22-April 25, 2020. We interviewed patients and all household contacts to obtain demographics and medical histories. At the initial household visit, 14 days later, and when a household contact became newly symptomatic, we collected respiratory swabs from patients and household contacts for testing by SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We estimated SIR and odds ratios (OR) to assess risk factors for secondary infection, defined by a positive rRT-PCR or ELISA test. RESULTS: Thirty-two (55%) of 58 households had evidence of secondary infection among household contacts. The SIR was 29% (n = 55/188; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-36%) overall, 42% among children (<18 years) of the COVID-19 patient and 33% among spouses/partners. Household contacts to COVID-19 patients with immunocompromised conditions had increased odds of infection (OR: 15.9, 95% CI: 2.4-106.9). Household contacts who themselves had diabetes mellitus had increased odds of infection (OR: 7.1, 95% CI: 1.2-42.5). CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial evidence of secondary infections among household contacts. People with COVID-19, particularly those with immunocompromising conditions or those with household contacts with diabetes, should take care to promptly self-isolate to prevent household transmission.","Lewis, Nathaniel M; Chu, Victoria T; Ye, Dongni; Conners, Erin E; Gharpure, Radhika; Laws, Rebecca L; Reses, Hannah E; Freeman, Brandi D; Fajans, Mark; Rabold, Elizabeth M; Dawson, Patrick; Buono, Sean; Yin, Sherry; Owusu, Daniel; Wadhwa, Ashutosh; Pomeroy, Mary; Yousaf, Anna; Pevzner, Eric; Njuguna, Henry; Battey, Katherine A; Tran, Cuc H; Fields, Victoria L; Salvatore, Phillip; O039,; Hegarty, Michelle; Vuong, Jeni; Chancey, Rebecca; Gregory, Christopher; Banks, Michelle; Rispens, Jared R; Dietrich, Elizabeth; Marcenac, Perrine; Matanock, Almea M; Duca, Lindsey; Binder, Allison; Fox, Garrett; Lester, Sandra; Mills, Lisa; Gerber, Susan I; Watson, John; Schumacher, Amy; Pawloski, Lucia; Thornburg, Natalie J; Hall, Aron J; Kiphibane, Tair; Willardson, Sarah; Christensen, Kim; Page, Lindsey; Bhattacharyya, Sanjib; Dasu, Trivikram; Christiansen, Ann",Clin. infect. dis,,361
248586,Factors affecting the anxiety levels of adolescents in home-quarantine during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify psychological distress experienced by emergency, anaesthetic and intensive care doctors during the acceleration phase of COVID-19 in the UK and Ireland. METHODS: Initial cross-sectional electronic survey distributed during acceleration phase of the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in the UK and Ireland (UK: 18 March 2020-26 March 2020 and Ireland: 25 March 2020-2 April 2020). Surveys were distributed via established specialty research networks, within a three-part longitudinal study. Participants were doctors working in emergency, anaesthetic and intensive medicine during the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in acute hospitals across the UK and Ireland. Primary outcome measures were the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Additional questions examined personal and professional characteristics, experiences of COVID-19 to date, risk to self and others and self-reported perceptions of health and well-being. RESULTS: 5440 responses were obtained, 54.3% (n=2955) from emergency medicine and 36.9% (n=2005) from anaesthetics. All levels of doctor seniority were represented. For the primary outcome of GHQ-12 score, 44.2% (n=2405) of respondents scored >3, meeting the criteria for psychological distress. 57.3% (n=3045) had never previously provided clinical care during an infectious disease outbreak but over half of respondents felt somewhat prepared (48.6%, n=2653) or very prepared (7.6%, n=416) to provide clinical care to patients with COVID-19. However, 81.1% (n=4414) either agreed (31.1%, n=2709) or strongly agreed (31.1%, n=1705) that their personal health was at risk due to their clinical role. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that during the acceleration phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, almost half of frontline doctors working in acute care reported psychological distress as measured by the GHQ-12.

This study aimed to explore and compare the air conditioner (AC) heating behavior of Wuhan residents before and after the COVID-19 lockdown. The date of commencement of the Wuhan lockdown (January 23, 2020) was considered the demarcation point to divide the AC monitoring data from the Internet of Things cloud platform into two groups; before and after Wuhan lockdown. Statistical methods were applied to analyze AC heating behavior of Wuhan residents from a total of 378 air conditioners during these two periods. The daily AC usage rate and average daily AC usage duration following the lockdown had a stronger correlation with daily outdoor temperature than that before the lockdown. AC heating behavior continued to demonstrate a part-time intermittent operation during the lockdown period, despite residents staying at home for a longer period. Trigger temperatures for occupants to turn on or adjust their AC during the lockdown period were overall 1-2â¯°C higher than before the lockdown. The AC heating demand in the HSCW zone has been increasing in recent years. These research results inform research on household energy demand and thermal comfort in China's HSCW zone, and provide a reference on the household behavioral changes in the occupants in the context of a lockdown as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Yan, Lu; Li, Jinbo; Liu, Meng; Hu, Mengqiang; Xu, Zhenkun; Xue, Kai",Build Environ,,361

Using Google search data on relevant keywords, we construct a daily index of consumer panic for 54 countries from January 1st to April 30th 2020. We also assemble data on government policy announcements and daily COVID-19 cases for all countries. Our panic index reveals widespread consumer panic in most countries, primarily during March, but with significant variation in the timing and severity of panic between countries. Our model implies that both domestic and world virus transmission contribute significantly to consumer panic. But government policy is also important: Internal movement restrictions - whether announced by domestic or foreign governments - generate substantial short run panic that largely vanishes in a week to ten days. Internal movement restrictions announced early in the pandemic generated more panic than those announced later. Stimulus announcements had smaller impacts, and travel restrictions do not appear to generate consumer panic.","Keane, Michael; Neal, Timothy",Journal of econometrics,,361

An effective treatment against this disease has not yet been developed; as such, several drugs are used without evidence of efficacy, which in some cases may lead to unwanted events. This is a cross-sectional study with the objective of evaluating adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients with COVID-19, identified between March 1 and August 15, 2020, in Brazil, as well as assessing the factors associated with the emergence of severe reactions. To compare the proportions of samples related to the notifier, patient, drugs and adverse events, we used Fisher's chi-square and exact nonparametric tests; and to compare the means of the data with normal distribution, we used the Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney's test. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed, estimating the crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) by the Stata software, version 10.0. A total of 631 ADRs were identified in 402 patients. The main drugs were hydroxychloroquine (59.5%), azithromycin (9.8%) and chloroquine (5.2%). The reactions manifested primarily in the cardiac system (38.8%), gastrointestinal system (14.4%), skin tissue (12.2%) and hepatic system (8.9%). Chloroquine (OR = 5.4; 95%CI: 1.9-15.6) and hydroxychloroquine (OR = 2.1; 95CI%: 1.2-3.6) were the only drugs associated with severe ADR. Our findings provide support for better practices in pharmacovigilance, contributing to effective and secure regulatory decision-making by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, patients and society as a whole.","Melo, José Romério Rabelo; Duarte, Elisabeth Carmen; Moraes, Marcelo Vogler de; Fleck, Karen; Silva, Amanda Soares do Nascimento E; Arrais, Paulo Sérgio Dourado",Cad Saude Publica,,361

253529,"Working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, its effects on health, and recommendations: The pandemic and beyond",2021,"On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced that the COVID-19 disease developed into a global pandemic. In the present paper, we aimed at analysing how the implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) as well as climatic, social, and demographic variables affected the initial growth rate of COVID-19. In more detail, we aimed at identifying and assessing all the predictors in a whole picture of the COVID-19 outbreak and the effectiveness of the response of the countries to the pandemic. It can be expected, indeed, that there is a subtle and complex interplay among the various parameters. As such, we estimated the initial growth rate of COVID-19 for countries across the globe, and used a multiple linear regression model to study the association between the initial growth rate and NPI as well as pre-existing country characteristics (climatic, social and demographic variables measured before the current epidemic began). We obtained a mean initial growth rate of 0.120 (SD 0.076), in the range 0.023-0.315. Ten (8 pre-existing country characteristics and 2 NPI) out of 29 factors considered (21 pre-existing country characteristics and 8 NPI) were associated with the initial growth of COVID-19. Population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million, PM2.5 air pollution mean annual exposure, life expectancy, hospital beds available, urban population, Global Health Security detection index and restrictions on international movement had the most significant effects on the initial growth of COVID-19. Based on available data and the results we obtained, NPI put in place by governments around the world alone may not have had a significant impact on the initial growth of COVID-19. Only restrictions on international movements had a relative significance with respect to the initial growth rate, whereas demographic, climatic, and social variables seemed to play a greater role in the initial growth rate of COVID-19.","Duhon, Jacqueline; Bragazzi, Nicola; Kong, Jude Dzevela",Sci Total Environ,,361

The present study offers an analysis of the influence that inclusion of geosites or mining sites could have on the existing routes of the Zaruma-Portovelo region (Ecuador), together with a global assessment of these itineraries as the basis of fostering local development in communities of the region. The methodology consists of the following stages: (i) compilation of existing travel itineraries;(ii) analysis and assessment of those geosites and mining sites that are included in two geotouristic routes through the Spanish Inventory of Places of Geological Interest method (IELIG, acronym in Spanish), but have not been assessed previously;(iii) assessment of existing routes (two geotouristic routes and one geomining route) from a global perspective through the Geotouristic Route Assessment Matrix method (GtRAM, acronym in Spanish);and (iv) definition of strategies for the development and promotion of travel itineraries within the context of geotourism. According to the results of quantitative assessment, three new sites (both geosites and mining sites) were studied and their obtained score of interest was “High” (164/400). The existing routes achieved good results both from the geological-mining perspective “High” score of (189/400) and within a global context “Very High” score of (3.5/5). The quantitative assessment allowed us to propose improvement strategies to disseminate and use these itineraries to unfold sustainable development based on geotourism.","Carrión-Mero, Paúl Herrera-Narváez Geanella Herrera-Franco Gricelda Sánchez-Zambrano Emily Mata-Perelló Josep Berrezueta Edgar",Minerals,,361

Therefore, it is paramount to identify the views of the community regarding how to allocate such resources. This study aims to quantify Australian community preferences for ventilation allocation. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was designed and administrated to an adult Australian online panel. Each survey respondent answered 12 choice sets from a total design of 120. Each choice set placed the respondent in the role of hypothetical decision maker, prioritising care between two patients. Conditional logit, mixed logit regression and latent class analysis were used to analyse the data. Additionally, we asked a series of attitudinal questions about different methods of making such decisions in practice, focusing on who should be responsible. RESULTS: A total of 1050 community members completed the survey and responded to each choice. Dimensions considered most important were age, likely effectiveness, smoking status, whether the person has dependents, whether they are a healthcare worker, and whether they have a disability or not. Estimating marginal rates of substitution between patient characteristics and chance of survival if ventilated yielded values of up to 30 percentage points if the patient was 70 years old relative to being 30. However, respondents typically said they would prefer such decisions to be made by medical professionals. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the preferences of the community to allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of such information should be treated with some caution as the underlying reason for such preferences are unclear, and respondents themselves preferred the decision to be made by others.","Norman, Richard; Robinson, Suzanne; Dickinson, Helen; Williams, Iestyn; Meshcheriakova, Elena; Manipis, Kathleen; Anstey, Matthew",Patient,,361

It contains cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides known as mogrosides. The extract from monk fruit is about 300 times sweeter than sucrose. In spite of its immense importance and International demand, Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) is not commercially cultivated outside China since scientific information for cultivation of this species is lacking. Planting material of monk fruit plant was not available in India. Thus, the seeds of monk fruit were introduced in India from China after following International norms. Then the experiments were conducted on different aspects such as seed germination, morphological and anatomical characterization, phenology, flowering and pollination behaviors, and dynamic of mogroside-V accumulation in fruit. The hydropriming at 40 °C for 24 h was found effective to reduce the germination time and to increase the germination rate (77.33%). The multicellular uniseriate trichomes were observed in both the leaf surfaces, however, higher trichomes density was observed in the ventral surface of males compared to females. The microscopic view revealed that the ovary was trilocular (ovary consists three chambers) having two ovules in each chamber or locule. Most of the fruits were globose or oblong type with 5-7 cm in length and 4-7 cm diameter. Mogroside-V content in fruit at 80 days after pollination was 0.69% on dry weight basis. The rate of increase of mogroside-V accumulation from 50 to 70 days was very slow, whereas a sharp increase was observed from 70 to 80 days. The higher receptivity of stigma was observed with fully open flowers. The floral diagram and formula have also been developed for both male and female flowers. Our results highlighted that monk fruit can be grown in Indian conditions.","Thakur, Babit Kumar; Mallikarjun, C P; Mahajan, Mitali; Kapoor, Priya; Malhotra, Jigyasa; Dhiman, Rimpy; Kumar, Dinesh; Pal, Probir Kumar; Kumar, Sanjay",Sci Rep,,361

We evaluated the incidence of QTc prolongation among moderately and severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ and of the existence of concomitant alternative causes. METHODS: All COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ (between Mar 1 and Apr 14, 2020) in a tertiary medical center were included. Clinical characteristics and relevant risk factors were collected from the electronic medical records. Individual patient QTc intervals were determined before and after treatment with HCQ. The primary outcome measure sought was a composite endpoint comprised of either an increase &#8805; 60 milliseconds (ms) in the QTc interval compared with pretreatment QTc, and/or a maximal QTc interval >500 ms. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-75) and 57 (63%) were male. Thirty-nine patients (43%) were severely or critically ill. Hypertension and obesity were common (n=23 each, 26%). QTc prolongation evolved in fourteen patients (16%). Age > 65 years, congestive heart failure, severity of disease, C-reactive protein level, hypokalemia and furosemide treatment, were all associated with QTc prolongation. Adjusted analysis showed that QTc prolongation was five times more likely with hypokalemia [OR 5, (95% CI, 1.3-20)], and three times more likely with furosemide treatment [ OR 3 (95% CI, 1.01-13.7)]. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with HCQ, QTc prolongation was associated with the presence of traditional risk factors such as hypokalemia and furosemide treatment.","Fteiha, Bashar; Karameh, Hani; Kurd, Ramzi; Ziff-Werman, Batsheva; Feldman, Itamar; Bnaya, Alon; Einav, Sharon; Orlev, Amir; Ben-Chetrit, Eli",Int J Clin Pract,,361

262325,Global Storm of Stress-Related Psychopathological Symptoms: A Brief Overview on the Usefulness of Virtual Reality in Facing the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: SARS-COv-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID19 causes a wide range of pathology. While some patients may experience mild or asymptomatic infection, others will progress to respiratory failure and death. Although some clinical parameters have been shown to predict patient outcomes, the role of cytokine measurements is controversial. The aim of the study was to determine whether admission cytokine levels can predict the clinical course of patients with COVID19. Methods: Blood was collected at admission from 41 patients with COVID19 at Virginia Commonwealth University from April-July 2020. A panel of 27 pro-inflammatory cytokines was measured in serum by multiplex assay. 20 patients were selected for analysis;10 with moderate disease (hospital admission, &lt;4L O2 need) and 10 severe COVID patients (ICU admission);patients with active malignancy were excluded. Multivariate principal component and correlation analysis (PCA) was performed. Patient severity (ICU admission, max O2 requirement, duration of hospital stay), patient demographics (gender, race, BMI), and serum cytokine levels were analyzed. Results: The only significant correlation with disease severity was duration of stay with TNF-α (0.5772,p=0.0097, Fig. 1A). IL-6 was not correlated with severity. PCA clustered severe patients together, with more variability being observed in the moderate cases (Fig.1B). Disease severity parameters cluster together with limited association with the cytokine and demographics parameters (Fig.1C). PCA identified 2 main clusters of cytokines, but neither was associated with severity. TNF-α and IL-8 were separate from the other cytokines (Fig.1C). Discussion: In this small series of COVID19 patients from an urban academic medical center, PCA revealed correlation between admission TNF-α levels and the development of severe COVID19. No correlation was noted between admission IL-6 levels and disease severity. An association between TNF-α and outcomes has recently been described in a large cohort from the United States, but we were not able to determine other predictors of outcomes despite an extensive cytokine panel. The discrepancy with prior studies may be attributed to the high percentage of African-American subjects and high rates of comorbidities in our cohort. Our findings show low levels of key cytokines when compared to previous studies in non-COVID ARDS suggesting a difference in the pathophysiology of severe COVID19. The lack of IL-6 association with severe COVID19 is consistent with recent negative trials of IL-6 blockade in COVID19. Larger studies are needed to explore the role of TNF-α in the development of severe COVID19 and its potential as a therapeutic target.","Perelas, A.; Freeberg, M. A.; Jackson, P.

This scientific note brings reflections on the trajectory of the Conselho Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional, the repercussions of its extinction in the last year, and the project to dismantle social protection policies in Brazil, with serious consequences at a time when the country is going through a crisis in public health due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The absence of the Conselho Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional and the weakening of the set of policies for Food and Nutritional Security has mobilized the civil society to defend the human rights to food, food sovereignty, and to democracy itself. The resistance of the different social movements in order to maintain the spaces of civil participation related to Food and Nutrition Security public policies are still going to be long and arduous, demanding the continued vocalization and strengthening of partnership networks within the different movements of the organized civil society. Finally, we highlight the urgent need for restoration of the National System of Food and Nutritional Security (Sistema Nacional de Segurança Alimentar e Nutricional) with all its instances, and of other social policies, so that the negative consequences of the pandemic are avoided or mitigated and the State complies with its obligations to guarantee the rights of the Brazilian population.","RECINE, Elisabetta; FAGUNDES, Andhressa; SILVA, Barbara Leone; GARCIA, Giselle Silva; RIBEIRO, Rita de Cássia Lisboa; GABRIEL, Cristine Garcia",Rev.

264219,"Pandemic fatigue and clinical nurses' mental health, sleep quality and job contentment during the covid-19 pandemic: The mediating role of resilience",2021,"Various statistical problems can be formulated in terms of a bilinear form of the covariance matrix. Examples are testing whether coordinates of a high‐dimensional random vector are uncorrelated, constructing confidence intervals for the risk of optimal portfolios or testing for the stability of a covariance matrix, especially for factor models. Extending previous works to a general high‐dimensional multivariate linear process framework and factor models, we establish distributional approximations for the associated bilinear form of the sample covariance matrix. These approximations hold for increasing dimension without any constraint relative to the sample size. The results are used to construct change‐point tests for the covariance structure, especially in order to check the stability of a high‐dimensional factor model. Tests based on the cumulated sum (CUSUM), self‐standardized CUSUM and the CUSUM statistic maximized over all subsamples are considered. Size and power of the proposed testing methodology are investigated by a simulation study and illustrated by analyzing the Fama and French factors for a change due to the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic.","Bours, Monika Steland Ansgar",Scandinavian Journal of Statistics,,361

We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in staff and students following the full reopening of all secondary schools in England. Methods: Public Health England (PHE) invited secondary schools in six regions (East and West London, Hertfordshire, Derbyshire, Manchester and Birmingham) to participate in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance during the 2020/21 academic year. Participants had nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning (September 2020) and end (December 2020) of the autumn term. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent risk factors for seropositivity and seroconversion. Findings: Eighteen schools in six regions enrolled 2,209 participants, including 1,189 (53.8%) students and 1,020 (46.2%) staff. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were not significantly different between students and staff in round one (5/948;[0.53%] vs. 2/876 [0.23%];p = 0.46) or round two (10/948 [1.05%] vs. 7/886 [0.79%];p = 0.63), and similar to national prevalence. None of four and 7/15 (47%) sequenced strains in rounds 1 and 2 were the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. In round 1, antibody seropositivity was higher in students than staff (114/893 [12.8%] vs. 79/861 [9.2%];p = 0.016), but similar in round 2 (117/893 [13.1%] vs.117/872 [13.3%];p = 0.85), comparable to local community seroprevalence. Between the two rounds, 8.7% (57/652) staff and 6.6% (36/549) students seroconverted (p = 0.16). Interpretation: In secondary schools, SARS-CoV-2 infection, seropositivity and seroconversion rates were similar in staff and students, and comparable to local community rates.

Cell therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a potential treatment for COVID-19 ARDS based on preclinical and clinical studies supporting the concept that MSCs modulate the inflammatory and remodeling processes and restore alveolo-capillary barriers. The authors performed a systematic literature review and random-effects meta-analysis to determine the potential value of MSC therapy for treating COVID-19-infected patients with ARDS. Publications in all languages from 1990 to March 31, 2020 were reviewed, yielding 2691 studies, of which nine were included. MSCs were intravenously or intratracheally administered in 117 participants, who were followed for 14 days to 5 years. All MSCs were allogeneic from bone marrow, umbilical cord, menstrual blood, adipose tissue, or unreported sources. Combined mortality showed a favorable trend but did not reach statistical significance. No related serious adverse events were reported and mild adverse events resolved spontaneously. A trend was found of improved radiographic findings, pulmonary function (lung compliance, tidal volumes, PaO2 /FiO2 ratio, alveolo-capillary injury), and inflammatory biomarker levels. No comparisons were made between MSCs of different sources.","Qu, Wenchun; Wang, Zhen; Hare, Joshua M; Bu, Guojun; Mallea, Jorge M; Pascual, Jorge M; Caplan, Arnold I; Kurtzberg, Joanne; Zubair, Abba C; Kubrova, Eva; Engelberg-Cook, Erica; Nayfeh, Tarek; Shah, Vishal P; Hill, James C; Wolf, Michael E; Prokop, Larry J; Murad, M Hassan; Sanfilippo, Fred P",Stem cells transl. med.

Nevertheless, geographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the country, and the strategies adopted may have contributed to generating a widespread feeling of uncertainty in the population; uncertainty about the disease, how to prevent it, its severity, and its impact on political and economic issues. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and common mental health disorders. Participants were contacted via social media messages and encouraged to fill out an online questionnaire with socioeconomic questions, a short measure of intolerance of uncertainty (IUS-12), and a measure of mental health indicator (DASS-21). With a sample of 924 participants from Sergipe, Brazil, three binomial logistic regressions were performed, one for each DASS-21 outcome, categorized by a median. The women in the sample showed a higher probability of having stress, anxiety and depression scores above the median. Over the entire sample, both subscales of IUS-12 were significantly and positively related to all three DASS-21 subscales. These findings are discussed in the context of mental health during a pandemic, and future directions for research are also presented.","Seco Ferreira, Diogo Conque; Oliveira, Walter Lisboa; Costa Delabrida, Zenith Nara; Faro, André; Cerqueira-Santos, Elder",Suma psicol,,361

METHODS: The authors conducted an attitude survey on remote learning among trainees and faculty members approximately 3 months after the transition from in-person to remote learning. The authors then conducted a faculty training on best practices in online teaching followed by an evaluation survey. Study findings were examined descriptively and by Fisher's exact testing. RESULTS: The response rates for the attitudes survey were 68% among trainees and 61% among faculty. Trainees and faculty perceived in-person learning more favorably than remote learning across a variety of domains, including overall enjoyment, interpersonal connection, ability to communicate, and concentration. Despite these trends, only 10% of trainees and 14% of faculty felt that all lectures would be most effectively delivered in-person when this becomes possible again. The response rate for the faculty training evaluation survey was 16%. Compared to non-attendees, faculty attendees reported more confidence in their ability to teach remotely (89% vs 56%, p=0.02) and but not increased optimism (89% vs 63%, p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that both trainees and faculty perceive remote learning negatively compared to in-person learning but still feel that some lectures should be delivered remotely even after a return to in-person learning is possible.","Heldt, Jonathan P; Agrawal, Alpna; Loeb, Richard; Richards, Misty C; Castillo, Enrico G; DeBonis, Katrina",Acad. psychiatry,,361

268881,Impact of the Early Phase of the COVID Pandemic on Cancer Treatment Delivery and the Quality of Cancer Care: A Scoping Review and Conceptual Model,2021,"The COVID-19 pathomechanism depends on (i) the pathogenicity of the virus, (ii) ability of the immune system to respond to the cytopathic effect of the virus infection, (iii) co-morbidities. Inflammatory cytokine production constitutes a hallmark of COVID-19 that is facilitated by inability of adaptive immunity to control virus invasion. The effect of cytokine release syndrome is deleterious, but the severity of it depends on other confounding factors: age and comorbidities. In this study, we analyze the literature data on the post-transplant course of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplanted (alloHSCT) patients, which is affected by generated inflammatory cytokines. The sequence of events boosting cytokine production was analyzed in relation to clinical and laboratory data highlighting the impact of cytokine generation on the post-transplant course. The collected data were compared to those from studies on COVID-19 patients. The similarities are: (i) the damage/pathogen-associated molecular pattern (DAMP/PAMP) stage is similar except for the initiation hit being sterile in alloHSCT (toxic damage of conditioning regimen) and viral in COVID-19; (ii) genetic host-derived factors play a role; (iii) adaptive immunity fails, DAMP signal(s) increases, over-production of cytokines occurs; (iv) monocytes lacking HLADR expression emerge, being suppressor cells hampering adaptive immunity; (v) immune system homeostasis is broken, the patient's status deteriorates to bed dependency, leading to hypo-oxygenation and malnutrition, which in turn stimulates the intracellular alert pathways with vigorous transcription of cytokine genes. All starts with the interaction between DAMPs with appropriate receptors, which leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the inflammatory process spreads, tissue is damaged, DAMPs are released and a vicious cycle occurs. Attempts to modify intracellular signaling pathways in patients with post-alloHSCT graft vs host disease have already been undertaken. The similarities documented in this study show that this approach may also be used in COVID-19 patients for tuning signal transduction processes to interrupt the cycle that powers the cytokine overproduction.","Lange, Andrzej; Lange, Janusz; Jaskula, Emilia",Front Immunol,,361

This study aimed to: 1) assess changes in well-being and perceived stress symptoms of Dutch emergency department (ED) staff in the course of the first COVID-19 wave, and 2) assess and explore stressors experienced by ED staff since the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire was administered during June-July 2020 to physicians, nurses and non-clinical staff of four EDs in the Netherlands. Well-being and stress symptoms (i.e., cognitive, emotional and physical) were scored for the periods pre, during and after the first COVID-19 wave using the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and a 10-point Likert scale. Stressors were assessed and explored by rating experiences with specific situations (i.e., frequency and intensity of distress) and in free-text narratives. Quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Narratives were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: In total, 192 questionnaires were returned (39% response). Compared to pre-COVID-19, the mean WHO-5 index score (range: 0-100) decreased significantly with 14.1 points (p < 0.001) during the peak of the first wave and 3.7 points (< 0.001) after the first wave. Mean self-perceived stress symptom levels almost doubled during the peak of the first wave (&#8804;0.005). Half of the respondents reported experiencing more moral distress in the ED since the COVID-19 outbreak. High levels of distress were primarily found in situations where the staff was unable to provide or facilitate necessary emotional support to a patient or family. Analysis of 51 free-texts revealed witnessing suffering, high work pressure, fear of contamination, inability to provide comfort and support, rapidly changing protocols regarding COVID-19 care and personal protection, and shortage of protection equipment as important stressors. CONCLUSIONS: The first COVID-19 wave took its toll on ED staff. Actions to limit drop-out and illness among staff resulting from psychological distress are vital to secure acute care for (non-)COVID-19 patients during future infection waves.","Hesselink, Gijs; Straten, Lise; Gallée, Lars; Brants, Anne; Holkenborg, Joris; Barten, Dennis G; Schoon, Yvonne",BMC Health Serv Res,,361

RESULTADO: Como resultado se propone un protocolo básico de comunicación fundamentado en el counselling y en los principios de la bioética moderna, capaz de facilitar las funciones de informar, motivar la adhesión terapéutica, promover cambios de conducta, abordar situaciones de comunicación difícil y, especialmente, de tener un encuentro auténtico con el paciente y su familia. Por conclusión sin comunicación eficaz no hay encuentro, y sin encuentro, la relación clínica entre profesional y paciente se puede convertir en un intercambio de palabras vacías, de imposiciones de tratamientos, que difícilmente el paciente va a cumplir adecuadamente. Los tiempos cambian y la Medicina participativa va encontrando un lugar más adecuado en el entorno clínico","Font Guiteras, Antoni; Reventós Osuna, Paula; Falo Zamora, Catalina",Psicooncología (Pozuelo de Alarcón),,361
270762,Persistent mental health impacts of disaster. Five-year follow-up after the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami: Iwanuma Study,2020,"The world is currently suffering from a pandemic which has claimed the lives of over 230,000 people to date. The responsible virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is mainly characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath. In severe cases, the disease can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, which are mostly fatal for the patient. The severity of disease progression was hypothesized to be related to an overshooting immune response and was correlated with age and comorbidities, including cancer. A lot of research has lately been focused on the pathogenesis and acute consequences of COVID-19. However, the possibility of long-term consequences caused by viral infections which has been shown for other viruses are not to be neglected. In this regard, this opinion discusses the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer with special focus on the inflammatory immune response and tissue damage caused by infection. We summarize the available literature on COVID-19 suggesting an increased risk for severe disease progression in cancer patients, and we discuss the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to cancer development. We offer lines of thought to provide ideas for urgently needed studies on the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Geisslinger, F.; Vollmar, A. M.; Bartel, K.",Pharmaceuticals,,361

A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan,2020,"Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a huge impact on the plastic waste management in many countries due to the sudden surge of medical waste which has led to a global waste management crisis. Improper management of plastic waste may lead to various negative impacts on the environment, animals, and human health. However, adopting proper waste management and the right technologies, looking in a different perception of the current crisis would be an opportunity. About 40% of the plastic waste ended up in landfill, 25% incinerated, 16% recycled and the remaining 19% are leaked into the environment. The increase of plastic wastes and demand of plastic markets serve as a good economic indicator for investor and government initiative to invest in technologies that converts plastic waste into value-added product such as fuel and construction materials. This will close the loop of the life cycle of plastic waste by achieving a sustainable circular economy. This review paper will provide insight of the state of plastic waste before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The treatment pathway of plastic waste such as sterilisation technology, incineration, and alternative technologies available in converting plastic waste into value-added product were reviewed.","Khoo, Kuan Shiong; Ho, Lih Yiing; Lim, Hooi Ren; Leong, Hui Yi; Chew, Kit Wayne",J Hazard Mater,,361

271711,The COVID-19 Pandemic Highlights Shortcomings in US Health Care Informatics Infrastructure: A Call to Action,2020,"INTRODUCTION: School nurse is present today in many countries around the world. Its contribution within schools is described in the literature especially with regard to the management of chronic diseases and health education interventions. The Sars-CoV2 pandemic has forced many states to close schools, involving major psycho-social problems. The reopening of schools is a great challenge, in this regard this work has the goal of evaluating the literature that identifies the figure of the school nurse as a strength in containing the spread of contagious diseases and the actions that can be effective for this purpose. METHODS: An integrative literature review was conducted by interrogating the main international medical-nursing databases, all research articles were included, editorials and letters were excluded. Results were screened independently by two investigators. RESULTS: 10 articles were included, the main purpose of which was to describe outbreak cases and strategies for their management. The major nursing interventions highlighted are surveillance, case reporting, education, management of relationships with families, collaboration with other professionals. DISCUSSION: Although the identified literature was quantitatively poor, it is clear that the school nurse is central to syndromic surveillance, educational role, decision making, clinical management, collaboration with the team of experts and management of communication.","Guarinoni, Milena Giovanna; Lardelli, Marco; Motta, Paolo Carlo",Prof Inferm,,361

271905,COVID-19 and Children's Mental Health: Identifying Challenges and the New Normal,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In 2010, a virtual sarcoma referral model was implemented, which aims to provide a centralised multidisciplinary team (MDT) to provide rapid advice, avoiding unnecessary appointments and providing a streamlined service. The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of this screening tool in reducing the service burden and expediting patient journey. METHODS AND RESULTS: All referrals made to a single tertiary referral sarcoma unit from January 2010 to December 2018 were extracted from a prospective database. Only 26.0% events discussed required review directly. 30.3% were discharged back to referrer. 16.5% required further investigations. 22.5% required a biopsy prior to review. There was a reduction in the rate of patients reviewed at the sarcoma clinic, and a higher discharge rate from the MDT in 2018 versus 2010 (p < 0.001). This gives a potential cost saving of 670,700 GBP over the 9 year period. CONCLUSION: An MDT meeting which triages referrals is cost-effective at reducing unnecessary referrals. This can limit unnecessary exposure of patients who may have an underlying diagnosis of cancer to a high-risk environment, and reduces burden on services as it copes with increasing demands during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alanie, Omer Mhf; Mahendra, Ashish; Mackinnon, Mairi; McCleery, Mark; Nicholas, Christopher; Gupta, Sanjay",Scott Med J,,361

A recent letter from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Redfield underscored the possibility of ""large-scale"" distribution of a coronavirus vaccine as early as November 1, 2020. However, recent polling reveals that the majority of Americans remain skeptical of both the safety and efficacy of a potential Covid-19 vaccine. Even more troublesome is the fact that a comprehensive, collaborative vaccine marketing campaign has not been initiated to educate the U.S. public on and encourage widespread Covid-19 vaccination. Accordingly, this article lays out a plan of action, utilizing proven immunization marketing strategies and novel approaches, that could be used to combat vaccine hesitancy toward Covid-19. A vaccine may indeed be our ticket out of this pandemic, but targeted marketing is needed to increase public optimism toward that fact.","Zizzo, John",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,361

SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as a highly contagious respiratory virus with severe morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable populations. Being a novel disease, everyone is susceptible, there are no vaccine and no treatment. To contain the spread of the disease, health authorities throughout the world have restricted the social interactions of individuals in various degrees. Allergists, like other physicians, are faced with the challenge of providing care for their patients, while protecting themselves and patients from getting infected, with strategies that are in continuous evolution as states work through the different stages of social distance. Allergist provides care for patients with the most common non-communicable disease in the world: asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, venom allergy, drug allergy atopic dermatitis, and urticarial syndromes. Some of these diseases are not only considered risk factors for severe reactions but also have symptoms such as cough and sneezing that are in differential diagnosis with COVID-19. As we move forward, allergy symptoms may prevent patients from working, go to school, or access medical services that increasingly are allowing only asymptomatic individuals. In this review, we will outline how to take care safety of different allergic patients during the pandemic.","Cianferoni, Antonella; Votto, Martina",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,,361

We describe the first case of PJP in an immunocompetent patient who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient was hospitalized for 18 d for respiratory failure due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and successfully treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) respiratory support, enoxaparin, ceftaroline and intravenous 6 mg of dexamethasone for 10 d, then with oral prednisone tapering. Despite his improved radiological and clinical conditions at discharge, he was admitted again after 18 d for worsening of respiratory conditions. Upon the second admission, a high-resolution CT-scan of the chest showed the development of new ground-glass opacities and P. jirovecii was detected on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A therapy with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole 20 mg/kg and methylprednisolone 40 mg i.v. bis in die (BID) was started, with improvement of clinical, biochemical and radiological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients may have multiple risk factors for development of PJP, in particular lymphopaenia and use of steroids. PJP must be ruled out with direct microbiological methods in patients presenting with radiologic and clinical features of possible or probable PJP, even in immunocompetent hosts.","Viceconte, Giulio; Buonomo, Antonio Riccardo; Lanzardo, Amedeo; Pinchera, Biagio; Zappulo, Emanuela; Scotto, Riccardo; Schiano Moriello, Nicola; Vargas, Maria; Iacovazzo, Carmine; Servillo, Giuseppe; Gentile, Ivan",Infect Dis (Lond),,361

The participants included 1780 left-behind (960 boys) and 1500 non-left-behind (811 boys) children in elementary and junior high school with a mean age of 11.23. Self-reported questionnaires concerning children's depression, loneliness, anxiety, and academic adjustment, and parents' coping with children's negative emotions were completed. The results suggested that compared with non-left-behind children, left-behind children's depression and anxiety symptoms were more severe and their academic adjustment was poorer. However, left-behind children had lower levels of loneliness than non-left-behind children. Additionally, supportive coping types, especially emotion-focused and problem-focused reactions, were significantly negatively correlated with children's depression and anxiety. Unsupportive coping types, especially distress and punitive reactions, were significantly positively correlated with children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the relationships between punitive reactions and depression, ignoring and loneliness and problem-focused reactions and academic adjustment were significantly stronger in left-behind children. Hence, during the pandemic, left-behind children were still at a disadvantage even with their parents' company. However, parents' coping style towards left-behind children's negative emotions played a significant role in their adjustment.","Wang, Yining; Liu, Wen; Wang, Weiwei; Lin, Shuang; Lin, Danhua; Wang, Hongli",,,361
273944,Transitioning Clinical Care for People Who Use Drugs to Telemedicine: Lessons Learned One Year into the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the economic and social problems that societies face today. At the same time, the public response to the crisis points to a constructive way forward. It has brought people together and unleashed a desire to contribute in many ways, some small and others spectacular. It has demonstrated how opportunities for people to participate in collective activities both psychologically and behaviorally can achieve remarkable results, especially when addressing a common danger. This paper argues that it is timely to widen participation in organizational decision-making as an approach to addressing many of the problems which will continue to be with us post-Covid, and which indeed the pandemic has exacerbated. In order to arrive at practical policy options, it proceeds through the following stages. The first is to establish a working definition of organizational participation and to develop a framework for classifying its principal forms. This framework serves to identify the more advanced and consequential forms of participation, and is then used to structure an evidence-based review of how they can constructively contribute to economic and social improvement. The final part of the paper reviews conditions bearing on the practical implementation of participation and which serve to clarify practical policy implications.","Child, John",Int. Rev. Appl.

In most cases, the curve is well described by the Gompertz function, which is characterized by two essential parameters, the initial growth rate and the decay rate as the first epidemic wave subsides. These parameters are determined by socioeconomic factors and the countermeasures to halt the epidemic. The Gompertz model implies that the total death toll depends exponentially, and hence very sensitively, on the ratio between these rates. The remarkably different epidemic curves for the first epidemic wave in Sweden and Norway and many other countries are classified and discussed in this framework, and their usefulness for the planning of mitigation strategies is discussed.","Rypdal, Kristoffer; Rypdal, Martin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02475v1.pdf,361

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, is being administered off-label to some patients with COVID-19, and although early small studies suggested a benefit, there are no conclusive data proving its usefulness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with or without treatment with Tocilizumab. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective study of 1938 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to hospitals within the Jefferson Health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, between March 25, 2020 and June 17, 2020, of which 307 received Tocilizumab. EXPOSURES: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes data related to length of stay, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The average age was 65.2, with 47% women; 36.4% were African-American. The average length of stay was 22 days with 26.3% of patients requiring admission to the ICU and 14.9% requiring mechanical ventilation. The overall mortality was 15.3%. Older age, admission to an ICU, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were associated with higher mortality. Treatment with Tocilizumab was also associated with higher mortality, which was mainly observed in subjects not requiring care in an ICU with estimated odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 (p = 0.0004). Tocilizumab treatment was also associated with higher likelihood of admission to an ICU (OR = 4.8, p < 0.0001), progression to requiring mechanical ventilation (OR = 6.6, p < 0.0001), and increased length of stay (OR = 16.2, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our retrospective analysis revealed an association between Tocilizumab administration and increased mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in subjects with COVID-19. Prospective trials are needed to evaluate the true effect of Tocilizumab in this condition.","Li, Michael; Yoo, Erika J; Baram, Michael; McArthur, Melanie; Skeehan, Connor; Awsare, Bharat; George, Gautam; Summer, Ross; Zurlo, John; Jallo, Jack; Roman, Jesse",Am J Med Sci,,361

Ivermectin, an anti-helminthic drug is also being proposed for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Ivermectin has demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses. Due to its potential to interfere with transport of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to nucleus, it is being proposed to have antiviral activity against this virus as well which has been confirmed in an in-vitro study. However, in-vitro to in-vivo extrapolation studies indicate an inability to achieve the desired IC50 levels of ivermectin after oral administration of doses up to 10 times higher than the approved anti-helminthic dose. In a modelling simulation study, drug accumulation in the lungs was noticed at levels having potential antiviral activity. It is hypothesised that inhaled formulation of ivermectin may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, ivermectin administered via inhalational route needs to be explored for potential beneficial role in COVID-19 in preclinical and clinical studies. We also hypothesise the possibility of drug having anti-inflammatory action in coronavirus associated severe respiratory illness based on few in-vitro and in-vivo reports which however needs to be confirmed clinically.","Mittal, Niti; Mittal, Rakesh",Med Hypotheses,,361
282917,Audit of physical health monitoring in a forensic psychiatric community caseload,2021,"Bonjour à tous, Dès le début de la pandémie de COVID-19, le CMFC a dû déterminer si l’Examen de certification en médecine familiale et l’Examen de compétence additionnelle en médecine d’urgence auraient lieu et de quelle façon Lors de ces décisions, le CMFC souhaitait maintenir ses exigences ainsi que la valeur et la réputation des désignations conférées à ceux qui y satisfont, tout en tenant compte de l’effet de ces décisions sur nos membres Pour cela, nous avons discuté et collaboré avec d’autres instances normatives comme le Collège royal, le Conseil médical du Canada (CMC) et la Fédération des ordres des médecins du Canada (FOMC) Nous en avons dégagé trois conclusions : D’abord, reporter tous les examens jusqu’en 2021 était l’option la plus juste, le seul moyen de traiter tout le monde de la même façon Cette option affecterait l’octroi du permis d’exercice pour tous les résidents admissibles à l’examen, soit environ 85 % des candidats à l’Examen de certification en médecine familiale et 60 % de candidats à l’Examen de compétence additionnelle en médecine d’urgence Deuxièmement, nous pourrions probablement tenir la partie informatisée de nos examens à l’automne 2020 ;notre fournisseur serait en mesure d’offrir ce volet partout au pays Enfin, les recommandations de santé publique, les restrictions des déplacements, le risque de contagion et le nombre d’employés et d’examinateurs nous obligeaient à reporter l’Examen de certification du printemps à l’automne 2020 De plus, il serait impossible de tenir le volet oral des deux examens à l’automne 2020 Le Bureau des examens et de la certification (BEC) est responsable des décisions stratégiques concernant la tenue des examens du CMFC Il a défini un ensemble de principes pour guider la prise de décisions finales : il est extrêmement important de tenir les examens dans les circonstances exceptionnelles de cette année ;notre approche doit être viable et sécuritaire ;les décisions concernant les examens du CMFC doivent être prises, autant que possible, avec les mêmes normes et la même confiance que toute autre année ;il s’agit d’une réponse à la pandémie, pas d’une occasion d’apporter d’autres changements au processus ;et il faut minimiser les effets négatifs sur nos membres et les candidats à l’examen, en priorisant ceux qui débutent la pratique ou nécessitent un permis d’exercice Le BEC a envisagé toutes les options et les répercussions liées au fait d’offrir les examens aux personnes qui s’y présentent pour la première fois et à celles qui le reprennent L’analyse du psychométricien du CMFC a indiqué une forte corrélation entre la réussite des volets écrit et oral de l’examen pour les candidats qui s’y présentent pour la première fois, mais pas chez ceux qui refont l’examen D’après cette analyse et les principes ci-haut, nous avons déterminé qu’il serait raisonnable, exceptionnellement durant les mesures d’urgence de la pandémie, de baser les décisions de certification sur un examen écrit seulement à l’automne Seuls les candidats qui se présentent à l’examen pour la première fois ou les personnes identifiées qui doivent reprendre la partie informatisée seulement seront admissibles Le volet oral évalue les compétences essentielles ;il est et restera un élément primordial des examens du CMFC Toute personne qui échoue à l’examen cette année devra se présenter aux deux volets la prochaine fois Cette pause d’un an des examens oraux, appuyée par les statistiques de rendement, n’est valide que pour les personnes candidates à l’examen pour la première fois Nous ne croyons pas pouvoir évaluer correctement celles qui ont déjà obtenu un échec en les soumettant seulement à un examen écrit en 2020 Ceci nuirait aux normes de certification du CMFC Le CMFC, par l’intermédiaire du BEC, a établi que les personnes ayant auparavant échoué à un examen seraient astreintes aux critères de certification qui étaient en vigueur au moment de leur échec, avant la pandémie Sachez qu’un processus rigoureux a été suivi pour prendre cette décision difficile, mais mûrement réfléchie, afin que notre examen continue de refléter les normes de certification élevées qui font partie de notre responsabilité envers la population canadienne Nous avons limité les changements au strict nécessaire en regard des restrictions imposées par la pandémie Bien que nous priorisions dans l’immédiat nos examens de l’automne 2020, nous songeons aussi à ceux qui auront lieu en 2021 À long terme, nous planifions d’accroître l’amélioration continue et la validité de nos examens, et de renforcer l’efficacité des communications entre le BEC et le Conseil d’administration du CMFC Il y a plusieurs années, la FOMC a établi que, pour obtenir un permis d’exercice dans la plupart des provinces et territoires, il fallait posséder la certification du CMFC ou du Collège royal ainsi qu’un doctorat en médecine et le titre de Licencié du CMC (la note de passage aux deux parties de l’Examen d’aptitude) Ces conditions ont été délibérément mises en place, en partie pour maintenir des normes et exigences de certification élevées et pour assurer des liens adéquats avec les autorités réglementaires, qui ont des responsabilités vis-à-vis du public Le maintien de normes élevées et de la certification, de même que le rôle du CMFC dans l’agrément des programmes de résidence en médecine de famille et de développement

283334,Social determinants of health and child maltreatment: a systematic review,2020,"Currently, there is a need for reliable tests that allow identification of individuals that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 even if the infection was asymptomatic. To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs are based on serum detection of Abs to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralizing Abs) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that is known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of Ags released from infected cells could stimulate Ab responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other nonstructural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titer IgG, IgM, and IgA Ab responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher Ab titers in these assays associated with more-severe disease, and no cross-reactive Abs against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG Abs specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 Ags can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent Ag in infected patients that can be used in serological tests, and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, noninvasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; Alfranca, Arantzazu; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Casasnovas, Jose M; Fernández-Soto, Daniel; Esteso, Gloria; Cáceres-Martell, Yaiza; Gardeta, Sofía; López-Sanz, Celia; Prat, Salomé; Mateu-Albero, Tamara; Gabrie, Ligia; López-Granados, Eduardo; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Reyburn, Hugh T; Rodríguez Frade, José M; Valés-Gómez, Mar",J Immunol,,361

Little is known about the extent of the environmental contamination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an urgently field hospital. A total of 66 surface samples were randomly collected from a general isolation ward and an ICU (intensive care unit) at a rapidly built field hospital (Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital) in Wuhan, China, from 12 March to 17 March 2020. The samples were used for SARS-CoV-2 detection and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) monitoring. Among these samples, 3.03% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The nurses' hands and nurse station in the ICU were weakly positive (CT value = 38.79; CT value = 37.56) and the ATP value of these two sites was higher than the mean value of all samples (ATP = 817; ATP = 577). The environmental cleaning and disinfection normalization bundle measures in Leishenshan hospital included air disinfection, object surface cleaning and disinfection, instrument equipment surface disinfection and hand hygiene, etc. These have been tested and were shown to be reliable and useful.

In Shanghai, the total PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ concentration dropped from 0.0291 pg-WHO2005-TEQ m–3 from 2018–2019 to 0.0250 pg-WHO2005-TEQ m–3 in 2020, while in Nanjing, it dropped from 0.0423 pg-WHO2005-TEQ m–3 to 0.0338 pg-WHO2005-TEQ m–3. The average concentrations of PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ in spring and winter in Shanghai and Nanjing were 47.6% and 53.8% higher than those in summer, respectively. From 2018-2019, the average particle phase fractions of total-PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ in Shanghai and Nanjing were 50.3% and 57.5%, respectively, while in 2020, they were 47.8% and 55.1%, respectively. From 2018-2019, the average PM2.5-bound total PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ content was 0.342 and 0.493 ng-WHO2005-TEQ g–1 in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively, while in 2020, it was 0.312 and 0.489 ng-WHO2005-TEQ g–1, respectively. In Shanghai and Nanjing, the average PM2.5-bound total PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ content in spring and winter was 77.5% and 73.2% higher than that in summer, respectively. From 2018–2019, the dry deposition flux of total-PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ was 316.3 and 460.5 pg WHO2005-TEQ m–2 month–1 in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively, while in 2020, it was 272.5 and 368.4 pg WHO2005-TEQ m–2 month–1, respectively. The average dry deposition flux of total-PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ in spring and winter was 47.6% and 53.8% higher than that summer in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively. The above results indicate that COVID-19 in 2020 had a positive effect on air quality improvement in PCDD/Fs. On average, more than 98.88% of the total PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ dry deposition flux was primarily contributed by the particle phase. This was attributed to the fact that dry deposition of particle phase PCDD/Fs was mainly due to gravitational settling accompanied by higher dry deposition velocities, while the gas phase PCDD/Fs were deposited mostly by diffusion at a lower dry deposition velocity. © The Author(s).","Yu, F.; Cui, K.; Sheu, H.

However, the effects of PG on the proliferation and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have not been clarified. In this study, MTT assay and flow cytometry were conducted to investigate the effect of PG on proliferation and apoptosis of NSCLC cells in vitro, respectively. A xenograft model of A549 cell was established in nude mice to validate the in vitro findings. Western blot were performed to measure the expression of molecules involved in AMPK/ERK/NF-&#954;B pathway. Results suggested that PG (50 or 100 µM) was significantly cytotoxic to A549 cells and SPC-A1 cells in vitro. PG treatment also inhibited the tumor growth of NSCLC cell mouse xenografts in vivo. These anti-proliferative and pro-apoptosis effects of PG were found to be regulated by the AMPK/ERK/NF-&#954;B pathway. Consequently, PG suppressed proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in NSCLC cells. In conclusions, PG regulates AMPK/ERK/NF-&#954;B axis in NSCLC cells, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the apoptosis of NSCLC cells.","Wu, Shuo; Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Yan; Chen, Lizhan; Xu, Xi; Dang, Yinli; Ti, Xinyu",Pharmazie,,361

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19, confirmed by positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral nucleic acids from oropharyngeal swab specimens between February 4, 2020 and July 6, 2020, were enrolled. Their clinical characteristics and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventeen of the 28 patients (60.7%) had pneumonia. The most frequent symptoms were cough (n = 23, 82.1%) and fever (n = 17, 60.7%). The development of pneumonia was associated with age &#8805;40 years (p < 0.024), body mass index (BMI) &#8805;25 kg/m2 (p = 0.014), fever (p = 0.007), shortness of breath (p = 0.036), chills ((p = 0.047), and lower platelet counts (<200,000/µL) (p = 0.007). Increased quarantine duration was associated with age &#8805;40 years (p = 0.026), Charlson index &#8805;1 (p = 0.037), lower lymphocyte (<1500/uL; p = 0.028) or platelet counts (<200,000/µL) (p = 0.016), lower serum sodium (<140 mEq/L; p = 0.006), and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level (&#8805;1 mg/dl; p = 0.04). Treatment with hydroxychloroquine or in combination with other medicines did not reduce the quarantine duration. All 28 patients recovered with a median quarantine duration of 27.2 days. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with older age, higher BMI, fever, chills or shortness of breath, lower serum sodium level, lower platelet or lymphocyte count, and higher CRP level may be associated with developing pneumonia or longer quarantine duration.","Tsai, Chun-Chou; Wang, Yung-Chih; Chiang, Tsung-Ta; Chen, I-An; Chiu, Chun-Hsiang; Yang, Ya-Sung; Yeh, Kuo-Ming; Chang, Feng-Yee",J.

Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of the novel SARS-CoV2 infection and progression can provide potential novel targets for its prevention and/or treatment. Virus microbiota reciprocal interactions have been studied in a variety of viral infections. For example, the integrity of Coronavirus particles can be disrupted by surfactin, a bacterial surface molecule that targets other viruses, including that of influenza A. In this light, intestinal microbiota likely influences COVID-19 virulence, while from its side SARS-CoV-2 may affect the intestinal microbiome promoting dysbiosis and other deleterious consequences. Hence, the microbiota pre-existing health status and its alterations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are likely to play an important, still underscored role in determining individual susceptibility and resilience to COVID-19. Indeed, the vast majority of COVID-19 worst clinical conditions and fatalities develop in subjects with specific risk factors such as aging and the presence of one or more comorbidities, which are intriguingly characterized also by unhealthy microbiome status. Moreover, these comorbidities require complex pharmacological regimens known as ""polypharmacy"" that may further affect microbiota integrity and worsen the resilience to viral infections. This complex situation may represent a further and underestimated risk with regard to COVID-19 clinical burden for the elderly and comorbid people. Here, we discuss the possible biological, physiopathological, and clinical implications of gut microbiota in COVID-19 and the strategies to improve/maintain its healthy status as a simple and adjunctive strategy to reduce COVID-19 virulence and socio-sanitary burden.","Donati Zeppa, Sabrina; Agostini, Deborah; Piccoli, Giovanni; Stocchi, Vilberto; Sestili, Piero",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,361

This spotlight article looks at developments made in “pre-pandemic preparedness planning” following a number of outbreaks of influenza type A virus in 1997. At that time, a specific avian influenza subtype, referred to as A(H5N1), wreaked havoc among fowl but also infected humans through direct transmission. The potential for slight genetic mutations that could make A(H5N1) more infectious, allowing human-to-human transmission, presented the threat of a deadly influenza pandemic. As a result, the U.S. government (and others coordinating through the World Health Organization) launched a pandemic preparation plan, including strategies to develop vaccines against A(H5N1) and its genetic lineages each year. This spotlight article discusses the events that led to the specific concern about A(H5N1) among public health officials, as well as early efforts to derive and stockpile an appropriate vaccine to protect against a possible pandemic. This perspective presents the challenges the world has faced, in recent history, in striving to keep one step ahead of pandemic threats.","Dolan, Brian",Centaurus,,361

These restrictions have forced many to embrace ‘hyperlocal’ approaches to adventure and provided an opportunity to reimagine our adventure travel philosophies and practices. Despite claims that traditional adventure travel could address some of the “world’s most pressing challenges”, it has largely failed to realize its potential to provide a range of social, economic, and environmental benefits. Conversely, microadventure, which espouses adventures in nearby nature that are low-carbon and human-scaled, is an enticing alternative for both current and post-pandemic conditions. This essay first critiques pre-pandemic adventure travel and describes the hazards of this approach in age of COVID-19. It then explores creative ‘lockdown’ microadventures; envisions what post-pandemic adventure may look like; and explains why we not only need to embrace microadventures in a post-pandemic world, but also why we may prefer them to traditional adventure travel.","Mackenzie, Susan Houge; Goodnow, Jasmine",Leis.

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis as no permanent solution is available. However effective this technique may be, research has emerged showing its limitations in detection and diagnosis especially when it comes to low abundant targets. In contrast, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a recent emerging technology with superior advantages over qPCR, has been shown to overcome the challenges of RT-qPCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 from low abundant target samples. Prospectively, in this article, the capabilities of RT-ddPCR are further expanded by showing steps on how to develop simplex, duplex, triplex probe mix, and quadruplex assays using a two-color detection system. Using primers and probes targeting specific sites of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (N, ORF1ab, RPP30, and RBD2), the development of these assays is shown to be possible. Additionally, step by step detailed protocols, notes, and suggestions on how to improve the assays workflow and analyze data are provided.

A federated learning system can be viewed as a large-scale distributed system, involving different components and stakeholders with diverse requirements and constraints. Hence, developing a federated learning system requires both software system design thinking and machine learning knowledge. Although much effort has been put into federated learning from the machine learning perspectives, our previous systematic literature review on the area shows that there is a distinct lack of considerations for software architecture design for federated learning. In this paper, we propose FLRA, a reference architecture for federated learning systems, which provides a template design for federated learning-based solutions. The proposed FLRA reference architecture is based on an extensive review of existing patterns of federated learning systems found in the literature and existing industrial implementation. The FLRA reference architecture consists of a pool of architectural patterns that could address the frequently recurring design problems in federated learning architectures. The FLRA reference architecture can serve as a design guideline to assist architects and developers with practical solutions for their problems, which can be further customised.","Lo, Sin Kit; Lu, Qinghua; Paik, Hye-Young; Zhu, Liming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11570v1.pdf,361

Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. Further, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens, or Camostat attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cellular entry.

294744,Balancing Healthcare and Economy Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Indian Experience,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in obese children and adolescents, and its health consequences. SOURCES: Studies published between 2000 and 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, SciELO, and Cochrane databases. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Obesity is a highly prevalent comorbidity in severe cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents; social isolation may lead to increase fat accumulation. Excessive adipose tissue, deficit in lean mass, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and low intake of essential nutrients are factors that compromise the functioning of organs and systems in obese individuals. These factors are associated with damage to immune, cardiovascular, respiratory, and urinary systems, along with modification of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, these organic changes from obesity may increase the need for ventilatory assistance, risk of thromboembolism, reduced glomerular filtration rate, changes in the innate and adaptive immune response, and perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The need for social isolation can have the effect of causing or worsening obesity and its comorbidities, and pediatricians need to be aware of this issue. Facing children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, health professionals should 1) diagnose excess weight; 2) advise on health care in times of isolation; 3) screen for comorbidities, ensuring that treatment is not interrupted; 4) measure levels of immunonutrients; 5) guide the family in understanding the specifics of the situation; and 6) refer to units qualified to care for obese children and adolescents when necessary.","Nogueira-de-Almeida, Carlos Alberto; Del Ciampo, Luiz A; Ferraz, Ivan S; Del Ciampo, Ieda R L; Contini, Andrea A; Ued, Fábio da V",J Pediatr (Rio J),,361

Two fundamental parameters, the basic reproduction number (R0) and case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19, help in this understanding process. The objective of this study was to estimate the R0 and CFR of COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. Methods We carried out a systematic review to find the reported estimates of the R0 and the CFR in articles from international databases between January 1 and August 31, 2020. Random-effect models and Forest plots were implemented to evaluate the mean effect size of R0 and the CFR. Furthermore, R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where the studies were conducted. To assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected articles, the I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test were used. Results Forty-five studies involving R0 and 34 studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13). The CFR in different regions of the world varied significantly, from 2.49 (2.08, 2.94) in Asia to 3.40 (2.81, 4.04) in North America. We observed higher mean CFR values for the countries with lower tests (3.15 vs 2.16) and greater median population age (3.13 vs 2.27). However, R0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. Conclusions An R0 of 2.69 and a CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19. Although R0 and CFR may vary over time, space, and demographics, we recommend considering these figures in control and prevention measures.","Ahammed, Tanvir Anjum Aniqua Rahman Mohammad Meshbahur Haider Najmul Kock Richard Uddin Md Jamal",Health Science Reports,,361

295417,Mental health and psychosocial considerations during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Immediately before the state of emergency was declared, there was an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among special training participants with severe physical stress. For promoting the optimization of infection prevention measures by identifying acts and situations with high risk of infection, we conducted a survey and analysis to understand the detailed process of infection spread in these cases. METHODS: A structured interview was conducted for the special training participants on their health status, changes in symptoms, training methods, and behavior history in their private lives. Additionally, a patrol of the training facility was carried out to understand the training environment, and antibody tests were conducted on the close contacts for more accurately grasping the spread of infection, by identifying subclinical infected persons. RESULTS: Within 10 days of COVID-19 onset in the first patient, 15 of the 19 original training participants developed symptoms, and 14 patients tested positive for RT-PCR. PCR tests were also performed on four patients who did not develop the disease - two were positive and negative, each. The two negatives turned positive on a later antibody test, suggesting that there was an asymptomatic infection. In addition, all five patients who participated in the training for only a day developed symptoms and tested positive for PCR in a few days. Of the 64 people who underwent testing for antibodies as close contacts, all but one who was living together with a patient were negative on antibody testing. CONCLUSIONS: The onset of COVID-19 occurred after the start of practice-based training continuously; therefore, the practice-based training was thought to be the main cause of the transmission. We speculate that the main factors behind the rapid spread of infection are as follows: during practice-based training, increased ventilation made it difficult to wear a mask; repeated loud vocalizations at close range; and the training pair was not fixed. Physical training without shouting and desk work, however, did not possess the risk of COVID-19, and avoiding certain situations at high risk of respiratory infections may have significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission. If personnel become infected with SARS-CoV-2, emergency measures should be devised by identifying patients and close contacts and facilitating the investigation of their behavioral history. Furthermore, evaluating and improving the effectiveness of infection control measures is necessary by ascertaining potentially infected persons by performing PCR tests, antigen tests, antibody tests, etc. in combination.","Tsushita, Keitaro; Kobayashi, Syoko; Uno, Saori; Urano, Yuko; Ikedo, Mayumi",Sangyo Eiseigaku Zasshi,,361
295786,"Evaluation of knowledge, attitudes and practices of health services vocational schools' students with regard to COVID-19",2021,"Current available data of the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been analyzed using dimensional analysis and self-similarity hypotheses. We show that the time series of infected population and deaths of the most impacted and unprepared countries exhibits an asymptotic power law behavior, compatible with the propagation of a signal in a fractal network. We propose a model which predicts an asymptotically self-similar expansion of deaths in time before containment, and the final death toll under total containment measures, as a function of the delay in taking those measures after the expansion is observed. The physics of the model resembles the expansion of a flame in a homogeneous domain with a fractal dimension 3.75. After containment measures are taken, the natural fractal structure of the network is drastically altered and a secondary evolution is observed. This evolution, akin to the homogeneous combustion in a static isolated enclosure with a final quenching, has a characteristic time of 20.1 days, according to available data of the pandemic behavior in China. The proposed model is remarkably consistent with available data, which supports the simplifying hypotheses made in the model. A universal formulation for a quarantine as a function of that delay is also proposed.","Ganan-Calvo, Alfonso M.; Ramos, Juan A. Hernandez",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14284v1.pdf,361

Therefore, some international efforts have been developed to get simpler and cheaper mechanical ventilators, although the main challenge is the air flow control, because of the dynamic complexity that links the servomechanism and the biohydraulic system. In this context, as a first stage in the development of robust control algorithms with the described intention, this paper presents the design and analysis of a feedback vector linear controller implemented in a virtual servomechanism from an open source mechanical ventilator. The numerical validation of this feedback vector controller is analyzed through two gains tuning scenarios, the results show a positive implementation taking in consideration the strong nonlinearity the system has. The novelty of the work resides in the accuracy of the model being quite simple.

Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has also been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. In this retrospective observational cohort study drawn from electronic health records we sought to describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients were hospitalized at a 13-hospital network spanning New Jersey USA between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution while awaiting results of randomized trials.

METHODS: The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by virus RNA detection) was evaluated in a group of 1,460 seropositive and a control group of 8,150 seronegative healthcare workers in three Centres of Northern Italy in the period June-November 2020. Neutralizing serum titers were analyzed in seropositive subjects with or without secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: During the 6-month survey, 1.78% seropositive subjects developed secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection while 6.63% seronegative controls developed primary infection (odds ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.38). Secondary infection was associated with low or absent serum neutralizing titer (p<0.01) and was mildly symptomatic in 45.8% cases vs 71.4% symptomatic primary infections (odds ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Immunity from natural infection appears protective from secondary infection; therefore, vaccination of seronegative subjects might be prioritized.","Rovida, Francesca; Cassaniti, Irene; Percivalle, Elena; Sarasini, Antonella; Paolucci, Stefania; Klersy, Catherine; Cutti, Sara; Novelli, Viola; Marena, Carlo; Luzzaro, Francesco; De Vito, Giovanni; Schiavo, Roberta; Lo Cascio, Giuliana; Lilleri, Daniele; Baldanti, Fausto",Int J Infect Dis,,361

METHODS: Thirty-two patients with familial Mediterranean fever and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. All the patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurement. The AngioVue optical coherence tomography angiography device (Optovue, Fremont, CA) with split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography was used to evaluate and examine the retinal microvascular structure. Three-dimensional en face Optical coherence tomography angiography images were obtained by examining the macula using the 3 x 3 mm scanning protocol in the Angio Retina mode and the optic nerve using the 3 x 3 mm scanning protocol in the Angio Disk mode. All the patients' right eyes were examined. RESULTS: A total of 62 subjects were included in the study, of whom 32 (53.3%) were female and 30 (46.7%) were male. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of optic nerve head or radial peripapillary capillary vessel density. On examination, the superficial capillary plexuses were statistically similar between the two groups, but the deep capillary plexus vessel density in the parafovea, superior hemi, temporal, and superior areas were significantly lower in the patients with familial Mediterranean fever. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the capillary plexus vessel density was significantly lower in the parafovea, superior hemi, temporal, and superior regions in the patients with familial Mediterranean fever than in the control group. Therefore, OCTA, a noninvasive study, may be useful for understanding the systemic effects of familial Mediterranean fever.","Erdem, Seyfettin; Karahan, Mine; Ava, Sedat; Dursun, Mehmet Emin; Cevik, Figen Ceylan; Özkul, Emin; Keklikci, Ugur; Çevik, Remzi",Arq. bras. oftalmol,,361
306144,[Impacts on the mental health of the elderly patient after COVID-19: Post-traumatic stress disorder. About clinical case],2020,"Since cytokine release syndrome with elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considered to be associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); IL-6 inhibitors, such as tocilizumab, are expected to be effective for its treatment. This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value at admission and at peak, and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. The ICU group had higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P < .05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P = .012; 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P = .002; 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P = .008). Receiver operating characteristics curve showed higher predictability of in-hospital mortality with IL-6 at peak than others (area under curve; IL-6 at peak: 0.875 [0.87-0.942], IL-6 at admission: 0.794 [0.699-0.889], d-dimer at peak 0.787 [0.690-0.883], d-dimer at admission 0.726 [0.625-0.827]). Incidence of fungal infections was significantly higher in patients who were given tocilizumab than those who were not (13.0% vs 1.1%, P < .001). Notably, tocilizumab did not affect in-hospital mortality after adjustment including IL-6 (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.00 [0.27-3.72, P = .998]). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer levels were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Tocilizumab did not decrease in-hospital mortality in our cohort.","Maeda, Tetsuro; Obata, Reiichiro; Rizk DO, Dahlia; Kuno, Toshiki",J. med. virol,,361

Several clinical prediction rules (CPRs) have been developed to help reduce unnecessary prescribing for RTIs, but there is a lack of studies exploring whether or how these CPRs are being used in UK general practice. AIM: To explore UK GPs' views and experiences with regards to RTI CPRs, and to identify barriers and facilitators to their use in practice. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative analysis of interviews with in-hours GPs working in the South and South West of England. METHOD: Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews were conducted, digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Patient and public involvement representatives contributed to study design and interpretation of findings. RESULTS: Thirty-two GPs were interviewed. Some CPRs were more commonly used than others. Participants used CPRs to facilitate patient-clinician discussion, confirm and support their decision, and document the consultation. GPs also highlighted concerns including lack of time, inability of CPRs to incorporate patient complexity, a shift in focus from the patient during consultations, and limited use in remote consultation (during the COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for user-friendly CPRs that are readily integrated into computer systems, and easily embedded into routine practice to complement clinical decision-making. Existing CPRs need to be validated for other populations where demographics and clinical characteristics may differ, as well different settings including remote consultations and self-assessment.","Hounkpatin, Hilda O; Woods, Catherine; Lown, Mark; Stuart, Beth; Leydon, Geraldine M",,,361

The developed and developing countries are facing the burden equally and no proven treatment options available. Recent studies suggest the plausibility of vitamin D therapy and prophylaxis for COVID-19, in the setting where the deficiency is more prevalent. Though evaluation of vitamin D status is not a routine in India, the present study focuses on the level of Vitamin d among COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study was a hospital-based cross-sectional to find the status of vitamin D among COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital, Patna, Bihar, India. The demographic, comorbidity data were taken, and the level of vitamin D was measured by a chemiluminescence-based immunoassay analyzer. The analysis compared the level of deficiency and insufficiency among different groups of COVID-19 patients. The role of DM and HTN as risk factors for mortality was compared. Results: Among the total study participants (156), 42.31% were obese and 17.31% were severe as per clinical severity. The total prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 58.97% and insufficiency was 89.1%. The prevalence was found high among male (61.02%), overweight (65.52%), and severe (62.96%) patients. The severity increases with advanced age (p&lt;0.05) and important risk factors for mortality are DM, HTN, and advanced age. Conclusion: The level of vitamin D can be assessed for the prognosis of COIVD-19 patients and help to modify the treatment protocol. Appropriate therapeutic/preventive intervention of vitamin D can alter the course and severity of COVID-19.","Singh, S.; Nimavat, N.; Kumar Singh, A.; Ahmad, S.; Sinha, N.",International journal of general medicine,,361

InterpretationThe results showed that the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine was safe in immunocompromised patients. The rate of seroconversion was substantially lower than in healthy controls, with a wide range of rates and antibody titres among predefined patient groups and subgroups. This clinical trial highlights the need for additional vaccine doses in certain immunocompromised patient groups and/or subgroups to improve immunity.

310823,Reduced No-Show Rates and Sustained Patient Satisfaction of Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The rapid spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 greatly threatens global public health but no prophylactic vaccine is available. Here, we report the generation of a replication-incompetent recombinant serotype 5 adenovirus, Ad5-S-nb2, carrying a codon-optimized gene encoding Spike protein (S). In mice and rhesus macaques, intramuscular injection with Ad5-S-nb2 elicits systemic S-specific antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Intranasal inoculation elicits both systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but weaker CMI response. At 30 days after a single vaccination with Ad5-S-nb2 either intramuscularly or intranasally, macaques are protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. A subsequent challenge reveals that macaques vaccinated with a 10-fold lower vaccine dosage (1 × 1010 viral particles) are also protected, demonstrating the effectiveness of Ad5-S-nb2 and the possibility of offering more vaccine dosages within a shorter timeframe. Thus, Ad5-S-nb2 is a promising candidate vaccine and warrants further clinical evaluation.","Feng, Liqiang; Wang, Qian; Shan, Chao; Yang, Chenchen; Feng, Ying; Wu, Jia; Liu, Xiaolin; Zhou, Yiwu; Jiang, Rendi; Hu, Peiyu; Liu, Xinglong; Zhang, Fan; Li, Pingchao; Niu, Xuefeng; Liu, Yichu; Zheng, Xuehua; Luo, Jia; Sun, Jing; Gu, Yingying; Liu, Bo; Xu, Yongcun; Li, Chufang; Pan, Weiqi; Zhao, Jincun; Ke, Changwen; Chen, Xinwen; Xu, Tao; Zhong, Nanshan; Guan, Suhua; Yuan, Zhiming; Chen, Ling",Nat Commun,,361
310861,"Improving cardiometabolic health assessments and interventions at St Charles Hospital, London",2021,"The dynamics of the spread of epidemics, such as the recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is highly nonlinear and therefore difficult to predict. As time evolves in the present pandemic, it appears more and more clearly that a clustered dynamics is a key element of the description. This means that the disease rapidly evolves within spatially localized networks, that diffuse and eventually create new clusters. We improve upon the simplest possible compartmental model, the SIR model, by adding an additional compartment associated with the clustered individuals. This sophistication is compatible with more advanced compartmental models and allows, at the lowest level of complexity, to leverage the well-mixedness assumption. The so-obtained SBIR model takes into account the effect of inhomogeneity on epidemic spreading, and compares satisfactorily with results on the pandemic propagation in a number of European countries, during and immediately after lock-down. Especially, the decay exponent of the number of new cases after the first peak of the epidemic is captured without the need to vary the coefficients of the model with time. We show that this decay exponent is directly determined by the diffusion of the ensemble of clustered individuals and can be related to a global reproduction number, that overrides the classical, local reproduction number.","Bos, Wouter J T; Bertoglio, Jean-Pierre; Gostiaux, Louis",Comput Mech,,361

311693,Gender differences in Health Risk Behaviors and its correlates during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Biological considerations suggest that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: The REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor before admission. Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin-angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04338009. FINDINGS: Between March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77). Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes. Compared with discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40-110] for continuation vs 81 [38-117] for discontinuation; ß-coefficient 8 [95% CI -13 to 29]). There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died. 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (&#967;2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77). There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with international society recommendations, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

311806,"Crosstalk of TLR4, vascular NADPH oxidase, and COVID-19 in diabetes: What are the potential implications?",2021,"Internet of Things (IoT) has recently brought an influential research and analysis platform in a broad diversity of academic and industrial disciplines, particularly in healthcare. The IoT revolution is reshaping current healthcare practices by consolidating technological, economic, and social views. Since December 2019, the spreading of COVID-19 across the world has impacted the world’s economy. IoT technology integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help address COVID-19. UAVs equipped with IoT devices produce raw data that demands computing analysis to make significant actions without human intervention. To mitigate the effect of COVID-19, in this paper, we design an IoT-UAV-based scheme that collects raw data using onboard thermal sensors. The thermal image captured from the thermal camera is used to determine the potential people in the image (of the massive crowd in a city), which might have COVID-19, based on the temperature recorded. An efficient hybrid approach for a face recognition system is proposed to detect the people in the image having high body temperature from infrared images captured in real-time. Also, a face mask detection scheme is introduced, which detects whether a person has a mask on the face or not. The schemes’ performance evaluation is done using various machine learning and deep learning classifiers. We use the edge computing infrastructure (onboard sensors and actuators) for data processing to reduce the response time and real-time analytics and prediction. The proposed approach delivers an average accuracy of 99.5% by using less than half the parameters for real-time predictions.","Barnawi, Ahmed Chhikara Prateek Tekchandani Rajkumar Kumar Neeraj Alzahrani Bander",Future Generation Computer Systems,,361

Increasing reports suggest an association between COVID-19 and AIS, although the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. Objectives: We performed a systematic review to characterize the clinical characteristics, neuroimaging findings, and outcomes of AIS in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase using a suitable keyword search strategy from 1st December 2019 to 29th May 2020. All studies reporting AIS occurrence in COVID-19 patients were included. Results: A total of 39 studies comprising 135 patients were studied. The pooled incidence of AIS in COVID-19 patients from observational studies was 1.2% (54/4466) with a mean age of 63.4 ± 13.1 years. The mean duration of AIS from COVID-19 symptoms onset was 10 ± 8 days, and the mean NIHSS score was 19 ± 8. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated mean D-dimer (9.2 ± 14.8 mg/L) and fibrinogen (5.8 ± 2.0 g/L). Antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in a significant number of cases. The majority of AIS neuroimaging patterns observed was large vessel thrombosis, embolism or stenosis (62.1%, 64/103), followed by multiple vascular territory (26.2%, 27/103). A high mortality rate was reported (38.0%, 49/129). Conclusion: We report the pooled incidence of AIS in COVID-19 patients to be 1.2%, with a high mortality rate. Elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies appear to be prominent in COVID-19 patients with concomitant AIS, but further mechanistic studies are required to elucidate their role in pathogenesis.","Tan, Y.

We identify LARC promotion discourse as constituting 'The Age of LARC': multifarious strategies for producing responsible sexual citizens whose health behaviours are empowered via a LARC-only approach to contraceptive use. We suggest that immediate postpartum LARC insertion policies, which have proliferated in the U.S. since 2012, exemplify the new era of LARC hegemony, in which urgency, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and outcomes dominate both health policy and clinical practice around these contraceptive technologies. By following these efforts to facilitate access to and use of immediate postpartum LARC, we find a discourse on sexual citizenship that paradoxically constructs sexual health freedom through the use of a single class of contraceptive technologies.","Brian, Jenny Dyck; Grzanka, Patrick R; Mann, Emily S",Health Sociol Rev,,361

312970,Nexus Between the COVID-19 Dynamics and Environmental Pollution Indicators in South America,2021,"In this study, efficacy and safety of interferon (IFN) ß-1b in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 were evaluated. Among an open-label, randomized clinical trial, adult patients (&#8805;18 years old) with severe COVID-19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to the IFN group or the control group. Patients in the IFN group received IFN ß-1b (250 mcg subcutaneously every other day for two consecutive weeks) along with the national protocol medications while in the control group, patients received only the national protocol medications (lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine for 7-10 days). The primary outcome of the study was time to clinical improvement. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications and 28-daymortality. Between April 20 and May 20, 2020, 80 patients were enrolled and finally 33 patients in each group completed the study. Time to clinical improvment in the IFN group was significantly shorter than the control group ([9(6-10) vs. 11(9-15) days respectively, p = 0.002, HR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.33-3.39]). At day 14, the percentage of discharged patients was 78.79% and 54.55% in the IFN and control groups respectively (OR = 3.09; 95% CI: 1.05-9.11, p = 0.03). ICU admission rate in the control group was significantly higher than the IFN group (66.66% vs. 42.42%, p = 0.04). The duration of hospitalization and ICU stay were not significantly different between the groups All-cause 28-day mortality was 6.06% and 18.18% in the IFN and control groups respectively (p = 0.12). IFN ß-1b was effective in shortening the time to clinical improvement without serious adverse events in patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, admission in ICU and need for invasive mechanical ventilation decreased following administration of IFN ß-1b. Although 28-day mortality was lower in the IFN group, further randomized clinical trials with large sample size are needed for exact estimation of survival benefit of IFN ß-1b.","Rahmani, Hamid; Davoudi-Monfared, Effat; Nourian, Anahid; Khalili, Hossein; Hajizadeh, Nooshin; Jalalabadi, Narjes Zarei; Fazeli, Mohammad Reza; Ghazaeian, Monireh; Yekaninejad, Mir Saeed",Int Immunopharmacol,,361
313290,Telehealth mental health services during COVID-19: summary of evidence and clinical practice,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has cast increased attention on emerging infections. Clinicians and public health experts should be aware of emerging infectious causes of encephalitis, mechanisms by which they are transmitted, and clinical manifestations of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of arthropod-borne viral infections -- transmitted chiefly by mosquitoes and ticks -- have emerged in recent years to cause outbreaks of encephalitis. Examples include Powassan virus in North America, Chikungunya virus in Central and South America, and tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe. Many of these viruses exhibit complex life cycles and can infect multiple host animals in addition to humans. Factors thought to influence emergence of these diseases, including changes in climate and land use, are also believed to underlie the emergence of the rickettsial bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, now recognized as a major causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome in South Asia. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of bats as carriers of viruses. Recent studies have begun to uncover mechanisms by which the immune systems of bats are poised to allow for viral tolerance. Several bat-borne infections, including Nipah virus and Ebola virus, have resulted in recent outbreaks of encephalitis. SUMMARY: Infectious causes of encephalitis continue to emerge worldwide, in part because of climate change and human impacts on the environment. Expansion of surveillance measures will be critical in rapid diagnosis and limiting of outbreaks in the future.","Venkatesan, Arun",Curr Opin Neurol,,361

Two studies were conducted separately in China during outbreak and the after peak stages, with 2540 participants were recruited from February 6 to 16, 2020, and 2543 participants were recruited from April 25 to May 5, 2020. The network models were created to explore the relationship between psychopathology symptoms both within and across anxiety and depression, with anxiety measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and depression measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Symptom network analysis was conducted to evaluate network and bridge centrality, and the network properties were compared between the outbreak and after peak. Noticeably, psychomotor symptoms such as impaired motor skills, restlessness, and inability to relax exhibited high centrality during the outbreak, which still relatively high but showed substantial remission during after peak stage (in terms of strength, betweenness, or bridge centrality). Meanwhile, symptoms of irritability (strength, betweenness, or bridge centrality) and loss of energy (bridge centrality) played an important role in the network after the peak of the pandemic. This study provides novel insights into the changes in central features during the different COVID-19 stages and highlights motor-related symptoms as bridge symptoms, which could activate the connection between anxiety and depression. The results revealed that restrictions on movement were associated with worsen in psychomotor symptoms, indicating that future psychological interventions should target motor-related symptoms as priority.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Hu, Zhishan; Feng, Yi; Wilson, Amanda; Chen, Runsen",Mol. psychiatry,,361

Patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment (e.g., bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, monoclonal antibodies, and paclitaxel therapy) are vulnerable to the development of respiratory syndromes induced by chemotherapeutic agents and are also more susceptible to viral infections as they are immunosuppressed. Neutropenia is an important risk factor for increased vulnerability to infections, as a respiratory syndrome involves an array of immune cells maintaining the balance between pathogen clearance and immunopathology. However, the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms in cancer patients is broad, with complications being related to the malignancy itself, treatment toxicity, and infections. The risk factors depend on the specific type of cancer, chemotherapy, patient characteristics, and comorbidities. Thus, this review discusses the main events implicated in immunosuppression caused by chemotherapy and radiation therapy and the association of immunosuppression and other factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility in cancer patients; and, importantly, how to deal with this situation in face of the current pandemic scenario.","Corso, Claudia Rita; Mulinari Turin de Oliveira, Natalia; Maria-Ferreira, Daniele",J Infect Public Health,,361

This study aims to determine: 1) the trajectory in daily step counts before, during and after the lockdown in China, and 2) the characteristics associated with the trajectories. METHODS: From December 2019 to July 2020, smartphone-based step counts were continuously collected in 815 Chinese adults residing in Shanghai over 202 days across three phases: before, during, and after the lockdown. Participant characteristics were reported, and height, weight and body composition measured before the lockdown. A 'sharp' regression discontinuity design with cluster robust standard errors was used to test the effect of the lockdown and reopening on daily steps and a linear mixed model was used to examine the characteristics associated with trajectories during the observed period. RESULTS: Based on 164,630 person-days of data, we found a sharp decline in daily step counts upon the lockdown (24/01/2020) by an average of 3796 (SE = 88) steps, followed by a significant trend of increase by 34 steps/day (SE = 2.5; p < .001) until the end of the lockdown (22/03/2020). This increasing trend continued into the reopening phase at a slower rate of 5 steps per day (SE = 2.3; p = 0.029). Those who were older, married, university educated, insufficiently active, had an 'at risk' body composition, and those in the control group, were slower at recovering step counts during the lockdown, and those who were older, married, without university education and with an 'at risk' body composition recovered step counts at a slower pace after the reopening. CONCLUSIONS: Despite later increases in step counts, COVID-19 lockdown led to a sustained period of reduced physical activity, which may have adverse health implications. Governments and health professionals around the world should continue to encourage and facilitate physical activity during the pandemic.","Ding, Ding; Cheng, Minna; Del Pozo Cruz, Borja; Lin, Tao; Sun, Shuangyuan; Zhang, Li; Yang, Qinping; Ma, Zhicong; Wang, Jing; Jia, Yingnan; Shi, Yan",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,,361

322873,Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 crisis generated changes in consumer behavior related to food purchase and the management of food packaging. Due to the intensification of online purchases for home delivery, there has been an increase in the use of food packaging (mostly non-biodegradable or non-renewable). Moreover, the fear of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 through contact with materials and surfaces has led to an intensified disposal of food packaging, promoting a setback in waste management. Scope and approach: The purpose of this short commentary is to address the impacts of increased use and disposal of food packaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Technological solutions have been presented as tools to minimize the environmental impacts of the increased volume of disposed food packaging (namely, the development of biodegradable food packaging) as well as to minimize the occurrence of cross-contamination (namely, the incorporation of active antiviral components). Key findings and conclusions: The consumer behavior in the COVID-19 pandemic requires actions concerning adoption of bioplastics for single-use food packaging. Polylactide (PLA) stands out for high production viability, performance comparable to those of petroleum-based thermoplastics, and carbon neutral life cycle. Moreover, active components including organic compounds (resveratrol, luteolin, myricetin etc.) and metals (e.g., copper, zinc, silver) can mitigate cross-contamination. Therefore, there are opportunities to reduce food packaging-related environmental footprints while also decreasing the occurrence of surface-mediated cross-contamination.","Queiroz de Oliveira, Williara; Cordeiro de Azeredo, Henriette Monteiro; Neri-Numa, Iramaia Angélica; Pastore, Glaucia Maria",Trends in food science &amp; technology,,361

326427,COVID-19 nationwide lockdown and physical activity profiles among North-western Italian population using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ),2021,"Among candidate drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the combination of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) has received intense worldwide attention. Even as the efficacy of this combination is under evaluation, clinicians have begun to use it largely. As these medications are known to prolong the QT interval, we analyzed serial electrocardiograms recorded in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with HCQ + AZ. Fifty consecutive patients received the combination of HCQ (600 mg/d for 10 days) and AZ (500 mg/d on day 1 and 250 mg/d from day 2 to day 5). Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were recorded before treatment, at day 3, at day 5, and at discharge. The median age of patients was 68 years (interquartile range, 53-81 years); 28 (56%) were men. The main comorbidities were hypertension (36%; n=18) and diabetes (16%; n=8). The mean corrected QT (QTc) interval was 408 ms at baseline and increased up to 437 ms at day 3 and to 456 ms at day 5. Thirty-eight patients (76%) presented short-term modifications of the QTc duration (>30 ms). Treatment discontinuation was decided in 6 patients (12%), leading to QTc normalization in 5 of them. No deaths and no cardiac arrhythmic events were observed in this cohort. Our report confirms that a short duration treatment with HCQ + AZ modifies the QTc interval. The treatment had to be discontinued for QTc modifications in 12% of patients. Nevertheless, in inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19, we did not observe any clinically relevant consequences of these transitory modifications. In conclusion, when patients are treated with HCQ + AZ, cardiac monitoring should be regularly performed and hospital settings allow monitoring under in safe conditions.","Voisin, Olivier; Lorc039,; h, Erwan le; Mahé, Annabelle; Azria, Philippe; Borie, Marie-Françoise; Hubert, Sidonie; Ménage, Elodie; Guillerm, Jean-Christophe; Mourad, Jean-Jacques",Mayo Clin Proc,,361
327554,Hidden in plain sight: Addressing the unique needs of high-risk psychiatric populations during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Dealing with a COVID-19 lockdown may have negative effects on children, but at the same time might facilitate parent-child bonding. Perceived stress may influence the direction of these effects. Using a longitudinal twin design, we investigated how perceived stress influenced lockdown induced changes in wellbeing of parents and children. A total of 106 parents and 151 children (10-13-year-olds) filled in questionnaires during lockdown and data were combined with data of previous years. We report a significant increase in parental negative feelings (anxiety, depression, hostility and interpersonal sensitivity). Longitudinal child measures showed a gradual decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior, which seemed decelerated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in parental negative feelings and children's externalizing behavior were mediated by perceived stress: higher scores prior to the lockdown were related to more stress during the lockdown, which in turn was associated with an increase in parental negative feelings and children's' externalizing behavior. Perceived stress in parents and children was associated with negative coping strategies. Additionally, children's stress levels were influenced by prior and current parental overreactivity. These results suggest that children in families with negative coping strategies and (a history of) parental overreactivity might be at risk for negative consequences of the lockdown.","Achterberg, Michelle; Dobbelaar, Simone; Boer, Olga D; Crone, Eveline A",Sci Rep,,361
327616,Responding to the Psychological Needs of Health-Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study from the Medical College of Wisconsin,2021,"Patients with severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) typically require supplemental oxygen as an essential treatment. We developed a machine learning algorithm, based on a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous management of oxygen flow rate for critical ill patients under intensive care, which can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong potentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice. Basically, we modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their health outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient characteristics and health status, a reinforcement learning based oxygen control policy is learned and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to reduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods through cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1,372 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. The mean mortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than standard of care by 2.57% (95% CI: 2.08- 3.06) reduction (P&lt;0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care to 5.37 % under our algorithm and the averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is 1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) lower than the rate actually delivered to patients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive care treatment that can reduce mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce resources. It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Hua Zhu Jiahao Xie Wei Zhong Judy",,,361

In elderly individuals and those with comorbidities, COVID-19 is associated with high mortality, frequently caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. We examine in situ expression of SARS-CoV-2 in airways and lung obtained at autopsy of individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Seven autopsy cases (male, N = 5; female, N = 2) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a median age of 66 years (range, 50-77 years) were evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS Nucleocapsid protein in correlation with clinical parameters. The median time from symptom onset to death was 9 days (range, 6-31 days), from hospitalization 7 days (range, 1-21 days), from positive RT-PCR 7 days (range, 0-18 days), and from intensive care unit admission defining onset of respiratory failure 3 days (range, 1-18 days). Chest imaging identified diffuse airspace disease in all patients corresponding to acute and (N = 5) or organizing (N = 2) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histologic examination. Among five patients with acute-phase DAD (&#8804;7 days from onset of respiratory failure), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pulmonary pneumocytes and ciliated airway cells (N = 5), and in upper airway epithelium (N = 2). In two patients with organizing DAD (>14 days from onset of respiratory failure), no virus was detected in lungs or airways. No endothelial cell infection was observed. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 who developed respiratory failure can be detected during the acute phase of lung injury and is absent in the organizing phase.","Schaefer, Inga-Marie; Padera, Robert F; Solomon, Isaac H; Kanjilal, Sanjat; Hammer, Mark M; Hornick, Jason L; Sholl, Lynette M",Mod Pathol,,361

329019,"Mental health of individuals who are deaf during COVID-19: Depression, anxiety, aggression, and fear",2021,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on children's mental health. Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.","Malboeuf-Hurtubise, Catherine; Léger-Goodes, Terra; Mageau, Geneviève A; Joussemet, Mireille; Herba, Catherine; Chadi, Nicholas; Lefrançois, David; Camden, Chantal; Bussières, Ève-Line; Taylor, Geneviève; Éthier, Marc-André; Gagnon, Mathieu",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,361

As of 2019, only 3 countries remained to be polio endemic globally, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. The east and southern sub-region countries had shown progressive achievement towards polio eradication and to start with the African regional certification. The availability of sensitive AFP surveillance performance is among important strategies in the achievement of polio eradication. We, therefore, decided to conduct this assessment of AFP performance from 2012 to 2019 in the ESA sub-region have evidence documentation and support the certification process of the WHO AFRO region. Methods: we reviewed all reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases from 19 countries in the ESA sub region with the date of onset of paralysis from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The data were run to descriptive analysis based on the personal characteristics and AFP surveillance performance indicators parameters. Results: a total of 46,014 AFP cases were reported from 19 countries in the ESA countries who were paralyzed from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. The most affected age group was children aged 0 to 3 years old where 19,740 children with acute paralysis were reported representing 42.9% of the total reported AFP for the period. The overall assessment of the non-polio AFP rate, there is an increase from a rate of 2.7 in 2012 to 3.5 in 2019 per 100,000 population aged less than 15 years, reflects a significant change with a p-value of 0.040 (95% C.I. ranges from 0.035 to 1.564).

Conclusion: we observed an overall increase in the sensitivity of the AFP surveillance performance for the ESA sub-region countries from 2012 to 2019 using the national performance indicators. The COVID-19 pandemic paused an operational challenge for AFP surveillance performances from 2020. A further subnational surveillance performance analysis is suggested.","Manyanga, Daudi; Byabamazima, Charles; Masvikeni, Brine; Daniel, Fussum",Pan Afr Med J,,361

330344,COVID-19 Trend Estimation in the Elderly Italian Region of Sardinia,2020,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in retirement homes (also known as assisted living facilities) is largely unknown. We examined the association between home-and community-level characteristics and the risk of outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in retirement homes since the beginning of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of licensed retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, from Mar. 1 to Dec. 18, 2020. Our primary outcome was an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection (&#8805; 1 resident or staff case confirmed by validated nucleic acid amplification assay). We used time-dependent proportional hazards methods to model the associations between retirement home- and community-level characteristics and outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Our cohort included all 770 licensed retirement homes in Ontario, which housed 56 491 residents. There were 273 (35.5%) retirement homes with 1 or more outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, involving 1944 (3.5%) residents and 1101 staff (3.0%). Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were distributed unevenly across retirement homes, with 2487 (81.7%) resident and staff cases occurring in 77 (10%) homes. The adjusted hazard of an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a retirement home was positively associated with homes that had a large resident capacity, were co-located with a long-term care facility, were part of larger chains, offered many services onsite, saw increases in regional incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and were located in a region with a higher community-level ethnic concentration. INTERPRETATION: Readily identifiable characteristics of retirement homes are independently associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and can support risk identification and priority for vaccination.","Costa, Andrew P; Manis, Derek R; Jones, Aaron; Stall, Nathan M; Brown, Kevin A; Boscart, Veronique; Castellino, Adriane; Heckman, George A; Hillmer, Michael P; Ma, Chloe; Pham, Paul; Rais, Saad; Sinha, Samir K; Poss, Jeffrey W",CMAJ,,361

330664,A longitudinal study on depressive symptoms and physical activity during the Spanish lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab (TCZ) has been used in the management of COVID-19-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Concerns exist regarding the risk of infections and drug-related toxicities. We sought to evaluate the incidence of these TCZ complications among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: All adult inpatients with COVID-19 between 1 March and 25 April 2020 that received TCZ were included. We compared the rate of late-onset infections (>48 hours following admission) to a control group matched according to intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation requirement. Post-TCZ toxicities evaluated included: elevated liver function tests (LFTs), GI perforation, diverticulitis, neutropenia, hypertension, allergic reactions, and infusion-related reactions. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included in each group. Seventeen infections in the TCZ group (23%) and 6 (8%) infections in the control group occurred >48 hours after admission (P = .013). Most infections were bacterial with pneumonia being the most common manifestation. Among patients receiving TCZ, LFT elevations were observed in 51%, neutropenia in 1.4%, and hypertension in 8%. The mortality rate among those that received TCZ was greater than the control (39% versus 23%, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Late onset infections were significantly more common among those receiving TCZ. Combining infections and TCZ-related toxicities, 61% of patients had a possible post-TCZ complication. While awaiting clinical trial results to establish the efficacy of TCZ for COVID-19 related CRS, the potential for infections and TCZ related toxicities should be carefully weighed when considering use.","Pettit, Natasha N; Nguyen, Cynthia T; Mutlu, Gökhan M; Wu, David; Kimmig, Lucas; Pitrak, David; Pursell, Kenneth",J. med. virol,,361

332441,The relationship between anxiety levels and anger expression styles of nurses during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is widely applied in foodborne pathogen detection and diagnosis. According to the cycles of threshold (Ct) values of qPCR testing, samples are judged as positive or negative. However, samples with Ct values in the gray zone are classified as ""possibly positive"" and required to be tested again. Repetitive qPCR may not eliminate the uncertain results but increase the workload of detection. CRISPR/Cas12a can specifically recognize the nucleic acid of the nM level and then indiscriminately slash the single-strand DNA with multiple turnovers. In this way, the detection signals can be greatly amplified. Here, we propose a CRISPR-based checking method to solve gray zone problems. After qPCR testing, the screening gray zone samples can be successfully checked by the CRISPR/Cas12a method. Furthermore, to conduct CRISPR reaction assay more conveniently and prevent possible aerosol contamination in the operational process, a gray zone checking cassette is designed. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the CRISPR-based checking method. Of 28 real swine blood samples, 6 ASFV qPCR gray zone samples are successfully checked. The CRISPR-based checking method provides a novel solution to eliminate gray zone sample problems with no additional effects on the PCR, which is operable and applicable in practical detection. The entire process can be completed within 10-15 min. This method will be a good supplementary and assistance for qPCR-based detection, especially in the diagnosis of diseases such as COVID-19.","Chen, Yanju; Wu, Shuyue; Wu, Hui; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Xiaofu; Qian, Siwenjie; Zhang, Mengyao; Xu, Junfeng; Ji, Feng; Wu, Jian",ACS Sens,,361

334616,Mental health of people living with dementia in care homes during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The response to the COVID-19 epidemic is generating severe shortages of personal protective equipment around the world. In particular, the supply of N95 respirator masks has become severely depleted, with supplies having to be rationed and health care workers having to use masks for prolonged periods in many countries. We sought to test the ability of 7 different decontamination methods: autoclave treatment, ethylene oxide gassing (ETO), low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (LT-HPGP) treatment, vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) exposure, peracetic acid dry fogging (PAF), ultraviolet C irradiation (UVCI) and moist heat (MH) treatment to decontaminate a variety of different N95 masks following experimental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or vesicular stomatitis virus as a surrogate. In addition, we sought to determine whether masks would tolerate repeated cycles of decontamination while maintaining structural and functional integrity. All methods except for UVCI were effective in total elimination of viable virus from treated masks. We found that all respirator masks tolerated at least one cycle of all treatment modalities without structural or functional deterioration as assessed by fit testing; filtration efficiency testing results were mostly similar except that a single cycle of LT-HPGP was associated with failures in 3 of 6 masks assessed. VHP, PAF, UVCI, and MH were associated with preserved mask integrity to a minimum of 10 cycles by both fit and filtration testing. A similar result was shown with ethylene oxide gassing to the maximum 3 cycles tested. Pleated, layered non-woven fabric N95 masks retained integrity in fit testing for at least 10 cycles of autoclaving but the molded N95 masks failed after 1 cycle; filtration testing however was intact to 5 cycles for all masks. The successful application of autoclaving for layered, pleated masks may be of particular use to institutions globally due to the virtually universal accessibility of autoclaves in health care settings. Given the ability to modify widely available heating cabinets on hospital wards in well-resourced settings, the application of moist heat may allow local processing of N95 masks.","Kumar, Anand; Kasloff, Samantha B; Leung, Anders; Cutts, Todd; Strong, James E; Hills, Kevin; Gu, Frank X; Chen, Paul; Vazquez-Grande, Gloria; Rush, Barret; Lother, Sylvain; Malo, Kimberly; Zarychanski, Ryan; Krishnan, Jay",PLoS One,,361

However, low adoption rates is a major issue that prevents these apps from achieving their full potential. In this paper, we present a national-scale survey experiment (N=1963) in the U.S. to investigate the effects of app design choices and individual differences on COVID-19 contact-tracing app adoption intentions. We found that individual differences such as prosocialness, COVID-19 risk perceptions, general privacy concerns, technology readiness, and demographic factors played a more important role than app design choices such as decentralized design vs. centralized design, location use, app providers, and the presentation of security risks. Certain app designs could exacerbate the different preferences in different sub-populations which may lead to an inequality of acceptance to certain app design choices (e.g., developed by state health authorities vs. a large tech company) among different groups of people (e.g., people living in rural areas vs. people living in urban areas). Our mediation analysis showed that one’s perception of the public health benefits offered by the app and the adoption willingness of other people had a larger effect in explaining the observed effects of app design choices and individual differences than one’s perception of the app’s security and privacy risks. With these findings, we discuss practical implications on the design, marketing, and deployment of COVID-19 contact-tracing apps in the U.S.","Li, Tianshi Cobb Camille Yang Jackie Baviskar Sagar Agarwal Yuvraj Li Beibei Bauer Lujo Hong Jason I.",Pervasive and Mobile Computing,,361

337800,Anxiety and facial self-contacts: possible impact on COVID-19 transmission in dental practice,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 commenced in Wuhan China in 2019 and soon spread worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to the ACE II receptor and begins viral replication. The effects and clinical findings of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver, kidney, heart, gastrointestinal (GI) system and especially lungs have been widely discussed. However, the effects on the pancreas-another organ that also expresses ACE II-have not been studied. METHODS: This work prospectively evaluated data from 316 patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients were categorized into three according to the severity of pneumonia (mild, severe, critical). Demographic data, rate of pancreatitis, biochemical parameters, and radiological images from each group were analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups and outcomes were compared: COVID-19 patients with acute pancreatitis (Group P) and without acute pancreatitis (Group C). RESULTS: The median age was 54 (18-87), and the median age for patients with acute pancreatitis was 55 (26-84). As an expected finding, we found a positive correlation between advanced age and mortality (p = 0.0003). 12.6% of the patients had acute pancreatitis. While pancreatitis was not seen in patients on mild status, the rate of pancreatitis was 32.5% in critical patients. Hospitalization and mortality rates were higher in patients with COVID-19 accompanied by acute pancreatitis (p = 0.0038 and p < 0.0001, respectively). C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and ferritin were significantly higher in those who had pancreatitis (p < 0.0001). D-Dimer and procalcitonin levels had only a small difference (p = 0.1127 and p = 0.3403, respectively). CONCLUSION: Acute pancreatitis alone is a clinical condition that can lead to mortality and may be one of the reasons for the exaggerated immune response developing in the progression of COVID-19. Our results point out that the presence of pancreatic damage triggered by SARS-CoV-2 can deteriorate the clinical condition of patients and the mortality rate may increase in these patients.","Akarsu, Cevher; Karabulut, Mehmet; Aydin, Husnu; Sahbaz, Nuri Alper; Dural, Ahmet Cem; Yegul, Duygu; Peker, Kivanc Derya; Ferahman, Sina; Bulut, Sezer; Dönmez, Turgut; Asar, Sinan; Yasar, Kadriye Kart; Adas, Gokhan Tolga",J Invest Surg,,361

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2435 employees from the enterprises located in Deqing (low-risk epidemic area) and Taizhou (high-risk epidemic area) of East China in March 2020. An online questionnaire covered information on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as knowledge, attitude, behavior and experience about COVID-19. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were applied to assess depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression model was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for depression and anxiety symptoms associated with risk factors. RESULTS: The participants were aged 36.3 ± 9.2 years on average, and nearly half of them were female. Overall, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and both were 19.4%, 12.3% and 9.8%, and decreased with age. After adjustment for covariates, 16 or more years of education, being a white-collar worker or working in the high-risk epidemic area were significantly associated with increased risks of both depression and anxiety, in contract regular physical exercise was associated with decreased risks of both mental disorders. CONCLUSION: The depression and anxiety problems were prevalent among returning workers during the COVID-19 period. Targeted psychological interventions should be developed and implemented to improve their mental health.","Yang, Shuyue; Lin, Haijiang; Zhu, Jianfu; Chen, Yue; Wang, Na; Zhao, Qi; Fu, Chaowei",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,,361
339200,Job Insecurity and Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among U.S. Young Adults During COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected public health and wellbeing. In response to the pandemic threat of the coronavirus epidemic, several countries, including China, adopted lockdown and quarantine policies, which may cause psychological distress. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China as well as the corresponding risk factors and protective factors. METHODS: We examined the immediate (2-week) and delayed (2-month) impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine on psychological distress in a national sample of 1390 Chinese residents. RESULTS: No immediate impact of province-wide lockdown on psychological distress was observed, whereas personal quarantine increased individuals' anxiety, fear, and anger. Despite the lack of initial association, psychological distress increased among those in province-wide lockdown. Self-stigma and personal control both significantly moderated the association between lockdown and psychological distress, but in different directions. Those with higher self-stigma and lower personal control were more impacted by the lockdown. Government support moderated the impact of quarantine on psychological distress, but not that of lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The delayed effects of lockdown and quarantine on psychological distress were observed, and self-stigma, social support, and perceived control moderate the relationships. This study is the first to demonstrate the psychological costs of province-wide lockdowns on individuals' mental health, providing evidence of the need for mitigation strategies and timely public mental health preparedness in countries with recent outbreaks of COVID-19.","Gan, Yiqun; Ma, Jinjin; Wu, Jianhui; Chen, Yidi; Zhu, Huanya; Hall, Brian J",Psychol Med,,361

340795,Acceptability of App-Based Contact Tracing for COVID-19: Cross-Country Survey Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Major infectious disease outbreaks are a constant threat to human health. Clinical research responses to outbreaks generate evidence to improve outcomes and outbreak control. Experiences from previous epidemics have identified multiple challenges to undertaking timely clinical research responses. This scoping review is a systematic appraisal of political, economic, administrative, regulatory, logistical, ethical and social (PEARLES) challenges to clinical research responses to emergency epidemics and solutions identified to address these. METHODS: A scoping review. We searched six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, PsycINFO, Scopus and Epistemonikos) for articles published from 2008 to July 2018. We included publications reporting PEARLES challenges to clinical research responses to emerging epidemics and pandemics and solutions identified to address these. Two reviewers screened articles for inclusion, extracted and analysed the data. RESULTS: Of 2678 articles screened, 76 were included. Most presented data relating to the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak or the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The articles related to clinical research responses in Africa (n = 37), Europe (n = 8), North America (n = 5), Latin America and the Caribbean (n = 3) and Asia (n = 1) and/or globally (n = 22). A wide range of solutions to PEARLES challenges was presented, including a need to strengthen global collaborations and coordination at all levels and develop pre-approved protocols and equitable frameworks, protocols and standards for emergencies. Clinical trial networks and expedited funding and approvals were some solutions implemented. National ownership and community engagement from the outset were a key enabler for delivery. Despite the wide range of recommended solutions, none had been formally evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: To strengthen global preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics, identified solutions for rapid clinical research deployment, delivery, and dissemination must be implemented. Improvements are urgently needed to strengthen collaborations, funding mechanisms, global and national research capacity and capability, targeting regions vulnerable to epidemics and pandemics. Solutions need to be flexible to allow timely adaptations to context, and research led by governments of affected regions. Research communities globally need to evaluate their activities and incorporate lessons learnt to refine and rehearse collaborative outbreak response plans in between epidemics.","Sigfrid, Louise; Maskell, Katherine; Bannister, Peter G; Ismail, Sharif A; Collinson, Shelui; Regmi, Sadie; Blackmore, Claire; Harriss, Eli; Longuere, Kajsa-Stina; Gobat, Nina; Horby, Peter; Clarke, Mike; Carson, Gail",BMC Med,,361

341744,Impact of COVID-19 on the elderly,2020,"Introduction: Lockdowns implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are thought to impact mental health [1,2] Understanding the mechanisms underlying this impact is critical to mitigating it [3] We tested the hypothesis that one such mechanism involves impaired mood homeostasis (i e , failure to stabilize mood via mood-modifying activities) [4,5] Methods: In this ecological momentary assessment cohort study, students in the Netherlands reported their mood and activities 4 times a day between March 16 and 29, 2020 New and immediate lockdown measures were announced on March 23 The average change in mood an individual experienced when engaging in an activity was recorded as its pleasantness Mood homeostasis was defined as the extent to which participants preferentially engaged in pleasant activities at time t+1 when their mood was low at time t, thus stabilizing their mood Participants' history of mental illness was screened at baseline Using linear regressions we assessed (i) changes in mood homeostasis from before to during lockdown, (ii) their moderation by mental illness history, (iii) their association with changes in mood level, and (iv) their mediation by changes in range of activities undertaken How changes in mood homeostasis might impact the risk of depression was estimated using computer simulations Statistical significance was set at 2-sided P&lt; 05 Results: Seventy-eight students were included Mood homeostasis was significantly higher before than during lockdown (0 37 vs 0 28;95% CI of the difference [0 03,0 15];P= 003) For every 0 1 point drop in mood homeostasis, average mood decreased by 1 9 points (95% CI, [1 3,3 6], P&lt; 001) This is enough to bring someone's average mood from the population's mean to its bottom quartile The change in mood homeostasis from before to during lockdown was mediated by a reduction in the range of activities (proportion mediated: 11 9%, P&lt; 001) Mood homeostasis dropped significantly more among people with (vs without) a history of mental illness (P&lt; 001): from similar values before lockdown (0 31 vs 0 36;P= 37) to significantly different values during lockdown (0 13 vs 0 35;95% CI of the difference [0 11,0 33];P&lt; 001) In computer simulations, changes in mood homeostasis attributed to the lockdown led to a 3-fold increase in the the yearly incidence of depressed mood episodes: from 9 0% (95% CI [6 6%,11 4%]) before lockdown to 28 2% (95% CI [23 6%,32 6%]) during lockdown Conclusions: Mood homeostasis appears to decrease during lockdown Larger decreases correlate with larger decreases in mood level The impact was larger for students with a history of mental illness The lack of a control group (as the lockdown was implemented nationally) is the main limitation of our study However, since the same participants were monitored before and during lockdown, the lockdown itself seems to be the most likely explanation for the observed difference Identifying interventions that increase mood homeostasis might be a promising avenue to mitigate the impact of lockdowns on mental health Table 1 No conflict of interest","Taquet, M.; Quoidbach, J.; Fried, E.

342250,"New Apps Drive Health Care Innovation, Access to Care",2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly variable condition. Validated tools to assist in the early detection of patients at high risk of mortality can help guide medical decisions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate externally, as well as in patients from the second pandemic wave in Europe, our previously developed mortality prediction model for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Three validation cohorts were generated: 2 external with 185 and 730 patients from the first wave and 1 internal with 119 patients from the second wave. The probability of death was calculated for all subjects using our prediction model, which includes peripheral blood oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, and age. Discrimination and calibration were evaluated in the validation cohorts. The prediction model was updated by reestimating individual risk factor effects in the overall cohort (N = 1477). RESULTS: The mortality prediction model showed good performance in the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, and in the second wave validation cohort 3 (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.94, 0.86, and 0.86, respectively), with excellent calibration (calibration slope, 0.86, 0.94, and 0.79; intercept, 0.05, 0.03, and 0.10, respectively). The updated model accurately predicted mortality in the overall cohort (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.91), which included patients from both the first and second COVID-19 waves. The updated model was also useful to predict fatal outcome in patients without respiratory distress at the time of evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first COVID-19 mortality prediction model validated in patients from the first and second pandemic waves.

343338,COVID-19: Impacts and Implications for Pediatric Practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus infection that has quickly caused extensive burden to individual, families, countries, and the globe. No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an ""active"" comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or ""active placebo"") for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.

343462,"The interplay between anxiety, fear, protective behaviors, compassion, and resilience among older adults during a COVID-19 lockdown: a structural equation modeling study",2021,"RATIONALE: The identification of minimally invasive and easily-accessible biomarkers to support the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalized patients constitutes a hot topic in clinical research. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as clinical indicators to assist in medical decision-making. Here, we aimed to examine the circulating miRNA profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to evaluate its potential as a source of biomarkers for the management of the disease. METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicenter study which included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-May 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care (n = 47) and hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU (n = 37). An additional study considering ICU non-survivors (n=17) and survivors (n = 20) was performed. Expression profiling of 41 miRNAs was performed in plasma samples using RT-qPCR. The panel included miRNAs associated with: i) immune/inflammatory response;ii) lung damage;iii) respiratory viral infections;iv) myocardial damage;v) coagulation. Quality control was performed using spike-ins and hemolysis tests. Predictive models were constructed using a variable selection process based on LASSO regression. RESULTS: Ten circulating miRNAs were deregulated in ICU compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs that displayed an optimal discrimination ability to distinguish between ICU and ward patients (AUC = 0.88) (Figure 1A). Among ICU patients, six miRNAs were downregulated when comparing nonsurvivors to survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs was found to be a relevant predictor of mortality during ICU stay (AUC = 0.84) (Figure 1B). The discrimination potential of the miRNA signature was higher than the observed for clinical laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts (including neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and the neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio), CRP or D-dimer (maximum AUC for these variables = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 impacts on the circulating miRNA profile. The results suggest the potential usefulness of the circulating miRNA signature for the management of the disease over contemporaneous tests, at least in ICU patients.","Pinilla, L.; Benítez, I.; Carratalá, A.; Moncusí-Moix, A.; Gort-Paniello, C.; Molinero, M.; González, J.; Torres, G.; Bernal, M.; Pico, S.; Doncel, C.; Almansa, R.; Jorge, N.; Bustamante, E.; Gómez, J.; González-Rivera, M.; Micheloud, D.; Ryan, P.; Tamayo, L.; Aldecoa, C.; Ferrer, R.; Ceccato, A.; Fernández, L.; Motos, A.; Riera, J.; Menéndez, R.; García, D.; Peñuelas, Ó Torres A.; Bermejo-Martín, J.; Barbé, F.; De Gonzalo-Calvo, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,361

344885,The use of decision support for inpatient rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic: Responding to a rapidly evolving health care crisis,2021,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic first reached the United States, the case fatality rate has fallen precipitously. Several possible explanations have been floated, including greater detection of mild cases due to expanded testing, shifts in age distribution among the infected, lags between confirmed cases and reported deaths, improvements in treatment, mutations in the virus, and decreased viral load as a result of mask-wearing. Using both Florida line-level data and recently released (but incomplete) national line level data from April 1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths--each stratified by age--we unpack the drop in case fatality rate (CFR). Under the hypothesis that improvements in treatment efficacy should correspond to decreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), we find that improvements in the national data do not always match the story told by Florida data. In the national data, treatment improvements between the first wave and the second wave appear substantial, but modest when compared to the drop in aggregate CFR. By contrast, possibly due to constrained resources in a much larger second peak, Florida data suggests comparatively little difference between the first and second wave, with HFR slightly increasing in every age group. However, by November 1st, both Florida and national data suggest significant decreases in age-stratified HFR since April 1st. By accounting for several confounding factors, our analysis shows how age-stratified HFR can provide a more realistic picture of treatment improvements than CFR. One key limitation of our analysis is that the national line-level data remains incomplete and plagued by artifacts. Our analysis highlights the crucial role that this data can play but also the pressing need for public, complete, and high-quality age-stratified line-level data for both cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for all states.","Cheng, Cheng; Zhou, Helen; Weiss, Jeremy C.; Lipton, Zachary C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04825v2.pdf,361

It can be concluded that the impact of talent policies on economic vitality has a significant lag of about 1.8 years. Then the Nash equilibrium is used to optimize the model. Based on our model, we can draw the conclusion: In the short term, economic grows most dynamically when investment for talents accounts for 38% of the total resources. In the long term, the best time for the growth of economic vitality comes when investment for talents accounts for 52% of the total resources.

349184,Ethical Challenges in Health Care Policy during COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy,2020,"The key link between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and COVID-19 is ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which acts as a double-edged sword, because ACE2 increases the tissue anti-inflammatory response but it is also the entry receptor for the virus. There is an important controversy on several drugs that regulate RAS activity and possibly ACE2, and are widely used, particularly by patients most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. In the lung of healthy rats, we observed that candesartan (an angiotensin type-1, AT1, receptor blocker; ARB) and captopril (an ACE inhibitor; ACEI) up-regulated expression of tissue ACE2 and RAS anti-inflammatory axis receptors (AT2 and Mas receptors). This effect was particularly pronounced in rats with metabolic syndrome (obesity, increased blood pressure and hyperglycemia) and aged rats. Treatment of cultures of human type-II pneumocytes with candesartan or captopril induced up-regulation of ACE2 expression in cells. Treatment with viral spike protein induced a decrease in full-length (i.e. transmembrane) ACE2, an increase in levels of a short intracellular ACE2 polypeptide and an increase in ADAM17 activity in cells, together with an increase in levels of soluble ACE2 and major proinflammatory cytokines in the culture medium. Spike protein-induced changes and levels of spike protein internalization in cells were inhibited by pretreatment with the above-mentioned drugs. The results suggest that these drugs increase ACE2 levels and promote the anti-inflammatory RAS axis in the lung. Furthermore, possible up-regulation of viral entry by the drug-induced increase in expression of transmembrane ACE2 is counteracted by additional mechanisms, particularly by drug-induced inhibition of ADAM17 activity.","Pedrosa, Maria A; Valenzuela, Rita; Garrido-Gil, Pablo; Labandeira, Carmen M; Navarro, Gemma; Franco, Rafael; Labandeira-Garcia, Jose L; Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I",Clin Sci (Lond),,361

Another neurological examination noted a different pattern of weakness to the lower limbs, along with new urinary retention, and spinal arachnoiditis was identified. After more than 10 weeks in the hospital, the patient was discharged. Throughout this case, there were multiple handovers between teams and specialties, all of which were underpinned by good communication and examination to achieve the best care.","Hurn, Eliot; Dickinson, Lauren; Abraham, Jijie Annie",BMJ case reports,,361

As the disease spreads around the globe, it has evolved into a world-wide pandemic, endangering the state of global public health and becoming a serious threat to the global community. To combat and prevent the spread of the disease, all individuals should be well-informed of the rapidly changing state of COVID-19. In the endeavor of accomplishing this objective, a COVID-19 real-time analytical tracker has been built to provide the latest status of the disease and relevant analytical insights. The real-time tracker is designed to cater to the general audience without advanced statistical aptitude. It aims to communicate insights through various straightforward and concise data visualizations that are supported by sound statistical foundations and reliable data sources. This paper aims to discuss the major methodologies which are utilized to generate the insights displayed on the real-time tracker, which include real-time data retrieval, normalization techniques, ARIMA time-series forecasting, and logistic regression models. In addition to introducing the details and motivations of the utilized methodologies, the paper additionally features some key discoveries that have been derived in regard to COVID-19 using the methodologies.","Long, Jiawei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03146v1.pdf,361

356567,Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes in a cohort of early psychosis patients,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the characteristics and predictors of death in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Spain. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed of the first consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time PCR assay in 127 Spanish centres until 17 March 2020. The follow-up censoring date was 17 April 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and complications data. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death. RESULTS: Of the 4035 patients, male subjects accounted for 2433 (61.0%) of 3987, the median age was 70 years and 2539 (73.8%) of 3439 had one or more comorbidity. The most common symptoms were a history of fever, cough, malaise and dyspnoea. During hospitalization, 1255 (31.5%) of 3979 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 736 (18.5%) of 3988 were admitted to intensive care units and 619 (15.5%) of 3992 underwent mechanical ventilation. Virus- or host-targeted medications included lopinavir/ritonavir (2820/4005, 70.4%), hydroxychloroquine (2618/3995, 65.5%), interferon beta (1153/3950, 29.2%), corticosteroids (1109/3965, 28.0%) and tocilizumab (373/3951, 9.4%). Overall, 1131 (28%) of 4035 patients died. Mortality increased with age (85.6% occurring in older than 65 years). Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them including advanced age, liver cirrhosis, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of C-reactive protein and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide comprehensive information about characteristics and complications of severe COVID-19, and may help clinicians identify patients at a higher risk of death.","Berenguer, Juan; Ryan, Pablo; Rodríguez-Baño, Jesús; Jarrín, Inmaculada; Carratalà, Jordi; Pachón, Jerónimo; Yllescas, María; Arriba, José Ramón",Clin. microbiol. infect,,361

By focusing directly on masculinity as a social process, this analysis contributes to the broader literature on gender and leadership, unpacking the gendered double bind that leaders who identify as men must navigate in acknowledging and responding to risks. I examine the responses of Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump suggesting that their respective struggles to acknowledge and respond to the public health threat were not simply the result of a lack of available information to inform rational policy decisions. Acknowledging risk and taking measures to prevent rather than ‘fight’ are not culturally neutral, they are coded as feminine and ‘weak’. Clearly, the delay in the response and subsequent spread of the virus in North America was not inevitable, other jurisdictions were able to respond more quickly. The masculinity double bind may have been one of the factors that undermined a prompt response in the increasingly macho context of North America.","Thomson, Kelly",Health Soc. Rev.,,361

While severe acute disease has been linked to an expansion of antibody-secreting plasmablasts, we sought to identify B cell responses that correlated with positive clinical outcomes in convalescent patients. We characterized the peripheral blood B cell immunophenotype and plasma antibody responses in 40 recovered non-hospitalized COVID-19 subjects that were enrolled as donors in a convalescent plasma treatment study. We observed a significant negative correlation between the frequency of peripheral blood memory B cells and the duration of symptoms for convalescent subjects. Memory B cell subsets in convalescent subjects were composed of classical CD24+ class-switched memory B cells, but also activated CD24-negative and natural unswitched CD27+ IgD+ IgM+ subsets. Memory B cell frequency was significantly correlated with both IgG1 and IgM responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in most seropositive subjects. IgM+ memory, but not switched memory, directly correlated with virus-specific antibody responses, and remained stable over 3 months. Our findings suggest that the frequency of memory B cells is a critical indicator of disease resolution, and that IgM+ memory B cells may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 immunity.","Newell, Krista L; Clemmer, Deanna C; Cox, Justin B; Kayode, Yetunde I; Zoccoli-Rodriguez, Victoria; Taylor, Harry E; Endy, Timothy P; Wilmore, Joel R; Winslow, Gary M",PLoS One,,361

METHODS: This is an international multicenter observational study in 20 US and European hospitals. Patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test and had an LUS examination. We identified three clinical phenotypes based on pre-existing chronic diseases (mixed phenotype), and on the presence (severe phenotype) or absence (mild phenotype) of signs and/or symptoms of respiratory failure at presentation. We defined the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia according to four different patterns: high (HighLUS), intermediate (IntLUS), alternative (AltLUS), and low (LowLUS) probability. The combination of patterns and phenotypes with RT-PCR results was described and analyzed. RESULTS: We studied 1462 patients, classified in mild (n = 400), severe (n = 727), and mixed (n = 335) phenotypes. HighLUS and IntLUS showed an overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 88.23-91.97%) in identifying patients with positive RT-PCR, with higher values in the mixed (94.7%) and severe phenotype (97.1%), and even higher in those patients with objective respiratory failure (99.3%). The HighLUS showed a specificity of 88.8% (CI 85.55-91.65%) that was higher in the mild phenotype (94.4%; CI 90.0-97.0%). At multivariate analysis, the HighLUS was a strong independent predictor of RT-PCR positivity (odds ratio 4.2, confidence interval 2.6-6.7, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Combining LUS patterns of probability with clinical phenotypes at presentation can rapidly identify those patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia at bedside. This approach could support and expedite patients' management during a pandemic surge.","Volpicelli, Giovanni; Gargani, Luna; Perlini, Stefano; Spinelli, Stefano; Barbieri, Greta; Lanotte, Antonella; Casasola, Gonzalo García; Nogué-Bou, Ramon; Lamorte, Alessandro; Agricola, Eustachio; Villén, Tomas; Deol, Paramjeet Singh; Nazerian, Peiman; Corradi, Francesco; Stefanone, Valerio; Fraga, Denise Nicole; Navalesi, Paolo; Ferre, Robinson; Boero, Enrico; Martinelli, Giampaolo; Cristoni, Lorenzo; Perani, Cristiano; Vetrugno, Luigi; McDermott, Cian; Miralles-Aguiar, Francisco; Secco, Gianmarco; Zattera, Caterina; Salinaro, Francesco; Grignaschi, Alice; Boccatonda, Andrea; Giostra, Fabrizio; Infante, Marta Nogué; Covella, Michele; Ingallina, Giacomo; Burkert, Julia; Frumento, Paolo; Forfori, Francesco; Ghiadoni, Lorenzo",Intensive Care Med,,361

Each country was affected but with a varying number of infected cases and mortality rates. Africa was hit late by the pandemic but the number of cases rose sharply. In this study, we investigated 224 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) in the early part of the outbreak, of which 69 were from Africa. We analyzed a total of 550 mutations by comparing them with the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan. We classified the mutations observed based on country and region, and afterwards analyzed common and unique mutations on the African continent as a whole. Correlation analyses showed that the duo variants ORF1ab/RdRp 4715L and S protein 614G variants, which are strongly linked to fatality rate, were not significantly and positively correlated with fatality rates (r = -0.03757, P = 0.5331 and r = -0.2876, P = 0.6389, respectively), although increased number of cases correlated with number of deaths (r = 0.997, P = 0.0002). Furthermore, most cases in Africa were mainly imported from American and European countries, except one isolate with no mutation and was similar to the original isolate from Wuhan. Moreover, unique mutations specific to countries were identified in the early phase of the outbreak but these mutations were not regional-specific. There were common mutations in all isolates across the continent as well as similar isolate-specific mutations in different regions. Our findings suggest that mutation is rapid in SARS-CoV-2 in Africa and although these mutations spread across the continent, the duo variants could not possibly be the sole cause of COVID-19 deaths in Africa in the early phase of the outbreak.","Lamptey, Jones; Oyelami, Favour Oluwapelumi; Owusu, Michael; Nkrumah, Bernard; Idowu, Paul Oluwagbenga; Adu-Gyamfi, Enoch Appiah; Czika, Armin; El-Duah, Philip; Yeboah, Richmond; Sylverken, Augustina; Olasunkanmi, Oluwatayo Israel; Owusu-Dabo, Ellis; Drosten, Christian; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,361

We aim to evaluate neurosurgical practice patterns as well as perioperative incidence of COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients and their outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of neurosurgical and neurointerventional cases at two tertiary centers during the first three months of the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic (March 8-June 8) as well as following three months (post-peak pandemic; June 9-September 9) was performed. Baseline characteristics, perioperative COVID-19 test results, modified Medically Necessary Time Sensitive (mMeNTS) score, and outcome measures were compared between COVID-19 positive and negative patients through bivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: 652 neurosurgical and 217 neurointerventional cases were performed during post-peak pandemic period. Cervical spine, lumbar spine, functional/pain, cranioplasty, and cerebral angiogram cases were significantly increased in the post-pandemic period. There was a 2.9% (35/1,197) positivity rate for COVID-19 testing overall and 3.6% (13/363) positivity rate postoperatively. Age, mMeNTS score, complications, length of stay, case acuity, ASA status, length of stay, and disposition were significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients. CONCLUSION: A significant increase in elective case volume during the post-peak pandemic period is feasible with low and acceptable incidence of COVID-19 in neurosurgical patients. COVID-19 positive patients were younger, less likely to undergo elective procedures, had increased length of stay, had more complications, and were discharged to a location other than home. The mMeNTS score plays a role in decision making for scheduling elective cases.","Sarpong, Kwadwo; Dowlati, Ehsan; Withington, Charles; Chesney, Kelsi; Mualem, William; Hay, Kathryn; Zhou, Tianzan; Black, Jordan; Shashaty, Matthew; Kalhorn, Christopher G; Nair, Mani N; Felbaum, Daniel R",World neurosurgery (Online),,361

METHODS: Sequential Ct data from COVID-19 nasal pharyngeal (NP) RT-PCR testing in all COVID-19 positive HCWs at a single institution. Analysis of Ct in relation to time until negative testing for RTW clearance. RESULTS: Data for 12 employees showed that time elapsed until RT-PCR test-based RTW clearance ranged from 7 to 57 days (median, 34.5 days). Lower initial Ct correlated with the total time elapsed until clearance (râ=â-0.80; Pâ=â0.002). CONCLUSION: Considering the RT-PCR Ct, which correlates with the estimated viral load, may help inform RTW planning and decision making beyond solely relying on dichotomized positive/negative results.","Domeracki, Sandra; Clapp, Robert N; Taylor, Kristopher; Lu, Chuanyi M; Lampiris, Harry; Blanc, Paul D",J Occup Environ Med,,361

An on-line survey was developed following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet e-Surveys (CHERRIES) guidelines and using the online survey software program, Qualtrics® XM, platform. Pilot testing of the survey was conducted for usability and functionality. The final 24-item survey was distributed via email and social media. A total of 338 adults responded to the survey, with 68.8% indicating that they participated in mind-body activities since the start of the pandemic. Physical activity was the most frequently (61.5%, n = 227) used mind-body practice. Further, 2 of the common barriers to engaging in mind-body practices were lack of motivation and wandering mind. Frequently listed reasons for using mind-body practices were to promote health, reduce stress and relaxation. Respondents believed that mind-body practices resulted in less stress. These findings may be applicable for reducing psychological stress related to the pandemic, as the pandemic continues to impact many areas of the United States.","Hellem, Tracy; Benavides-Vaello, Sandra; Taylor-Piliae, Ruth",J Evid Based Integr Med,,361
368932,[the Psychological Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health - Literature Review],2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic in Wales and the UK has highlighted significant and historic inequalities in health between social groups. To better understand the composition of these inequalities and inform planning after the pandemic, we undertook a decomposition of life expectancy inequalities between the most and least deprived quintiles for men and women by age and cause of death and explored trends between 2002 and 2018. STUDY DESIGN: Statistical decomposition of life expectancy inequalities by age and cause of death using routine population mortality datasets. METHODS: We used routine statistics from the Office for National Statistics for the period 2002-2018 on population and deaths in Wales stratified by age, gender, Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) 2019 quintile and cause of death, categorised by International Classification of Disease, version 10, code into 15 categories of public health relevance. We aggregated data to 3-year rolling figures to account for low numbers of events in some groups annually. Next, we estimated life expectancy at birth by quintile, gender and period using life table methods. Lastly, we performed a decomposition analysis using the Arriaga method to identify the specific disease categories and ages at which excess deaths occur in more disadvantaged areas to highlight potential areas for action. RESULTS: Life expectancy inequalities between the most and least WIMD quintiles rose for both genders between 2002 and 2018: from 4.69 to 6.02 years for women (an increase of 1.33 years) and from 6.34 to 7.42 years for men (an increase of 1.08 years). Exploratory analysis of these trends suggested that the following were most influential for women: respiratory disease (1.50 years), cancers (1.36 years), circulatory disease (1.35 years) and digestive disease (0.51 years). For men, the gap was driven by circulatory disease (2.01 years), cancers (1.39 years), respiratory disease (1.25 years), digestive disease (0.79 years), drug- and alcohol-related conditions (0.54 years) and external causes (0.54 years). Contributions for women from respiratory disease, cancers, dementia and drug- and alcohol-related conditions appeared to be increasing, while among men, there were rising contributions from respiratory, digestive and circulatory disease. CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy inequalities in Wales remain wide and have been increasing, particularly among women, with indications of worsening trends since 2010 following the introduction of fiscal austerity. As agencies recover from the pandemic, these findings should be considered alongside any resumption of services in Wales or future health and public policy.","Currie, J; Boyce, T; Evans, L; Luker, M; Senior, S; Hartt, M; Cottrell, S; Lester, N; Huws, D; Humphreys, C; Little, K; Adekanmbi, V; Paranjothy, S",Public Health,,361

People have little information about SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus). Internet has become a frequently used tool to obtain information in recent years, while YouTube is one of the popular sources of information with many videos on its platform. This study aims to identify the topics regarding Coronavirus that people learned about on YouTube. The videos about Coronavirus were also evaluated in terms of the reliability of their source of information. METHODS: In total, 160 videos on Coronavirus that had 500,000 or more views were analysed. The latent Dirichlet allocation method was used in the process of identifying the topics that were then compared in terms of video parameters. The reliability of the source of information provided by videos was assessed with a modified DISCERN tool. RESULTS: A proportion of 15.6 % of these videos had a scientific content, while 45 % of these videos were about the process entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of video reliability, the difference between video types was found to be significant; videos with scientific content had more reliable sources of information (p<0.001).

Methods Six COVID-19 patients with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were enrolled from the Seventh People's Hospital of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from Jan. 1 to Feb. 22, 2020. The epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, imaging data and laboratory indicators were retrospectively analyzed. Results All six patients had a clear travel or residence history in Wuhan. Four patients had fever, three had cough, two had upper respiratory tract symptoms such as runny nose and sore throat, and two had systemic symptoms such as headache and muscle ache. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed that all the six patients had abnormal manifestations in bilateral lungs, and the lower lung lesions were more common than the upper lung lesions. The main manifestations were multiple ground-glass opacities, consolidation shadows, crazy paving sign and different degrees of fibrosis in lateral field of bilateral lungs. Chest CT examination later after onset showed lung consolidation and severe fibrosis. Conclusion The imaging of COVID-19 has special characteristics. Combined with the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, COVID-19 can be effectively diagnosed in the early stage.","Xia-Hui, Ge; Jing, Xu; Ming-Hao, Ha; Li-Wei, Zhang; Li-Tao, Song; Jie-Ning, Wang; Yan, Lin; Xiao-Yan, Gao; Chong, Bai",Acad.

CO-RADS categorization of the level of COVID-19 suspicion might improve diagnostic performance.PurposeTo investigate the value of chest CT with CO-RADS classification to screen for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and to determine its diagnostic performance in individuals with COVID-19 symptoms during the exponential phase of viral spread.Materials and MethodsIn this secondary analysis of a prospective trial (Clinical Trial Number: IRB B1172020000008), from March 2020 to April 2020, we performed parallel SARS-CoV-2 PCR and CT with categorization of COVID-19 suspicion by CO-RADS, for individuals with COVID-19 symptoms and controls without COVID-19 symptoms admitted to the hospital for medical urgencies unrelated to COVID-19. CT-CORADS was categorized on a 5-point scale from 1 (very low suspicion) to 5 (very high suspicion). AUC were calculated in symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals to predict positive SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and likelihood ratios for each CO-RADS score were used for rational selection of diagnostic thresholds.Results859 individuals (median 70 years, IQR 52-81, 443 men) with COVID-19 symptoms and 1138 controls (median 68 years, IQR 52-81, 588 men) were evaluated. CT-CORADS had good diagnostic performance (P<.001) in both symptomatic (AUC=.89) and asymptomatic (AUC=.70) individuals. In symptomatic individuals (41.7% PCR+), CO-RADS &#8805; 3 detected positive PCR with high sensitivity (89%, 319/358) and 73% specificity. In asymptomatic individuals (5.3% PCR+), a CO-RADS score &#8805; 3 detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with low sensitivity (45%, 27/60) but high specificity (89%).ConclusionCT-CORADS had good diagnostic performance in symptomatic individuals, supporting its application for triage. Sensitivity in asymptomatic individuals was insufficient to justify its use as first-line screening approach. Incidental detection of CO-RADS &#8805; 3 in asymptomatic individuals should trigger testing for respiratory pathogens.","De Smet, Kristof; De Smet, Dieter; Ryckaert, Thomas; Laridon, Emanuel; Heremans, Birgit; Vandenbulcke, Ruben; Demedts, Ingel; Bouckaert, Bernard; Gryspeerdt, Stefaan; Martens, Geert A",Radiology,,361

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing the number and characteristics of emergency psychiatric consultations during post-lockdown with respect to the lockdown period. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, referred symptoms, diagnosis, information on multiple psychiatric consultations and hospitalisation were collected. RESULTS: A rise of almost 60% in emergency psychiatric consultations during the post-lockdown compared to the lockdown period was observed. Emergency psychiatric consultations in the post-lockdown period were associated with lower rates of cannabis (aOR = 0.42, p = 0.011) and cocaine use (aOR = 0.39, p = 0.011). Despite a lower occurrence of two or more psychiatric consultations was observed during post-lockdown phase (aOR = 0.44, p = 0.008), subjects who had anxiety disorders (aOR = 3.91, p = 0.000) and substance intoxication or withdrawal (aOR = 6.89, p = 0.000) were more likely to present to emergency psychiatric consultations during post-lockdown period compared to the lockdown one. CONCLUSIONS: Substance intoxication or withdrawal and anxiety disorders increased after the COVID-19 lockdown.

376868,Mental Health and COVID-19: The Psychological Implications of a Pandemic for Nurses,2021,"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the scarcity of resources has necessitated triage of critical care for patients with the disease. In patients aged 65 years and older, triage decisions are regularly based on degree of frailty measured by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). However, the CFS could also be useful in patients younger than 65 years. We aimed to examine the association between CFS score and hospital mortality and between CFS score and admission to intensive care in adult patients of all ages with COVID-19 across Europe. Methods: This analysis was part of the COVID Medication (COMET) study, an international, multicentre, retrospective observational cohort study in 63 hospitals in 11 countries in Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older, had been admitted to hospital, and either tested positive by PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or were judged to have a high clinical likelihood of having SARS-CoV-2 infection by the local COVID-19 expert team. CFS was used to assess level of frailty: fit (CFS1-3), mildly frail (CFS4-5), or frail (CFS6-9). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was admission to intensive care. Data were analysed using a multivariable binary logistic regression model adjusted for covariates (age, sex, number of drugs prescribed, and type of drug class as a proxy for comorbidities). Findings: Between March 30 and July 15, 2020, 2434 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 55-77]; 1480 [61%] men, 954 [30%] women) had CFS scores available and were included in the analyses. In the total sample and in patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients and mildly frail patients had a significantly higher risk of hospital mortality than fit patients (total sample: CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 odds ratio [OR] 2·71 [95% CI 2·04-3·60], p<0·0001 and CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·54 [1·16-2·06], p=0·0030; age &#8805;65 years: CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 2·90 [2·12-3·97], p<0·0001 and CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·64 [1·20-2·25], p=0·0020). In patients younger than 65 years, an increased hospital mortality risk was only observed in frail patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 2·22 [1·08-4·57], p=0·030; CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·08 [0·48-2·39], p=0·86). Frail patients had a higher incidence of admission to intensive care than fit patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·54 [1·21-1·97], p=0·0010), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 0·71 [0·55-0·92], p=0·0090). Among patients younger than 65 years, frail patients had an increased incidence of admission to intensive care (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 2·96 [1·98-4·43], p<0·0001), whereas mildly frail patients had no significant difference in incidence compared with fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 0·93 [0·63-1·38], p=0·72). Among patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients had no significant difference in the incidence of admission to intensive care compared with fit patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·27 [0·92-1·75], p=0·14), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 0·66 [0·47-0·93], p=0·018). Interpretation: The results of this study suggest that CFS score is a suitable risk marker for hospital mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. However, treatment decisions based on the CFS in patients younger than 65 years should be made with caution.

The present study aims to explore various modes of education used by educational institutions across the world and provide a holistic understanding of different measures taken by governments and universities to endure the crippling crisis. The radical shift to digital pedagogy followed by online assessments and examinations brought new experiences to both educators and learners. This paper elucidates the extraordinary challenges encountered by various stakeholders in making the required shift to digital learning and the substantial attempts made by educational institutions to minimize learning losses. The paper also presents various opportunities induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the need to develop appropriate mechanisms to deal with such an unforeseen crisis in future. To this effect, some recommendations have been made that may enable educational institutions to eliminate adversities and maintain academic integrity in tempestuous times.","Babbar, Mansi Gupta Tushita",Policy Futures in Education,,361
377011,"Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic period on depression, anxiety and stress levels of the healthcare employees in Turkey",2020,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role in inflammation, which is attributable at least, in part, to the conversion of the pro-inflammatory angiotensin (Ang) II peptide into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), a peptide which opposes the actions of AngII. ACE2 and AngII are present in many tissues but information on the cornea is lacking. We observed that mice deficient in the Ace2 gene (Ace2-/- ), developed a cloudy cornea phenotype as they aged. Haze occupied the central cornea, accompanied by corneal edema and neovascularization. In severe cases with marked chronic inflammation, a cell-fate switch from a transparent corneal epithelium to a keratinized, stratified squamous, psoriasiform-like epidermis was observed. The stroma contained a large number of CD11c, CD68, and CD3 positive cells. Corneal epithelial debridement experiments in young ACE2-deficient mice showed normal appearing corneas, devoid of haze. We hypothesized, however, that these mice are ""primed"" for a corneal inflammatory response, which once initiated, would persist. In vitro studies reveal that interleukins (IL-1a, IL-1b), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL8), and TNF-&#945;, are all significantly elevated, resulting in a cytokine storm-like phenotype. This phenotype could be partially rescued by treatment with the AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist, losartan, suggesting that the observed effect was mediated by AngII acting on its main receptor. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes human ACE2 as the receptor for entry with subsequent downregulation of ACE2, corneal inflammation in Ace2-/- mice may have a similar mechanism with that in COVID-19 patients. Thus the Ace2-/- cornea, because of easy accessibility, may provide an attractive model to explore the molecular mechanisms, immunological changes, and treatment modalities in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Junyi; Kaplan, Nihal; Wysocki, Jan; Yang, Wending; Lu, Kurt; Peng, Han; Batlle, Daniel; Lavker, Robert M",FASEB J,,361

Since then, multiple groups worldwide have attempted to describe predictive models for adverse clinical outcomes in patients affected by this disease. Within laboratory findings, the first Chinese cohorts described an inverse relationship between the absolute lymphocyte count and disease severity, and about 80% of severe patients exhibited lymphopenia. However, there are discrepancies regarding the predictive value of this clinical manifestation, as well as in the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Here, we review current evidence regarding lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19, and the potential utility of this hematological finding as a disease biomarker.","Rondon-Carvajal, J.; Avila-Rodriguez, V.; Lopez-Mora, M.

This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the technological and mental factors affecting users' adoption intentions of M-payment under the COVID-19 pandemic, to expand the domain of technology adoption under the emergency situation. This study integrated Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with perceived benefits from Mental Accounting Theory (MAT), and two additional variables (perceived security and trust) to investigate 739 smartphone users' adoption intentions of M-payment during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The empirical results showed that users' technological and mental perceptions conjointly influence their adoption intentions of M-payment during the COVID-19 pandemic, wherein perceived benefits are significantly determined by social influence and trust, corresponding with the situation of pandemic. This study initially integrated UTAUT with MAT to develop the theoretical framework for investigating users' adoption intentions. Meanwhile, this study originally investigated the antecedents of M-payment adoption under the pandemic situation and indicated that users' perceptions will be positively influenced when technology's specific characteristics can benefit a particular situation.","Zhao, Yuyang; Bacao, Fernando",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,361

METHODS: We surveyed 235 respondents, 51-95 years old (M = 71.35; SD = 7.39; 74% female), including two open-ended questions concerning COVID-19-related difficulties and positive experiences during the past week. Using inductive coding, we found nine final codes for difficulties and 12 for positives and grouped them into socioecological levels: personal, interpersonal, and societal. RESULTS: Difficulties were reported by 94% of the sample, while 63% described positives. Difficulties and positive responses were made at all socioecological levels and illustrated a dialectic between personal level constraints and opportunities, interpersonal level social isolation and integration, and societal level outrage, sorrow, and social optimism. DISCUSSION: Respondents described sources of vulnerabilities and resilience that supported a socioecological approach to understanding resilience during this pandemic. A notable example was resilience derived from witnessing and contributing to community and social solidarity, highlighting the potential of older adults as resources to their communities during the global pandemic.","Igarashi, Heidi; Kurth, Maria L; Lee, Hye Soo; Choun, Soyoung; Lee, Dylan; Aldwin, Carolyn M",,,361

In this article, we critically examine the available data on the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through organ transplantation. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from nonlung clinical specimens, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in autopsy specimens, previous experience with the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the vast experience with other common RNA respiratory viruses are all addressed. Taken together, these data provide little evidence to suggest the presence of intact transmissible SARS-CoV in organs that can potentially be transplanted, specifically liver and heart. Other considerations including ethical, financial, societal, and logistical concerns are also addressed. We conclude that, for selected patients with high waitlist mortality, transplant programs should consider accepting heart or liver transplants from deceased donors with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kates, Olivia S; Fisher, Cynthia E; Rakita, Robert M; Reyes, Jorge D; Limaye, Ajit P",Am. j. transplant,,361

In this study, we applied an animal model framework to elucidate changes in human purchasing behavior under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Purchasing behavior and potential predictors were assessed in an online questionnaire format (N = 813). Multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate the role of individually Perceived Threat of COVID-19, anxiety related personality traits (trait-anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty) and the role of media exposure in predicting quantity and frequency of purchasing behavior. High levels of Perceived Threat of COVID-19 were associated significantly with a reported reduction in purchasing frequency (b = -.24, p < .001) and an increase in the quantity of products bought per purchase (b = .22, p < .001). These results are comparable to observed changes in foraging behavior in rodents under threat conditions. Higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty (b = .19, p < .001) and high extend of media exposure (b = .27, p < .001) were positively associated with Perceived Threat of COVID-19 and an increase in purchasing quantity.

METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study with prospective recruitment of volunteer families that included at least one first-reported adult case positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and at least one child aged less than 15 years living in the same household under strict home confinement was conducted in the Health Region of metropolitan Barcelona (Spain) during the pandemic period April 28-June 3, 2020. All household members were tested at home by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay in finger-prick obtained capillary blood. RESULTS: A total of 381 family households including 381 first-reported PCR-positive adult cases and 1,084 contacts (672 children, 412 adults) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence rates were 17.6% (118/672) in children and 18.7% (77/335) in adult contacts (p=0.64). Among first-reported cases, seropositivity rates varied from 84.0% in adults previously hospitalized and tested within 6 weeks since the first positive PCR result to 31.5% in those not hospitalized and tested after that lag time (p<0.001). Nearly all (99.9%) positive pediatric contacts were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: Children appear to have similar probability as adults to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 in quarantined family households but remain largely asymptomatic once infected. Adult antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weak at early convalescence and beyond 6 weeks post-infection confirmation, especially in cases that have experienced mild disease.","Brotons, Pedro; Launes, Cristian; Buetas, Elena; Fumado, Vicky; Henares, Desiree; de Sevilla, Mariona Fernandez; Redin, Alba; Fuente-Soro, Laura; Cuadras, Daniel; Mele, Maria; Jou, Cristina; Millat, Pere; Jordan, Iolanda; Garcia-Garcia, Juan Jose; Bassat, Quique; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen",Clin Infect Dis,,361

The potential of big data can be realized via analytic and learning techniques, in which the data from various sources is transferred to a central cloud for central storage, processing, and training. However, this conventional approach faces critical issues in terms of data privacy as the data may include sensitive data such as personal information, governments, banking accounts. To overcome this challenge, federated learning (FL) appeared to be a promising learning technique.

The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents the urgent need to understand the complex pathogen-host interplay for effective control of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 reorganizes the host cytoskeleton for efficient cell entry and controls host transcriptional processes to support viral protein translation. The virus also dysregulates innate cellular defenses using various structural and nonstructural proteins. This results in substantial but delayed hyperinflammation alongside a weakened interferon (IFN) response. We provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and its uniquely aggressive life cycle and discuss the interactions of various viral proteins with host signaling pathways. We also address the functional changes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, relative to SARS-CoV. Our comprehensive assessment of host signaling in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis provides some complex yet important strategic clues for the development of novel therapeutics against this rapidly emerging worldwide crisis.","Suryawanshi, Rahul K; Koganti, Raghuram; Agelidis, Alex; Patil, Chandrashekhar D; Shukla, Deepak",Trends Microbiol,,361

395001,Using Technology to Measure Older Adults' Social Networks for Health and Well-Being: A Scoping Review,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify specific cutoff scores for three commonly used embedded performance validity tests (PVTs) for a Spanish speaking population. Culturally adapted cutoff scores for embedded PVTs were established using an analog study design. In addition, the psychometric properties of these measures when applying culturally adapted scores as compared to non-adapted scores were analyzed. METHOD: Participants (N = 114) were administered three embedded PVTs (Reliable Digit Span, Phonetic Fluency Test, and Animal Semantic Fluency Test) in a randomized order. Following an analog design, control participants were instructed to perform to the best of their abilities and the analog group was instructed to simulate cognitive impairment. RESULTS: In keeping with guidelines for specificity and sensitivity, the most culturally appropriate scores of &#8804;6, &#8804;27, and &#8804;16 were determined for the Reliable Digit Span, Phonetic Fluency Test, and the Semantic Fluency Test, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This the first study addressing culturally sensitive cutoffs for commonly used embedded validity measures using a European Spanish population. While these findings cannot be generalized to forensic or clinical populations at the present time, they support the claim that specific cutoff scores that are sensitive to cultural variables are necessary in addressing embedded validity measures of the Reliable Digit Span, Phonetic Fluency Test, and Semantic Fluency Test.","Daugherty, J C; Puente, A E; Lozano-Ruiz, A; Perez-Garcia, M",Appl Neuropsychol Adult,,361

396591,Support for families of isolated or deceased COVID-19 patients in sub-Saharan Africa,2020,"Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has drastically impacted the provision of mental health services. Changes required of providers were substantial and could lead to increased burnout and, subsequently, increased turnover intentions. This study examined burnout experienced by mental health services providers in the context of COVID-19 and through the lens of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model. We examined the effects of work changes on burnout and subsequent turnover intentions, and how job and personal resources may have buffered the extent to which work changes due to COVID-19 impacted burnout. Methods: Service providers (n = 93) from six community mental health centers (CMHCs) in one Midwestern state in the United States completed surveys as part of service contracts to implement evidence-based practices. Path analysis tested the unconditional indirect relations between work changes and turnover intentions through burnout. Moderated mediation determined whether the indirect effect of work changes on turnover intentions via burnout varied in strength by job and personal resources. Results: Work changes had a significant indirect effect on turnover intentions through burnout ( ß ^ = .140, 95% CI = .072, .217). This indirect effect varied as a function of two job resources, organizational trust and perceived organizational support. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Burnout was relatively low only when work changes were low and job resources levels high. When work changes were high, burnout was similarly high across levels of job resources. To minimize burnout, organizations should limit task, setting, and team-related work changes to the extent possible.

397558,Elimination of COVID-19 in the Faroe Islands: Effectiveness of massive testing and intensive case and contact tracing,2021,"In its most direct interpretation, telemedicine is medical care provided at a distance. Although telemedicine's use had been steadily increasing, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented interest and urgency among patients, health care professionals, and policymakers to facilitate health care devoid of the need for in-person contact. The growth in personal access to telecommunications technology meant an unprecedented number of people in the United States and around the world had access to the equipment and technology that would make virtual care possible from the home. As the mass implementation of telemedicine unfolded, it became quickly apparent that scaling up the use of telemedicine presented considerable new challenges, some of which worsened disparities. This article describes those challenges by examining the history of telemedicine, its role in both supporting access and creating new barriers to access in trying to get everyone connected, frameworks for thinking about those barriers, and facilitators that may help overcome them, with a particular focus on older adults and patients with cancer in rural communities.","Lopez, Ana Maria; Lam, Kenneth; Thota, Ramya",Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,,361
397674,COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on mental health of healthcare professionals,2020,"Objectives: Respiratory co-infections have the potential to affect the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This meta-analysis was performed to analyze the prevalence of respiratory pathogens (viruses and atypical bacteria) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This review was consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Searched databases included: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature. Studies with a series of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with additional respiratory pathogen testing were included. Independently, 2 authors extracted data and assessed quality of evidence across all studies using Cochrane's Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and within each study using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Data extraction and quality assessment disagreements were settled by a third author. Pooled prevalence of co-infections was calculated using a random-effects model with univariate meta-regression performed to assess the effect of study subsets on heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot inspection, Begg's correlation, and Egger's test. Results: Eighteen retrospective cohorts and 1 prospective study were included. Pooling of data (1880 subjects) showed an 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.9-17.4, I 2 = 0.92) pooled prevalence of respiratory co-pathogens. Studies with 100% co-pathogen testing (1210 subjects) found a pooled prevalence of 16.8% (95% CI = 8.1-27.9, I 2 = 0.95) and studies using serum antibody tests (488 subjects) found a pooled prevalence of 26.8% (95%, CI = 7.9-51.9, I 2 = 0.97). Meta-regression found no moderators affecting heterogeneity. Conclusion: Co-infection with respiratory pathogens is a common and potentially important occurrence in patients with COVID-19. Knowledge of the prevalence and type of co-infections may have diagnostic and management implications.","Davis, Bennett; Rothrock, Ava N; Swetland, Sarah; Andris, Halle; Davis, Phil; Rothrock, Steven G",,,361

Altruism of Giving, Happiness and Mental Health during the Covid-19 Period in the UK",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many countries around the world and Iran was no exception. The aim of this study was to evaluate health anxiety of Iranian pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 300 pregnant women in different trimesters (n = 100 in each trimester) were recruited. A demographic questionnaire and the Health Anxiety Questionnaire were used to collect data. Scores of < 27, 27-34 and more than 35 were defined as low, moderate and high health anxiety, respectively. Due to nationwide restrictions, data were collected through social media groups. Chi-square tests, ANOVA and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Mean (SD) total anxiety scores were 22.3 ± 9.5, 24.6 ± 9.3 and 25.4 ± 10.6 in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. 9, 13 and 21% of women had severe anxiety in the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively. Women in the third trimester had significantly higher health anxiety scores than those in the first trimester (p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy were more worried about consequences of disease, but total health anxiety scores were significantly higher among women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Health care providers should pay more attention to the mental health of pregnant women in times of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Saadati, Najmieh; Afshari, Poorandokht; Boostani, Hatam; Beheshtinasab, Maryam; Abedi, Parvin; Maraghi, Elham",BMC Psychiatry,,361

Prior studies reported a decrease in the number of stroke and TIAs admissions. Most reports have been from single hospitals, there is no data available on the impact on a statewide level. Methods: A retrospective analysis of stroke quality improvement data reported to the State of Maryland. These data are from Primary, Thrombectomy-Capable, and Comprehensive Stroke Centers. The number of admissions for stroke overall and by stroke subtype are reported and compared for March-June 2020 vs. March-June 2019. Last known well (LKW) to hospital arrival, intravenous tPA (IV tPA) and thrombectomy rates were analyzed. Results: The overall number of stroke admissions from March-June 2020 compared to March-June 2019 was 1,001 vs. 1,203 in March, 809 vs. 1,112 in April, 950 vs. 1206 in May, and 937 vs. 1,261 in June. There was an average 21% decrease for the 4-month period in 2020 compared to 2019. For ischemic stroke, there was a decrease in hospital admission for each month in 2020 vs. 2019: 740 vs. 922 in March, 606 vs. 866 in April, 721 vs. 906 in May, and 698 vs. 880 in June. TIAs admission rates were similarly decreased in 2020 vs. 2019: 116 vs. 136, 74 vs. 97, 111 vs. 137, and 107 vs. 111. The number of ICH admissions in 2020 vs. 2019 was 100 vs. 107 in March, 90 vs. 112 in April, 96 vs. 116 in May, and 103 vs. 121 in June. Median LKW well to hospital arrival was 292 vs. 254 min in March, 383 vs. 293 min in April, 291.5 vs. 247 min in May, and 320 vs. 292 min in June. There was about 1% decrease in thrombectomy rates in the 4-month period in 2020 compared to 2019. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of Maryland there was a consistentdecrease in the volume of stroke admissions. Median LKW to hospital arrival was also increased,supporting evidence for of a delay in stroke care. While reasons for these changes need to befurther explored, our findings suggest that public health campaigns for the pandemic should takeinto account and not adversely affect the acute care of unrelated medical emergencies.","Balucani, C.; Carhuapoma, J.

The hydroxychloroquine group had a significantly reduced duration of hospital stay than the arbidol and corticosteroids groups. The oseltamivir group had a significantly shorter length of hospital stay than the arbidol, corticosteroids, and lopinavir/ritonavir groups. The hydroxychloroquine group had a significantly higher IgM titer than the other four groups and exhibited significantly higher IgG levels than the arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, and oseltamivir groups. Our findings indicated that hydroxychloroquine might have the potential for efficient COVID-19 management, while oseltamivir should be prudently considered in combination therapy.","Tan, Jiahong; Yuan, Yuan; Xu, Cheng; Song, Chunyan; Liu, Dan; Ma, Ding; Gao, Qinglei",Virus Res,,361

Many services cancelled all routine appointments and surgery, which allowed them to redirect care towards large numbers of infected patients requiring respiratory and other support. Maternity services are relatively unique in that most of the care is time sensitive and cannot be rescheduled. Assessment such as routine bloods need to be taken in early pregnancy, anatomic surveys are best conducted at 20-22 weeks' gestation, and births continue regardless of a pandemic. In this paper we describe how National Maternity Hospital Dublin, with an annual delivery rate of 8000 births, reorganised services to continue to care for our mothers and babies. This included the development of a 'hospital within a hospital' approach, and separate physical and care pathways for positive cases.

400226,Identifying the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Service Access for People who Use Drugs (PWUD): A National Qualitative Study,2021,"Media critics frequently complain about the tendency of reporters to cover political news using partisan conflict or partisan game frames, which describe policy disagreement as sites of partisan conflict where the parties can score ""wins"" or ""losses."" Such frames, thought to decrease trust and increase partisan polarization, may be particularly dangerous when used in the coverage of public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We report a survey experiment where 2,455 respondents were assigned to read coverage of the pandemic that was framed in non-partisan terms, in terms of partisan conflict, or as a game where one party was winning and the other losing. Contrary to expectations, we find no effect of these frames across a broad range of opinions about and actions related to the pandemic, with the exception of a small negative effect of partisan game-framed coverage on the desire to consume news about the pandemic. These results suggest that partisan framing may not have negative effects during a public health crisis or, alternately, that such effects are difficult to detect in real-time using traditional survey experiments.

400826,Anxiety and associated factors among Ethiopian health professionals at early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia,2021,"Introduction: Healthcare systems are being bombarded during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding burnout, compassion fatigue, and potential protective factors, such as compassion satisfaction, will be important in supporting the vital healthcare workforce. The goal of the current study was to understand the key factors of burnout, compassion fatigue, and compassion satisfaction among healthcare employees during the pandemic within the U.S. in April 2020. Methods: The authors conducted a single-center, cross-sectional online survey using the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) Questionnaire and three open-ended questions around stress and responses to stress during COVID-19 at a large Midwestern academic medical center with nearly 16,000 employees. Results: Healthcare employees (613) representing over 25 professions or roles and 30 different departments within the health system were surveyed. Participants reported low levels of compassion fatigue and burnout, but moderate levels of compassion satisfaction. Compassion satisfaction was notably higher than prior literature. Key areas of stress outside of work included family, finances and housing, childcare and homeschooling, and personal health. Conclusions: This was a cross-sectional survey, limiting causal analyses. Also, based on the qualitative responses, the ProQOL was somewhat insufficient in assessing the breadth of stressors, particularly outside of work, that healthcare employees faced due to the pandemic. Although compassion satisfaction was elevated during the initial phases of the pandemic, providing some possible protection against burnout, this may change as COVID-19 continues to surge. Healthcare systems are encouraged to assess and address the broad range of work and non-work-related stressors to best serve their vital workforce.","Dwyer, M. L.; Alt, M.; Brooks, J.

We study the properties and dynamics of the proposed model. The conditions under which the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable are discussed. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of the parameters and use the data from Tennessee state (as a case study) to discuss identifiability of the parameters of the model. The non-negative parameters in the model are obtained by solving inverse problems with empirical data from California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The basic reproduction number is seen to be slightly above the critical value of one suggesting that stricter measures such as the use of face-masks, social distancing, contact tracing, and even longer stay-at-home orders need to be enforced in order to mitigate the spread of the virus. As stay-at-home orders are rescinded in some of these states, we see that the number of cases began to increase almost immediately and may continue to rise until the end of the year 2020 unless stricter measures are taken.","Biala, Toheeb A.; Khaliq, Abdul Q.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03913v1.pdf,361

Objective: To investigate whether state-imposed stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) and the proportion of African American population in a state were associated with the state-level COVID-19 cases. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used daily, state-level data on COVID-19 cases, tests, and fatalities from the COVID Tracking Project. Data from March 1 to May 4, 2020, for all states (except Washington state) as well as the District of Columbia were used. Exposures: The key exposure variables were state-level SAHO (1 if in place, 0 otherwise), and proportion of state population who are African American. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was daily cumulative COVID-19 case rates. A secondary outcome was subsequent COVID-19 fatality rates, derived using mean cumulative fatality rates 21 to 28 days after each date. Multivariate regression models were estimated. Results: The final sample included 3023 pooled state- and day-level observations. The mean (SD) cumulative positive case rate was 103.186 (200.067) cases per 100â¯000 state population, the mean (SD) cumulative test rate was 744.23 (894.944) tests per 100â¯000 state population, and the mean (SD) subsequent cumulative fatality rate was 12.923 (21.737) deaths per 100â¯000 state population. There was a negative association of SAHOs with cumulative case rates (ß = -1.166; 95% CI, -1.484 to -0.847; P < .001) and subsequent fatality rates (ß = -0.204; 95% CI, -0.294 to -0.113; P < .001). Estimation analyses indicated that expected cumulative case rates would have been more than 200% higher and fatality rates approximately 22% higher if there were no SAHOs, as compared with SAHOs fully in place. A higher proportion of African American population was associated with higher case rates (ß = 0.045; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.077; P = .001) and fatality rates (ß = 0.068; 95% CI, 0.044 to 0.091; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, SAHOs were associated with reductions in COVID-19 case rates. These findings could help inform policy makers to address the continued COVID-19 pandemic in the US. The proportion of African American population was positively associated with COVID-19 case rates, and this state-level finding adds to evidence from existing ecological studies using county-level data on racial disparities in COVID-19 infection rates and underlines the urgency of better understanding and addressing these disparities.","Padalabalanarayanan, Sangeetha; Hanumanthu, Vidya Sagar; Sen, Bisakha",JAMA Netw Open,,361
403308,Disinfection of Stethoscope and Non-Infrared Thermometer: Practices of Physicians in Ethiopia in the Era of COVID-19,2020,"N-type inactivation of voltage-gated K+ channels is conferred by the N-terminal ""ball"" domains of select pore-forming &#945; subunits or of auxiliary ß subunits, and influences electrical cellular excitability. Here, we show that hemin impairs inactivation of K+ channels formed by Kv3.4 &#945; subunits as well as that induced by the subunits Kvß1.1, Kvß1.2, and Kvß3.1 when coexpressed with &#945; subunits of the Kv1 subfamily. In Kvß1.1, hemin interacts with cysteine and histidine residues in the N terminus (C7 and H10) with high affinity (EC50 100 nM). Similarly, rapid inactivation of Kv4.2 channels induced by the dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein DPP6a is also sensitive to hemin, and the DPP6a mutation C13S eliminates this dependence. The results suggest a common mechanism for a dynamic regulation of Kv channel inactivation by heme/hemin in N-terminal ball domains of Kv &#945; and auxiliary ß subunits. Free intracellular heme therefore has the potential to regulate cellular excitability via modulation of Kv channel inactivation.","Coburger, Ina; Yang, Kefan; Bernert, Alisa; Wiesel, Eric; Sahoo, Nirakar; Swain, Sandip M; Hoshi, Toshinori; Schönherr, Roland; Heinemann, Stefan H","Pflugers arch., Eur. j. physiol",,361
403513,Maternal and neonatal health care worker well-being and patient safety climate amid the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The accuracy of commercially available tests for COVID-19 in Brazil remains unclear. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis to describe the accuracy of available tests to detect COVID-19 in Brazil. We searched at the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) online platform to describe the pooled sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) for detection of IgM/IgG antibodies and for tests using naso/oropharyngeal swabs in the random-effects models. We identified 16 tests registered, mostly rapid-tests. Pooled diagnostic accuracy measures [95%CI] were: (i) for IgM antibodies Se=82% [76-87]; Sp=97% [96-98]; DOR=168 [92-305] and SROC=0.98 [0.96-0.99]; (ii) for IgG antibodies Se=97% [90-99]; Sp=98% [97-99]; DOR=1994 [385-10334] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]; and (iii) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by antigen or molecular assays in naso/oropharyngeal swabs Se=97% [85-99]; Sp=99% [77-100]; DOR=2649 [30-233056] and SROC=0.99 [0.98-1.00]. These tests can be helpful for emergency testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. However, it is important to highlight the high rate of false negative results from tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies in the initial course of the disease and the scarce evidence-based validation results published in Brazil. Future studies addressing the diagnostic performance of tests for COVID-19 in the Brazilian population are urgently needed.","Castro, Rodolfo; Luz, Paula M; Wakimoto, Mayumi D; Veloso, Valdilea G; Grinsztejn, Beatriz; Perazzo, Hugo",Braz J Infect Dis,,361

405946,Impact of covid-19 pandemic lockdown on mental and physical health of students: A cross-sectional study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to threaten public health globally. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, with respiratory and multiple organ failure. It is believed that dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial dysfunction contribute to the pathogenesis of severe diseases. However, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the role of endothelial cells are poorly understood. METHODS: Well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells were used to explore the cytokine and chemokine production after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured the susceptibility to infection, immune response, and expression of adhesion molecules, in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) exposed to conditioned medium from infected epithelial cells. The effect of imatinib on HPMVECs exposed to conditioned medium was evaluated. RESULTS: We demonstrated the production of IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1 from the infected human airway cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) did not support productive replication of SARS-CoV-2, treatment of HPMVECs with conditioned medium collected from infected airway cells induced an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and vascular adhesion molecules. Imatinib inhibited the up-regulation of these cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in HPMVECs treated with conditioned medium. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the role of endothelial cells in the development of clinical disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the importance of endothelial cell-epithelial cell interaction in the pathogenesis of human COVID-19 diseases.","Hui, Kenrie Pui-Yan; Cheung, Man-Chun; Lai, Ka-Ling; Ng, Ka-Chun; Ho, John Chi-Wang; Peiris, Malik; Nicholls, John Malcolm; Chan, Michael Chi-Wai",Clin. infect. dis,,361

So, rapid detection of all respiratory pathogens can facilitate prompt treatment and prevent the deterioration of respiratory disease. Previously published primers and probes of the TaqMan array card (TAC) for respiratory pathogens are not sensitive to Chinese clinical specimens. This study aimed to develop and improve the TAC assay to detect 28 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in a Chinese population. METHODS: To improve the sensitivity, we redesigned the primers and probes, and labeled the probes with minor groove binders. The amplification efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of the primers and probes were determined using target-gene containing standard plasmids. The detection performance of the TAC was evaluated on 754 clinical specimens and the results were compared with those from conventional methods. RESULTS: The performance of the TAC assay was evaluated using 754 clinical throat swab samples and the results were compared with those from gold-standard methods. The sensitivity and specificity were 95.4 and 96.6%, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the TAC was 10 to 100 copies/µL. CONCLUSIONS: TAC is an efficient, accurate, and high-throughput approach to detecting multiple respiratory pathogens simultaneously and is a promising tool for the identification of pathogen outbreaks.","Liu, Keke; Jing, Hongbo; Chen, Ying; Zheng, Xin; Jiang, Hua; Kong, Decong; Zheng, Yvling; Chen, Shuiping; Liu, Peng; Jiang, Yongqiang",BMC Infect Dis,,361

408320,Psychological impact during COVID-19 lockdown in children and adolescents with previous mental health disorders,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The aeromedical transport of coronavirus patients presents risks to clinicians and aircrew. Patient positioning and physical barriers may provide additional protection during flight. This paper describes airflow testing undertaken on fixed wing and rotary wing aeromedical aircraft. METHODS: Airflow testing was undertaken on a stationary Hawker Beechcraft B200C and Leonardo Augusta Westland 139. Airflow was simulated using a Trainer 101 (MSS Professional A/S, Odense Sø, Syddanmark, Denmark) Smoke machine. Different cabin configurations were used along with variations in heating, cooling, and ventilation systems. RESULTS: For the Hawker Beechcraft B200C, smoke generated within the forward section of the cabin was observed to fill the cabin to a fluid boundary located in-line with the forward edge of the cargo door. With the curtain closed, smoke was only observed to enter the cockpit in very small quantities. For the Leonardo AW139, smoke generated within the cabin was observed to expand to fill the cabin evenly before dissipating. With the curtain closed, smoke was observed to enter the cockpit only in small quantities CONCLUSION: The use of physical barriers in fixed wing and rotary wing aeromedical aircraft provides some protection to aircrew. Optimal positioning of the patient is on the aft stretcher on the Beechcraft B200C and on a laterally orientated stretcher on the AW139. The results provide a baseline for further investigation into methods to protect aircrew during the coronavirus pandemic.","de Wit, Anthony John; Coates, Ben; Cheesman, Michael John; Hanlon, Gregory Richard; House, Thomas Giles; Fisk, Benjamin",Air Med J,,361

This study aims to explore the physical, social, and psychological impact of the diagnosis on the individual through online interviews. MethodA qualitative study approach using online interviews was conducted. A sample of 30 participants of different age groups, gender, and nationalities were interviewed to explore the impact of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis on their physical, mental, social, psychological health, and lifestyle practices. An interview guide was created based on coping strategy model and conceptual framework of coping strategies. All interviews were recorded then transcribed after obtaining written consent from participants. Ethics approval was obtained from the United Arab Emirates Social Science Ethics Committee. NVIVO software was used for thematic analysis based on both identified coping models to highlight the most important feelings and emotions, family support, and changes in lifestyle that may impact the COVID-19 patient and family. Researchers identified the themes separately and then verified themes in one meeting. ResultsMajor themes include the physical effects, social effects, psychological effects, spiritual effects, and lifestyle effects. Emerging themes include coping mechanisms, trust in authorities and health care system, appreciation of the role of the government, conspiracy theories, and media roles. Those who had a positive infection towards the end of 2020 and in 2021 described having fewer negative emotions and better psychological resilience. ConclusionThe findings of this study indicate that people diagnosed with COVID-19 have perceived a very good support in terms of their physical health from the government and health authorities, but require social, psychological, and educational support during the infection period and post-recovery.","Alkuwaiti, Mouza; Hamda, Bayan Abu; Aljneibi, Noof; Paulo, Marilia Silva; Elbarazi, Iffat",,,361

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly demanded to develop treatments for COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 92.06% identity in their N protein RBDs' sequences, which results in very similar structures. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is more easily to spread. Utilizing multi-scale computational approaches, this work studied the fundamental mechanisms of the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including their stabilities and binding strengths with RNAs at different pH values. Electrostatic potential on the surfaces of N proteins show that both the N proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have dominantly positive potential to attract RNAs. The binding forces between SARS-CoV N protein and RNAs at different distances are similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, both in directions and magnitudes. The electric filed lines between N proteins and RNAs are also similar for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The folding energy and binding energy dependence on pH revealed that the best environment for N proteins to perform their functions with RNAs is the weak acidic environment.","Guo, Wenhan; Xie, Yixin; E Lopez-Hernandez, Alan; Sun, Shengjie; Li, Lin",Math Biosci Eng,,361

416226,Maternal insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic: associations with depression and anxiety,2021,"OBJECTIVE: No data exist regarding the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the risk factors of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This study aimed to stratify risk factors of SUDEP in relation to COVID-19 lockdown, among patients with epilepsy (PWE) in Cairo University epilepsy unit (CUEU). Therefore, we can detect risk factors and mitigate such factors in the second wave of the virus. METHODS: an observational, cross-sectional study carried on 340 Egyptian patients with active epilepsy. Individual risk identification and stratification was done by using The SUDEP and seizure Safety Checklist, after which sharing risk knowledge to PWE and their caregivers was undertaken. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 29.72 ± 12.12. The median of the static factors was 4 (IQR 3-5) whereas, the median of the modifiable factors was 2 (IQR 1-3). Epilepsy emergencies (serial seizures or status epilepticus) were reported in 24.1 % of patients, for which non-compliance was the commonest cause, followed by deferral of epilepsy surgery for patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that use of anxiolytic medications, non-compliance, keeping patients with DRE on dual anti-seizure medications (ASMs), or adding third medication increased the odds of increased seizure frequency by 2.7, 3.5, 16.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. CONCLUSION: Some COVID-19 related issues had influenced the risk of seizure worsening including postponing epilepsy surgery for patients with DRE, non-compliance, and psychiatric comorbidities. Special attention should be paid to these issues to mitigate the risk of SUDEP.","Magdy, Rehab; Kishk, Nirmeen A; Fouad, Amr M; Alsayyad, Enas",Epilepsy Res,,361

A GRADE rapid review on the N95 respirators effectiveness,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and outcomes associated with concomitant renal and respiratory failure in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This is a case series of patients from a U.S. healthcare system in New York City. All adult patients (&#8805; 18 yr) admitted to the hospital with positive coronavirus disease 2019 testing between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2020, who required mechanical ventilatory support were included. Patients who remained hospitalized were followed through May 1, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Renal replacement therapy included at least one session of dialysis, continued venovenous hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, laboratory markers, 30-day in-hospital outcomes, ventilator days, and survival to discharge were included. Multivariate predictors for mortality and need for renal replacement therapy were identified. A total of 330 patients were included in this analysis and were most commonly greater than or equal to 70 years (40%), male (61%), Black or African American (41%), and Hispanic or Latino (38%). Renal replacement therapy was required in 101 patients (29%), most commonly among Blacks or African Americans (50%). Elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with renal replacement therapy, compared with the nondialysis cohort. Overall, 243 patients (74%) died and 56 (17%) were discharged from the hospital, of which 9 (3%) required renal replacement therapy. Male sex (odds ratio, 2.0; 1.1-3.5; p = 0.020), Black race (odds ratio, 1.8; 1.0-3.1; p = 0.453), and history of hypertension (odds ratio, 2.7; 1.3-5.4; p = 0.005) were predictors for requiring renal replacement therapy. Risk factors for in-hospital mortality included age greater than or equal to 60 years (odds ratio, 6.2; 3.0-13.0; p < 0.0001), male sex (odds ratio, 3.0; 1.4-6.4; p = 0.004), and body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m (odds ratio, 2.1; 1.0-4.4; p = 0.039).

417079,COVID‐19 causes more delay in managed care launch for Illinois youth,2020,"The novel coronavirus was recognised in December 2019 and caught humanity off guard. The virus employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into human cells. ACE2 is expressed on different organs, which is raising concern as to whether these organs can be infected by the virus or not. The testis appears to be an organ enriched with levels of ACE2, while the possible mechanisms of involvement of the male reproductive system by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully elucidated. The major focus of the present studies is on the short-term complications of the coronavirus and gains importance on studying the long-term effects, including the possible effects of the virus on the male reproductive system. The aim of this review was to provide new insights into different possible mechanisms of involvement of male gonads with SARS-CoV-2 including investigating the ACE2 axis in testis, hormonal alterations in patients with COVID-19, possible formation of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) and subsequently immunological infertility as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we suggest measuring the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) as a determiner of male fertility impairment in patients with COVID-19 along with other options such as sex-related hormones and semen analysis. Invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the spermatogonia, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells can lead to sex hormonal alteration and impaired gonadal function. Once infected, changes in ACE2 signalling pathways followed by oxidative stress and inflammation could cause spermatogenesis failure, abnormal sperm motility, DNA fragmentation and male infertility.","Haghpanah, Abdolreza; Masjedi, Fatemeh; Alborzi, Saeed; Hosseinpour, Alireza; Dehghani, Anahita; Malekmakan, Leila; Roozbeh, Jamshid",Andrologia,,361

Effectively containing the pandemic requires a societal consensus. However, a long line of research in political science has told us that polarization tends to occur on highly salient topics because partisans ""follow the leader."" We examine the degree of partisan consensus that exists in Canada at the level of political elites and the mass public. We analyze Member of Parliament (MP) Twitter behaviour and show a massive increase in attention to COVID-19 and find no evidence of any MPs from any party downplaying the pandemic. We find no association between Conservative Party vote share and Google search interest in the coronavirus, while survey data show that individual-level partisan differences are small and disappear when controlling for demographics and left-right ideology.

Main body of abstract: The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic due to its spread to other countries inside and outside Asia. Initial confirmation of the pandemic shows patient exposure to the Huanan seafood market. Bats might be a significant host for the spread of coronaviruses via an unknown intermediate host. The human-to-human transfer has become a significant concern due to one of the significant reasons that is asymptomatic carriers or silent spreaders. No data is obtained regarding prophylactic treatment for COVID-19, although many clinical trials are underway. Conclusion: The most effective weapon is prevention and precaution to avoid the spread of the pandemic. In this current review, we outline pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, ongoing clinical trials, prevention, and precautions. We have also highlighted the impact of pandemic worldwide and challenges that can help to overcome the fatal disease in the future.","Shaikh, Sana Saffiruddin; Jose, Anooja P; Nerkar, Disha Anil; Vijaykumar Kv, Midhuna; Shaikh, Saquib Khaleel",Futur J Pharm Sci,,361

419538,Socioeconomic inequalities associated with mortality for COVID-19 in Colombia: a cohort nationwide study,2021,"At a time when COVID-19 immunity certificates are debated and vaccination certificates might potentially be made available if an effective vaccine is established, we conducted a study to elucidate public opinion on this issue. Our objective was to determine social and individual perceptions of COVID-19 immunity certificates through a population-based study. A nested survey within the SEROCoV-POP study, a population-based serosurvey of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland, was conducted with a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was proposed to 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants. Measures included percentage of participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements on immunity and vaccination certificates. Stratification by age, gender, education and work status was used to examine socio-demographic variations. Of the 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants, 1425 completed the questionnaire (response rate 93%; mean age &plusmn; standard deviation 52 &plusmn; 15.1 years; 51.9% women). About 80% of participants agreed that knowing one&rsquo;s serology status would lead to a change in one&rsquo;s behaviour. In the event that the presence of antibodies correlated with immunity, 60% of participants reported that certificates should be offered to the general population. The results showed variations in perceptions of certificates depending on the context (73% agreed on certificates&rsquo; utility for travel, 72% for entering a country, and 32% for the right to work). Provided an effective vaccine was available, 55% of participants agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and 49% agreed that a vaccination certificate should be mandatory. About 68% reported a potential risk of discrimination and 28% a risk of deliberate infection. Differences were seen with age, gender and education level. This study shows that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland can envisage scenarios where COVID-19 immunity, and eventually vaccination, certificates would be useful. Seroprevalence estimates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain low to date, and the interpretability of serological testing and immunity remains undefined. However, the information from this study is important, especially the differences based on context and the socio-demographic variations, and should be taken into account if COVID-19-related certificates are to be implemented.","Nehme, Mayssam; Stringhini, Silvia; Guessous, Idris",Swiss Med Wkly,,361

421141,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health,2020,"OBJECTIVE: EMA decided that with ulipristal acetate (UPA) treatment for uterine fibroids, should be discontinued due to the associated risk of hepatic failure, We analyzed whether the risk of recurrent symptoms due to fibroids may lead to an increased risk of Covid -19 infection and death, that would exceed the former risk of hepatic failure and transplantation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We used a Markov model to generate probabilities. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: There are currently about 36,250 treated patients in Europe. We estimated bleeding probabilities, while using or discontinuing UPA, which may induce a need of medical or surgical management in symptomatic patients, and increase the risk of acquiring a Covid-19 infection, and die from it. We also estimated the risk of suffering a hepatic failure and hepatic transplantation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Based on our assumptions, ceasing UPA during a Covid 19 pandemic may be associated with a fatality ratio between 4 and 18, due to the Pandemic, whereas pursuing UPA would be associated with a fatality rate due to the pandemic between 1-2, and an added fatality rate due to hepatic impairment of 1. The added risk of stopping UPA may range between 2 and 15 additional deaths. Our calculations suggest that the decision to stop UPA in the middle of the Covid- 19 pandemic may be untimely, since it may result in an increased risk of Covid-19 infection, due to the recurrence of symptoms and the need for medical and surgical treatment. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A decision, like the one EMA took need to be taken in a wider health context of a population, than simply analyzing its role as regulating agent for medications.","Rozenberg, Serge; Revercez, Perrine; Fastrez, Maxime; Vandromme, Jean; Bucella, Dario",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,361

Other non-pharmaceutical interventions for suppressing transmission include active case finding, contact tracing, quarantine, immunity or health certification, and a wide range of personal protective measures. Here we investigate the potential effectiveness of these alternative approaches to suppression. We introduce a conceptual framework represented by two mathematical models that differ in strategy. We find both strategies may be effective, although both require extensive testing and work within a relatively narrow range of conditions. Generalized protective measures such as wearing face masks, improved hygiene and local reductions in density are found to significantly increase the effectiveness of targeted interventions.","Drake, John M; Dahlin, Kyle; Rohani, Pejman; Handel, Andreas",Proc Biol Sci,,361

Based on the data, influence of SARS-CoV-2 on human cells was analyzed and potential therapeutic compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 were screened. MATERIALS AND METHODS: R package ""DESeq2"" was used for differential gene analysis on the data of cells infected or non-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The ""ClusterProfiler"" package was used for GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed through STRING website, and the key subset in the PPI network was identified after visualization by Cytoscape software. Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to screen known compounds that caused genomic change reverse to that caused by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: By intersecting DEGs in two datasets, a total of 145 DEGs were screened out, among which 136 genes were upregulated and 9 genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly associated with the pathways involved in viral infection, inflammatory response, and immunity. The CMap research found that there were three compounds with a median_tau_score less than -90, namely triptolide, tivozanib and daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can cause abnormal changes in a large number of molecules and related signaling pathways in human cells, among which IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways may play a key role in pathogenic process of SARS-CoV-2. Here, three compounds that may be effective for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 were screened, which would provide new options for improving treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, W-Y; Fang, Z-X; Lv, X-D; Zhou, Q-H; Yao, M; Deng, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,361

421877,Impact of COVID-19 on mental health: Update from the United Kingdom,2020,"Respiratory rhythm (RR) during sniffing is known to couple with hippocampal theta rhythm. However, outside of the short sniffing bouts, a more stable ~ 2 Hz RR was recently shown to rhythmically modulate non-olfactory cognitive processes, as well. The underlying RR coupling with wide-spread forebrain activity was confirmed using advanced techniques, creating solid premise for investigating how higher networks use this mechanism in their communication. Here we show essential differences in the way prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) process the RR signal from the olfactory bulb (OB) that may support dynamic, flexible PFC-HC coupling utilizing this input. We used inter-regional coherences and their correlations in rats, breathing at low rate (~ 2 Hz), outside of the short sniffing bouts. We found strong and stable OB-PFC coherence in wake states, contrasting OB-HC coherence which was low but highly variable. Importantly, this variability was essential for establishing PFC-HC synchrony at RR, whereas variations of RRO in OB and PFC had no significant effect. The findings help to understand the mechanism of rhythmic modulation of non-olfactory cognitive processes by the on-going regular respiration, reported in rodents as well as humans. These mechanisms may be impaired when nasal breathing is limited or in OB-pathology, including malfunctions of the olfactory epithelium due to infections, such as in Covid-19.","Mofleh, Rola; Kocsis, Bernat",Sci Rep,,361

Currently there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and so, there is an urgent need for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to combat the disease until a vaccine will be available worldwide. Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (over conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that time frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few number of clinical trial required. In this work, a virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as potential inhibitors of the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12 drugs are proposed as candidates for inhibitors of the Mpro enzyme. Some of the selected compounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials (i.e. ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of the disease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the most promising candidate is the naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline. This compound has largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates along all filtering steps of our virtual screening protocol. If the activity of any of these drugs is experimentally corroborated, they could be used directly in clinical trials without the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they are already used as drugs for other diseases.","Angelina, Emilio; Andujar, Sebastian; Parravicini, Oscar; Enriz, Daniel; Peruchena, Nelida",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14790v1.pdf,361

Pandemics are inherently social phenomena, and public health measures intended to curtail transmission of COVID-19 (e.g., quarantine and social distancing) have consequences for individuals with anxiety and depression. Using qualitative methods, respondents with previously diagnosed anxiety or depression identified ways in which COVID-19 affected their symptoms at multiple levels of the social ecological model (SEM). Key themes reported were organized following the SEM. Emergent themes at the individual level are isolation/loneliness, fear of contracting COVID-19, and uncertainty about the future. Themes at the interpersonal level are: fears of family contracting COVID-19, separation from family members, and domestic relationships. Themes at the level of community and societal stressors are: employment, community and societal systems, media, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings demonstrate the ways that mental health, physical health/safety, and social environments are interrelated in the experience of COVID-19 for individuals diagnosed with anxiety or depression.

428312,Psychometric properties of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) in Spanish older adults,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients increasingly seek second opinion (SO) consultations, but there is scarce empirical evidence to substantiate medical and psychological benefits for patients. This is the first study to examine patient- and oncologist-reported (1) motivations and expectations of patients to seek a SO, (2) the perceived medical outcome, and (3) psychological consequences of SOs over time (i.e. patients' uncertainty and anxiety). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multi-informant longitudinal cohort study (SO-COM) included consecutive cancer patients referred for a SO (N = 70; age 28-85), as well as their referring and consulting oncologists. Outcome measures were completed at three time points: Patients and referring oncologists reported motivations and expectations before the SO (T0), patients and consulting oncologists reported the medical outcome of the SO (i.e. discrepancy between first and second opinion) immediately following the SO (T1), and patients reported their uncertainty and anxiety at T0, T1, and two months following the SO (T2). RESULTS: Cancer patients most frequently reported wanting expert advice, exhausting all options, and/or needing more information as motivations for SOs. Referring oncologists rather accurately anticipated these motivations, except most did not recognize patients' information needs. The vast majority of patients (90.0%) received a medical advice similar to the first opinion, although 65.7% had expected to receive a different opinion. Patients' uncertainty (F = 6.82, p=.002; Î·2 =.22), but not anxiety (F = 3.074, p=.055, Î·2 =.11) was significantly reduced after the SO. CONCLUSIONS: SOs can yield psychological benefits by reducing patients' uncertainty, but the added medical value remains debatable. Referring oncologists may not be fully aware of their patients' information needs. Patients should be better informed about goals and benefits of SOs to better manage their expectations. More cost-effective ways of optimally providing medically and psychologically valuable SOs need to be explored.","Lehmann, Vicky; Smets, Ellen M A; de Jong, Maxime; de Vos, Filip Y F; Kenter, Gemma G; Stouthard, Jacqueline M; Hillen, Marij A",Acta Oncol,,361

Our primary objective was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on call volumes for several determinants in Niagara Region EMS. Our secondary objective was to assess changes in paramedic-assigned patient acuity scores as determined using the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). METHODS: We analyzed data from a regional EMS database related to call type, volume, and patient acuity for January to May 2016-2020. We used statistical methods to assess differences in EMS calls between 2016 and 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 114,507 EMS calls were made for the period of January 1 to May 26 between 2016 and 2020, inclusive. Overall, the incidence rate of EMS calls significantly decreased in 2020 compared to the total EMS calls in 2016-2019. Motor vehicle collisions decreased in 2020 relative to 2016-2019 (17%), while overdoses relatively increased (70%) in 2020 compared to 2016-2019. Calls for patients assigned a higher acuity score increased (CTAS 1) (4.1% vs. 2.9%). CONCLUSION: We confirmed that overall, EMS calls have decreased since the emergence of COVID-19. However, this effect on call volume was not consistent across all call determinants, as some call types rose while others decreased. These findings indicate that COVID-19 may have led to actual changes in emergency medical service demand and will be of interest to other services planning for future pandemics or further waves of COVID-19.","Ferron, Richard; Agarwal, Gina; Cooper, Rhiannon; Munkley, Douglas",BMC Emerg Med,,361

432875,Psychological distress among health professional students during the COVID-19 outbreak - Corrigendum,2021,"IntroductionSingle-dose COVID-19 vaccines in healthy individuals with past COVID-19 infections seem to provide better immunity than double doses in COVID-19 unexposed individuals. However, it is not known whether the same is true for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) who are on immunosuppressants. MethodsWe identified 30 patients with AIRD who took a single dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine post-COVID-19 infection. Age, sex and disease similar patients were enrolled in to three groups of 30 each who had (1) past infection with COVID-19 but no vaccine, (2) a single dose of ChAdOx1 and (3) double doses of ChAdOx1. Sera were collected from each patient approximately 30 days after last vaccine dose or since the onset of COVID19 symptoms (in the unvaccinated group). Antibodies to spike protein were estimated and virus neutralization potential of sera was tested. ResultsBaseline characteristics including drug usage was similar betweenthe groups. Seroconversion occurred in 25(83%), 23(77%), 27(90%), and 30(100%) in natural infection, single-dose vaccine, double dose vaccine, and infection +single dose vaccine groups respectively. Mean antibody titres (10076.8{+/-}8998) in the last group were at least 6-100x higher than in the other 3 groups. Also, the infection +vaccine group had the highest neutralization potential of 83.37 % as compared to 45.4% in the fully vaccinated group. ConclusionThe hybrid immunity with a single dose of the vector-based vaccine post-infection seems to be superior to double dosage of the vaccine in patients with AIRD. A universal vaccination strategy involving a single dose of vaccine for all individuals with previous COVID-19 infection seems to be effective in these patients also. What is already known about this subject?A single dose of an RNA based COVID-19 vaccine after COVID-19 natural infection provides superior immune protection as compared to double doses of vaccines in infection naive persons A second dose of vaccine in healthy people who had infection previously does not increase the immune protection but may paradoxically induce tolerance Vaccine responses in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases(AIRD) may be suboptimal due to underlying disease or the use of immunosuppressants. What does this study add?Hybrid-induced immunity (single vaccine post COVID-19 infection) produces adequate vaccine responses in patients with AIRD, non-inferior to double dose of vaccine Besides mRNA vaccines, the adenoviral vector vaccine AZD1222 also demonstrates this hybrid phenomenon. How might this impact on clinical practice?Vaccination policies can consider providing only a single vaccine in those who had previous COVID-19 infection. This strategy has been shown not to be harmful for patients with AIRD. This will help reduce vaccine shortages.","Shenoy, Padmanbha; Ahmed, Sakir; Paul, Aby; Cherian, Somi; Umesh, Rashwith; Shenoy, Veena; Vijayan, Anuroopa; Babu, Sageer; Nivin, S; Thambi, Arya",,,361

433425,Associations of working from home with occupational physical activity and sedentary behavior under the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has become a major challenge to public health in China and other countries, considering its pathogenicity across all age groups. Pregnancy is a unique physiological condition, and is characterized by altered immunity and elevated hormone levels to actively tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus, which undergoes a sudden and substantial fluctuation during the immediate postpartum period. Changes in clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of pregnant women during the pre-partum and post-partum periods require further elucidation. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of eight pregnant cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-partum and post-partum periods. Our results showed that four of the eight pregnant women were asymptomatic before delivery but became symptomatic post-partum. Correspondingly, white blood cell (WBC) counts increased and lymphocyte (LYMPH) counts decreased. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the serum also increased to a higher level than those in general pregnancy. Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and CRP, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.","Wu, Chunchen; Yang, Wenzhong; Wu, Xiaoxue; Zhang, Tianzhu; Zhao, Yaoyao; Ren, Wei; Xia, Jianbo",Virol Sin,,361

Methods: We performed literature searches from multiple resources in April and August 2020 for relevant English and Chinese literature. Abstracts were screened, followed by full-text review with data extraction of reports that included at least 20 kidney transplant recipients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and completed outcomes. Results: Twenty studies had sufficient data which we have summarised. Studies were predominantly descriptive and came from France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, UK, and USA. Quality assessment demonstrated limitations in selection of comparison groups and controlling for additional factors. Mortality rates from published studies were variable. Based on early data early from Spain, 46% of patients who developed COVID-19 within 60 days of transplantation died. Acute kidney injury was common, and mycophenolate was discontinued in most patients. Conclusion: Given the rapid global spread of COVID-19, reliable evidence is needed to inform public health policies. Hospitalised kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 are at a high risk of death in early reports but interpretation of this data requires caution as studies were susceptible to period effects. Reassuringly, the quality of observational data is improving. Detailed and comprehensive data collection through linked registries will be necessary to conduct accurate analyses of risk factors for adverse outcomes, not least given the risks of stopping immunosuppression. This report highlights the early mortality excess in transplant recipients but medium and longer-term outcomes remain uncertain and merit careful investigation.","Mahalingasivam, Viyaasan; Craik, Alison; Tomlinson, Laurie A; Ge, Long; Hou, Liangying; Wang, Qi; Yang, Kehu; Fogarty, Damian G; Keenan, Ciara",,,361

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.","Lechien, Jerome R; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; De Siati, Daniele R; Horoi, Mihaela; Le Bon, Serge D; Rodriguez, Alexandra; Dequanter, Didier; Blecic, Serge; El Afia, Fahd; Distinguin, Lea; Chekkoury-Idrissi, Younes; Hans, Stéphane; Delgado, Irene Lopez; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Lavigne, Philippe; Falanga, Chiara; Barillari, Maria Rosaria; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Khalife, Mohamad; Leich, Pierre; Souchay, Christel; Rossi, Camelia; Journe, Fabrice; Hsieh, Julien; Edjlali, Myriam; Carlier, Robert; Ris, Laurence; Lovato, Andrea; De Filippis, Cosimo; Coppee, Frederique; Fakhry, Nicolas; Ayad, Tareck; Saussez, Sven",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,361

439346,The Effect of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life in Children,2020,"(1) Background: China will provide free coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations for the entire population. This study analyzed the COVID-19 vaccination willingness rate (VWR) and its determinants under China's free vaccination policy compared to a paid vaccine. (2) Methods: Data on 2377 respondents were collected through a nationwide questionnaire survey. Multivariate ordered logistic regression models were specified to explore the correlation between the VWR and its determinants. (3) Results: China's free vaccination policy for COVID-19 increased the VWR from 73.62% to 82.25% of the respondents. Concerns about the safety and side-effects were the primary reason for participants' unwillingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Age, medical insurance and vaccine safety were significant determinants of the COVID-19 VWR for both the paid and free vaccine. Income, occupation and vaccine effectiveness were significant determinants of the COVID-19 VWR for the free vaccine. (4) Conclusions: Free vaccinations increased the COVID-19 VWR significantly. People over the age of 58 and without medical insurance should be treated as the target intervention population for improving the COVID-19 VWR. Contrary to previous research, high-income groups and professional workers should be intervention targets to improve the COVID-19 VWR. Strengthening nationwide publicity and education on COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness are recommended policies for decision-makers.","Liu, Rugang; Zhang, Yuxun; Nicholas, Stephen; Leng, Anli; Maitland, Elizabeth; Wang, Jian",,,361

441209,"Association of Symptoms of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity with Problematic Internet Use among University Students in Wuhan, China During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a hypercoagulability state. Clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to severe illness and mortality. Thrombotic complications in COVID-19 have been associated with mortality. The incidence of systemic hypercoagulation in COVID-19 is associated with the process of severe inflammation. The majority of severely ill patients have developed coagulopathy, and this condition is associated with poor outcomes. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man presented with respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection. He presented with tachypnea, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and 74% peripheral oxygen saturation under 15 L/min oxygen per non-rebreather mask. Initial laboratory test results showed severe hypoxemia as per blood gas analysis (pH 7.42, pCO2 23 mmHg, pO2 43 mmHg, HCO3 15 mmol/L, base deficit -9 mmol/L), with increased procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen, creatine kinase myocardial band, and Troponin I. He subsequently developed thrombosis of the pulmonary arteries and multiple branches of the pulmonary vein despite therapeutic anticoagulation. We initiated heparin therapy (average dose 25 191 units per day, mean activated partial thromboplastin time, 64.35 seconds). Radiological investigations revealed multiple thromboses on pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins, as well as multiple locations of brain infarction. Rescue thrombolytic therapy was given, but unfortunately, the patient died due to multiple end-organ failures. CONCLUSIONS Controlling coagulopathy, and thrombolytic therapy type and timing, are critical issues, and new strategies must be sought to lower its morbidity and mortality rates further.","Aribawa, I Gusti Ngurah M; Hidayat, Leonard; Dewi, Putu Utami; Ryalino, Christopher",Am J Case Rep,,361

There is limited data about COVID-19 infection in pregnancy, especially in critically ill patients. Case: A 30-year-old female who presented at 26 weeks gestation with acute severe respiratory distress that required intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We had a high suspicion of COVID-19 disease despite repeated negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, with eventual positive COVID IgG antibody testing. Through an integration of obstetrical knowledge, critical care, and comparing outcomes from similar cases in the literature, we decided to expectantly manage her pregnancy and did not recommend administration of antenatal steroids. She was extubated after 23 days of mechanical ventilation and recovered from her respiratory illness. She had a full-term spontaneous vaginal delivery of a baby boy at 39 weeks gestation with excellent maternal and fetal outcomes at delivery. Conclusion: In the face of COVID-19, a new disease with unclear maternal and fetal outcomes to date, a collaboration of care teams is essential to navigate through the challenging decisions made, including timing of delivery, treatment options, and administration of steroids. Our paper is unique as there is no other published case report of a critically ill pregnant patient with COVID-19 in which delivery was deferred, and a full recovery was observed, with a vaginal delivery at term.","Alsayyed, Farah; Hastings, Victoria; Lederman, Sanford",Case Rep Obstet Gynecol,,361

The aim of this article is to comment on these events from a systemic point of view, referring to systems theories and the non-linear causal relation between human behaviour and the environment. As Bateson stated, linear thinking has led human beings to exploit the environment, causing an ecological crisis and disequilibrium within the system, because the mutual interrelationship and homeostasis mechanisms between humans and their environment were ignored. Taking into account the pandemic and its effects, the new coronavirus provides an opportunity to see otherwise invisible or obscured relational phenomena, such as the mutual relationship between humans and their environment.","Pettini, G.; Mazzocco, K.",Systems Research and Behavioral Science,,361

Eight peptides showed strong inhibition of spike-mediated MERS-CoV cell-cell fusion with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (0.25-2.3 microM). Peptides #4-6 inhibited 95-98.3% of MERS-CoV plaque formation. Notably, peptide four showed strong inhibition of MERS-CoV plaques formation with EC50 = 0.302 microM. All peptides demonstrated safe profiles without cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 10 muM, and this cellular safety, combined with their anti-MERS-CoV antiviral activity, indicate all peptides can be regarded as potential promising antiviral agents.","Kandeel, M.; Yamamoto, M.; Park, B.

(Letter #2),2020,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of four types of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt) of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study included 1,908,197 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 190 countries between 23 January and 13 April 2020. The implemented NPIs were categorised into four types: mandatory face mask in public, isolation or quarantine, social distancing and traffic restriction (referred to as mandatory mask, quarantine, distancing and traffic hereafter, respectively). RESULTS: The implementations of mandatory mask, quarantine, distancing and traffic were associated with changes (95% confidence interval, CI) of -15.14% (from -21.79% to -7.93%), -11.40% (from -13.66% to -9.07%), -42.94% (from -44.24% to -41.60%) and -9.26% (from -11.46% to -7.01%) in the Rt of COVID-19 when compared with those without the implementation of the corresponding measures.

Duration of hospital stay was 6.8{+/-}3.7 days, supplemental oxygen was in 18.4%, non-invasive ventilation in 7.1%, mechanical ventilation in 3.6% and 7.3% died. Unadjusted and age-sex adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals, respectively were, age [≥]50y (4.16, 3.22-5.37 and 4.15,3.21-5.35), men (1.88,1.41-2.51 and 1.26,0.91-1.48); hypertension (2.22,1.74-2.83 and 1.32,1.02-1.70), diabetes (1.88,1.46-2.43 and 1.16,0.89-1.52) and tobacco (1.29,1.02-1.63 and 1.28,1.00-1.63). Need for invasive ventilation was greater in age >50y (3.06,2.18-4.28 and 3.06,2.18-4.29) and diabetes (1.64,1.14-2.35 and 1.12,0.77-1.62). Non-invasive ventilation was more in age [≥]50y (2.27,1.80-2.86 and 2.26,1.79-2.85) and hypertension (1.82,1.41-2.35 and 1.29,0.99-1.69). Multivariate adjustment for presenting factors attenuated the significance. ConclusionCardiovascular risk factors-age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes and tobacco-are associated with greater risk of death and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients in India.","Sharma, Arvind K; Baig, Vaseem Naheed; Sharma, Sonali; Dalela, Gaurav; Panwar, Raja Babu; Katoch, Vishwa Mohan; Gupta, Rajeev",,,361
444199,Clozapine prescribing and safety during COVID-19,2021,"Background Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard surgical treatment of gall bladder disease. However, conversion to open cholecystectomy is inevitable in certain cases. Different centers has reported different conversion rate and factors associated with conversion. Objective To identify the conversion rate, postoperative complication and factors associated with conversion. Method This retrospective study included all laparoscopic cholecystectomy cases attempted in Dhulikhel hospital during the year 2015 and 2016. Records of all patients were reviewed to find out demography of the patients, indications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, rate of conversion to open, underlying reasons for conversion and postoperative complications. Result Out of 644 cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 452 (70.18%) were female and 192 (29.81%) were male with the mean age of 39 years. Over all conversion rate to open cholecystectomy was 1.86% with the frozen calot's triangle as the most common reason for conversion. The overall postoperative complication was found to be 1.24% with no major bile duct injury. Acute cholecystitis is a significant preoperative predictor for the conversion into open cholecystectomy. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can safely be done with low conversion rate and complication. Appreciation of the predictor factors help the patient and surgeon for appropriate treatment plan.","Malla, B R; Shakya, Y R; Rajbhandari, N; Karki, B",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),,361
444200,Clozapine prescribing and safety during COVID-19,2021,"Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) is an uncommon and highly aggressive tumor. There is no HER2 testing protocol for UCS despite the development of HER2 antibody conjugates. We aimed to elucidate histopathological HER2 expression details in UCS, to compare HER2 scores between ASCO/CAP criteria for gastric and breast cancer, and to propose requirements for HER2 testing for UCS. Eighty-nine specimens from 84 patients with metastatic/recurrent UCS were prospectively collected from May 2018 to July 2020. We performed HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 89 specimens and FISH for 44 specimens. HER2 expression details and HER2 score were evaluated according to the latest ASCO/CAP criteria for gastric (2016) and breast cancer (2018). HER2 IHC scores according to the gastric cancer criteria were 0 in 31 cases (35%), 1+ in 26 (29%), 2+ in 22 (25%), and 3+ in 10 cases (11%) of the 89 specimens. A lateral/basolateral membranous staining pattern was observed in 28/32 (88%) specimens with HER2 scores of 2+/3+. HER2 intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 28/32 (88%) of the specimens with HER2 scores of 2+/3+. The overall concordance rate of HER2 score was 70% between the gastric and breast criteria. FISH revealed HER2 gene amplification in 10/44 (23%) specimens containing only lateral/basolateral membranous staining pattern. Based on the histopathological features of HER2 expression in UCS, a scoring system that accepts lateral/basolateral staining patterns should be applied. Furthermore, we proposed specific requirements for UCS testing, including specimen selection, scoring system, and calculating the proportion of HER2-positive cells.","Yoshida, Hiroshi; Nishikawa, Tadaaki; Matsumoto, Koji; Mori, Masahiko; Hirashima, Yasuyuki; Takehara, Kazuhiro; Ariyoshi, Kazuya; Hasegawa, Kosei; Yonemori, Kan",Virchows arch,,361
444785,Infection and death by COVID-19 in a cohort of healthcare workers in Mexico,2021,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has published guidance recommending systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and no corticosteroids for those with nonsevere COVID-19. Although their recommendations for critical cases were based on the results from seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs), those for noncritical cases were based on the results from only one RCT, the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial. In search of additional evidence of corticosteroids' effect on COVID-19, we systematically reviewed controlled observational studies, besides RCTs, that assessed the impact of corticosteroid treatment on any type of mortality and/or other outcomes in noncritical patients. Of the 4037 titles and abstracts screened, we ultimately included the RECOVERY trial and five controlled observational studies using propensity score matching, (accessed on September 8, 2020). Two of the controlled observational studies assessed the association between corticosteroid treatment and in-hospital mortality, without finding statistical significance. Four of the controlled observational studies assessed corticosteroids' effect on other outcomes, demonstrating that they were associated with reduced risk of intubation in patients requiring oxygen and with longer hospitalization and viral shedding in mild or moderate cases. These results support the WHO recommendations not to use corticosteroids for nonsevere COVID-19.","Shuto, Hisayuki; Komiya, Kosaku; Yamasue, Mari; Uchida, Sonoe; Ogura, Takashi; Mukae, Hiroshi; Tateda, Kazuhiro; Hiramatsu, Kazufumi; Kadota, Jun-Ichi",Sci Rep,,361
445348,Risk Communication Effectiveness During COVID-19 Pandemic Among General Population in Saudi Arabia,2021,"A novel statistical model based on a two-layer, contact and information, graph is suggested in order to study the influence of disease prevalence on voluntary general population vaccination during the COVID-19 outbreak. Details about the structure and number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered/vaccinated individuals from the contact layer are simultaneously transferred to the information layer. The ever-growing wealth of information that is becoming available about the COVID virus was modelled at each individual level by a simplified proxy predictor of the amount of disease spread. Each informed individual, a node in a heterogeneous graph, makes a decision about vaccination ""motivated"" by their benefit. The obtained results showed that disease information type, global or local, has a significant impact on an individual vaccination decision. A number of different scenarios were investigated. The scenarios showed that in the case of the stronger impact of globally broadcasted disease information, individuals tend to vaccinate in larger numbers at the same time when the infection has already spread within the population. If individuals make vaccination decisions based on locally available information, the vaccination rate is uniformly spread during infection outbreak duration. Prioritising elderly population vaccination leads to an increased number of infected cases and a higher reduction in mortality. The developed model accuracy allows the precise targeting of vaccination order depending on the individuals' number of social contacts. Precisely targeted vaccination, combined with pre-existing immunity, and public health measures can limit the infection to isolated hotspots inside the population, as well as significantly delay and lower the infection peak.","Jovanovic, Rastko; Davidovic, Milos; Lazovic, Ivan; Jovanovic, Maja; Jovasevic-Stojanovic, Milena",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,361
445486,"Influence of social media exposure on mental health in relation with COVID-19 pandemic in the state of Tamil Nadu, India",2020,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a widespread impact on societies across the globe. As part of the effort to control transmission in the United States, many businesses either closed or instituted nonpharmaceutical control measures and allowed only essential workers on-site. During summer and fall of 2020, employers began formulating ""return to work"" strategies designed to mitigate the risk of transmission among employees. On a population level, several countries implemented national testing and surveillance strategies that proved effective in mitigating citizen-to-citizen transmission and contributed to suppressing COVID-19. A crucial component of many such strategies is population-based testing to identify and engage individuals with asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection, which also is relevant to return-to-work strategies. The authors describe an approach that multisite employers might use to help mitigate transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace. This approach leverages a bioinformatics platform informed by real-time PCR test data at the county and subcounty (eg, Public Use Microdata Area) level, allowing for population-based testing to be selectively targeted for employees in geographies with elevated SARS-CoV-2 positivity. A ""Command Center"" application integrates data from multiple sources (eg, local infection trends, employee symptom diaries, Bluetooth thermometers) in real time, which can be used to inform decisions regarding surveillance and employee self-isolation or quarantine; a mobile phone-based application provides for rapid, secure communication with employees. This overview is based on peer-reviewed literature and the early experience of a large employer with implementing bioinformatics tools to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the workplace.","Plantes, Peter J; Fragala, Maren S; Clarke, Charles; Goldberg, Zachary N; Radcliff, Jeff; Goldberg, Steven E",Popul Health Manag,,361

446631,COVID-19 and its impact on child and adolescent psychiatry - a German and personal perspective,2020,"Perovskite semiconductor nanocrystals have emerged as an excellent family of materials for optoelectronic applications, where biexciton interaction is essential for optical gain generation and quantum light emission. However, the strength of biexciton interaction remains highly controversial due to the entangled spectral features of the exciton- and biexciton-related transitions in conventional measurement approaches. Here, we tackle the limitation by using polarization-dependent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and quantify the excitation energy-dependent biexciton binding energy at cryogenic temperatures. The biexciton binding energy increases with excitation energy, which can be modeled as a near inverse-square size dependence in the effective mass approximation considering the quantum confinement effect. The spectral line width for the exciton-biexciton transition is much broader than that for the ground state to exciton transition, suggesting weakly correlated broadening between these transitions. These inhomogeneity effects should be carefully considered for the future demonstration of optoelectronic applications relying on coherent exciton-biexciton interactions.","Huang, Xinyu; Chen, Lan; Zhang, Chunfeng; Qin, Zhengyuan; Yu, Buyang; Wang, Xiaoyong; Xiao, Min",J Phys Chem Lett,,361

A previous pooled analysis clearly identified elevated D-dimer levels as being associated with severity of COVID-19. Since then, several other studies have provided clearer support for this initial evidence. However, potentially under-recognized by those reporting on D-dimer is the considerable variation in reporting units for D-dimer, and thus also the potential for misreporting of D-dimer data based on poor or incomplete reporting. A PubMed search was used to identify recent papers reporting on D-dimers in COVID-19-based studies. We report that: (1) most publications did not identify either the manufacturer or D-dimer product used; (2) most did not identify whether D-dimer values were reported as D-dimer units (DDU) or fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) (~2 × differences); (3) nearly half did not identify normal cut-off values; (4) some did not report numerical findings or units for D-dimer; (5) where reported, most identified units as either mg/L or µg/mL; (6) we identified at least four errors in reporting from 21 papers. It may not be possible to truly standardize D-dimer assays, but it should be feasible to harmonize D-dimer assays to a single unit of measurement.","Favaloro, Emmanuel J; Thachil, Jecko",Clin Chem Lab Med,,361

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of medical records of patients seen in the Sleep and Circadian Clinic at Brigham Health during the immediate period of 1 month after the national lockdown was announced on March 15, 2020. Patients with OSA were included only if positive airway pressure adherence data were available in the 12 months before and in the month after the lockdown. Patients with other sleep disorders and patients with OSA without adherence data were excluded. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 63.5 ± 13.9 years, 55% of the participants were men, and the mean body mass index was 31.8 ± 7.9 kg/m². Severe OSA was noted among 59.5% compared with 29.3% with moderate OSA, and 11.2% with mild OSA. An increased number of patients reported insomnia after the lockdown (41% vs 48%, P = .02). Sex stratification showed worsening insomnia only among women. There was no significant difference in positive airway pressure adherence as measured by hours of use, self-reported sleep duration, or use of sleep medications.

This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in Covid-19 mortality. Covid-19 mortality rate was calculated as number of deaths per 100 Covid-19 cases. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, linear regressions were applied to a cross-sectional dataset comprising 169 countries. We retrieved data from the Worldometer website, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and Logistics Performance Indicators databases. Covid-19 mortality rate was negatively associated with Covid-19 test number per 100 people (RR = 0.92, P = 0.001), government effectiveness score (RR = 0.96, P = 0.017), and number of hospital beds (RR = 0.85, P < 0.001). Covid-19 mortality rate was positively associated with proportion of population aged 65 or older (RR = 1.12, P < 0.001) and transport infrastructure quality score (RR = 1.08, P = 0.002). Furthermore, the negative association between Covid-19 mortality and test number was stronger among low-income countries and countries with lower government effectiveness scores, younger populations and fewer hospital beds. Predicted mortality rates were highly associated with observed mortality rates (r = 0.77; P < 0.001). Increasing Covid-19 testing, improving government effectiveness and increasing hospital beds may have the potential to attenuate Covid-19 mortality.","Liang, Li-Lin; Tseng, Ching-Hung; Ho, Hsiu J; Wu, Chun-Ying",Sci Rep,,361

We analyzed the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases to determine individual risk factors for COVID-19 related illness, with consideration to demographic information, pre-existing patient conditions and their relationship to severity of COVID-19 related illness.MethodsWe collected data from a convenience sampling of patients who received care at a multicenter healthcare system in southern California between March and August 2020. Data from this retrospective review of the electronic health record included demographics (age, gender, BMI and ethnicity), blood type, certain medications and mortality risk by way of the updated Charlson Comorbidity index (CCI), which includes 12 categories of comorbidity predicting 1-year mortality (Quan et al., 2011). Cases were stratified by severity (discharged home from Emergency Department, admitted as an inpatient to a non-acute care setting, admitted as a patient to an acute care setting, need for intubation, and survivability. ANOVA was used as a test of difference;Pearson r and eta were used as tests of association. ResultsOf 5,559 cases reviewed, 391 cases had complete data available for analysis. Eighteen cases (0.05%) were discharged home from the Emergency Department, 65 (16.6%) were admitted to a non-acute setting and 308 (78.8%) were admitted to an acute care setting. 176 (45%) cases required endotracheal intubation, and of the total sample, 100 (25.6) patients expired. Age (p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.666), gender (p &lt; 0.001, η = 0.351), BMI (p = 0.042, η = 0.906) and history of Diabetes (p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.309) were strongly correlated with patient disposition (discharge vs. non-acute, vs. acute). Age (p &lt;0.001, r = 0.557), Gender (p &lt;0.001, r = 0.307), BMI (p = 0.021, η = 0.915), and Beta Blocker use (p &lt;0.001, r = 0.306) were strongly correlated to risk for intubation, and Age (p &lt; 0.001, η = 605), BMI (p = 0.015, η = 0.905) and CCI (p &lt; 0.001, η = 0.3), were strongly correlated with survivability. ConclusionsOur analysis contributes further understanding of risk stratification of severity of illness in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Hypertension has been frequently reported in the literature to be an important risk factor for COVID-19 related illness. However, in our analysis, it was not strongly correlated to the outcomes under investigation.","Graham, J. K.; Failla, K.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,361

Purpose To determine the changes in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. Materials and Methods This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). Results Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25-63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (±standard deviation) of 4 days ± 1 (range, 1-8 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days ± 4 (range, 11-26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2 = 0.25, P < .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0-4 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 ± 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5-8 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 ± 4; P = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9-13 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 ± 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (&#8805;14 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 ± 4) without crazy-paving pattern. Conclusion In patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (without severe respiratory distress during the disease course), lung abnormalities on chest CT scans showed greatest severity approximately 10 days after initial onset of symptoms. © RSNA, 2020.","Pan, Feng; Ye, Tianhe; Sun, Peng; Gui, Shan; Liang, Bo; Li, Lingli; Zheng, Dandan; Wang, Jiazheng; Hesketh, Richard L; Yang, Lian; Zheng, Chuansheng",Radiology,,361
452431,Indications of Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: Comparison of National Survey and Twitter Data,2021,"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that have shown in vitro activity on the replication of certain coronaviruses. In the context of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), these two drugs have been proposed as possible treatments. The results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with COVID-19, due to major methodological weaknesses. Yet, these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest, raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use. In the absence of evidence of clinical benefits, the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of COVID-19. In addition, widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials. The chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide. This represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated. In the context of emergency, rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have, as soon as possible, reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease. Meanwhile, serious adverse drug reactions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine, justifying to limit its prescription, and to perform suitable cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring.","Roustit, M; Guilhaumou, R; Molimard, M; Drici, M-D; Laporte, S; Montastruc, J-L",Therapie,,361

The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the association between DIC and its comorbidities. Results: Out of 154 non-survivors, non-overt DIC was observed in 94.8% of the patients, whereas only 5.2% fulfilled the overt criteria of DIC with a mean age 64.6 years. The mortality rate was 4.5 times higher among men than women. The D-dimer level was >250 ng/ml in 68.8% of the patients including 88.9% of the non-overt and 100% of the overt DIC patients. Prothrombin time (PT) in non-overt and overt DIC cases was 17.3 s and 24.4 s, respectively. Thrombotic event and chronic kidney disease were found to be the main predictors of DIC (p < 0.0001 and 0.03, respectively) followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (statistically insignificant). Conclusions: Our study concludes that the ISTH DIC score cannot predict mortality as the COVID-19 related DIC differs from the sepsis-induced DIC. Among the seriously ill, older patients with comorbidities, increased levels of D-dimer and prolonged PT are more reliable parameters among COVID-19 non-survivors.","Anwar, Nimra; Tashfeen, Sunila; Akhtar, Fahim; Noor, Afshan; Khan, Saleem Ahmed; Omair, Ahmad",,,361

Ambulant trauma surgery was minimised to reduce risk of contracting COVID-19. Operating capacity significantly reduced and surgical training dramatically curtailed. Locally, a private hospital has been utilised as a green site with consultant-lead trauma lists. Our aim is to review the safety and efficiency of this service. Method: Patients underwent pre-assessment, COVID-19 swabs and 7 days isolation pre and post-op. Staff also underwent swabbing. Prospectively data was gathered for all patients operated on at this site from 12/05/2020 to 20/08/2020. Records reviewed for readmission, complications and COVID status. A satisfaction questionnaire was sent to trainees who operated at this site. Results: 79 operations were completed during this period. 50 male and 29 female, average age 49, average ASA 2. No complications or COVID-19 infections were recorded. Mean time to theatre was 18 days. Delays to theatre led to 2 complications. 87% of trainees felt training was maintained. Conclusions: Establishing a green site enabled efficient and safe management whilst still facilitating surgical training. This requires clear guidelines for staff and patients. We believe this model can help trauma service provision as the pandemic evolves.","Biggs, A.; Moore, E.; Zbaeda, M.; Shah, K.; Keightley, A.",British Journal of Surgery,,361

Aim of this study is to report results of patients with COVID-19-positive swab, in the perioperative period after surgery. Data of COVID-19-positive patients undergoing emergent or oncological surgery, were collected in a retrospective, multicenter study, which involved 20 Italian institutions. Collected parameters were age, sex, body mass index, COVID-19-related symptoms, patients' comorbidities, surgical procedure, personal protection equipment (PPE) used in operating rooms, rate of postoperative infection among healthcare staff and complications, within 30-postoperative days. 68 patients, who underwent surgery, resulted COVID-19-positive in the perioperative period. Symptomatic patients were 63 (92.5%). Fever was the main symptom in 36 (52.9%) patients, followed by dyspnoea (26.5%) and cough (13.2%). We recorded 22 (32%) intensive care unit admissions, 23 (33.8%) postoperative pulmonary complications and 15 (22%) acute respiratory distress syndromes. As regards the ten postoperative deaths (14.7%), 6 cases were related to surgical complications. One surgeon, one scrub nurse and two circulating nurses were infected after surgery due to the lack of specific PPE. We reported less surgery-related pulmonary complications and mortality in Sars-CoV-2-infected patients, than in literature. Emergent and oncological surgery should not be postponed, but it is mandatory to use full PPE, and to adopt preoperative screenings and strategies that mitigate the detrimental effect of pulmonary complications, mostly responsible for mortality.","De Luca, Maurizio; Sartori, Alberto; Vitiello, Antonio; Piatto, Giacomo; Noaro, Giulia; Olmi, Stefano; Foschi, Diego; De Re, Luca; Zappa, Marco; Sarro, Giuliano; Rivolta, Umberto; Giraudo, Giorgio; Borghi, Felice; Pozzo, Gabriele; Sorisio, Vincenzo; Pignata, Giusto; Greco, Paola Antonella; Sisti, Valerio; Campagnaro, Tommaso; Guglielmi, Alfredo; Andreuccetti, Jacopo; Di Leo, Alberto; Lauro, Enrico; Ricci, Francesco; Musella, Mario; Zizzo, Maurizio; Bonacini, Stefano; Podda, Mauro; Pisanu, Adolfo; Coletta, Pietro; Guerrieri, Mario; Caracino, Valerio; Basti, Massimo; Pilone, Vincenzo; Raffaelli, Marco; Oragano, Luigi",Updates surg.

This infection quickly has progressed to a global pandemic since March 2020, with very high human-to-human transmission rate. Besides lung injury, COVID-19 is also associated with cardio and neurovascular complications. Herein, we report the case of a 77-year-old female who presented with non-severe COVID-19 and multiple ischemic strokes secondary to an extensive carotid thrombosis. The ischemic stroke was supposed to have been caused by the cytokine storm related to COVID-19. The possibility of hemorrhagic transformation, based on the assessment of bleeding score, limited the use of anticoagulation, and probably explained the stroke recurrence and poor outcome in our patient. The pathogenic mechanism and the management of this complex situation are still lacking and further studies are needed.","Aasfara, Jehanne; Jidane, Said; Laarje, Aziza; Yamani, Khalid El; Belyamani, Lahcen; Tijani, Youssef",Pan Afr Med J,,361

We investigated the relationship between socioeconomic determinants of health obtained from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and COVID-19 incidence and mortality at the county level in Georgia. METHODS: We analyzed data on COVID-19 incidence and case-fatality rates (CFRs) from the Georgia Department of Public Health from March 1 through August 31, 2020. We used repeated measures generalized linear mixed models to determine differences over time in Georgia counties among quartile health rankings of health outcomes, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. RESULTS: COVID-19 incidence per 100 000 population increased across all quartile county groups for all health rankings (range, 23.1-51.6 in May to 688.4-1062.0 in August). COVID-19 CFRs per 100 000 population peaked in April and May (range, 3312-6835) for all health rankings, declined in June and July (range, 827-5202), and increased again in August (range, 1877-3310). Peak CFRs occurred later in counties with low health rankings for health behavior and clinical care and in counties with high health rankings for social and economic factors and physical environment. All interactions between the health ranking quartile variables and month were significant (P < .001). County-level Gini indices were associated with significantly higher rates of COVID-19 incidence (P < .001) but not CFRs. CONCLUSIONS: From March through August 2020, COVID-19 incidence rose in Georgia's counties independent of health rankings categorization. Differences in time to peak CFRs differed at the county level based upon key health rankings. Public health interventions should incorporate unique strategies to improve COVID-19-related patient outcomes in these environments.","Berman, Adam E; Miller, D Douglas; Rahn, Daniel W; Hess, David C; Thompson, Mark A; Mossialos, Elias A; Waller, Jennifer L",Public Health Rep,,361

This population is also at risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to understand the impact of coexistent hip fracture and SARS-CoV-2 for informed decision-making at patient and service levels. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of older (> 60 years) people with fragility hip fractures and outcomes with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was early (30-day or in-hospital) mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay and key clinical characteristics known to be associated with outcomes after hip fracture. RESULTS: A total of 14 cohort and five case series studies were included (692 SARS-CoV-2 positive, 2,585 SARS-CoV-2 negative). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an overall risk ratio (RR) for early mortality of 4.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.42 to 5.82). Early mortality was 34% (95% CI 30% to 38%) and 9% (95% CI 8% to 10%) in the infected and noninfected groups respectively. Length of stay was increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (mean difference (MD) 5.2 days (3.2 to 7.2)). Age (MD 1.6 years (0.3 to 2.9)); female sex (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.05)); admission from home (RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.00)); presence of dementia (RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.43)); and intracapsular fracture (RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.11)) were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were statistically, but not clinically, significantly greater Nottingham Hip Fracture Scores in infected compared with non-infected patients (MD 0.7 (0.4 to 0.9)). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with worse outcomes after hip fracture. This is not explained by differences in patient characteristics. These data can be used to support informed decision-making and may help track the impact of widespread adoption of system-level and therapeutic changes in management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Limited understanding of complications in cancer progression, its development system, and their interactions are major restrictions towards the progress of optimal and effective treatment strategies. The system-level approach has been designed to explore genetic complexity of the disease and to identify novel oral cancer related genes to detect genomic alterations at molecular level, through cDNA differential analysis. We analyzed 21 oral cancer-related cDNA datasets and listed 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among 30, we found 6 significant DEGs including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ADCY2, C7, SERPINB5, and ANAPC13 and studied their functional role in OC. Our genomic and interactive analysis showed significant enrichment of xenobiotics metabolism, p53 signaling pathway and microRNA pathways, towards OC progression and development. We used human proteomic data for post-translational modifications to interpret disease mutations and inter-individual genetic variations. The mutational analysis revealed the sequence predicted disordered region of 14%, 12.5%, 10.5% for ADCY2, CYP1B1, and C7 respectively. The MiRNA target prediction showed functional molecular annotation including specific miRNA-targets hsa-miR-4282, hsa-miR-2052, hsa-miR-216a-3p, for CYP1B1, C7, and ADCY2 respectively associated with oral cancer. We constructed the system level network and found important gene signatures. The drug-gene interaction of OC source genes with seven FDA approved OC drugs help to design or identify new drug target or establishing novel biomedical linkages regarding disease pathophysiology. This investigation demonstrates the importance of system genetics for identifying 6 OC genes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ADCY2, C7, SERPINB5, and ANAPC13) as potential drugs targets. Our integrative network-based system-level approach would help to find the genetic variants of OC that can accelerate drug discovery outcomes to develop a better understanding regarding treatment strategies for many cancer types.","Abbas, Syeda Zahra; Qadir, Muhammad Imran; Muhammad, Syed Aun",Sci Rep,,361

To effectively and efficiently respond to unmet medical needs, efforts should be directed towards revolutionizing the predictive capability of non-clinical surrogates that inform drug discovery and development programs. I developed this mini special issue amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate recent advancements and opportunities for four main subthemes that support drug discovery and development including prediction of metabolic pathways, translational pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, pharmacogenomics, and trends in bioanalysis. Scientific papers in these areas were covered by investigators from the International Society for the Study of Xenobiotics New Investigator Group and other investigators.

Here, we describe two women infected with SARS-CoV-2 whose real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results and symptoms changed during the menstrual cycle. The first patient developed a fever on the first day of her menstrual period, and again on the first day of her next menstrual period after hospital discharge. RT-PCR test results were positive during the first menstrual period before admission, but turned negative during hospitalization, and then were positive again during the second menstrual period after hospital discharge. Another one also developed a fever again on the first day of her menstrual period after hospital discharge. RT-PCR test results were negative before admission and during hospitalization, but turned positive during the first menstrual period after hospital discharge. The cases indicate sex hormones may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There are no widely available licensed therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, highlighting an urgent need for effective interventions. The virus enters host cells through binding of a receptor-binding domain within its trimeric spike glycoprotein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In this article, we describe the generation and characterization of a panel of murine mAbs directed against the receptor-binding domain. One mAb, 2B04, neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with remarkable potency (half-maximal inhibitory concentration of <2 ng/ml). In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2B04 protected challenged animals from weight loss, reduced lung viral load, and blocked systemic dissemination. Thus, 2B04 is a promising candidate for an effective antiviral that can be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Alsoussi, Wafaa B; Turner, Jackson S; Case, James B; Zhao, Haiyan; Schmitz, Aaron J; Zhou, Julian Q; Chen, Rita E; Lei, Tingting; Rizk, Amena A; McIntire, Katherine M; Winkler, Emma S; Fox, Julie M; Kafai, Natasha M; Thackray, Larissa B; Hassan, Ahmed O; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Watson, Corey T; Kleinstein, Steven H; Fremont, Daved H; Diamond, Michael S; Ellebedy, Ali H",J. immunol,,361

Therefore, scientific prevention and control strategies and effective intervention measures are the only ways to solve the world problem. In the determination of intervention measures, not only the effectiveness evaluation, but also accessibility, treatment cost, inventory and production capacity and other relevant sociological issues shall be considered, especially in low and middle-income countries and regions. With the introduction of clinical epidemiological experiment design and evidence-based medicine evidence evaluation into the evaluation of curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), TCM has officially entered the studies of syndrome regularity of new public health emergencies(such as SARS and influenza) clearly diagnosed by modern medicine for many years, as well as the development of relevant guidelines, consensus and paths. The results of curative effect show that TCM could significantly alleviate symptoms, control disease and tendency, reduce the occurrence of critical illness, and improve the clinical efficacy and the prognosis and quality of life of patients, which fully reflects the consciousness and self-confidence of traditional Chinese medicine workers. For the evidence-based evaluation of TCM intervention in new public health emergencies, the basic principles and general methods of clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine shall be followed to obtain high-quality evidence; besides, we shall also fully realize that clinical scientific study is carried out with the epidemic treatment as the primary task. The scientific hypothesis comes from the clinical problems unsolved. The scientific study conclusions aim to give feedbacks to clinical diagnosis and treatment regimens. The core elements of clinical trials are population(P), intervention(I), control(C), outcome(O), which are abbreviated as &quot;PICO&quot;. The evaluation of intervention measures for new public health emergencies with traditional Chinese medicine shall have clear study objectives and a high quality, with a correct analysis method as the guarantee of real and reliable results. Then, the selection of patients, the de-finition of intervention measures and control measures, the development of end-point indicators, the clinical quality control under special epidemics, the data verification, and the data analysis methods to be adopted are all characteristics and key points that need special consideration. It is suggested that scientific experimental design, rigorous collection and scientific data analysis shall be conducted to reflect the therapeutic value of traditional Chinese medicine, so that the study results could be adopted and shared, and become the scientific evidence for China and even the global to republish the diagnosis and treatment regimens.","Wang, Lian-Xin; Xie, Yan-Ming",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,361

Drawing expectations from resilience theory, this paper explores how the trajectory of and research community around the coronavirus research was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Characterizing epistemic clusters and pathways of knowledge through extracting terms featured in articles in early COVID-19 research, combined with evolutionary pathways and statistical analysis, the results reveal that the pandemic disrupted existing lines of coronavirus research to a large degree. While some communities of coronavirus research are similar pre- and during COVID-19, topics themselves change significantly and there is less cohesion amongst early COVID-19 research compared to that before the pandemic. We find that some lines of research revert to basic research pursued almost a decade earlier, whilst others pursue brand new trajectories. The epidemiology topic is the most resilient among the many subjects related to COVID-19 research. Chinese researchers in particular appear to be driving more novel research approaches in the early months of the pandemic. The findings raise questions about whether shifts are advantageous for global scientific progress, and whether the research community will return to the original equilibrium or reorganize into a different knowledge configuration.","Zhang, Yi; Cai, Xiaojing; Fry, Caroline V; Wu, Mengjia; Wagner, Caroline S",Scientometrics,,361

Consequently, proteolytic activity plays an important role in fundamental cellular processes such as differentiation and migration, immunological and inflammatory reactions, apoptosis and survival. During virus infection, host proteases are involved in several processes, from cell entry to initiation, progression and resolution of inflammation. On the other hand, many viruses encode their own highly specific proteases, responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral proteins, but, at the same time, to cleave host proteins to corrupt antiviral host responses and adjust protein activity to favor viral replication. Traditionally, protease substrate identification has been addressed by means of hypothesis-driven approaches, but recent advances in proteomics have made a toolkit available to uncover the extensive repertoire of host proteins cleaved during infection, either by viral or host proteases. Here, we review the currently available proteomics-based methods that can and have contributed to the systematic and unbiased identification of new protease substrates in the context of virus-host interactions. The role of specific proteases during the course of virus infections will also be highlighted.","Martiáñez-Vendrell, Xavier; Kikkert, Marjolein",Adv Virus Res,,361

We examined recent numbers of stroke consults, their age and deficits in a large telestroke program and compared them to 2019 Hypothesis: Increased younger stroke consults in 2020 would involve higher deficits associated with COVID19. Methods: The Institute for Digital Health & Innovation-Stroke Program provides neurology support to 54 spoke hospitals across Arkansas. Stroke consults who received Alteplase during 01/01/20 to 07/31/20 were compared to the same months in 2019. Retrospective analysis included consult age, geographical region, mechanical thrombectomy (MT), deficits (initial and post NIHSS) and outcomes. Age was listed as &lt; 65 or &gt;/=65 yrs. The state was blocked into seven geographical regions. MT was noted and deficits as improved, worsened, same (no improvement) or unknown. COVID19 positivity was unknown. Results: Consult numbers declined in 2020 vs. 2019, 285 vs. 370, respectively. Both years saw MT in approximately 10%;however, 27% went to hospice or expired in 2020 vs. 7.7% in 2019. In 2020 and 2019, those &lt; 65 consults who received MT were similar at 37 and 41% of total procedures, respectively. Pre-pandemic, there were significant differences in consult numbers among the seven regions (X2=30.1,n=370,p=0.037) in 2020, there were none (p=NS). The number of consults &lt; 65 or &gt;/= 65 years were not different between years(p=0.61);however, age had a similar significant effect on the initial NIHSS in both 2019 and 2020 (X2=13.5,n=370,p=0.0037 and X2=10.8,n=285,p=0.012, respectively). Improvement in initial deficit scores did not change (X2=6.9,n=655,p=0.074). No geographical differences were seen (p=0.66). Monthly initial deficits indicated a significant peak risein the younger consults (&lt; 65) in April 2020. Conclusion: Stroke consult numbers declined by 13% in 2020 but the proportion of young and oldwere unchanged. In April 2020, younger consults (&lt; 65) experienced a spike in deficits.

We aim to describe the proportion of evidence on the effect of interventions for COVID-19 from preprints and journal articles and map changes in evidence between and within different sources reporting on the same study. METHODS: Meta-research study. We screened the Cochrane living systematic review and network meta-analysis (COVID-NMA) database to identify all preprints and journal articles on all studies assessing interventions for COVID-19 published up to 15 August 2020. We compared all evidence sources (i.e., preprint and associated journal article) and the first and latest versions of preprints for each study to identify changes in two evidence components: study results (e.g., numeric change in hazard ratio, odds ratio, event rate, or change in p value > or < 0.05 in any outcome) and abstract conclusions (classified as positive, negative or neutral regarding the intervention effect, and as reporting uncertainty in the findings or not). Changes in study results were further classified as important changes if they (1) represented a change in any effect estimate by &#8805; 10% and/or (2) led to a change in the p value crossing the threshold of 0.05. RESULTS: We identified 556 studies. In total, 338 (61%) had been reported in a preprint: 66 (20%) of these had an associated journal article (median time to publication 76 days [interquartile range (IQR) 55-106]) and 91 (27%) had > 1 preprint version. A total of 139 studies (25% of the overall sample) were reported in multiple evidence sources or versions of the same source: for 63 (45%), there was a change in at least one evidence component between or within sources (42 [30%] had a change in study results, and in 29 [21%] the change was classified as important; 33 [24%] had a change in the abstract conclusion). For studies with both a preprint and an article, a median of 29% (IQR 14-50) of total citations were attributed to the preprint instead of the article. CONCLUSIONS: Results on the effect of interventions for COVID-19 are often reported in multiple evidence sources or source versions for a single study. Evidence is not stable between and within evidence sources. Real-time linkage of all sources per study could help to keep systematic reviews up-to-date.","Oikonomidi, Theodora; Boutron, Isabelle; Pierre, Olivier; Cabanac, Guillaume; Ravaud, Philippe",BMC Med,,361

We, therefore, examined reports on interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and histamine receptor antagonists. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed by 19 September 2020, and updated on 28 October 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar using (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (histamine antagonist OR famotidine OR cimetidine). ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and (famotidine or histamine). RESULTS: Famotidine may be a useful addition in COVID-19 treatment, but the results from prospective randomized trials are as yet awaited. Bioinformatics/drug repurposing studies indicated that, among several medicines, H1 and H2 receptor antagonists may interact with key viral enzymes. However, in vitro studies have to date failed to show a direct inhibition of famotidine on SARS-CoV-2 replication. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical research into the potential benefits of H2 receptor antagonists in managing COVID-19 inflammation began from a simple observation and now is being tested in multi-centre clinical trials. The positive effects of famotidine may be due to H2 receptor-mediated immunomodulatory actions on mast cell histamine-cytokine cross-talk, rather than a direct action on SARS-CoV-2.","Ennis, Madeleine; Tiligada, Katerina",Inflamm. res,,361

The aim of this study was to characterize the extent to which NYC metropolitan area school websites communicated to students their updated mental health service offerings, psychoeducational information related to COVID-19, and community-based resources after the abrupt end to on-campus services during the Spring semester. A total of 138 websites were analyzed. Overall, only half of the surveyed web pages provided information about remote counseling, and just under two thirds of schools (57.97%) had directions for students experiencing a mental health emergency. As predicted, enrollment size was associated with whether psychoeducation about mental health and COVID-19 and information about remote counseling were available on a school's website. In both cases, medium-sized schools were the most likely to have these resources available on their websites as compared to small and large-sized schools. College counseling center web pages should include robust and current information that targets schools' diverse student bodies.","Seidel, Erica J; Mohlman, Jan; Basch, Corey H; Fera, Joseph; Cosgrove, Alison; Ethan, Danna",J Community Health,,361
474540,Safeguarding the physical health of people with severe mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Alveolar type II (ATII) cells are a key structure of the distal lung epithelium, where they exert their innate immune response and serve as progenitors of alveolar type I (ATI) cells, contributing to alveolar epithelial repair and regeneration. In the healthy lung, ATII cells coordinate the host defense mechanisms, not only generating a restrictive alveolar epithelial barrier, but also orchestrating host defense mechanisms and secreting surfactant proteins, which are important in lung protection against pathogen exposure. Moreover, surfactant proteins help to maintain homeostasis in the distal lung and reduce surface tension at the pulmonary air-liquid interface, thereby preventing atelectasis and reducing the work of breathing. ATII cells may also contribute to the fibroproliferative reaction by secreting growth factors and proinflammatory molecules after damage. Indeed, various acute and chronic diseases are associated with intensive inflammation. These include oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, fibrosis and numerous interstitial lung diseases, and are characterized by hyperplastic ATII cells which are considered an essential part of the epithelialization process and, consequently, wound healing. The aim of this review is that of revising the physiologic and pathologic role ATII cells play in pulmonary diseases, as, despite what has been learnt in the last few decades of research, the origin, phenotypic regulation and crosstalk of these cells still remain, in part, a mystery.","Ruaro, Barbara; Salton, Francesco; Braga, Luca; Wade, Barbara; Confalonieri, Paola; Volpe, Maria Concetta; Baratella, Elisa; Maiocchi, Serena; Confalonieri, Marco",Int. j. mol. sci.

COVID-19’s Impact on Patients With Eating Disorders: The Relationship Between Eating Disorder/Mental Health Symptoms and Eating Disorder Motivation to Recover,2021,"This paper makes the case for immediate planning for a COVID-19 vaccination uptake strategy in advance of vaccine availability for two reasons: first, the need to build a consensus about the order in which groups of the population will get access to the vaccine; second, to reduce any fear and concerns that exist in relation to vaccination and to create demand for vaccines. A key part of this strategy is to counter the anti-vaccination movement that is already promoting hesitancy and resistance. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a tsunami of misinformation and conspiracy theories that have the potential to reduce vaccine uptake. To make matters worse, sections of populations in many countries display low trust in governments and official information about the pandemic and how the officials are tackling it. This paper aims to set out in short form critical guidelines that governments and regional bodies should take to enhance the impact of a COVID-19 vaccination strategy. We base our recommendations on a review of existing best practice guidance. This paper aims to assist those responsible for promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake to digest the mass of guidance that exists and formulate an effective locally relevant strategy.

479138,All Hands on Deck: The Federal Health Care Response to the COVID-19 National Emergency,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pregnant women suffer from varying levels of pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) which can negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess PRA and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 on 318 pregnant women purposively recruited from primary healthcare centers in Sari and Amol, Iran. Data were collected using questionnaires (PRAQ, Edinburg, KAP of COVID-19, CDA-Q and Demographic questionnaire), which were provided to participants through the social media or were completed for them over telephone. Data were analyzed with the linear regression and the logistic regression analysis, at the significance level of 0.05 using the SPSS software (v. 21). RESULTS: Around 21% of participants had PRA, 42.1% had depression, and 4.4% had COVID-19 anxiety. The significant predictors of PRA were number of pregnancies (P = 0.008), practice regarding COVID-19 (P < 0.001), COVID-19 anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P < 0.001), and social support (P = 0.025) which explained 19% of the total variance. Depression and COVID-19 anxiety increased the odds of PRA by respectively four times and 13%, while good practice regarding COVID-19 decreased the odds by 62%. CONCLUSION: Around 21% of pregnant women suffer from PRA during the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant predictors of PRA during the pandemic include number of pregnancies, practice regarding COVID-19, COVID-19 anxiety, depression, and social support. These findings can be used to develop appropriate strategies for the management of mental health problems during pregnancy in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hamzehgardeshi, Zeinab; Omidvar, Shabnam; Amoli, Arman Asadi; Firouzbakht, Mojgan",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,361

This paradigm shift has raised questions concerning how these institutions reinvented themselves and modified their edu-communicative strategies to promote heritage through active citizen participation. The present study centers on analyzing how the main Spanish archaeological museums and sites (N = 254) have used Twitter as an edu-communicative tool and analyzes the content of their hashtags through a mixed methodology. The objective is to identify the educational strategies for both transmitting information as well as interacting with users. We did it by observing and analyzing if Spanish archaeological institutions are promoting a type of quality, accessible, and egalitarian education and promoting the creation of cyber communities that ensure the sustainability of heritage through citizen participation. This paper proposes an innovative assessment of communication on Twitter based on the purpose of messages from the viewpoint of heritage education, their r-elational factor, and predominant type of learning. The main findings reveal a significant increase in Twitter activity, both in quantitative and qualitative terms: educational content is gaining primacy over the simple sharing of basic information and promotional content.

Healthcare personnel are particularly exposed to additional stressors. OBJECTIVE: To identify the mental burden, resilience, tendency towards absenteeism and associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in an anonymous cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data on sociodemographics, occupational situation, contact to COVID-19 patients, mental burden, stressors, resilience, risk and protective factors were assessed among a convenience sample of healthcare personnel in spring 2020 (5 April 2020-7 May 2020). A comparison with the general population in Germany before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. RESULTS: After the evaluation of 650 completed questionnaires, an increased mental burden was found compared to the German general population before the pandemic, while the mental burden was reduced compared to the general population during the pandemic. The self-reported resilience was slightly higher compared to the general population before and during the pandemic. The COVID-19-related stressors and worries were the most important risk factors, self-efficacy and optimism the most important protective factors. The mental burden was moderately correlated with the intention to change the profession and the tendency towards absenteeism. CONCLUSION: Mental burden in healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a higher tendency towards taking sick leave. In order to support healthcare personnel interventions that foster resources, such as self-efficacy and optimism should be offered to particularly vulnerable groups .","Röthke, Nikolaus; Wollschläger, Daniel; Kunzler, Angela M; Rohde, Annika; Molter, Stefan; Bodenstein, Marc; Reif, Andreas; Walter, Henrik; Lieb, Klaus; Tüscher, Oliver",Nervenarzt,,361

However, due to limited contact, adequate rehabilitation is difficult to provide for quarantined patients. Telerehabilitation technology could be a solution; however, issues specific to COVID-19 should be taken into consideration, such as strict quarantine and respiratory symptoms, as well as accessibility to deal with rapid increases in need due to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and to investigate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation system for patients who are quarantined due to COVID-19 by combining existing commercial devices and computer applications. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team has identified the requirements for a telerehabilitation system for COVID-19 and developed the system to satisfy those requirements. In the subsequent feasibility study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=10; mean age 60 years, SD 18 years) were included. A single session of telerehabilitation consisted of stretching exercises, a 15-minute exercise program, and a video exercise program conducted under real-time guidance by a physical therapist through a video call. The system included a tablet computer, a pulse oximeter, videoconferencing software, and remote control software. The feasibility of the system was evaluated using the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ; 14 items) and an additional questionnaire on the telerehabilitation system (5 items). Each item was rated from ""1 = strongly disagree"" to ""5 = strongly agree."" RESULTS: The telerehabilitation system was developed by combining existing devices and applications, including a pulse oximeter and remote control mechanism, to achieve user-friendliness, affordability, and safety, which were determined as the system requirements. In the feasibility study, 9 out of 10 patients were able to use the telerehabilitation system without any on-site help. On the TSQ, the mean score for each item was 4.7 (SD 0.7), and in the additional items regarding telerehabilitation, the mean score for each item was 4.3 (SD 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility of this simple telerehabilitation system in quarantined patients with COVID-19, encouraging further investigation on the merit of the system's use in clinical practice.","Mukaino, Masahiko; Tatemoto, Tsuyoshi; Kumazawa, Nobuhiro; Tanabe, Shigeo; Katoh, Masaki; Saitoh, Eiichi; Otaka, Yohei",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,,361

482257,"Assessment of Knowledge Attitude and Practice Regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Outbreak among General Population of Karachi, Pakistan",2020,"Mandatory attendance, particularly in didactic settings, is a highly debated topic in higher education, including dental education. Within dental education, a large portion of education occurs in preclinical laboratories and clinical environments. There is little to no research on attendance in these settings in dental schools. This point/counterpoint paper examines the pros and cons of mandatory attendance in these highly specialized educational settings. With the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 and continues to impact dental education at the time of publication, this topic has become even more relevant. Viewpoint 1 claims that attendance should be mandatory because a greater exposure to preclinical and clinical environments helps foster better clinical hand skills, critical thinking, decision-making, problem-solving skills, and an overall sense of professional identity. It goes on further to suggest that there may be a link between attendance and performance in exams and that attendance is part of the dental school's responsibility. Viewpoint 2 argues that the rationale for attendance is complex, and that creating learning environments that are psychologically safe will incentivize students to attend, even without mandatory attendance policies. Furthermore, it explains that technological advances have allowed dental schools to think creatively about asynchronous learning, which by its very nature does not require attendance at a given time. The authors of both viewpoints conclude that the preclinical and clinical education and experience are critical dental education and that dental school leaders should focus on improving the quality of these experiences.","Saeed, Sophia G; Bain, Jennifer L; Khoo, Edmund; Siqueira, Walter L; van der Hoeven, Ransome",J. dent. educ,,361

484197,Letter to editor- How has COVID-19 school closure impacted parental mental health?,2021,"BACKGROUND: At the end of February 2020, the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China had drastically slowed and appeared to be under control compared to the peak data in early February of that year. However, the outcomes of COVID-19 control and prevention measures varied between regions (ie, provinces and municipalities) in China; moreover, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and the spread of the disease has accelerated in countries outside China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish valid models to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention among various regions in China. These models also targeted regions with control and prevention problems by issuing immediate warnings. METHODS: We built a mathematical model, the Epidemic Risk Time Series Model, and used it to analyze two sets of data, including the daily COVID-19 incidence (ie, newly diagnosed cases) as well as the daily immigration population size. RESULTS: Based on the results of the model evaluation, some regions, such as Shanghai and Zhejiang, were successful in COVID-19 control and prevention, whereas other regions, such as Heilongjiang, yielded poor performance. The evaluation result was highly correlated with the basic reproduction number (R0) value, and the result was evaluated in a timely manner at the beginning of the disease outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The Epidemic Risk Time Series Model was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention in different regions in China based on analysis of immigration population data. Compared to other methods, such as R0, this model enabled more prompt issue of early warnings. This model can be generalized and applied to other countries to evaluate their COVID-19 control and prevention.","Huang, Qiangsheng; Kang, Yu Sunny",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,361

Because the repertoires are highly diverse, specialized software methods are needed to extract meaningful information from BCR and TCR sequence data. Here, we review recent developments in bioinformatics tools for analysis of BCR and TCR repertoires, with an emphasis on those that incorporate structural features. After describing the recent sequencing technologies for immune receptor repertoires, we survey structural modeling methods for BCR and TCRs, along with methods for clustering such models.

The aim of this study was to assess ethical issues of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related research proposals submitted during the early stages of pandemic in Nepal. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of COVID-19 related research proposals and their informed consent document submitted to the ethical review board at Nepal Health Research Council was done for the study. The analysis was done as per the National Ethical Guidelines, Standard Operating Procedure for Health Research in Nepal and World Health Organization guidelines for infectious disease outbreak, 2016 under ethically relevant headings. Descriptive data were analyzed in SPSS v24. RESULTS: The major issues were observed in the informed consent documents where 55% were lacking principal investigator's contact information, 68% not having participant selection criteria, 70% without clear informed consent taking process, 57% without explanation of possible risks. Similarly, 68% of the interventional studies' consent form didn't mention possible adverse events and mitigation mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the research proposals related to COVID-19 were devoid of major ethical elements which took longer time for receiving approval and eventually delayed the opportunity for evidence generation in critical time. More attention is needed to increase awareness and to develop capacity of researchers, reviewers, ethics committees and relevant stakeholders at the time of health emergencies.","Ghimire, Namita; Hamal, Pawan Kumar; Panthee, Asmita; Vaidya, Anju; Khadka, Mira; Mahato, Namra Kumar; Karn, Mukesh Kumar; Verma, Shashi; Dhimal, Meghnath; Ghimire, Prakash; Gyanwali, Pradip",J Nepal Health Res Counc,,361

Our study aimed to explore the association between obesity and the negative outcomes of COVID-19 worldwide. The prevalence of obesity and overweight per country was extracted from the World Health Organization information system and, for measuring the COVID-19 negative outcomes, we calculated the cumulated notification rate and the mortality for the interval since starting of pandemic till the 29th of November 2020. We explored the linear relationship between COVID-19 and obesity by a bivariate Spearman rank correlation, interpreted using the rule of thumb for 95% level of confidence. We found globally a positive, moderate, and statistically significant correlation between prevalence of obesity and overweight and the negative outcomes of COVID-19. Some of the results found at global level were confirmed in the disaggregated analysis per WHO regions. Due to the linear association of obesity with the COVID-19 negative outcomes, effective actions are needed for keeping the health systems resilience during the COVID-19. Preventing the obese and overweight people to be infected, prioritizing access to vaccination and to adequate care and treatment could be effective.","Furtunescu, F.

494073,Become Aware of the Short and Long-Term Mental Health Effects of COVID,2021,"Rationale: A novel model of phenotypes based on set thresholds of respiratory system compliance (Crs) was recently postulated in context of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In particular, the dissociation between the degree of hypoxemia and Crs was characterized as a distinct ARDS phenotype.Objectives: To determine whether such Crs-based phenotypes existed among patients with ARDS before the COVID-19 pandemic and to closely examine the Crs-mortality relationship.Methods: We undertook a secondary analysis of patients with ARDS, who were invasively ventilated on controlled modes and enrolled in a large, multinational, epidemiological study. We assessed Crs, degree of hypoxemia, and associated Crs-based phenotypic patterns with their characteristics and outcomes.Measurements and Main Results: Among 1,117 patients with ARDS who met inclusion criteria, the median Crs was 30 (interquartile range, 23-40) ml/cm H2O. One hundred thirty-six (12%) patients had preserved Crs (&#8805;50 ml/cm H2O; phenotype with low elastance [""phenotype L""]), and 827 (74%) patients had poor Crs (<40 ml/cm H2O; phenotype with high elastance [""phenotype H""]). Compared with those with phenotype L, patients with phenotype H were sicker and had more comorbidities and higher hospital mortality (32% vs. 45%; P < 0.05). A near complete dissociation between PaO2/FiO2 and Crs was observed. Of 136 patients with phenotype L, 58 (43%) had a PaO2/FiO2 < 150. In a multivariable-adjusted analysis, the Crs was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio per ml/cm H2O increase, 0.988; 95% confidence interval, 0.979-0.996; P = 0.005).Conclusions: A wide range of Crs was observed in non-COVID-19 ARDS. Approximately one in eight patients had preserved Crs. PaO2/FiO2 and Crs were dissociated. Lower Crs was independently associated with higher mortality. The Crs-mortality relationship lacked a clear transition threshold.","Panwar, Rakshit; Madotto, Fabiana; Laffey, John G; van Haren, Frank M P",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,,361

495248,Caring for Frail Older Adults During COVID-19: Integrating Public Health Ethics into Clinical Practice,2020,"Based on the supply of stock market returns hypothesis, we argue that the unprecedented adverse shock of COVID-19 on the countries' economic growth translates into a negative shock to the stock markets. According to the institutional theory, we also argue that the impact of COVID-19 in emerging countries is different from developed countries. Based on the overreaction hypothesis, we expect that the market reaction during the stabilizing period of COVID-19 spread is different from the market reaction during the infection period. Using high-frequency daily data across 53 emerging and 23 developed countries from January 14 to August 20, 2020, we find that COVID-19 cases and deaths adversely affect stock returns and increase volatility and trading volume. Cases and deaths affected stock returns and volatility in the emerging markets, while only cases of COVID-19 affected stock returns, volatility, and trading volume in the developed markets. COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to returns, volatility, and trading volume for emerging countries during the rising infection of COVID-19 (pre-April 2020), while cases and mortality rates are related to returns, volatility, and trading volume in developed countries during the stabilizing spread (post-April 2020). Therefore, the emerging markets' investors seem to react to COVID-19 cases and mortality rates differently from those in the developed markets across two different periods of COVID-19 infection.","Harjoto, Maretno Agus; Rossi, Fabrizio; Lee, Robert; Sergi, Bruno S",J Econ Bus,,361

RESULTS: Prevalence of aPLs in patients with COVID-19 was as follows: classic aPLs, 5.8%; aPS/PT, 4.6%; IgA-aß2GPI, 15%; and any aPL, 21%. When patients were compared with individuals of a control group of a similar age, the only significant difference found was the higher prevalence of IgA-aß2GPI (odds ratio: 2.31; 95% confidence interval: 1.16-4.09). No significant differences were observed in survival, thrombosis, or ventilatory failure in aPL-positive versus aPL-negative patients. ß2GPI median levels were much lower in patients with COVID-19 (15.9 mg/l) than in blood donors (168.8 mg/l; P < 0.001). Only 3.5% of patients with COVID-19 had normal levels of ß2GPI (>85 mg/l). Low levels of ß2GPI were significantly associated with ventilatory failure (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: ß2GPI levels were much lower in patients with COVID-19 than in healthy people. Low ß2GPI-levels were associated with ventilatory failure. No differences were observed in the COVID-19 evolution between aPL-positive and aPL-negative patients. Functional ß2GPI deficiency could trigger a clinical process similar to that seen in APS but in the absence of aPLs.","Serrano, Manuel; Espinosa, Gerard; Lalueza, Antonio; Bravo-Gallego, Luz Yadira; Diaz-Simón, Raquel; Garcinuño, Sara; Gil-Etayo, Javier; Moises, Jorge; Naranjo, Laura; Prieto-González, Sergio; Ruiz-Ortiz, Estibaliz; Sánchez, Beatriz; Moreno-Castaño, Ana Belen; Díaz-Pedroche, Carmen; Viñas-Gomis, Odette; Cervera, Ricard; Serrano, Antonio",,,361

However, a more pragmatic approach to applying AI methods to a medical diagnosis is designing a framework that facilitates human-machine interaction and expert decision making. Studies have shown that categorization can play an essential rule in accelerating real-world decision making. Inspired by descriptive document clustering, we propose a domain-independent explanatory clustering framework to group contextually related instances and support radiologists' decision making. While most descriptive clustering approaches employ domain-specific characteristics to form meaningful clusters, we focus on model-level explanation as a more general-purpose element of every learning process to achieve cluster homogeneity. We employ DeepSHAP to generate homogeneous clusters in terms of disease severity and describe the clusters using favorable and unfavorable saliency maps, which visualize the class discriminating regions of an image. These human-interpretable maps complement radiologist knowledge to investigate the whole cluster at once. Besides, as part of this study, we evaluate a model based on VGG-19, which can identify COVID and pneumonia cases with a positive predictive value of 95% and 97%, respectively, comparable to the recent explainable approaches for COVID diagnosis.","Ravi, Sahithya; Khoshrou, Samaneh; Pechenizkiy, Mykola",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14871v1.pdf,361

RECENT FINDINGS: In the United States, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children have been mild illnesses, with those 5-17 years of age having the highest frequency. Specifically, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in children is two times higher in adolescents (12-17 years) than younger school-aged children (5-11 years). Despite the higher case counts in older children, 10% of pediatric hospitalizations have been in infants less than one year. In addition, severe respiratory and renal complications, hospitalization, and even death have been documented in children. SUMMARY: Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress, with mild nonspecific symptoms being the most commonly reported. The broad clinical presentation and the frequency of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections in children pose challenges for controlling and detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, severe disease has been noted in children with associated medical complications and death. Thus, additional active surveillance and research is needed to understand the burden children contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States.","Rankin, Danielle A; Talj, Rana; Howard, Leigh M; Halasa, Natasha B",Curr. opin. pediatr,,361
502570,"The Vital Role of a Federally Qualified Community Health Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"During pandemic events, strategies such as social distancing can be fundamental to curb viral spreading. Such actions can reduce the number of simultaneous infections and mitigate the disease spreading, which is relevant to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these strategies can be suggested, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception of the disease risk. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated, avoiding unnecessary contacts. With this motivation, we propose an epidemiological SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory to take into account dynamic individual quarantine strategies, intending to combine in a single process social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading. The disease spreads in a population whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agent's health state. At the same time, the infection rate depends on the agent's strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of infected agents. Results show recurrent infection waves, which were seen in previous epidemic scenarios with quarantine. Notably, the risk perception is found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates. Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies.","Amaral, Marco A.; Oliveira, Marcelo M. de; Javarone, Marco A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05979v1.pdf,361

503319,Covid-19: schools set to close across UK except for children of health and social care workers,2020,"The year 2020 was a landmark year of a once-in-a-century pandemic of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 virus, that led to a rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The spectrum of disease with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from asymptomatic to mild upper respiratory illness, to moderate to severe disease with respiratory compromise to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death. Early in the pandemic, risk factors were recognized that contributed to more severe disease, but it became evident that individuals and even young people could have severe COVID-19. As we started to understand the immunobiology of COVID-19, it became clearer that the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were variable, and in some cases, the excessive inflammatory response contributed to greater morbidity and mortality. In this review, we will explore some of the additional risk factors that appear to contribute to disease severity and enhance our understanding of why some individuals experience more severe COVID-19. Recent advances in genome-wide associations have identified potential candidate genes in certain populations that may modify the host immune responses leading to dysregulated host immunity. Genetic defects of the type I interferon pathway are also linked to a more clinically severe phenotype of COVID-19. Finally, dysregulation of the adaptive immune system may also play a role in the severity and complex clinical course of patients with COVID-19. A better understanding of the host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 will hopefully lead to new treatment modalities to prevent the poor outcomes of COVID-19 in those individuals with pre-existing risk factors or genetic variants that contribute to the dysregulated host immune responses.","Ballow, Mark; Haga, Christopher L",J.

Although some risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality have already been identified in various ethnic cohorts, there remains a paucity of data among Hispanics, particularly those living on borders. Ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in Hispanic and black populations have been reported. We sought to identify the clinical presentation, treatment, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of 82 Hispanic patients in a county hospital and describe the factors associated with rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (48.8%) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (39%), both found to be associated with hospitalization and mortality, while only DM was associated with increased rate of ICU admission. Multivariable analysis showed that individuals with fever, low oxygen saturation (SpO2), nasal congestion, shortness of breath, and DM had an increased risk of hospitalization. Individuals with fever, decreased levels of SpO2, and advanced age were found to be associated with an increased risk of death. The most common cause of death was respiratory failure (28.9%), followed by shock (17.8%) and acute kidney injury (15.6%). Our findings are critical to developing strategies and identifying at-risk individuals in a Hispanic population living on borders. Research aiming to identify key evidence-based prognostic factors in our patient population will help inform our healthcare providers so that best interventions can be implemented to improve the outcomes of patients with COVID-19.","Cervantes, Jorge; Sureen, Amit; Galura, Gian; Dodoo, Christopher; Dwivedi, Alok Kumar; Bashashati, Mohammad; Zuckerman, Marc; Meza, Armando",J. invest. med,,361
504257,"Physical activity, resilience, emotions, moods, and weight control of older adults during the COVID-19 global crisis",2021,"Although vaccines are considered one of the most effective medical interventions to prevent vaccine preventable disease and associated morbidity and mortality, a number of recent outbreaks are threatening the gains made by vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy is a key driver of vaccine refusal and has been associated with vaccine preventable outbreaks. While parents seek information from many sources to inform their vaccine decision-making process, they continue to view their child's pediatric provider as a trusted source of vaccine information. The communication that occurs between a provider and parent with regards to vaccination is critical in reducing concerns and nudging parents toward vaccine acceptance. However, vaccine-hesitant parents raise issues in this encounter that many providers feel ill-equipped to answer, due to lack of training on evidence-based communication strategies. We focus on promising approaches related to patient-provider communication within the context of vaccination. We found empirical evidence that the use of a presumptive format to recommend vaccines, motivational interviewing, and tailoring information to increase message salience are approaches that can positively affect vaccine acceptance. As providers continue to serve as important influencers in the vaccine decision-making process, it is evident that there is a need to continue to identify evidence-based, and practically implementable approaches to mitigate parental vaccine hesitancy. Providers play a key role in improving coverage rates, and therefore it is paramount to seek ways to improve how providers communicate about vaccines.","Limaye, Rupali J; Opel, Douglas J; Dempsey, Amanda; Ellingson, Mallory; Spina, Christine; Omer, Saad B; Dudley, Matthew Z; Salmon, Daniel A; Leary, Sean O",Acad Pediatr,,361

Air purification devices are necessary to remove and/or inactivate airborne biological species from indoor air environment. Corona discharge in an electrostatic precipitator is capable of removing particulate matter and disinfecting biological aerosols to act as electrostatic disinfector (ESD). The ions generated by ESD can effectively inactivate bacteria/viruses. However, the available research rarely investigated disinfection effect of ESD, and it is urgent to develop quantitative ESD design methods for building mechanical ventilation applications. This study developed an integrated numerical model to simulate disinfection performance of ESD. The numerical model considers the ionized electric field, electrohydrodynamic flow, and biological disinfection. The model prediction was validated with the experimental data (E. coli): Good agreement was observed. The validated model then was used to study the influences of essential design parameters (e.g. voltage, inlet velocity) of ESD on disinfection efficiency. The effects of modeling of electrophoretic force and EHD (electrohydrodynamic) flow patterns on disinfection efficiency and computing time were also analyzed. The disinfection efficiency of well-designed ESD (with space charge density of 3.6×10-06â¯C/m3) could be as high as 100%.

To improve the segmentation performance of COVID 19 images, ensemble strategy incorporating five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical relevance of the proposed method with the Radiographic Assessment of the Quality of Lung Edema (RALE). Results. The proposed ensemble strategy showed dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher than conventional methods (0.854 0.889). Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate positive correlation to the extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities under the RALE framework. Conclusion. A deep learning based model in CXR can accurately segment and quantify regional distribution of pulmonary opacities in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia.","Kim, Young-Gon; Kim, Kyungsang; Wu, Dufan; Ren, Hui; Tak, Won Young; Park, Soo Young; Lee, Yu Rim; Kang, Min Kyu; Park, Jung Gil; Kim, Byung Seok; Chung, Woo Jin; Kalra, Mannudeep K.; Li, Quanzheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12610v1.pdf,361
508134,A Semi-Quantitative Risk Assessment and Management Strategies on COVID-19 Infection to Outpatient Health Care Workers in the Post-Pandemic Period,2021,"BACKGROUND: In June 2020, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a virtual workshop focused on integrating the science of aging and environmental health research. The concurrent COVID-19 pandemic and national attention on racism exposed shortcomings in the environmental research field's conceptualization and methodological use of race, which have subsequently hindered the ability of research to address racial health disparities. By the workshop's conclusion, the authors deduced that the utility of environmental aging biomarkers-aging biomarkers shown to be specifically influenced by environmental exposures-would be greatly diminished if these biomarkers are developed absent of considerations of broader societal factors-like structural racism-that impinge on racial health equity. OBJECTIVES: The authors reached a post-workshop consensus recommendation: To advance racial health equity, a ""compound"" exposome approach should be widely adopted in environmental aging biomarker research. We present this recommendation here. DISCUSSION: The authors believe that without explicit considerations of racial health equity, people in most need of the benefits afforded by a better understanding of the relationships between exposures and aging will be the least likely to receive them because biomarkers may not encompass cumulative impacts from their unique social and environmental stressors. Employing an exposome approach that allows for more comprehensive exposure-disease pathway characterization across broad domains, including the social exposome and neighborhood factors, is the first step. Exposome-centered study designs must then be supported with efforts aimed at increasing the recruitment and retention of racially diverse study populations and researchers and further ""compounded"" with strategies directed at improving the use and interpretation of race throughout the publication and dissemination process. This compound exposome approach maximizes the ability of our science to identify environmental aging biomarkers that explicate racial disparities in health and best positions the environmental research community to contribute to the elimination of racial health disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8392.","Nwanaji-Enwerem, Jamaji C; Jackson, Chandra L; Ottinger, Mary Ann; Cardenas, Andres; James, Katherine A; Malecki, Kristen M C; Chen, Jiu-Chiuan; Geller, Andrew M; Mitchell, Uchechi A",Environ Health Perspect,,361

A novel aspect of our approach is the incorporation of a time-varying reporting rate accounting for the initial phase of the pandemic before testing was widely available. By varying both the reporting rate and the effective contact rate in time, our models can capture changes in the data induced by external influences, such as public health intervention measures, for example. We view COVID-19 incidence data as the observed measurements of a hidden Markov model, with latent space represented by the underlying epidemiological model, and employ a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) sampling scheme for Bayesian inference. Parameter inference is performed via PMCMC on incidence data collated by the New York Times from the states of New York and Tennessee from March 1, 2020 through August 30, 2020. Lastly, we perform Bayesian model selection on the different formulations of the epidemiological models, make predictions from our fitted models, and validate our predictions against the true incidence data for the week between August 31, 2020 and September 7, 2020.","Spannaus, Adam; Papamarkou, Theodore; Erwin, Samantha; Christian, J.

The causative agent was identified as a novel b-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was named COVID-19. Since the beginning of 2020, the infection has spread worldwide, which led the WHO to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern and to characterize the current situation as a pandemic. The transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. Most cases are mild, but some patients develop severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress, septic shock and multi-organ failure. The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, myalgia and shortness of breath. Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found. Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities. Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.","Trojánek, Milan; Grebenyuk, Vyacheslav; Herrmannová, Kristýna; Necas, Tomás; Gregorová, Jana; Kucbel, Martin; Sín, Robin; Rohácová, Hana; Stejskal, Frantisek",Cas Lek Cesk,,361

511076,Vigorously Cited: A Bibliometric Analysis of the 500 Most Cited Physical Activity Articles,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently in development, yet little is known about people's acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of adults ages 18 and older in the United States (n = 2,006) in May 2020. Multivariable relative risk regression identified correlates of participants' willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine acceptability). RESULTS: Overall, 69% of participants were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they thought their healthcare provider would recommend vaccination (RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.49-2.02) or if they were moderate (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16) or liberal (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.22) in their political leaning. Participants were also more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived likelihood getting a COVID-19 infection in the future (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.09), perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.11), or perceived effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine (RR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.40-1.52). Participants were less likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they were non-Latinx black (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.90) or reported a higher level of perceived potential vaccine harms (RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Many adults are willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, though acceptability should be monitored as vaccine development continues. Our findings can help guide future efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptability (and uptake if a vaccine becomes available).","Reiter, Paul L; Pennell, Michael L; Katz, Mira L",Vaccine,,361

511467,Lessons native American culture can teach us about resilience during pandemics and health care crises,2021,"We showed ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 is higher in the kidney of male compared with female mice. To further investigate this sex difference, we examined the role of ACE2 in Ang-[1-8] (angiotensin [1-8])-induced hypertension and regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney of WT (wild type) and Ace2 KO (knockout) mice. Mean arterial pressure rose faster in WT male than WT female mice after Ang-[1-8] infusion. This sex difference was attenuated in ACE2 KO mice. Ang-[1-8] infusion reduced glomerular AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) binding in WT female mice by 30%, and deletion of Ace2 abolished this effect. In contrast, Ang-[1-8] infusion increased glomerular AT1R binding in WT male mice by 1.2-fold, and this effect of Ang-[1-8] persisted in Ace2 KO male mice (1.3-fold). ACE2 also had an effect on renal protein expression of the neutral endopeptidase NEP (neprilysin), the enzyme that catabolizes Ang-[1-10] (angiotensin [1-10]), the precursor of Ang-[1-8]. Ang-[1-8] infusion downregulated NEP protein expression by 20% in WT male, whereas there was a slight increase in NEP expression in WT female mice. Deletion of Ace2 resulted in lowered NEP expression after Ang-[1-8] infusion in both sexes. These findings suggest sex-specific ACE2 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to female protection from Ang-[1-8]-induced hypertension. These findings have ramifications for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in hypertension since ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and hypertension is a major risk factor for poor outcomes.","Ji, Hong; de Souza, Aline M A; Bajaj, Bilkish; Zheng, Wei; Wu, Xie; Speth, Robert C; Sandberg, Kathryn",Hypertension,,361
511737,"Knowledge, Anxiety, Fear, and Psychological Distress About COVID-19 Among University Students in the United Arab Emirates",2020,"The paucity of knowledge about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific virulence factors has greatly hampered the therapeutic management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Recently, a cluster of studies appeared, which presented empirical evidence for SARS-CoV-2-specific virulence factors that can explain key elements of COVID-19 pathology. These studies unravel multiple structural and nonstructural specifics of SARS-CoV-2, such as a unique FURIN cleavage site, papain-like protease (SCoV2-PLpro), ORF3b and nonstructural proteins, and dynamic conformational changes in the structure of spike protein during host cell fusion, which give it an edge in infectivity and virulence over previous coronaviruses causing pandemics. Investigators provided robust evidence that SARS-CoV-2-specific virulence factors may have an impact on viral infectivity and transmissibility and disease severity as well as the development of immunity against the infection, including response to the vaccines. In this article, we are presenting a summarized account of the newly reported studies.","Kumar, Ashutosh; Prasoon, Pranav; Kumari, Chiman; Pareek, Vikas; Faiq, Muneeb A; Narayan, Ravi K; Kulandhasamy, Maheswari; Kant, Kamla",J. med. virol,,361

In this study, we present the first estimates of these rates using multi-country serology studies, together with public data on hospital admissions and mortality. Our results show that the risk of severe and critical disease increases exponentially with age, but much less steeply than the risk of fatal illness. Importantly, the estimated rate of severe disease outcome in adolescents is an order of magnitude larger than the reported rate of vaccine side-effects; thus, showing how these estimates are relevant for health policy. Finally, we validate our results by showing that they are in close agreement with the estimates obtained from an indirect method that uses reported infection fatality rates estimates and hospital mortality data.","Herrera-Esposito, Daniel; Campos, Gustavo de los",,,361

While the overall mortality is low, the virus is highly virulent and may infect millions of people worldwide. This will consequently burden health systems, particularly by those individuals considered to be at high risk of severe complications from COVID-19. Such risk factors include advanced age, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes and cancer. However, few data on the outcomes of cancer patients infected by SARS CoV-2 exist. Therefore, there is a lack of guidance on how to manage cancer patients during the pandemic. We sought to propose specific recommendations about the management of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies. Methods: The Brazilian Gastrointestinal Tumours Group board of directors and members sought up-to-date scientific literature on each tumour type and discussed all recommendations by virtual meetings to provide evidence-based—and sometimes, expert opinion—recommendation statements. Our objectives were to recommend evidence-based approaches to both treat and minimise the risk of COVID-19 for cancer patients, and simultaneously propose how to decrease the use of hospital resources at a time these resources need to be available to treat COVID-19 patients. Results: Overall and tumour-specific recommendations were made by stage (including surgical, locoregional, radiotherapy, systemic treatments and follow-up strategies) for the most common gastrointestinal malignancies: esophagus, gastric, pancreas, bile duct, hepatocellular, colorectal, anal cancer and neuroendocrine tumours. Conclusions: Our recommendations emphasise the importance of treating cancer patients, using the best evidence available, while simultaneously taking into consideration the world-wide health resource hyperutilisation to treat non-cancer COVID-19 patients.","Riechelmann, Rachel P.; D’Alpino Peixoto, Renata; Dos Santos Fernandes, Gustavo; Weschenfelder, Rui F.; Prolla, Gabriel; Filho, Duílio Rocha; Andrade, Aline Chaves; Crosara, Marcela; Rego, Juliana Florinda M.; Gansl, Rene C.; Coimbra, Felipe; Aguiar, Aguiar; Carvalho, Elisângela; Hoff, Paulo M.; Coutinho, Anelisa K.",ecancermedicalscience,,361

The Call of Louisa Jordan: The Formation of the Spiritual Care Team at NHS Louisa Jordan, Glasgow, Scotland",2021,"BACKGROUND: During the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic it is crucial for hospitals to implement infection prevention strategies to reduce nosocomial transmission to the lowest possible number. This is all the more important because molecular tests for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are uncertain, and the resources available for them are limited. In this view, a monocentric, retrospective study with an interventional character was conducted to investigate the extent to which the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mask requirement and daily screening for suspicious patients has an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial rate in the pandemic environment. METHODS: All inpatients from a maximum care hospital in Regensburg (Bavaria) between March 1st and June 10th 2020 were included. Patient with respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission, patients were managed according to a standard hygiene protocol. At the end of March a strict hygiene bundle was introduced including a general mask obligation and a daily clinical screening of inpatients for respiratory symptoms. Nosocomial infection rate for COVID-19 and the risk for infection transmission estimated by the nosocomial incidence density before and after introduction the hygiene bundle were compared. The infection pressure for the hospital during the entire observational period was characterized by the infection reports in the region in relation to the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the number of infected employees. RESULTS: In fact, after the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mouth and nose protection obligation and a daily clinical screening of suspicious patients, a significant reduction of the nosocomial rate from 0.28 to 0.06 (p = 0.026) was observed. Furthermore, the risk of spreading hospital-acquired infections also decreased dramatically from 0.0007 to 0.00018 (p = 0.031; rate ratio after/before 0.25 (95%CI 0.06, 1.07) despite a slow decrease of the hospital COVID 19-prevalence and an increase of infected employees.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 April 2020. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK. PARTICIPANTS: 545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n=13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n=126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, &#967;2=21.1034, p<0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.23, p=0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers.

519524,Mindful Moms: Motivation to Self-Manage Depression Symptoms,2020,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: In spring 2020, high numbers of children presented with acral pernio-like skin rashes, concurrent with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding their clinical characteristics/ infection status may provide prognostic information and facilitate decisions about management. METHODS: A pediatric-specific dermatology registry was created by the Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology (SPD) and Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) and was managed by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia using REDCap. RESULTS: Data from 378 children 0-18 years entered into the registry between April 13 and July 17, 2020 were analyzed. Data were drawn from a standardized questionnaire completed by clinicians which asked for demographics, description of acral lesions, symptoms before and after acral changes, COVID-19 positive contacts, treatment, duration of skin changes, laboratory testing including SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing, as well as histopathology. 229 (60.6%) were male with mean age of 13.0 years (± 3.6 years). Six (1.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Pedal lesions (often with pruritus and/or pain) were present in 96%. 30% (114/378) had COVID-19 symptoms during the 30 days prior to presentation. Most (69%) had no other symptoms and an uneventful course with complete recovery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children with acral pernio-like changes were healthy and all recovered with no short-term sequelae. We believe these acral changes are not just a temporal epiphenomenon of shelter in place during the spring months of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be a late phase reaction that needs further study.","Castelo-Soccio, Leslie; Lara-Corrales, Irene; Paller, Amy S; Bean, Eric; Rangu, Sneha; Oboite, Michelle; Flohr, Carsten; Ahmad, Regina-Celeste; Calberg, Valerie; Gilliam, Amy; Pope, Elena; Reynolds, Sean; Sibbald, Cathryn; Shin, Helen T; Berger, Emily; Schaffer, Julie; Siegel, Michael P; Cordoro, Kelly M",Pediatr Dermatol,,361

We have predicted that in the case that a fraction of the population above a certain threshold returns to the public space, the negative tendency of the epidemic curve will revert. Such predictions were based on modeling the reactivation of economic activity after lockdown by means of an epidemiological model on a contact network of Mexico City derived from mobile device co-localization. We evaluated the epidemic dynamics considering the tally of active and recovered cases documented in the mexican government's open database. Scenarios were modeled in which different percentages of the population are reintegrated to the public space by scanning values ranging from 5% up to 50%. Null models were built by using data from the Jornada Nacional de Sana Distancia (the Mexican model of elective lockdown) in which there was a mobility reduction of 75% and no mandatory mobility restrictions. We found that a new peak of cases in the epidemic curve was very likely for scenarios in which more than 5% of the population rejoined the public space; The return of more than 50% of the population synchronously will unleash a peak of a magnitude similar to the one that was predicted with no mitigation strategies. By evaluating the tendencies of the epidemic dynamics, the number of new cases registered, new cases hospitalized, and new deaths, we consider that under this scenario, reactivation following only elective measures may not be optimal. Given the need to reactivate economic activities, we suggest to consider alternative measures that allow to diminish the contacts among people returning to the public space. We evaluated that by""encapsulating""reactivated workers may allow a reactivation of a larger fraction of the population without compromising the desired tendency in the epidemic curve.","Anda-J'auregui, Guillermo de; Hern'andez-Lemus, Enrique",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12688v1.pdf,361

Syndemic theory provides a useful framework for understanding how such interacting epidemics develop under conditions of health and social disparity. Multiple historical and present-day factors have created the syndemic conditions within which black Americans experience the lethal force of COVID-19. These factors include racism and its manifestations (e.g., chattel slavery, mortgage redlining, political gerrymandering, lack of Medicaid expansion, employment discrimination, and health care provider bias). Improving racial disparities in COVID-19 will require that we implement policies that address structural racism at the root of these disparities.","Poteat, Tonia; Millett, Gregorio A; Nelson, LaRon E; Beyrer, Chris",Ann Epidemiol,,361

To test whether the olfactory neuroepithelium may represent a target of the virus, we generated RNA-seq libraries from human olfactory neuroepithelia, in which we found substantial expression of the genes coding for the virus receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and for the virus internalization enhancer TMPRSS2. We analyzed a human olfactory single-cell RNA-seq dataset and determined that sustentacular cells, which maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. ACE2 protein was highly expressed in a subset of sustentacular cells in human and mouse olfactory tissues. Finally, we found ACE2 transcripts in specific brain cell types, both in mice and humans. Sustentacular cells thus represent a potential entry door for SARS-CoV-2 in a neuronal sensory system that is in direct connection with the brain.","Fodoulian, Leon; Tuberosa, Joël; Rossier, Daniel; Boillat, Madlaina; Kan, Chenda; Pauli, Véronique; Egervari, Kristof; Lobrinus, Johannes A; Landis, Basile N; Carleton, Alan; Rodriguez, Ivan",iScience,,361

Contact tracing apps give the unprecedented possibility to reconstruct graphs of daily contacts, so the question is: who should be tested? As human contact networks are known to exhibit community structure, in this paper we show that the Kemeny constant of a graph can be used to identify and analyze bridges between communities in a graph. Our 'Kemeny indicator' is the value of the Kemeny constant in the new graph that is obtained when a node is removed from the original graph. We show that testing individuals who are associated with large values of the Kemeny indicator can help in efficiently intercepting new virus outbreaks, when they are still in their early stage. Extensive simulations provide promising results in early identification and in blocking the possible 'super-spreaders' links that transmit disease between different communities.","Yilmaz, Serife; Dudkina, Ekaterina; Bin, Michelangelo; Crisostomi, Emanuele; Ferraro, Pietro; Murray-Smith, Roderick; Parisini, Thomas; Stone, Lewi; Shorten, Robert",PLoS One,,361

However, there has been little epidemiological research to assess these risks. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of HCW (n = 546) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW; n = 283) with no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who were recruited from a large U.S. university and two affiliated university hospitals. In this cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline, we examined SARS-CoV-2 infection status (as determined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oropharyngeal swabs) by healthcare worker status and role. RESULTS: At baseline, 41 (5.0%) of the participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 14 (34.2%) reported symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among HCW (7.3%) than in NHCW (0.4%), representing a 7.0% greater absolute risk (95% confidence interval for risk difference 4.7, 9.3%). The majority of infected HCW (62.5%) were nurses. Positive tests increased across the two weeks of cohort recruitment in line with rising confirmed cases in the hospitals and surrounding counties. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results demonstrate that HCW had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than NHCW. Continued follow-up of this cohort will enable us to monitor infection rates and examine risk factors for transmission.

The current literature demonstrates unclear outcomes regarding barotrauma in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of barotrauma in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and its influence on survival. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed from March 18, 2020 to May 5, 2020, with follow-up through June 18, 2020, encompassing critically ill intubated patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia at an academic tertiary care hospital in Brooklyn, New York. Critically ill patients with pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, or both (n = 75) were compared to those without evidence of barotrauma (n = 206). Clinical characteristics and short-term patient outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Barotrauma occurred in 75/281 (26.7%) of included patients. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with increased 30-day mortality were elevated age (HR 1.015 [95% CI 1.004-1.027], P = 0.006), barotrauma (1.417 [1.040-1.931], P = 0.027), and renal dysfunction (1.602 [1.055-2.432], P = 0.027).

The world urgently needs cost-effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, antiviral, and therapeutic drugs to control it. In this study, we engineered the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and produced it in the plant Nicotiana benthamiana in a glycosylated and deglycosylated form. Expression levels of both glycosylated (gRBD) and deglycosylated (dRBD) RBD were greater than 45 mg/kg fresh weight. The purification yields were 22 mg of pure protein/kg of plant biomass for gRBD and 20 mg for dRBD, which would be sufficient for commercialization of these vaccine candidates. The purified plant-produced RBD protein was recognized by an S protein-specific monoclonal antibody, demonstrating specific reactivity of the antibody to the plant-produced RBD proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD showed specific binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. In mice, the plant-produced RBD antigens elicited high titers of antibodies with a potent virus-neutralizing activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that mice immunized with plant-produced deglycosylated RBD form elicited high titer of RBD-specific antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, obtained data support that plant-produced glycosylated and in vivo deglycosylated RBD antigens, developed in this study, are promising vaccine candidates for the prevention of COVID-19.","Mamedov, Tarlan; Yuksel, Damla; Ilgın, Merve; Gurbuzaslan, Irem; Gulec, Burcu; Yetiskin, Hazel; Uygut, Muhammet Ali; Islam Pavel, Shaikh Terkis; Ozdarendeli, Aykut; Mammadova, Gulshan; Say, Deniz; Hasanova, Gulnara",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452461/,361

DESIGN: A process evaluation underpinned by Normalisation Process Theory. SETTING: Three National Health Service provider organisations in England. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four healthcare professionals (7 newborn screening laboratory staff and 24 clinicians) and 18 parents were interviewed. INTERVENTIONS: Three co-designed interventions were implemented in practice: standardised laboratory proformas, communication checklists and an email/letter template. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Acceptability and feasibility of the co-designed interventions. RESULTS: Auditing the implementation of these interventions revealed between 58%–76% of the items on the laboratory proforma and 43%–80% of items on the communication checklists were completed. Interviews with healthcare professionals who had used the interventions in practice provided positive feedback in relation to the purpose of the interventions and the ease of completion both of which were viewed as enhancing communication of positive newborn bloodspot screening results. Interviews with parents highlighted the perceived benefit of the co-designed interventions in terms of consistency, pacing and tailoring of information as well as providing reliable information to families following communication of the positive newborn bloodspot screening result. The process evaluation illuminated organisational and contextual barriers during implementation of the co-designed interventions in practice. CONCLUSION: Variations in communication practices for positive newborn bloodspot screening results continue to exist. The co-designed interventions could help to standardise communication of positive newborn screening results from laboratories to clinicians and from clinicians to parents which in turn could improve parents’ experience of receiving a positive newborn bloodspot screening result. Implementation highlighted some organisational and contextual barriers to effective adoption of the co-designed interventions in practice.

In this paper, I argue that the AI rights research program is beset by an epistemic problem that threatens to impede its progress—namely, a lack of a solution to the ‘Hard Problem’ of consciousness: the problem of explaining why certain brain states give rise to experience. To motivate this claim, I consider three ways in which to ground AI rights—namely: superintelligence, empathy, and a capacity for consciousness. I argue that appeals to superintelligence and empathy are problematic, and that consciousness should be our central focus, as in the case of animal rights. However, I also argue that AI rights is disanalogous from animal rights in an important respect: animal rights can proceed without a solution to the ‘Hard Problem’ of consciousness. Not so with AI rights, I argue. There we cannot make the same kinds of assumptions that we do about animal consciousness, since we still do not understand why brain states give rise to conscious mental states in humans.","Andreotta, Adam J.",AI Soc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-00997-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836903/,361

594466,Anxiety and associated factors among Ethiopian health professionals at early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia,2021-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Health-care workers are thought to be highly exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in health-care workers and the proportion of seroconverted health-care workers with previous symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, screening was offered to health-care workers in the Capital Region of Denmark, including medical, nursing, and other students who were associated with hospitals in the region. Screening included point-of-care tests for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Test results and participant characteristics were recorded. Results were compared with findings in blood donors in the Capital Region in the study period. FINDINGS: Between April 15 and April 23, 2020, we screened 29 295 health-care workers, of whom 28 792 (98·28%) provided their test results. We identified 1163 (4·04% [95% CI 3·82–4·27]) seropositive health-care workers. Seroprevalence was higher in health-care workers than in blood donors (142 [3·04%] of 4672; risk ratio [RR] 1·33 [95% CI 1·12–1·58]; p<0·001). Seroprevalence was higher in male health-care workers (331 [5·45%] of 6077) than in female health-care workers (832 [3·66%] of 22 715; RR 1·49 [1·31–1·68]; p<0·001). Frontline health-care workers working in hospitals had a significantly higher seroprevalence (779 [4·55%] of 16 356) than health-care workers in other settings (384 [3·29%] of 11 657; RR 1·38 [1·22–1·56]; p<0·001). Health-care workers working on dedicated COVID-19 wards (95 [7·19%] of 1321) had a significantly higher seroprevalence than other frontline health-care workers working in hospitals (696 [4·35%] of 15 983; RR 1·65 [1·34–2·03]; p<0·001). 622 [53·5%] of 1163 seropositive participants reported symptoms attributable to SARS-CoV-2. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom that was most strongly associated with seropositivity (377 [32·39%] of 1164 participants with this symptom were seropositive vs 786 [2·84%] of 27 628 without this symptom; RR 11·38 [10·22–12·68]). The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04356560. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of health-care workers with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was low but higher than in blood donors. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health-care workers was related to exposure to infected patients. More than half of seropositive health-care workers reported symptoms attributable to COVID-19.

595174,Mental health of pregnant and postpartum women in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Despite media claims that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uniting societies and countries in shared experience, there has been concern that the pandemic is in fact exposing and widening existing inequalities within societies. Data have shown these differences for cases and fatalities, but data on other types of adversities are lacking. Therefore, this study explored the changing patterns of adversity relating to the COVID-19 pandemic by socioeconomic position (SEP) during the early weeks of lockdown in the UK. METHODS: Data were from 12 527 UK adults in the University College London COVID-19 Social Study (a panel study that involves online weekly data collection from participants during the COVID-19 pandemic). We analysed data collected from 25 March to 14 April 2020. The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and country of living. We used Poisson and logit models to assess 10 different types of adverse experiences depending on an index of SEP over time. RESULTS: There was a clear gradient across the number of adverse events experienced each week by SEP. This was most clearly seen for adversities relating to finances (including loss of employment and cut in income) and basic needs (including access to food and medications) but less for experiences directly relating to the virus. Inequalities were maintained with no reductions in discrepancies between socioeconomic groups over time. CONCLUSIONS: There were clear inequalities in adverse experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in the early weeks of lockdown in the UK. Results suggest that measures taken to try to reduce such adverse events did not go far enough in tackling inequality.","Wright, Liam; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503892/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214475,361

The main therapeutic target of COVID-19 is main protease (Mpro). It plays a key role as an enzyme in the SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription. In this case, the alpha-mangostin potentially has antiviral activity against Mpro by inhibiting this enzyme. Nevertheless, the alpha-mangostin has low solubility and a lack of information about alpha-mangostin activity against the SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study is to describe the molecular interactions and identify the pharmacokinetics profile between alpha-mangostin and its derivatives. in silico study was conducted by pharmacokinetics and toxicity prediction, molecular docking simulation, and Lipinski's rule of five. FKS9 has a Gibbs free energy value of-10.5 kcal/mol with an inhibition constant of 36.45 μM and an interaction with amino acid His41 residue. Its human intestinal absorption and Caco-2 values were 95.13% and 47.71% while the plasma protein binding and blood-brain barrier values were 96.66% and 6.99%.

597835,Unintended Pregnancy During COVID-19 Pandemic Among Women Attending Antenatal Care in Northwest Ethiopia: Magnitude and Associated Factors,2021-05-18,"Background: Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial COVID-19 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision-making are lacking. We sought to evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women. Methods: 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131), umbilical cord sera (N=10), and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, 2nd vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post 2nd vaccine, and delivery by Luminex, and confirmed by ELISA. Titers were compared to pregnant women 4-12 weeks from native infection (N=37). Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups. Results: Vaccine-induced immune responses were equivalent in pregnant and lactating vs non-pregnant women. All titers were higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, but not IgA, increased in maternal blood and breastmilk with vaccine boost. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. Conclusions: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placental and breastmilk.","Gray, K. J.; Bordt, E.

599622,Pivoting in the pandemic: a qualitative study of child and adolescent psychiatrists in the times of COVID-19,2021-03-04,"The coronavirus pandemic has had huge impacts on the National Health Service (NHS). Patients suffering from the illness have placed unprecedented demands on acute care, particularly on Intensive Care Units (ICUs). This has led to an effort to dramatically increase the resources available to NHS hospitals in treating these patients, involving re‐organisation of hospital facilities, redeployment of existing staff and a drive to bring in recently retired and newly graduated staff to fight the pandemic. These increases in demand and changes to supply have had large knock‐on effects on the care provided to the wider population. This paper discusses likely implications for healthcare delivery in the short and medium term of the responses to the coronavirus pandemic, focusing primarily on the implications for non‐coronavirus patients. Patterns of past care suggest those most likely to be affected by these disruptions will be older individuals and those living in more deprived areas, potentially exacerbating pre‐existing health inequalities. Effects are likely to persist into the longer‐run, with particular challenges around recruitment and ongoing staff shortages. This article is protected by copyright.

A patient being treated with haloperidol decanoate for psychosis experienced a fever within 3 days of injection and leukocytosis along with swelling, pain, and a “knot” feeling at the injection site. This recurred after each injection for several months. Muscle rigidity or changes in vital signs other than temperature were not noted. Temperature and injection site reactions resolved with administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The elevation in temperature was discovered as a result of universal twice daily temperature monitoring implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports of fever with antipsychotics are typically associated with NMS or heat stroke; the details of this case do not meet the clinical criteria for either. Similar reactions are reported for other antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, but not for haloperidol.

Methods: This cross-sectional study of internet monitors was conducted between December 22 and 26, 2020. Of a total of 33,302 participants, 5,760 who worked from home at least 1 day a month, excluding those who met the exclusion criteria, were included in the analysis. A binary subjective assessment of the physical work environment while working from home was used as an exposure factor. We examined 9 items related to the physical work environment, including level of illuminance and use of suitable desks and chairs, traditionally recommended for health and safety management when working at a desk. The number of non-conformities to 7 items was also used as an exposure factor. The presence of severe work functioning impairment was measured using the Work Functioning impairment Scale (WFun), a self-reported outcome measure of the degree of work functioning impairment. Odds ratios of severe work functioning impairment were estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression analysis with the prefecture of residence as a random effect. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that the odds ratio of severe work functioning impairment was significantly higher among those who indicated ""No"" to all recommended items except for ""I work at a desk/chair for office use."" The highest odds ratio of work functioning impairment was associated with a ""No"" response to ""There is enough light to do my work"" (aOR: 2.02, 95%CI: 1.73-2.35, p<0.01). Our results also suggest the presence of a dose-response relationship between the number of non-conformities to recommendations for work environments while working from home and work functioning impairment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that it is important for both companies and individual workers to create a work environment that prevents negative health outcomes and improves productivity while working from home.","Okawara, M.; Ishimaru, T.; Tateishi, S.; Hino, A.; Tsuji, M.; Ikegami, K.; Nagata, M.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254207; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254207v1?rss=1,361

Methods: We analyzed the data of 7,758 children and adolescents with COVID-19 and characteristics of secondary transmission generated by these cases using case information published by local governments. Ratio of pediatric and adolescent cases generating secondary transmission was calculated for various social settings. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 was 24.8 cases per 10(5) population aged between 0 and 9 years, and 59.2 among those aged between 10 and 19 years, which was lower than that among individuals of all age groups (79.6 per 10(5) population) between January 15 and October 31, 2020. The proportion of cases generating secondary cases was 8.3% among infants and young children in nursery schools and kindergartens, 16% among children and adolescents attending primary schools, 34% among those attending junior high schools, 43% among those attending high schools, 31% among those attending professional training colleges, and 24% in those attending universities. Households were the most common setting for secondary transmission.

This study aims to compare mental health between the two workforces to appraise how cultural characteristics may impact their mental health status. A cross-sectional study was used with self-report measures regarding (i) mental health problems, (ii) mental health shame, (iii) self-compassion, (iv) work engagement and (v) work motivation. 257 German employees and 225 South African employees have completed those scales. This study reports results following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. T-tests, correlation and regression analyses were performed. German employees had lower mental health problems and mental health shame, and higher self-compassion than South Africans. Mental health problems were positively associated with mental health shame and amotivation, and negatively associated with work engagement and intrinsic motivation in both groups. Lastly, self-compassion, a PP 2.0 construct, was the strongest predictor for mental health problems in both countries. Our results suggest (i) that German culture’s long-term orientation, uncertainty avoidance and restraint may help explain these differences, and (ii) that self-compassion was important to mental health in both countries. While the levels of mental health differed between the two countries, cultivating self-compassion may be an effective way to protect mental health of employees in those countries.

607062,A mixed-methods evaluation of the uptake of novel differentiated ART delivery models in a national sample of health facilities in Uganda,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND: Despite severe outbreaks of COVID-19 among colleges and universities across the USA during the Fall 2020 semester, the majority of institutions did not routinely test students. While high-frequency repeated testing is considered the most effective strategy for disease mitigation, most institutions do not have the necessary infrastructure or funding for implementation. Therefore, alternative strategies for testing the student population are needed. Our study detailed the implementation and results of testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread on a university campus, and we aimed to assess the relative effectiveness of the different testing strategies. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we included 6273 on-campus students arriving to a large public university in the rural USA (Clemson, SC, USA) for in-person instruction in the Fall 2020 semester (Sept 21 to Nov 25). Individuals arriving after Sept 23, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before Aug 19, and student athletes and band members were not included in this study. We implemented two testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread during this period: a novel surveillance-based informative testing (SBIT) strategy, consisting of random surveillance testing to identify outbreaks in residence hall buildings or floors and target them for follow-up testing (Sept 23 to Oct 5); followed by a repeated weekly surveillance testing (Oct 6 to Nov 22). Relative changes in estimated weekly prevalence were examined. We developed SARS-CoV-2 transmission models to compare the relative effectiveness of weekly testing (900 daily surveillance tests), SBIT (450 daily surveillance tests), random surveillance testing (450 daily surveillance tests), and voluntary testing (0 daily surveillance tests) on disease mitigation. Model parameters were based on our empirical surveillance data in conjunction with published sources. FINDINGS: SBIT was implemented from Sept 23 to Oct 5, and identified outbreaks in eight residence hall buildings and 45 residence hall floors. Targeted testing of residence halls was 2·03 times more likely to detect a positive case than random testing (95% CI 1·67–2·46). Weekly prevalence was reduced from a peak of 8·7% to 5·6% during this 2-week period, a relative reduction of 36% (95% CI 27–44). Prevalence continued to decrease after implementation of weekly testing, reaching 0·8% at the end of in-person instruction (week 9). SARS-CoV-2 transmission models concluded that, in the absence of SBIT (ie, voluntary testing only), the total number of COVID-19 cases would have increased by 154% throughout the semester. Compared with SBIT, random surveillance testing alone would have resulted in a 24% increase in COVID-19 cases. Implementation of weekly testing at the start of the semester would have resulted in 36% fewer COVID-19 cases throughout the semester compared with SBIT, but it would require twice the number of daily tests. INTERPRETATION: It is imperative that institutions rigorously test students during the 2021 academic year. When high-frequency testing (eg, weekly) is not possible, SBIT is an effective strategy to mitigate disease spread among the student population that can be feasibly implemented across colleges and universities.

However, the pathogenicity of RVA has never been directly compared in homologous and heterologous hosts. The bovine RVA/Cow-tc/KOR/K5/2004/G5P[7] strain, which was shown to possess a typical porcine-like genotype constellation similar to that of the G5P[7] prototype RVA/Pig-tc/USA/OSU/1977/G5P9[7] strain, was examined for its pathogenicity and compared with the porcine G5P[7] RVA/Pig-tc/KOR/K71/2006/G5P[7] strain possessing the same genotype constellation. The bovine K5 strain induced diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets and calves, whereas the porcine K71 strain caused diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets, but not in calves. Furthermore, the bovine K5 strain showed extra-intestinal tropisms in both piglets and calves, whereas the porcine K71 strain had extra-intestinal tropisms in piglets, but not in calves. Therefore, we performed comparative genomic analysis of the K71 and K5 RVA strains to determine whether specific mutations could be associated with these distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. Full-length sequencing analyses for the 11 genomic segments for K71 and K5 revealed that these strains were genetically nearly identical to each other.

Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). METHODS: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p < 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication. CONCLUSIONS: The RV-C only replicate in ciliated AECs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. CDHR3 expression positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated AECs. Our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and CDHR3 production may be important determinants of RV-C illness severity.

We present two cases of new-onset neurologic symptoms post-vaccination that, upon further workup, revealed two different neuro-oncologic processes requiring neurosurgical intervention and further treatment. We hypothesize that despite these processes being unrelated to vaccination, the COVID-19 vaccines may induce an inflammatory cascade with the ability to uncover underlying sinister pathology.

609140,"Changes in Diet, Sleep, and Physical Activity Are Associated With Differences in Negative Mood During COVID-19 Lockdown",2020-09-02,"Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, an emerging viral infection with a global case fatality rate of 35.5%, caused major outbreaks first in 2012 and 2015, though new cases are continuously reported around the world. Transmission is believed to mainly occur in healthcare settings through aerosolized particles. This study uses Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment to develop a generalizable model that can assist with interpreting reported outbreak data or predict risk of infection with or without the recommended strategies. The exposure scenario includes a single index patient emitting virus‐containing aerosols into the air by coughing, leading to short‐ and long‐range airborne exposures for other patients in the same room, nurses, healthcare workers, and family visitors. Aerosol transport modeling was coupled with Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the risk of MERS illness for the exposed population. Results from a typical scenario show the daily mean risk of infection to be the highest for the nurses and healthcare workers (8.49 × 10(−4) and 7.91 × 10(−4), respectively), and the lowest for family visitors and patients staying in the same room (3.12 × 10(−4) and 1.29 × 10(−4), respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicates that more than 90% of the uncertainty in the risk characterization is due to the viral concentration in saliva. Assessment of risk interventions showed that respiratory masks were found to have a greater effect in reducing the risks for all the groups evaluated (>90% risk reduction), while increasing the air exchange was effective for the other patients in the same room only (up to 58% risk reduction).","Adhikari, Umesh; Chabrelie, Alexandre; Weir, Mark; Boehnke, Kevin; McKenzie, Erica; Ikner, Luisa; Wang, Meng; Wang, Qing; Young, Kyana; Haas, Charles N.; Rose, Joan; Mitchell, Jade",Risk Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31524301/; https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13389,361

It acts as the master of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) process in the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). SCOPE: Under the stress of unfolded proteins, GRP78 binds to the unfolded proteins to prevent misfolding, while under the load of the unfolded protein, it drives the cell to autophagy or apoptosis. Several attempts reported the overexpression of GRP78 on the cell membrane of cancer cells and cells infected with viruses or fungi. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Cell-surface GRP78 is used as a cancer cell target in previous studies. Additionally, GRP78 is used as a drug target to stop the progression of cancer cells by different compounds, including peptides, antibodies, and some natural compounds. Additionally, it can be used as a protein target to reduce the infectivity of different viruses, including the pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Besides, GRP78 targeting is used in diagnosis and imaging modalities using radionuclides. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review summarizes the various attempts that used GRP78 both in therapy (fighting cancer, viral and fungal infections) and diagnosis (imaging).","Elfiky, Abdo A.; Baghdady, Ahmed M.; Ali, Shehab A.; Ahmed, Marwan I.",Life Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520310699; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841659/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520310699?v=s5,361

This controversial observation can be explained by the lack of sensitivity of the assessed methods used for viral identification and by the small number of patients included in the randomized cohorts studied. Most studies showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is identified in about 70% of hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis during seasonal winter epidemics, followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV, about 3–19%) or rhinoviruses (about 20%). Other respiratory viruses have also been reported, indicating significant causes of bronchiolitis and hospitalization during seasonal epidemics. The presence of more than one pathogen, and moreover, the association of RSV with rhinoviruses and also RSV with hMPV, may influence the natural course of bronchiolitis. A better understanding of these various interactions would help future decision-making, such as the extent to which searches for co-pathogens should be conducted in severe bronchiolitis patients already infected by RSV.","Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia; Komurian-Pradel, Florence; Richard, Nathalie; Vernet, Guy; Lina, Bruno; Floret, Daniel",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653208002977; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653208002977; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2008.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18829380/,361

Telehealth is not being used ubiquitously at present. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify the barriers that prevent ubiquitous use of telehealth and the ways in which telehealth improves health outcomes and quality of life indicators for older adults. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Kruse protocol and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Reviewers queried the following four research databases: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, and Embase (Science Direct). Reviewers analyzed 57 articles, performed a narrative analysis to identify themes, and identified barriers and reports of health outcomes and quality of life indicators found in the literature. RESULTS: Reviewers analyzed 57 studies across the following five interventions of telehealth: eHealth, mobile health (mHealth), telemonitoring, telecare (phone), and telehealth video calls, with a Cohen κ of 0.75. Reviewers identified 14 themes for barriers. The most common of which were technical literacy (25/144 occurrences, 17%), lack of desire (19/144 occurrences, 13%), and cost (11/144 occurrences, 8%). Reviewers identified 13 medical outcomes associated with telehealth interventions. The most common of which were decrease in psychological stress (21/118 occurrences, 18%), increase in autonomy (18/118 occurrences, 15%), and increase in cognitive ability (11/118 occurrences, 9%). Some articles did not report medical outcomes (18/57, 32%) and some did not report barriers (19/57, 33%). CONCLUSIONS: The literature suggests that the elimination of barriers could increase the prevalence of telehealth use by older adults. By increasing use of telehealth, proximity to care is no longer an issue for access, and thereby care can reach populations with chronic conditions and mobility restrictions. Future research should be conducted on methods for personalizing telehealth in older adults before implementation.

We analyzed clinical parameters and assessed the expression of these biomarkers in patients with different disease severity in a hospitalized Peruvian cohort to determine those associated with worse prognosis. We measured anti-spike IgG antibodies by ELISA and 30 cytokines by quantitative suspension array technology in 123 sera samples. We analyzed differences between patients with moderate, severe and fatal COVID-19 by logistic regression at baseline and in longitudinal samples. Significant differences were found among the clinical parameters: hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine and D-dimer levels. Higher anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal patient outcomes. At hospitalization, IL-10, IL-6, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNFα and IL-8 levels were already increased in fatal patients´ group. Meanwhile, multivariable analysis revealed that increased GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, and IL-8 values were associated with fatal outcomes. Moreover, longitudinal analysis identified IL-6 and MCP-1 as the main risk factors related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this Peruvian cohort we identified and validated biomarkers related to COVID-19 outcomes. Further studies are needed to identify novel criteria for stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital entry. BACKGROUND: In the most severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, large numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells become activated and begin to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. METHODS: A total of 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen in Lima, Peru were enrolled during August-October 2020. Of these, 21 had moderate disease, 24 severe diseases and 10 died. We measured 30 cytokines and chemokines by quantitative suspension array technology and anti-spike IgG antibodies using a commercial ELISA. We evaluated these parameters in peripheral blood every 2-5 days until patient discharge or death. Patient information and clinical parameters related were obtained from the respective clinical histories. RESULTS: The frequency of obesity differed among the 3 groups, being most frequent in patients who died. There were also significant differences in clinical parameters: hemoglobin, segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes,C-reactive protein, creatinine and D-dimer levels. Greater anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal outcomes. In univariate analyses, higher baseline concentrations of IL-6, MIP-1α, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNFα, IL-8 and IL-12p70 correlated with severity, while multivariable analysis showed that increased concentrations in 4 biomarkers (GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-8) were associated with fatal outcomes. Longitudinal analysis showed IL-6 (hazard ratio [HR] 6.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-28.7) and MCP-1 (HR 4.61, 95%CI 1.1-19.1) to be related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

We present a case of an overall healthy patient who developed a Klebsiella pneumoniae brain abscess in the absence of liver pathology. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Vietnamese man with past medical history significant for hypertension presented to the hospital with acute on chronic worsening of altered mental status, personality changes, and gait dysfunction. Initial vitals revealed temperature of 37.1 °C, heart rate 87 beats/minute, blood pressure 150/87 mmHg, respiratory rate 18/minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Physical exam was notable for altered mental status, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14, and right lower facial droop. Cardiopulmonary exam was within normal limits. Head computed tomography (CT) showed a left frontotemporal mass, with subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing a ring-enhancing lesion concerning for a brain abscess. The abscess was urgently drained; however, there was intraoperative spillage into the ventricles. Intraoperative cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the patient was maintained on appropriate antibiotics. He developed worsening mental status, septic shock, and cerebral edema requiring decompressive left hemicraniectomy. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no hepatic lesions. The patient did not improve, and the family elected for comfort measures. CONCLUSION: High mortality is associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae (as opposed to Klebsiella oxytoca) brain abscesses, especially in the setting of intraventricular spread.

The onset-to-door time was longer (153.0 vs. 120.5 min, p = 0.049) and seizures and intracranial tumours were more common among stroke mimics (16.9% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.012 and 9.6% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.037, respectively). We conclude that there was a decline in prehospital stroke triage quality during the lockdown despite low COVID-19 incidence in the country. Moreover, we observed an increase in hospital arrival delays and severe conditions presenting as stroke mimics. Our findings suggest that improved strategies are required to maintain optimal neurological care during public health emergencies.","Melaika, Kazimieras; Sveikata, Lukas; Wiśniewski, Adam; Jaxybayeva, Altynshash; Ekkert, Aleksandra; Jatužis, Dalius; Masiliūnas, Rytis",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672096/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18042150,361

OBJECTIVES: This work presents a new approach to selecting proper health-based thresholds for a heat warning system which are different from thresholds of heat-health relationship. METHODS: The proposed approach examined heat-health relationships through analyzing 15 years of health records with a modified generalized additive model (GAM), compared risk ratio increments (RRIs) of threshold candidates against a reference, assessed frequency of days above these candidates, and presented results graphically for easy communication. The candidate with the maximum RRI and proper occurring frequency is potentially the best threshold. Three heat indicators, including wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), temperature (T), and apparent temperature (AT), as well as three health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, heat-related hospital admissions, and heat-related emergency visits were evaluated. RESULTS: Risk ratios for all three health outcomes showed a consistent rising trend with increasing threshold candidates for all three heat indicators among different age and gender groups. WBGT had the most obvious increasing trend of RRIs with the three health outcomes. The maximum RRI was observed in heat-related emergency visits (242%), followed by heat-related hospital admissions (73%), and all-cause mortality (9%). The RRIs assessed for the three health outcomes pointed to the same thresholds, 33.0 °C, 34.0 °C, and 37.5 °C for WBGT, T, and AT, respectively. The number of days above these thresholds and for warning to be issued ranged between 0 and 7 days during 2000–2014. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated a new approach to determining heat-warning thresholds with different heat indicators and health outcomes. The proposed approach provides a straightforward, feasible, and flexible scientific tool that assists the authorities around the world in selecting a proper threshold for a heat warning system.","Cheng, Yu-Ting; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice; Hwang, Jing-Shiang",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599292/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118306947; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935118306947; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.12.059,361

The role and management of chronic immunosuppressive therapies during COVID-19 must be characterized. METHOD: Herein, we report the follow-up of a cohort of 47 KTs admitted at two Spanish Kidney Transplant Units who survived COVID-19. The impact of the management of immunosuppression during COVID-19 on graft function and immunologic events was evaluated. RESULTS: At least one immunosuppressive agent was withdrawn in 83% of patients, with antimetabolites being the most frequent. Steroids were generally not stopped and the dose was even increased in 15% of patients as part of the treatment of COVID-19. Although immunosuppressive drugs were suspended during a median time of 17 days, no rejection episodes neither de novo donor specific antibodies were observed up to 3 months after discharge, and no significant changes occurred in calculated panel reactive antibodies. Acute graft dysfunction was common (55%) and the severity was related to tacrolimus trough levels, which were higher in patients receiving antivirals. At the end of follow-up, all patients recovered baseline kidney function. CONCLUSION: Our observational study suggests that immunosuppression in KTs hospitalized due to COVID-19 could be safely minimized.","Anton Pampols, Paula; Trujillo, Hernando; Melilli, Edoardo; Urban, Blanca; Sandino Pérez, Justo; Favà, Alexandre; Gutierrez, Eduardo; Bestard, Oriol; Mancebo, Esther; Sevillano, Angel; Cruzado, Josep; Morales, Enrique",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab111.0017,361

The success of IgG concentrates on a clinical level is documented by the slowly increasing number of registered indication and the more rapid increase of the off-label uses, a topic dealt with in another contribution to this special issue of Frontiers in Immunology. A part of the success is the adverse event (AE) profile of IgG concentrates which is, even at life-long need for therapy, excellent. Transmission of pathogens in the last decade could be entirely controlled through the antecedent introduction by authorities of a regulatory network and installing quality standards by the plasma fractionation industry. The cornerstone of the regulatory network is current good manufacturing practice. Non-infectious AEs occur rarely and mainly are mild to moderate. However, in recent times, the increase in frequency of hemolytic and thrombotic AEs raised worrying questions on the possible background for these AEs. Below, we review elements of non-infectious AEs, and particularly focus on hemolysis and thrombosis. We discuss how the introduction of plasma fractionation by ion-exchange chromatography and polishing by immunoaffinity chromatographic steps might alter repertoire of specificities and influence AE profiles and efficacy of IgG concentrates.","Späth, Peter J.; Granata, Guido; La Marra, Fabiola; Kuijpers, Taco W.; Quinti, Isabella",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25699039/,361

The current study aims to examine the mediating role of coping strategies in the relationship between risk perception of COVID-19 and psychological well-being, as well as the relationship between meaning-based resources and psychological well-being amongst healthcare personnel in southern Poland. Two hundred and twenty-six healthcare personnel who worked in hospitals, outpatient clinics, and medical laboratories during the first few months of the coronavirus pandemic (March–May 2020) filled in questionnaires measuring risk perception of COVID-19, meaning-based resources, coping, and psychological well-being. The results demonstrate that risk perception was negatively related to psychological well-being, whereas meaning-based resources were positively associated with well-being. Two coping strategies—problem-focused and meaning-focused coping—mediated the relationship between risk perception and psychological well-being as well as the relationship between meaning-based resources and psychological well-being. This indicates that perception processes and personal factors do not directly influence healthcare personnel’s psychological well-being, but rather they do indirectly through coping processes.","Krok, Dariusz; Zarzycka, Beata",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33050068/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9103225,361

We conducted a multi-centre, retrospective matched cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive hospital inpatients analysed by HIV status. METHODS: HIV-negative patients were matched to people living with HIV (PLWH) admitted from 1 February 2020 to 31 May 2020 up to a 3:1 ratio by the following: hospital site, SARS-CoV-2 test date ± 7 days, age ± 5 years, gender, and index of multiple deprivation decile ± 1. The primary objective was clinical improvement (two-point improvement or better on a seven-point ordinal scale) or hospital discharge by day 28, whichever was earlier. RESULTS: A total of 68 PLWH and 181 HIV-negative comparators were included. In unadjusted analyses, PLWH had a reduced hazard of achieving clinical improvement or discharge [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-0.85, p = 0.005], but this association was ameliorated (aHR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.43-1.17, p = 0.18) after additional adjustment for ethnicity, frailty, baseline hypoxaemia, duration of symptoms prior to baseline, body mass index (BMI) categories and comorbidities. Baseline frailty (aHR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65-0.95, p = 0.011), malignancy (aHR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.17, 0.82, p = 0.014) remained associated with poorer outcomes.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Staff and parents/guardian participants in the 132 primary schools and 20 secondary schools participating in sKIDs and sKIDsPLUS surveillances. Main outcome measure Prevalence of control measures implemented in Autumn 2020, parental and staff perception of ease of implementation and acceptability of conducting school surveillance studies. Results In total, 56/152 (37%) schools participating in Public Health England's sKIDs study of COVID in schools accepted the invitation to participate in the survey. By 28 December 2020, 1,953 parent and 986 staff respondents had completed the online questionnaire. While more than half the parents were positive about their children returning to school, roughly a third reported being a little anxious. 90% and 82% of primary and secondary school parents were either completely or partly reassured by the preventive measures implemented in their schools. Among staff, 80% of primary staff and 87% of secondary school staff felt that they were at higher risk of COVID-19 because of their profession; only 52% of primary school staff and 38% of secondary school staff reportedly felt safe. According to the teaching staff, most preventive measures were well-implemented apart from requiring 2-metre distancing between staff. For students, maintaining the 2-metre distance was reported to be particularly difficult. By extension, secondary schools also struggled to maintain small groups at all times or ensuring that the same staff were assigned to each student group (a problem also commonly reported by parents).

Rainwater harvesting could be an optional water source to fulfill or support the emergency water demand in areas where there is abundant rainfall. The study aimed to assess the rainwater harvesting potential and storage requirements for households and selected institutions and to determine its adequacy to satisfy the emergency water demand for the prevention of COVID-19 in Dilla town, Southern Ethiopia. Rainwater harvesting potential for households and selected institutions were quantified using 17 years’ worth of rainfall data from the Ethiopian Meteorology Agency. To address the rainfall variability, we computed the confidence limits of monthly harvest-able rainwater potential using confidence intervals about the mean as well as confidence intervals using Coefficient of Variation (COV) of monthly rainfall. The storage requirements were also estimated by considering the driest and west seasons and months. The average annual rainfall in Dilla town was 1464 mm. Households with a roof area of 40 m2 and 100 m2 have the potential to harvest 7.2-39.66 m3 and 19.11-105.35 m3 of rainwater respectively.

We investigated the use of alignment-based and alignment-free methods and support vector machine using mononucleotide frequency and dinucleotide bias to predict the hosts of viruses, and applied these approaches to three datasets: rabies virus, coronavirus, and influenza A virus. For coronavirus, we used the spike gene sequences, while for rabies and influenza A viruses, we used the more conserved nucleoprotein gene sequences. We compared the three methods under different scenarios and showed that their performances are highly correlated with the variability of sequences and sample size. For conserved genes like the nucleoprotein gene, longer k-mers than mono- and dinucleotides are needed to better distinguish the sequences. We also showed that both alignment-based and alignment-free methods can accurately predict the hosts of viruses. When alignment is difficult to achieve or highly time-consuming, alignment-free methods can be a promising substitute to predict the hosts of new viruses.","Li, Han; Sun, Fengzhu",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-28308-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29968780/,361

We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an exemplary case where there is a large gap between private and social costs and where moral suasion has been widely used as a policy instrument. Based on a survey experiment with a representative sample of around 3500 Germans at the beginning of the pandemic, we study how moral appeals affect contributions with low and high opportunity costs, hand washing and social distancing, to reduce the infection externality as well as the support for governmental regulation. We find that Deontological moral suasion, appealing to individual moral duty, is effective in increasing planned social distancing and hand-washing, while a Consequentialist appeal only increases planned hand-washing. Both appeals increase support for governmental regulation. Exploring heterogeneous treatment effects reveals that younger respondents are more susceptible to Deontological appeals. Our results highlight the potential of moral appeals to induce intended private contributions to a public good or the reduction of externalities, which can help to overcome collective action problems for a range of environmental issues.","Bos, Björn; Drupp, Moritz A.; Meya, Jasper N.; Quaas, Martin F.",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836868/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00477-2,361

Its propagation and symptom progress are very rapid. This study evaluated the clinical characteristics, laboratory results and mortality factors of probable SARS cases. Methods This study was adopted with a retrospective research design to study probable SARS cases from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou and Kaoshiung from August 2003 to February 2004, with a total of 78 cases (average age, 44 years; standard deviation, 18 years; age range, 13–84 years) including 24 males (30.8%) and 54 females (69.2%). Results Most of the 78 cases involved nosocomial infection (56.4%). A total of 24 patients died, and the mortality rate was as high as 30.8%. Logistic regression analysis found that intubation (odds ratio, 115; p < 0.001) was the mortality forecast factor. Conclusion The mortality rate of intubation patients was 115 times higher than that of those who did not require intubation. Therefore, special care must be taken with SARS disease with severe infiltration chest X-ray images and respiratory distress. Positive medical treatment should be performed to lower the mortality rate.","Liu, Tei-Chu; Chang, Wen-Han; Jiang, Bing-Cheng; Maa, Suh-Hwa; Chien, Ding-Kuo; Tang, Woung-Ru",International Journal of Gerontology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873959809700183; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1873959809700183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288876/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1873-9598(09)70018-3,361
630135,Three challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic represents for psychiatry,2020-05-15,"The latest technologies associated with implantable physiological monitoring devices can record multiple channels of data (including: heart rates and rhythms, activity, temperature, impedance and posture), and coupled with powerful software applications, have provided novel insights into the physiology of animals in the wild. This perspective details past challenges and lessons learned from the uses and developments of implanted biologgers designed for human clinical application in our research on free-ranging American black bears (Ursus americanus). In addition, we reference other research by colleagues and collaborators who have leveraged these devices in their work, including: brown bears (Ursus arctos), grey wolves (Canis lupus), moose (Alces alces), maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). We also discuss the potentials for applications of such devices across a range of other species. To date, the devices described have been used in fifteen different wild species, with publications pending in many instances. We have focused our physiological research on the analyses of heart rates and rhythms and thus special attention will be paid to this topic. We then discuss some major expected step changes such as improvements in sensing algorithms, data storage, and the incorporation of next-generation short-range wireless telemetry. The latter provides new avenues for data transfer, and when combined with cloud-based computing, it not only provides means for big data storage but also the ability to readily leverage high-performance computing platforms using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. These advances will dramatically increase both data quantity and quality and will facilitate the development of automated recognition of extreme physiological events or key behaviours of interest in a broad array of environments, thus further aiding wildlife monitoring and management.

However, existing methodologies are inadequate for capturing eye-level greenness visibility exposure at high spatial resolutions for observers located on the ground. As a response, we developed an innovative methodological approach to model and map eye-level greenness visibility exposure for 5 m interval locations within a large study area. We used multi-source spatial data and applied viewshed analysis in conjunction with a distance decay model to compute a novel Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI) at more than 86 million observer locations. We compared our eye-level visibility exposure map with traditional top-down greenness exposure metrics such as Normalised Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a Street view based Green View Index (SGVI). Furthermore, we compared greenness visibility at street-only locations with total neighbourhood greenness visibility. We found strong to moderate correlations (r = 0.65-0.42, p < 0.05) between greenness visibility and mean NDVI, with a decreasing trend in correlation strength at increasing buffer distances from observer locations. Our findings suggest that top-down and eye-level measurements of greenness are two distinct metrics for assessing greenness exposure. Additionally, VGVI showed a strong correlation (r = 0.481, p < 0.01) with SGVI. Although the new VGVI has good agreement with existing street view based measures, we found that street-only greenness visibility values are not wholly representative of total neighbourhood visibility due to the under-representation of visible greenness in locations such as backyards and community parks. Our new methodology overcomes such underestimations, is easily transferable, and offers a computationally efficient approach to assessing eye-level greenness exposure.","Labib, S.

635346,Healthcare workers' anxieties and coping strategies during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Turkey,2021-03-02,"INTRODUCTION: A reduction in the number of interventional cardiology procedures has emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was performed to quantify this decrease and the impact on the management of myocardial infarction in Latin America. METHODS: A telematic survey was conducted for all countries in Latin America. Diagnostic catheterisations, coronary and structural interventions, as well as the incidence and delay to reperfusion therapy of myocardial infarction (STEMI), were recorded. Two periods were compared: from 24 February to 8 March 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and another 2‑week period that varied according to country (COVID-19). RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 79 centres in 20 countries. There was a significant decrease in the number of diagnostic procedures (−65.2%), coronary interventions (−59.4%), structural therapeutics (−86.1%) and STEMI care (−51.2%). A decrease was noted in the incidence of STEMI, but also a delay in the time to STEMI reperfusion. While there was a variation in activity in interventional cardiology between countries, patient behaviour was rather homogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in healthcare activity has been noted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including STEMI care, with the risk of increased mortality and/or morbidity following STEMI. Healthcare providers should encourage patients with suspected symptoms of STEMI to call for emergency care to ensure rapid diagnosis and timely reperfusion treatment.

The consequences of a pandemic can significantly affect and disrupt a large spectrum of workforce sectors in today's society. This paper, motivated by the impact of a pandemic, extends the formulation of the dynamic inoperability input–output model (DIIM) to account for economic perturbations resulting from such an event, which creates a time-varying and probabilistic inoperability to the workforce. A pandemic is a unique disaster, because the majority of its direct impacts are workforce related and it does not create significant direct impact to infrastructure. In light of this factor, this paper first develops a method of translating unavailable workforce into a measure of economic-sector inoperability. While previous formulations of the DIIM only allowed for the specification of an initial perturbation, this paper incorporates the fact that a pandemic can cause direct effects to the workforce over the recovery period. Given the uncertainty associated with the impact of a pandemic, this paper develops a simulation framework to account for the possible variations in realizations of the pandemic. The enhancements to the DIIM formulation are incorporated into a MatLab program and then applied to a case study to simulate a pandemic scenario in the Commonwealth of Virginia.","Orsi, Mark J.; Santos, Joost R.",IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern A Syst Hum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32390784/; https://doi.org/10.1109/tsmca.2009.2033032,361

Although much effort has focused on Spike adaptation for viral entry and adaptive immune escape, B.1.1.7 mutations outside Spike likely contribute to enhance transmission. Here we used unbiased abundance proteomics, phosphoproteomics, mRNA sequencing and viral replication assays to show that B.1.1.7 isolates more effectively suppress host innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells. We found that B.1.1.7 isolates have dramatically increased subgenomic RNA and protein levels of Orf9b and Orf6, both known innate immune antagonists. Expression of Orf9b alone suppressed the innate immune response through interaction with TOM70, a mitochondrial protein required for RNA sensing adaptor MAVS activation, and Orf9b binding and activity was regulated via phosphorylation. We conclude that B.1.1.7 has evolved beyond the Spike coding region to more effectively antagonise host innate immune responses through upregulation of specific subgenomic RNA synthesis and increased protein expression of key innate immune antagonists. We propose that more effective innate immune antagonism increases the likelihood of successful B.1.1.7 transmission, and may increase in vivo replication and duration of infection.","Thorne, Lucy G; Bouhaddou, Mehdi; Reuschl, Ann-Kathrin; Zuliani-Alvarez, Lorena; Polacco, Ben; Pelin, Adrian; Batra, Jyoti; Whelan, Matthew V.X.; Ummadi, Manisha; Rojc, Ajda; Turner, Jane; Obernier, Kirsten; Braberg, Hannes; Soucheray, Margaret; Richards, Alicia; Chen, Kuei-Ho; Harjai, Bhavya; Memon, Danish; Hosmillo, Myra; Hiatt, Joseph; Jahun, Aminu; Goodfellow, Ian G.; Fabius, Jacqueline M.; Shokat, Kevan; Jura, Natalia; Verba, Klim; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Beltrao, Pedro; Swaney, Danielle L.; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Jolly, Clare; Towers, Greg J.; Krogan, Nevan J.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127972/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.06.446826,361

In the present study, the standardization and validation of a one step, four tube reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) for rapid detection and serotyping of the DENV targeting NS1 gene using the Genie® II flourometer was carried out. The performance of the RT-LAMP was compared to RT-PCR, CDC 1-4 Real time PCR and the NS1 antigen ELISA, IgM and IgG anti DENV antibodies. Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 250/300 patients suspected clinically of DENV infection. RT- LAMP and CDC 1-4 Real time PCR assay was positive in 148/250 patients, while 92/250 patients were positive for anti- Dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. The RT-LAMP assay and the CDC real-time RT-PCR assay showed high concordance (k = 1.0). The detection rate of acute DENV infection improved to 96% (240/250) when the results of RT-LAMP were combined with NS1 Ag, IgM and IgG ELISA. The RT-LAMP had a detection limit of 100 copies for DEN-1 and DEN-2, 10 copies for DEN-3 and DEN-4 compared to 1000 copies for DEN-1 and DEN-2, 100 copies for DEN-3 and DEN-4 by the conventional RT-PCR.

Such local modelling has not been completed for diet consumption in England despite diet being an important predictor of health status. The study sets out whether aspects of adult diet can be modelled from previously collected data to define and evaluate area-level interventions to address obesity and ill-health. METHODS: Adults aged 16 years and over living in England. Consumption of fruit, vegetables, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are modelled using small-area estimation methods in English neighbourhoods (Middle Super Output Areas [MSOA]) to identify areas where reported portions are significantly different from recommended levels of consumption. The selected aspects of diet are modelled from respondents in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey using pooled data from 2008–2016. RESULTS: Estimates indicate that the average prevalence of adults consuming less than one portion of fruit, vegetables or 100% juice each day by MSOA is 6.9% (range of 4.3 to 14.7%, SE 0.06) and the average prevalence of drinking more than 330ml/day of SSB is 11.5% (range of 5.7 to 30.5%, SE 0.03). Credible intervals around the estimates are wider for SSB consumption. The results identify areas including regions in London, urban areas in the North of England and the South coast which may be prioritised for targeted interventions to support reduced consumption of SSB and/or an increase in portions of fruit and vegetables. CONCLUSION: These estimates provide valuable information at a finer spatial scale than is presently feasible, allowing for within-country and locality prioritisation of resources to improve diet. Local, targeted interventions to improve fruit and vegetable consumption such as subsidies or voucher schemes should be considered where consumption of these foods is predicted to be low.","Smith, Dianna M.; Vogel, Christina; Campbell, Monique; Alwan, Nisreen; Moon, Graham",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161358/,361

METHODS: Three scales from the BREAST-Q Breast Cancer BCT Module Version 2.0 questionnaire were used to collect patient-reported outcomes regarding post-operative physical well-being of the chest, post-operative satisfaction with breast cosmesis, and post-operative adverse effects of radiation. RESULTS: Patients who received EBRT travelled farther on average than patients who received IORT to complete treatment. Respondents who received IORT reported better physical well-being of the chest than those who received EBRT. Regression revealed that the respondent’s age was the determining factor in the difference between IORT and EBRT post-operative physical well-being scores, where younger patients report poorer well-being. There was no difference in patient-reported outcomes regarding post-operative satisfaction with breast cosmesis or adverse effects of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received IORT reported better physical well-being of the chest than patients who received EBRT. There appeared to be a relationship between age and physical well-being of chest. This study suggested that there was no difference in patient-reported outcomes concerning post-operative satisfaction with breast cosmesis or post-operative adverse effects of radiation between patients who received IORT and those who received EBRT.","Leatherman, Jo; Nicholas, Christina; Cusick, Therese; Cooke, Ellen; Ablah, Elizabeth; Okut, Hayrettin; Hunt, Diane",Kans J Med,https://doi.org/10.17161/kjm.vol1415147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262637/,361

METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective case series included 238 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Hospital Universitario Clínico San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) who were discharged or who died. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain information on sex, age, personal antecedents, clinical features, findings on physical examination, and laboratory results for each patient. Associations between mortality and baseline characteristics were estimated as hazard ratios (HR) calculated with Cox regression models. Series mortality was 25.6%. Among patients with dependence for basic activities of daily living, 78.7% died, and among patients residing in retirement homes, 80.8% died. The variables most clearly associated with a greater hazard of death were age (3% HR increase per 1-year increase in age; 95%CI 1–6), diabetes mellitus (HR 2.42, 95%CI 1.43–4.09), SatO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (43% HR reduction per 1-point increase; 95%CI 23–57), SOFA score (19% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 5–34) and CURB-65 score (76% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 23–143). CONCLUSIONS: The patients residing in retirement homes showed great vulnerability.

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether mind-body modalities improve burnout and other mental health aspects of nurses. A comprehensive search was conducted using six electronic databases. Randomized controlled trials using mind-body modalities on the mental health of nurses, up to January 2021, were included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Seventeen studies were included in the review. Data on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and yoga were available for burnout, and there was no evidence that multimodal resilience programs including MBIs statistically significantly improved burnout levels compared to no intervention or active control groups. However, one study reported that yoga could significantly improve emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, which are subscales of burnout, compared to usual care. In addition, the effects of MBIs, relaxation, yoga, and music on various mental health outcomes and stress-related symptoms have been reported. In conclusion, there was some evidence that yoga was helpful for improvement in burnout of nurses. However, due to the heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes of the studies included, further high-quality clinical trials are needed on this topic in the future.","Jung, Su-Eun; Ha, Da-Jung; Park, Jung-Hyun; Lee, Boram; Kim, Myo-Sung; Sim, Kyo-Lin; Choi, Yung-Hyun; Kwon, Chan-Young",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444604/,361

In contrast, in high income countries, only10-25% of stillbirths are caused by infection. Syphilis, where prevalent, causes the majority of infectious stillbirths and is the infection most amenable to screening and treatment. Ascending bacterial infection is a common cause of stillbirth, but prevention has proven elusive. Many viral infections are causal for stillbirth but aside from vaccination for common childhood diseases, it is unclear how most viral-caused stillbirths may be prevented. Malaria, because of its high prevalence and extensive placental damage accounts for large numbers of stillbirths. Intermittent malarial prophylaxis and insecticide impregnated bed nets should decrease stillbirths. Many animal and vector-borne infections cause stillbirth. Because this relationship is especially important in LMICs, research that more clearly defines this relationship is crucial to reduce the unacceptably high stillbirth rates in those areas.","Goldenberg, Robert L.; McClure, Elizabeth M.; Saleem, Sarah; Reddy, Uma M.",The Lancet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673609617128; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3893931?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(09)61712-8; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673609617128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20223514/,361

Many workers migrating to Thailand are young unskilled workers from Myanmar. In this study, we examine factors associated with Myanmar migrant workers’ smoking status and characterized smoking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in one seafood factory in Thailand. This descriptive study utilized person-to-person interviews among 300 Myanmar migrants in one seafood factory in Thailand, of which 94.3% were young males between 18 and 39 years of age. Results demonstrated that 90% were current daily smokers, over 90% smoked 30–60 times per month, and 95% spent less than 500 baht (US $16) per month on smoking. About 70% of current smokers had 6–10 friends who smoked, compared with 40% of non-smokers (chi-square, p-value ≤ 0.07). Among this sample of mainly male migrant workers, smoking is very common, in part driven through social contact, but levels of dependence appear relatively low. The results suggest potential intervention approaches to reduce high smoking prevalence among this population, such as targeting young males and addressing their concerns about negative attitudes by peers to tobacco use and the unhealthful exposures of women and children in their families and the larger community.","Charoenca, Naowarut; Chaw, Nan Khin Thet; Kungskulniti, Nipapun; Hamann, Stephen L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444408/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168659,361

This study aimed to characterise the antimicrobial resistance patterns, molecular subtypes, and integron types and resistance gene cassettes in S. sonnei from Jiangsu Province, China. METHODS: In total, 340 S. sonnei were collected in 2002–2011 throughout Jiangsu Province. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR amplification of integrons, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing of cassette regions were performed. RESULTS: Resistance rates to ampicillin (67.7%), nalidixic acid (75.2%), tetracycline (73.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (68.7%) remained high. Strains from Centre and South Jiangsu showed higher resistance and multiresistance rates compared with the North. PFGE analysis indicated that large-scale clonal transmission among different cities occurred several times during 10 years. Among all strains, 55.9% (190/340) harboured class 1 integrons, 80.3% (273/340) harboured class 2 integrons and 49.4% (168/340) harboured an atypical class 1 integron. Resistance rates to nine antimicrobials in the class 1 integron-positive group were significantly higher than in the negative group (P < 0.05). Seven different gene cassettes were detected in class 1 integrons. The most prevalent type was aacA4–cmlA1 (114/286). Class 2 integrons carried the gene cassette array dfrA1–sat1–aadA1, and the atypical class 1 integron carried bla(OXA-30)–aadA1. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing antimicrobial resistance and significant clonal transmission of S. sonnei circulating in Jiangsu were closely related to the high prevalence of integrons and gene cassettes. Long-term cross-regional monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is urgently required for S. sonnei.","Gu, Bing; Xu, Ting; Kang, Haiquan; Xu, Yanling; Liu, Genyan; Pan, Shiyang; Qian, Huimin; Ma, Ping",J Glob Antimicrob Resist,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213716517300747; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2017.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28606485/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213716517300747,361

The increase in morbidity and mortality resulting from microbial infections has been attributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant microbes. Associated with the increase in multidrug resistance is the lack of new and effective antimicrobials. This has led to global initiatives to identify novel and more effective antimicrobial agents in addition to discovering novel and effective drug delivery and targeting methods. The use of nanoparticles as novel biomaterials to fully achieve this feat is currently gaining global attention. Nanoparticles could become an indispensable viable therapeutic option for treating drug-resistant infections. Of all the nanoparticles, the metals and metal oxide nanoparticles appear to offer the most promise and have attracted tremendous interest from many researchers. Moreover, the use of nanomaterials in photothermal therapy has received considerable attention over the years. This review provides current insight on antimicrobial resistance as well as the mechanisms of nanoparticle antibacterial activity. It offers an in-depth review of all the recent findings in the use of nanomaterials as agents against multi-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Also, nanomaterials that can respond to light stimuli (photothermal therapy) to kill microbes and facilitate enhanced drug delivery and release are discussed. Moreover, the synergistic interactions of nanoparticles with antibiotics and other nanomaterials, microbial adaptation strategies to nanoparticles, current challenges, and future prospects were extensively discussed.

In this study, we isolated a Yokose virus from a serum sample of Myotis daubentonii (order Chiroptera, family Vespertilionidae) collected in Yunnan province, China in 2013. METHODS: The serum specimens of bat were used to inoculate in BHK-21 and Vero E6 cells for virus isolation. Then the viral complete genome sequence was obtained and was used for phylogenetic analysis performed by BEAST software package. RESULTS: The virus was shown to have cytopathic effects in mammalian cells (BHK-21 and Vero E6). Genome sequencing indicated that it has a single open reading frame (ORF), with a genome of 10,785 nucleotides in total. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genome suggests that XYBX1332 is a Yokose virus (YOKV) of the genus Flavivirus. Nucleotide and amino acid homology levels of the ORF of XYBX1332 and Oita-36, the original strain of YOKV, were 72 and 82%, respectively. The ORFs of XYBX1332 and Oita-36 encode 3422 and 3425 amino acids, respectively. In addition, the non-coding regions (5′- and 3′-untranslated regions [UTRs]) of these two strains differ in length and the homology of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs was 81.5 and 78.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The isolation of YOKV (XYBX1332) from inland China thousands of kilometers from Yokosuka, Japan, suggests that the geographical distribution of YOKV is not limited to the islands of Japan and that it can also exist in the inland areas of Asia. However, there are large differences between the Chinese and Japanese YOKV strains in viral genome.","Feng, Yun; Ren, Xiaojie; Xu, Ziqian; Fu, Shihong; Li, Xiaolong; Zhang, Hailin; Yang, Weihong; Zhang, Yuzhen; Liang, Guodong",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1107-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634973/,361

This may be affecting patient–therapist relation and family functioning. To assess emotional reaction and their influence on family systems, we developed a 55-item questionnaire based on the Atlas of Emotion and the Calgary Family Intervention Model. METHODS: We recruited more than 160 participants to validate an online survey, namely the Jugendwerk Dysphagia Emotion and Family Assessment Score (JDEFA). Forty-Nine health care workers, patients, and family members completed the survey and provided additional comments regarding interactions of emotions and dysphagia. Analysis was accomplished by non-parametric tests and principal component analyses with Varimax rotation. Additionally, we accomplished a qualitative content analysis taking a phenomenological single-coder approach. RESULTS: Analysis revealed a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.93. Using primary component analyses, justified by a Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin value of 0.81, we identified two main factors (emotion and family). Patients experienced sadness and anger more often than health care providers, whereas family members felt anxiety even more often. Our qualitative analysis revealed 20 themes (7 for anger, 2 enjoyment, 4 sadness, 3 anxiety, 2 disgust, 1 shame, and 1 punishment). Predominantly, the fear of choking was mentioned by patients, whereas professionals reported about the fear of making mistakes. CONCLUSION: The JDEFA is a valid and reliable testing tool for the assessment of swallowing disorders concerning emotional aspects and family functioning.

652406,Knowledge and awareness among physiotherapy students to combat COVID-19: A questionnaire based study,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a risk cluster for a number of secondary diseases. The implementation of prevention programs requires early detection of individuals at risk. However, access to health care providers is limited in structurally weak regions. Brandenburg, a rural federal state in Germany, has an especially high MetS prevalence and disease burden. This study aims to validate and test the feasibility of a setup for mobile diagnostics of MetS and its secondary diseases, to evaluate the MetS prevalence and its association with moderating factors in Brandenburg and to identify new ways of early prevention, while establishing a “Mobile Brandenburg Cohort” to reveal new causes and risk factors for MetS. METHODS: In a pilot study, setups for mobile diagnostics of MetS and secondary diseases will be developed and validated. A van will be equipped as an examination room using point-of-care blood analyzers and by mobilizing standard methods. In study part A, these mobile diagnostic units will be placed at different locations in Brandenburg to locally recruit 5000 participants aged 40-70 years. They will be examined for MetS and advice on nutrition and physical activity will be provided. Questionnaires will be used to evaluate sociodemographics, stress perception, and physical activity. In study part B, participants with MetS, but without known secondary diseases, will receive a detailed mobile medical examination, including MetS diagnostics, medical history, clinical examinations, and instrumental diagnostics for internal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and cognitive disorders. Participants will receive advice on nutrition and an exercise program will be demonstrated on site. People unable to participate in these mobile examinations will be interviewed by telephone. If necessary, participants will be referred to general practitioners for further diagnosis. DISCUSSION: The mobile diagnostics approach enables early detection of individuals at risk, and their targeted referral to local health care providers. Evaluation of the MetS prevalence, its relation to risk-increasing factors, and the “Mobile Brandenburg Cohort” create a unique database for further longitudinal studies on the implementation of home-based prevention programs to reduce mortality, especially in rural regions.

652867,Impact of COVID-19 on Maternal Mental Health,2021-02-22,"The pandemic viral illness COVID-19 is especially life-threatening in the elderly and in those with any of a variety of chronic medical conditions. This essay explores the possibility that the heightened risk may involve activation of the “extended autonomic system” (EAS). Traditionally, the autonomic nervous system has been viewed as consisting of the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the enteric nervous system. Over the past century, however, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems have come to the fore, justifying expansion of the meaning of “autonomic.” Additional facets include the sympathetic adrenergic system, for which adrenaline is the key effector; the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis; arginine vasopressin (synonymous with anti-diuretic hormone); the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with angiotensin II and aldosterone the main effectors; and cholinergic anti-inflammatory and sympathetic inflammasomal pathways. A hierarchical brain network—the “central autonomic network”—regulates these systems; embedded within it are components of the Chrousos/Gold “stress system.” Acute, coordinated alterations in homeostatic settings (allostasis) can be crucial for surviving stressors such as traumatic hemorrhage, asphyxiation, and sepsis, which throughout human evolution have threatened homeostasis; however, intense or long-term EAS activation may cause harm. While required for appropriate responses in emergencies, EAS activation in the setting of chronically decreased homeostatic efficiencies (dyshomeostasis) may reduce thresholds for induction of destabilizing, lethal vicious cycles. Testable hypotheses derived from these concepts are that biomarkers of EAS activation correlate with clinical and pathophysiologic data and predict outcome in COVID-19 and that treatments targeting specific abnormalities identified in individual patients may be beneficial.","Goldstein, David S.",Clin Auton Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32700055/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10286-020-00714-0,361

Their structures were established on the basis of analytical (CHN) and spectral (IR, (1)H-NMR, EIMS) data. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their toxicity potential by a brine shrimp lethality bioassay. Ten compounds i.e., 3a, 3e, 3i-3l and 3n-3q proved to be active in this assay, displaying promising toxicity (LD(50) = 1.11 × 10(−5) M − 1.80 × 10(−4) M). Amongst these, 3k, 3n and 3o were found to be the most active ones (LD(50) = 1.11 × 10(−5) M − 1.43 × 10(−5) M). Compound 3k showed the highest activity with a LD(50) value of 1.11 × 10(−5) M and can, therefore, be used as a lead for further studies. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that the presence of strong inductively electron-attracting trifluoromethoxy substituent at position-5 of the isatin moiety played an important role in inducing or enhancing toxic potentiality of some of the synthesized compounds.","Pervez, Humayun; Saira, Naveeda; Iqbal, Mohammad Saeed; Yaqub, Muhammad; Khan, Khalid Mohammed",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16086408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25134761/,361

Using the lockdowns in different cities as exogenous shocks, our difference-in-differences estimations show that lockdown policies significantly reduced air pollution by 12% on average. Based on the first lockdown city, Wuhan, we present three underlying mechanisms driving our findings: anticipatory effects, spillover effects, and a city’s level of connection with Wuhan. Our findings are more pronounced in cities whose population was more willing to self-isolate or more susceptible to anxiety, or whose government faces less pressure to stimulate economic growth. Overall, this study contributes to the literature by evaluating the unintended consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak for air quality, and provides timely policy implications for policymakers.","Liu, Shasha; Kong, Gaowen; Kong, Dongmin",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00492-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836853/,361

There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and thus repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a restraint energy distribution (RED) function, making the practical FEP-ABFE−based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible. As a result, out of 25 drugs predicted, 15 were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The most potent one is dipyridamole (inhibitory constant K(i) = 0.04 µM) which has shown promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (K(i) = 0.36 µM) and chloroquine (K(i) = 0.56 µM) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.","Li, Zhe; Li, Xin; Huang, Yi-You; Wu, Yaoxing; Liu, Runduo; Zhou, Lingli; Lin, Yuxi; Wu, Deyan; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Hao; Xu, Ximing; Yu, Kunqian; Zhang, Yuxia; Cui, Jun; Zhan, Chang-Guo; Wang, Xin; Luo, Hai-Bin",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010470117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051297/,361

655399,Delusions of Certainty: Commercial Vessel COVID-19 Risk Stratification,2021-06-04,"Viral respiratory diseases remain problematic in swine. Among viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV), alone or in combination, are the two main known contributors to lung infectious diseases. Previous studies demonstrated that experimental dual infections of pigs with PRRSV followed by SIV can cause more severe disease than the single viral infections. However, our understanding of the impact of one virus on the other at the molecular level is still extremely limited. Thus, the aim of the current study was to determine the influence of dual infections, compared to single infections, in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and precision cut lung slices (PCLS). PAMs were isolated and PCLS were acquired from the lungs of healthy 8-week-old pigs. Then, PRRSV (ATCC VR-2385) and a local SIV strain of H1N1 subtype (A/Sw/Saskatchewan/18789/02) were applied simultaneously or with 3 h apart on PAMs and PCLS for a total of 18 h. Immuno-staining for both viruses and beta-tubulin, real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA assays targeting various genes (pathogen recognition receptors, interferons (IFN) type I, cytokines, and IFN-inducible genes) and proteins were performed to analyze the cell and the tissue responses. Interference caused by the first virus on replication of the second virus was observed, though limited. On the host side, a synergistic effect between PRRSV and SIV co-infections was observed for some transcripts such as TLR3, RIG-I, and IFNβ in PCLS. The PRRSV infection 3 h prior to SIV infection reduced the response to SIV while the SIV infection prior to PRRSV infection had limited impact on the second infection. This study is the first to show an impact of PRRSV/SIV co-infection and superinfections in the cellular and tissue immune response at the molecular level. It opens the door to further research in this exciting and intriguing field.","Dobrescu, I.; Levast, B.; Lai, K.; Delgado-Ortega, M.; Walker, S.; Banman, S.; Townsend, H.; Simon, G.; Zhou, Y.; Gerdts, V.; Meurens, F.",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.11.037; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513005634; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513005634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418046/,361

Given the pervasiveness of this problem, low mobility during hospitalization was first described as ‘dangerous’ in 1947 and later described as an epidemic. Hospitals have made considerable progress over the last half-century and the last two decades in particular, however, the COVID-19 pandemic presents serious new challenges that threaten to undermine recent efforts and progress towards a culture of mobility. In this special article, we address the question of how to confront an epidemic of immobility within a pandemic. We identify 4 specific problems for creating and advancing a culture of mobility posed by COVID-19: social distancing and policies restricting patient movement, personnel constraints, PPE shortages, and increased patient hesitancy to ambulate. We also propose 4 specific solutions to address these problems. These approaches will help support a culture of healthy mobility during and after hospitalization and help patients to keep moving during the pandemic and beyond.","Pereira, Daniel E; Welch, Sarah A; Montgomery, Chandler D; Hatcher, Jeremy B; Duggan, Mariu C; Greysen, S Ryan",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077507/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab132,361

The course of these CRDs (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis) are often punctuated by microbial infections that may result in hospitalization and are associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as reduced quality of life. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a key protein that regulates airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion. There has been much interest in IL-13 from the last two decades. This cytokine is believed to play a decisive role in the exacerbation of inflammation during the course of viral infections, especially, in those with pre-existing CRDs. Here, we discuss the common viral infections in CRDs, as well as the potential role that IL-13 plays in the virus-induced disease pathogenesis of CRDs. We also discuss, in detail, the immune-modulation potential of IL-13 that could be translated to in-depth studies to develop IL-13-based therapeutic entities.","Shastri, Madhur D; Allam, Venkata Sita Rama Raju; Shukla, Shakti D; Jha, Niraj Kumar; Paudel, Keshav Raj; Peterson, Gregory M; Patel, Rahul P; Hansbro, Philip M; Chellappan, Dinesh K; Dua, Kamal",Life sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352260/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119871,361

This study aims to identify psychosocial problems faced by HCWs in Vietnam during the national partial lockdown between 1 and 22 April 2020 and to identify risk factors associated with psychosocial issues among this population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the second week of April 2020 during the national lockdown in Vietnam. Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants through web-based surveys. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on HCWs through online surveys. Results: Of the 349 HCWs, we found 22.6% reported psychosocial problems. Most of participants reported having exposure to COVID-19 daily (48.7%). The majority of them also felt that their job put them at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections (90.3%) and expressed fear of potential infection (85.7%). Despite COVID-19 risks, 95.4% of participants, however, expressed their willingness to continue working at their current health facility. In addition, 94.8% of participants believed if they or their family members had been infected, their agency leaders would have provided them with appropriate medical care. Lastly, HCWs who worked in the internal medicine department who did not take care of COVID-19 patients or expressed fear of becoming infected were more likely to have higher total IES-R scores. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the support of healthcare leaders and assurance of care might be helpful in mitigating the psychological effects of COVID-19 among HCWs in Vietnam. These resources should be tailored to HCWs who are working in different areas of health services, including staff who are not working directly with COVID-19 patients. In addition, psychosocial health resources should be provided for not only physicians but also nursing staff.","Nguyen, Thao Thanh; Le, Xuan Thi Thanh; Nguyen, Nguyen Thao Thi; Nguyen, Quang Nhat; Le, Huong Thi; Pham, Quan Thi; Ta, Nhung Kim Thi; Nguyen, Quynh Thi; Nguyen, Anh Ngoc; Hoang, Men Thi; Pham, Hai Quang; Vu, Linh Gia; Luong, Anh Mai; Koh, David; Nguyen, Trang Ha; Tran, Bach Xuan; Latkin, Carl A.; Ho, Cyrus S.H.; Ho, Roger C.M.",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.562337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354605/,361

By paying royalties, companies can get permission to exploit resources. Yet, there is no official report breaking down the payments for hydrocarbons and lignite, in particular regarding the effectively levied fees. Hence, the objective of this study is to provide an overview of the ownership and paid royalties, and to discuss the sustainable use and management of the German subsurface in the face of ecological, social, and economic impacts of resource exploitation. Our analysis shows that the subsurface is partly state- and partly company-owned. Lignite is almost exclusively privately owned by two companies. In contrast, hydrocarbons are predominantly state-owned. In 2017, on average 13% was paid in royalties for gas and 11% for petroleum. These royalties have minor impact on state budgets. For instance, in the concerned state of Lower Saxony, the levies amount to 189 million € or 0.6% of the state budget. Thus, the state income from royalties is low. However, local communities and property owners have no financial benefits.

The purpose of this study is to understand the internet use patterns of Chinese adults and to measure their associations with sleep duration from variety, frequency and type. METHODS: A total of 19,730 samples were selected from 2018 data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal study. Internet usage was obtained by specific questions, and the range of sleep period was grouped according to recommendations from the National Sleep Foundation. Kruskal–Wallis H-test and the chi-squared test were used for basic descriptive analysis, and multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the relationships between internet use and sleep duration. Stata version 15.0 was used for data cleaning, and SPSS version 20.0 was used for statistics analysis. RESULTS: After screening, a total of 6346 persons were included in the analysis, of which 3148 (49.61%) were males and 3198 (50.39%) were females. Age ranged from 21 to 95 years, most persons were over 45 years old, with the median age of 56 years. Only 1180 (18.59%) participants used the internet, and almost all of them used mobile phones (1137, 96.36%), the other three types were desktop computer (232, 19.66%), laptop computer (69, 5.85%) and tablet (73, 6.19%). There were 912 (77.28%) and 268 (22.71%) participants who used only one and two or more types, respectively. In the unadjusted model, both short sleep and long sleep were associated with internet use compared with normal sleep duration (0.806 [0.708–0.918] p = 0.001; 0.345 [0.251–0.475] p < 0.000). After adjusting for all covariates, the association between long sleep and internet use still persisted (0.612 [0.433–0.865] p = 0.005), but no significant difference was found in short sleep (0.929 [0.803–1.075] p = 0.325). CONCLUSION: Internet use was found to be closely associated with sleep and the duration of sleep negatively affected, which may provide new ideas for sleep hygiene recommendations and healthy media use.

Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.","Caramelo, Francisco; Ferreira, Nuno; Oliveiros, Barbara",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027268,361

However, there is limited evidence regarding the relationship between changes in social participation and depressive symptom onset among older adults during the pandemic. We examined the association between changes in social participation and the onset of depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This was a longitudinal study. SETTING: Communities in Minokamo City, a semi-urban area in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 65 years using random sampling. Participants completed a questionnaire survey at baseline (March 2020) and follow-up (October 2020). MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Two-Question Screen. Based on their social participation status in March and October 2020, participants were classified into four groups: “continued participation,” “decreased participation,” “increased participation,” and “consistent non-participation.” RESULTS: A total of 597 older adults without depressive symptoms at baseline were analyzed (mean age = 79.8 years; 50.4% females). Depressive symptoms occurred in 20.1% of the participants during the observation period. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis showed that decreased social participation was significantly associated with the onset of the depressive symptoms, compared to continued participation, after adjusting for all covariates (incidence rate ratio = 1.59, 95% confidence interval = 1.01–2.50, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Older adults with decreased social participation during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated a high risk of developing depressive symptoms. We recommend that resuming community activities and promoting the participation of older adults, with sufficient consideration for infection prevention, are needed to maintain mental health among older adults.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze how efficient setting up of a central sampling team would be to prevent any outbreak within the institution by minimizing the movement of suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in the inpatient wards. The secondary objective was to train maximum resident doctors to collect samples of admitted patients. METHODOLOGY: A central sampling team comprising of resident doctors from various departments was made who did sampling of the suspected COVID-19 inpatients admitted under various specialties. RESULTS: There were a total of 341 patients [209 males (61.29%), 132 females (38.7%)] and 335 patients underwent sampling. There was a positive correlation between: (1) number of calls from a department vs percentage of positive samples in that department [Pearson correlation coefficient (R) = 0.47; P = 0.026], (2) number of samples taken by resident of a particular department from central sampling team vs number of positive samples taken by resident of that department [R = 0.8739, P = 0.01] and (3) number of visits to a department vs number of residents trained in that department [R = 0.93; P = 0.00001]. CONCLUSION: Formulation of a central sampling team led to changes like a separate donning and doffing area in each ward and training of many resident doctors posted in different wards. This made each ward self-sufficient in collection of samples.

Strong control is considered due to the social separation. The result is consequently associated with a macroscopic law for the population. This dynamic system is useful to recognize the behavior of the growth rate of the infection and to confirm if its control is correctly functioning.

Although most of the tribe was rounded up and forced to relocate to Bosque Redondo, the adult breeding population was large enough to prevent a genetic bottleneck. However, some Navajo underwent further population bottlenecks while hiding from the brutal US Army action (under Kit Carson’s guidance). This led to an increased frequency of other autosomal recessive diseases. Recent advances in population genetics, pathophysiology of the diseases, and social/ethical issues concerning their study are reviewed.","Erickson, Robert P.",J Appl Genet,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13353-021-00630-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880741/,361
658650,"The Vital Role of a Federally Qualified Community Health Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020-11-10,"Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia despite the widespread use of vaccines. While vaccines are effective at reducing the incidence of most serotypes included in vaccines, a rise in infection due to nonvaccine serotypes and moderate efficacy against some vaccine serotypes have contributed to high disease incidence. Additionally, numerous isolates of S. pneumoniae are antibiotic or multidrug resistant. Several conserved pneumococcal proteins prevalent in the majority of serotypes have been examined for their potential as vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials. An additional, yet-unexplored tool for disease prevention and treatment is the use of human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting conserved pneumococcal proteins. Here, we isolated the first human MAbs (PhtD3, PhtD6, PhtD7, PhtD8, and PspA16) against the pneumococcal histidine triad protein (PhtD) and the pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), two conserved and protective antigens. MAbs to PhtD target diverse epitopes on PhtD, and MAb PspA16 targets the N-terminal segment of PspA. The PhtD-specific MAbs bind to multiple serotypes, while MAb PspA16 serotype breadth is limited. MAbs PhtD3 and PhtD8 prolong the survival of mice infected with pneumococcal serotype 3. Furthermore, MAb PhtD3 prolongs the survival of mice in intranasal and intravenous infection models with pneumococcal serotype 4 and in mice infected with pneumococcal serotype 3 when administered 24 h after pneumococcal infection. All PhtD and PspA MAbs demonstrate opsonophagocytic activity, suggesting a potential mechanism of protection. Our results identify new human MAbs for pneumococcal disease prevention and treatment and identify epitopes on PhtD and PspA recognized by human B cells.","Huang, Jiachen; Gingerich, Aaron D.; Royer, Fredejah; Paschall, Amy V.; Pena-Briseno, Alma; Avci, Fikri Y.; Mousa, Jarrod J.",Infect Immun,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00747-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649050/,361

Variants of concern (VOCs) can be detected in the wastewater samples using next generation sequencing, however it can be challenging to determine the relative abundance of different VOCs since the reads cannot be assembled into complete genomes. Here, we present Alcov (abundance learning of SARS-CoV-2 variants), a tool that uses mutation frequencies in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data to predict the distribution of VOC lineages in the sample. We used Alcov to predict the distributions of lineages from three wastewater samples which agreed well with clinical data. By predicting not just which VOCs are present, but their relative abundances in the population, Alcov extracts a more complete snapshot of the variants which are circulating in a community.","Ellmen, I.; Lynch, M.

660152,Population density predicts youth's physical activity changes during Covid-19 - Results from the MoMo study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The need for early identification of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in communities was high in Yemen during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic because most cases presenting to health facilities were severe. Early detection of cases would allow early interventions to interrupt the transmission chains. This study aimed to describe the implementation of community-based surveillance (CBS) in in internally displaced people (IDP) camps and urban settings in Yemen from 15 April 2020 to 30 September 2020. METHODS: Following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for evaluation of surveillance systems, we assessed the usefulness and acceptability of CBS. For acceptability, we calculated the proportion of trained volunteers who reported disease alerts. To assess the usefulness, we compared the alerts reported through the electronic diseases early warning system (eDEWS) with the alerts reported through CBS and described the response activities implemented. RESULTS: In Al-Mukalla City, 18% (14/78) of the volunteers reported at least one alert. In IDP camps, 58% (18/31) of volunteers reported at least one alert. In Al-Mukalla City, CBS detected 49 alerts of influenza-like illness, whereas health facilities detected 561 cases of COVID-19. In IDP camps, CBS detected 91 alerts of influenza-like illness, compared to 10 alerts detected through eDEWS. In IDP camps, CBS detected three other syndromes besides influenza-like illness (febrile illness outbreak suspicion, acute diarrhoea, and skin disease). In IDP camps, public health actions were implemented for each disease detected and no further cases were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In Yemen, CBS was useful for detecting suspected outbreaks in IDP camps. CBS implementation did not yield expected results in general communities in urban areas in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic when little was known about the disease. In the urban setting, the system failed to detect suspected COVID-19 cases and other diseases despite the ongoing outbreaks reported through eDEWS. In Yemen, as in other countries, feasibility and acceptability studies should be conducted few months before CBS expansion in urban communities. The project should be expanded in IDP camps, by creating COVID-19 and other disease outbreak reporting sites.

660899,Gender Differences in State Anxiety Related to Daily Function Among Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Questionnaire Study,2021-06-03,"(1) Background: Due to the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, rehabilitation centres have become less available for neurological patients. This is the result of efforts to physically distance society, to try to slow the spread of the pathogen. Health care facilities were mainly restricted to urgent cases, while most physiotherapy treatments, mainly for patients with chronic conditions, were suspended. Some countries have seen a reduction in acute stroke hospital admissions of from 50% to 80%. One solution to the above problem is the use of telerehabilitation in the home environment as an alternative to inpatient rehabilitation. (2) Aim of the study: The purpose of this review is to analyse the benefits and limitations of teletherapy in relation to the functional condition of post-stroke patients. (3) Methods: Selected publications from 2019 to 2021 on the telerehabilitation of stroke patients were reviewed. The review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. (4) Results: Studies have proven that teletherapy significantly improves the functional condition of post-stroke patients, resulting in improved quality of life and faster return to independence (while maintaining maximum possible precautions related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic). (5) Conclusions: Analysis of the study results showed comparable effectiveness of rehabilitation in the tele system to inpatient therapy. However, it should be emphasised that patients undergoing telerehabilitation must meet strict conditions to be eligible for this type of treatment program. However, the strength of the evidence itself supporting the effectiveness of this method ranks low due to the limited number of randomised control trials (RCT), small number of participants, and heterogeneous trials.","Ostrowska, Paulina Magdalena; Śliwiński, Maciej; Studnicki, Rafał; Hansdorfer-Korzon, Rita",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072939/,361

Their quality of life has been declared a national priority by the US government. OBJECTIVE: Assess effects of an eHealth intervention for older adults on quality of life, independence, and related outcomes. DESIGN: Multi-site, 2-arm (1:1), non-blinded randomized clinical trial. Recruitment November 2013 to May 2015; data collection through November 2016. SETTING: Three Wisconsin communities (urban, suburban, and rural). PARTICIPANTS: Purposive community-based sample, 390 adults age ≥65 with health challenges. Exclusions: long-term care, inability to get out of bed/chair unassisted. INTERVENTION: Access (vs. no access) to interactive website (ElderTree) designed to improve quality of life, social connection, and independence. MEASURES: Primary outcome: quality of life (PROMIS Global Health). Secondary: independence (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living); social support (MOS Social Support); depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8); falls prevention (Falls Behavioral Scale). Moderation: healthcare use (Medical Services Utilization). Both groups completed all measures at baseline, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Three hundred ten participants (79%) completed the 12-month survey. There were no main effects of ElderTree over time. Moderation analyses indicated that among participants with high primary care use, ElderTree (vs. control) led to better trajectories for mental quality of life (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.10–0.54, P=0.005), social support received (OR=0.17, 95% CI 0.05–0.29, P=0.007), social support provided (OR=0.29, 95% CI 0.13–0.45, P<0.001), and depression (OR= −0.20, 95% CI −0.39 to −0.01, P=0.034). Supplemental analyses suggested ElderTree may be more effective among people with multiple (vs. 0 or 1) chronic conditions. LIMITATIONS: Once randomized, participants were not blind to the condition; self-reports may be subject to memory bias.

662519,"Interprofessional perceptions of emotional, social, and ethical effects of multidrug-resistant organisms: A qualitative study",2021-02-22,"COVID-19 vaccination remains the most effective means to achieve control of the pandemic. In the United States, COVID-19 cases and deaths have markedly declined since their peak in early January 2021, due in part to increased vaccination coverage (1). However, during June 19-July 23, 2021, COVID-19 cases increased approximately 300% nationally, followed by increases in hospitalizations and deaths, driven by the highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant* of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Available data indicate that the vaccines authorized in the United States (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) offer high levels of protection against severe illness and death from infection with the Delta variant and other currently circulating variants of the virus (2). Despite widespread availability, vaccine uptake has slowed nationally with wide variation in coverage by state (range = 33.9%-67.2%) and by county (range = 8.8%-89.0%).† Unvaccinated persons, as well as persons with certain immunocompromising conditions (3), remain at substantial risk for infection, severe illness, and death, especially in areas where the level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission is high. The Delta variant is more than two times as transmissible as the original strains circulating at the start of the pandemic and is causing large, rapid increases in infections, which could compromise the capacity of some local and regional health care systems to provide medical care for the communities they serve. Until vaccination coverage is high and community transmission is low, public health practitioners, as well as schools, businesses, and institutions (organizations) need to regularly assess the need for prevention strategies to avoid stressing health care capacity and imperiling adequate care for both COVID-19 and other non-COVID-19 conditions. CDC recommends five critical factors be considered to inform local decision-making: 1) level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission; 2) health system capacity; 3) COVID-19 vaccination coverage; 4) capacity for early detection of increases in COVID-19 cases; and 5) populations at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. Among strategies to prevent COVID-19, CDC recommends all unvaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings. Based on emerging evidence on the Delta variant (2), CDC also recommends that fully vaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. Fully vaccinated persons might consider wearing a mask in public indoor settings, regardless of transmission level, if they or someone in their household is immunocompromised or is at increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their household is unvaccinated (including children aged <12 years who are currently ineligible for vaccination).","Christie, Athalia; Brooks, John T.; Hicks, Lauri A.; Sauber-Schatz, Erin K.; Yoder, Jonathan S.; Honein, Margaret A.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7030e2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324480/,361
662906,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Implementation of High-Performance Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation on Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Outcomes,2021-05-13,"Background: The 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) has turned into a global pandemic with unprecedented challenges for the global community. Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020. Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current ""true"" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing. Findings: The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K). Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.","Ghaffarzadegan, Navid; Rahmandad, Hazhir",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040956,361

A longitudinal study of Norwegian older adults’ psychosocial well-being before and during early and later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-08-25,"Plausible representatives of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in pigs have been characterized as being CD4(hi)CD172(lo). Due to their paucity in blood, we utilized novel fluorescent-activated cell sorting procedures to isolate them from PBMC. The resultant subset was greater than 98% homogeneous in regards to the selected phenotype and contained the preponderance of individuals secreting IFN-α after exposure to a known stimulant, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In addition to being a potent source of IFN-α, other properties of these porcine CD4(hi)CD172(lo) cells including their morphological transition from a plasma cell-like shape during quiescence to one resembling a dendritic cell (DC) after activation by TGEV and their relatively strong constitutive expression of interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) conformed to the expectations of genuine pDCs. While a substantial IFN-α response was also elicited from the porcine pDCs by pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV), and TLR7 and 9 agonists, there was an agent-dependent induction of varying amounts of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Notably, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) failed to provoke the pDCs to secrete any of the measured cytokines except IL-2. Moreover, whereas pDCs exposed to TGEV or the TLR9 agonist rapidly increased IRF-7 production and morphed into DCs with enhanced CD80/86 expression, similar alterations were not observed during incubation with PRRSV. This atypical response of pDCs to PRRSV may contribute to its pathogenesis, which unlike that associated with PrV, SIV or TGEV includes persistent infection and limited development of protective immunity.","Calzada-Nova, Gabriela; Schnitzlein, William; Husmann, Robert; Zuckermann, Federico A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242709003523; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242709003523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19939462/,361

METHODS: A mixed-method study was conducted consisting of semi-structured interviews, a focus group and a survey. Various stakeholders were involved including (representatives of) workers with chronic health conditions, insurance physicians, occupational physicians, other healthcare professionals, researchers, employers, and policymakers. The semi-structured interviews were performed to identify implementation determinants, followed by a focus group to validate resulting determinants. To conclude, a survey was conducted to select the most important implementation determinants through prioritization by ranking the order of importance. The Tailored Implementation of Chronic Diseases checklist (TICD) was used as concept-driven coding frame for the qualitative analysis of the interviews and focus group. The self-developed survey was based on the domains of the TICD. The survey was analyzed by frequency count of first ranking of determinants per and between domains of the TICD. RESULTS: Various stakeholders participated (N = 27) in the interviews and focus group. The qualitative data retrieved yielded a list of determinants with additional in-depth themes according to the TICD. For the selection of the most important determinants, a survey with 101 respondents was conducted, consisting of occupational physicians, insurance physicians and workers with a chronic health condition. From the seven domains of the TICD, respondents emphasized the importance of taking into account the needs and factors associated with workers with a chronic health condition as this determinant ranked highest. Taking into account the individual needs and wishes of workers was mentioned to enable successful implementation, whereas stress of the workers was indicated to impede implementation. Other important determinants included ‘being able to work with the tools’ in terms of time and usability or ‘cognitions, beliefs and attitudes of occupational and insurance physicians’ to be able to use the tools. CONCLUSION: This study identified the most important determinants from the perspective of various stakeholders involved in the implementation of client-centered tools in occupational health for workers with chronic health conditions. Furthermore, by prioritizing the most important determinants, targeted implementation strategies can be developed.

664568,Improvement in Eating Disorder Risk and Psychological Health in People with Class 3 Obesity: Effects of a Multidisciplinary Weight Management Program,2021-04-23,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the general population, the risk of severe COVID-19 is associated with old age, male sex, hypertension, obesity and chronic diseases. Chronic lung diseases are listed as additional risk factors for hospitalization and ICU admission. The purpose of this review is to define whether chronic lung diseases, such as bronchiectasis and interstitial diseases, represent a risk for a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients affected by common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most common symptomatic primary antibody defect. RECENT FINDINGS: CVID patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic with a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. The meta-analysis of 88 CVID cases described in large cohorts and case reports demonstrated that CVID patients with chronic lung involvement have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 in comparison to CVID without lung diseases (50 vs. 28%, relative risk 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.04--2.92, Pâ=â0.043). Differently from the general population, age and metabolic comorbidities did not represent a risk factor for severe course in this patient's population. SUMMARY: Underlying chronic lung diseases but not age represent a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in CVID. Prompt therapeutic intervention should be adopted in SARS-CoV-2 positive CVID patients with chronic lung diseases independently of their age.","Milito, Cinzia; Soccodato, Valentina; Auria, Stefania; Pulvirenti, Federica; Quinti, Isabella",Curr. opin. allergy clin. immunol,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0000000000000789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580250/,361

Camels are mostly bred in East African countries then exported into Africa and Middle East for consumption. To understand the distribution of MERS-CoV among camels in North Africa and the Middle East, we conducted surveillance in Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. We also performed longitudinal studies of three camel herds in Egypt and Jordan to elucidate MERS-CoV infection and transmission. Between 2016 and 2018, a total of 4027 nasal swabs and 3267 serum samples were collected from all countries. Real- time PCR revealed that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples from Egypt, Senegal, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. Microneutralization assay showed that antibodies were detected in all countries. Positive PCR samples were partially sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was built. The tree suggested that all sequences are of clade C and sequences from camels in Egypt formed a separate group from previously published sequences. Longitudinal studies showed high seroprevalence in adult camels. These results indicate the widespread distribution of the virus in camels. A systematic active surveillance and longitudinal studies for MERS-CoV are needed to understand the epidemiology of the disease and dynamics of viral infection.","Kandeil, Ahmed; Gomaa, Mokhtar; Nageh, Ahmed; Shehata, Mahmoud M.; Kayed, Ahmed E.; Sabir, Jamal S.

Data on their effectiveness to decrease antimicrobial use in children have been limited and varied. We aimed to assess the impact of the implementation of the FilmArray Meningitis Encephalitis Panel (MEP) on antimicrobial use and outcomes in children. In an observational retrospective study performed at Atlantic Health System (NJ), we sought to evaluate the duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment (days of therapy (DoT)) for patients <21 years of age hospitalized and evaluated for presumptive meningitis or encephalitis before and after the introduction of the MEP. A secondary analysis was performed to determine if recovery of a respiratory pathogen influenced DoT. The median duration of antibiotic therapy prior to the implementation of the MEP was 5 DoT (interquartile range (IQR): 3–6) versus 3 DoT (IQR: 1–5) (p < 0.001) when MEP was performed. The impact was greatest on intravenous third-generation cephalosporin and ampicillin use. We found a reduction in the number of inpatient days associated with the MEP. In the regression analysis, a positive respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) was not a significant predictor of DoT (p = 0.08). Furthermore, we found no significant difference between DoT among patients with negative and positive RPP (p = 0.12). Our study supports the implementation of rapid diagnostics to decrease the utilization of antibiotic therapy among pediatric patients admitted with concerns related to meningitis or encephalitis.","McDonald, Danielle; Gagliardo, Christina; Chiu, Stephanie; Di Pentima, M.

Recent evidence suggests that tetraspanins themselves may become crowded by virus particles and that these crowds/aggregates co-internalize with the viral particles. Using microscopy, we studied human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16-dependent aggregates on the cell surface of tetraspanin overexpressing keratinocytes. We find that aggregates are (1) rich in at least two different tetraspanins, (2) three-dimensional architectures extending up to several micrometers into the cell, and (3) decorated intracellularly by filamentous actin. Moreover, in cells not overexpressing tetraspanins, we note that obscurin-like protein 1 (OBSL1), which is thought to be a cytoskeletal adaptor, associates with filamentous actin. We speculate that HPV contact with the cell membrane could trigger the formation of a large tetraspanin web. This web may couple the virus contact site to the intracellular endocytic actin machinery, possibly involving the cytoskeletal adaptor protein OBSL1. Functionally, such a tetraspanin web could serve as a virus entry platform, which is co-internalized with the virus particle.

665746,Considerations for Providing Pediatric Gender-Affirmative Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-09-14,"Malignant gliomas remain a challenging cancer to treat due to limitations in both therapeutic and efficacious options. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) have emerged as a novel, locoregional, antineoplastic treatment modality with favorable efficacy and safety being demonstrated in the most aggressive type of malignant gliomas, glioblastoma (GBM). In 2 large randomized, controlled phase 3 trials, the addition of TTFields was associated with increased overall survival when combined with adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM) and comparable overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). TTFields target cancer cells by several mechanisms of action (MoA) including suppression of proliferation, migration and invasion, disruption of DNA repair and angiogenesis, antimitotic effects, and induction of apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. Having several MoAs makes TTFields an attractive modality to combine with standard, salvage, and novel treatment regimens (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy). Treatment within the field of malignant gliomas is evolving to emphasize combinatorial approaches that work synergistically to improve patient outcomes. Here, we review the current use of TTFields in GBM, discuss MOA and treatment delivery, and consider the potential for its wider adoption in other gliomas.","Ghiaseddin, Ashley P.; Shin, David; Melnick, Kaitlyn; Tran, David D.",Curr Treat Options Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11864-020-00773-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734509/,361

More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far. Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration. Conclusions: COVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, the severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.","Zhao, Wen; Yu, Shikai; Zha, Xiangyi; Wang, Ning; Pang, Qiumei; Li, Tongzeng; Li, Aixin",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035436,361

METHODS AND RESULTS: CAPACITY-COVID is an international patient registry established to determine the role of cardiovascular disease in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this registry, data generated during routine clinical practice are collected in a standardised manner for patients with a (highly suspected) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requiring hospitalisation. For the current analysis, consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 registered between 28 March and 3 July 2020 were included. Patients were followed for the occurrence of cardiac complications and pulmonary embolism from admission to discharge. In total, 3011 patients were included, of which 1890 (62.8%) were men. The median age was 67 years (interquartile range 56–76); 937 (31.0%) patients had a history of cardiac disease, with pre-existent coronary artery disease being most common (n=463, 15.4%). During hospitalisation, 595 (19.8%) patients died, including 16 patients (2.7%) with cardiac causes. Cardiac complications were diagnosed in 349 (11.6%) patients, with atrial fibrillation (n=142, 4.7%) being most common. The incidence of other cardiac complications was 1.8% for heart failure (n=55), 0.5% for acute coronary syndrome (n=15), 0.5% for ventricular arrhythmia (n=14), 0.1% for bacterial endocarditis (n=4) and myocarditis (n=3), respectively, and 0.03% for pericarditis (n=1). Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 198 (6.6%) patients. CONCLUSION: This large study among 3011 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 shows that the incidence of cardiac complications during hospital admission is low, despite a frequent history of cardiovascular disease. Long-term cardiac outcomes and the role of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 outcome warrants further investigation.","Linschoten, Marijke; Peters, Sanne; van Smeden, Maarten; Jewbali, Lucia S; Schaap, Jeroen; Siebelink, Hans-Marc; Smits, Peter C; Tieleman, Robert G; van der Harst, Pim; van Gilst, Wiek H; Asselbergs, Folkert W",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://doi.org/10.1177/2048872620974605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222494/,361

In the last decade, it has become increasingly evident that GBF1 can also regulate different steps of the replication cycle of RNA viruses belonging to different virus families. GBF1 has been shown not only to facilitate the intracellular traffic of different viral and cellular elements during infection, but also to modulate the replication of viral RNA, the formation and maturation of viral replication complexes, and the processing of viral proteins through mechanisms that do not depend on its canonical role in intracellular transport.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple societies issued caution statements because of the unknown effect of corticosteroids on the patient’s immune system. The purpose is to determine if image-guided corticosteroid injections administered during the COVID-19 lockdown phase were associated with a higher infection rate compared to the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, patients undergoing image-guided corticosteroid injections for pain management during the lockdown phase between April 15 and May 22, 2020, were enrolled. One month after the injection, patients were surveyed by telephone for any COVID-19-related symptoms, and the electronic medical record (EMR) was reviewed for symptoms and test results. RESULTS: Seventy-one subjects were recruited, 31 (44%) females, 40 (56%) males, ages 58 ± 17 (20–92) years. Follow-up was available in 66 (93%) of subjects, 60 (91%) by phone survey and EMR, 6 (9%) by EMR only, 45 ± 22 (19–83) days after injection.

A striking example is the recurrent outbreaks that have been occurring in seabirds on Amsterdam Island for the past 30 years, threatening populations of three Endangered seabird species and of the endemic, Critically Endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis. The bacteria Pasteurella multocida (avian cholera causative agent), and to a lesser extent Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (erysipelas causative agent), were both suspected to be responsible for these epidemics. Despite this critical situation, demographic trends were not available for these threatened populations, and the occurrence and characterization of potential causative agents of epizootics remain poorly known. The aims of the current study were to (i) provide an update of population trends for four threatened seabird species monitored on Amsterdam Island, (ii) assess the occurrence of P. multocida, and E. rhusiopathiae in live birds from five species, (iii) search for other infectious agents in these samples and, (iv) isolate and genotype the causative agent(s) of epizooties from dead birds. Our study shows that the demographic situation has worsened substantially in three seabird species during the past decade, with extremely low reproductive success and declining populations for Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses Thalassarche carteri, sooty albatrosses Phoebetria fusca, and northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi. Pasteurella multocida or E. rhusiopathiae were detected by PCR in live birds of all five investigated species, while results were negative for eight additional infectious agents. A single strain of P. multocida was repeatedly cultured from dead birds, while no E. rhusiopathiae could be isolated. These results highlight the significance of P. multocida in this particular eco-epidemiological system as the main agent responsible for epizootics.

Increasing evidence supports that immune infiltration in tumors is associated with prognosis. Therefore, we aim to assess infiltration in OV using multiple methods to capture genomic signatures regulating immune events to identify reliable predictions of different outcomes. A dataset of 309 ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma patients with overall survival >90 days from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed. Multiple estimations and clustering methods identified and verified two immune clusters with component differences. Functional analyses pointed out immune-related alterations underlying internal genomic variables potentially. After extracting immune genes from a public database, the LASSO Cox regression model with 10-fold cross-validation was used for selecting genes associated with overall survival rate significantly, and a risk score model was then constructed. Kaplan–Meier survival and Cox regression analyses among cohorts were performed systematically to evaluate prognostic efficiency among the risk score model and other clinical pathological parameters, establishing a predictive ability independently. Furthermore, this risk score model was compared among identified signatures in previous studies and applied to two external cohorts, showing better prediction performance and generalization ability, and also validated as robust in association with immune cell infiltration in bulk tissues. Besides, a transcription factor regulation network suggested upper regulatory mechanisms in OV. Our immune risk score model may provide gyneco-oncologists with predictive values for the prognosis and treatment management of patients with OV.","Zhao, Xibo; Cong, Shanshan; Guo, Qiuyan; Cheng, Yan; Liang, Tian; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Guangmei",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.653357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968933/,361

670986,Cognitive and mental health changes and their vulnerability factors related to COVID-19 lockdown in Italy,2021-01-27,"Identifying the causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis. Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10(4) DNA copies/mL were detected. Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF. Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.","Edridge, Arthur W.

The aim of this study was to identify latent variables underlying adherence to COVID‐19 guidelines and to examine demographic and psychological predictors of adherence. A sample of US adults (N = 1,200) were surveyed in late April to mid‐May 2020. The factor structure of adherence was examined using exploratory factor analysis. Machine learning regression models using elastic net regularization were used to examine predictors of adherence. Two factors characterized adherence: avoidance and cleaning. Elastic net models identified differential demographic and psychological predictors of these two forms of adherence. Religious affiliation, denial coping, full‐time employment, substance use coping, and being 60 or older predicted lower avoidance adherence. Behavioral and mindfulness emotion regulation skills, agreeableness, and Democrat political affiliation predicted greater avoidance adherence. For cleaning adherence, interpersonal and behavioral emotion regulation skills and conscientiousness emerged as strong predictors of greater cleaning. Efforts to promote compliance with COVID‐19 health guidelines may benefit from distinguishing avoidance and cleaning adherence and considering predictors of each of these aspects of adherence.","Bailey, Brooklynn; Whelen, Megan L.; Strunk, Daniel R.",Appl Psychol Health Well Being,https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032383/,361

In Study 1 (N = 564), participants completed explicit measures of psychopathic traits and of life history strategy. To attenuate common method biases, Study 2 (N = 267) employed an alternative measure of psychopathy and an indirect measure of life history strategy, namely, future-discounting. Across two studies, we found consistent and significant evidence that participants from Wuhan, the initial epicenter of the pandemic, evidenced a faster life history strategy and a markedly higher level of psychopathic traits than did participants from Chongqing, which was less affected by the virus. Furthermore, a consistent pattern of correlation between life history strategy and psychopathy was observed across different groups of participants. We also replicated some previously reported studies but found that not all sex effects were consistent with life history in Chinese populations. Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals may show a high degree of variation in life history speed and psychopathic traits in response to unpredictable and adverse environments, which provide support for extended life history plasticity.","Li, Heng; Cao, Yu",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679114/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01549-2,361

However, both techniques possess unique strengths and limitations, which define their ability to meet evolving requirements for faster, more affordable and more accurate clinical tests. In response, hybrid techniques, which combine the accessibility and ease-of-use of immunoassays with the sensitivity, high throughput and multiplexing capabilities of mass spectrometry are continually being explored. Developments in antibody conjugation methodology have expanded the role of these biomolecules to applications outside of conventional colorimetric assays and histology. Furthermore, the range of different mass spectrometry ionisation and analysis technologies has enabled its successful adaptation as a detection method for numerous clinically relevant immunological assays. Several recent examples of combined mass spectrometry-immunoassay techniques demonstrate the potential of these methods as improved diagnostic tests for several important human diseases. The present challenges are to continue technological advancements in mass spectrometry instrumentation and develop improved bioconjugation methods, which can overcome their existing limitations and demonstrate the clinical significance of these hybrid approaches.","Stevens, Katherine G.; Pukala, Tara L.",Trends Analyt Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2020.116064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046944/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993620302934?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165993620302934,361

671887,Impact of the coronavirus on providing oral health care in the Netherlands,2021-09-21,"BACKGROUND: The HIV pandemic impacts the lives of millions and despite the global coordinated response, innovative actions are still needed to end it. A major challenge is the added burden of coinfections such as viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and various sexually transmitted infections in terms of prevention, treatment and increased morbidity in individuals with HIV infection. A need for combination prevention strategies, tailored to high-risk key populations arises and technology-based interventions can be a valuable asset. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the delivery of existing services and added stress to existing public health and clinical structures but also highlighted the potential of exploiting technical solutions for interventions regarding infectious diseases. In this paper we report the design process, results and evaluation findings from the pilots of ‘RiskRadar’—a web and mobile application aiming to support combination prevention, testing and linkage to care for HIV, viral hepatitis, various sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis. METHODS: RiskRadar was developed for the INTEGRATE Joint Action’s aim to improve, adapt and pilot innovative digital tools for combination prevention. RiskRadar was designed iteratively using informed end-user-oriented approaches. Emphasis was placed on the Risk Calculator that enables users to assess their risk of exposure to one or more of the four disease areas, make informed decisions to seek testing or care and adjust their behaviours ultimately aiming to harm/risk reduction. RiskRadar has been piloted in three countries, namely Croatia, Italy and Lithuania. RESULTS: RiskRadar has been used 1347 times across all platforms so far. More than 90% of users have found RiskRadar useful and would use it again, especially the Risk Calculator component. Almost 49.25% are men and 29.85% are in the age group of 25–34. The application has scored 5.2/7 in the User Experience Questionnaire, where it is mainly described as “supportive” and “easy-to-use”. The qualitative evaluation of RiskRadar also yielded positive feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Pilot results demonstrate above average satisfaction with RiskRadar and high user-reported usability scores, supporting the idea that technical interventions could significantly support combination prevention actions on Sexually Transmitted Infections.","Kakalou, Christine; Polychronidou, Eleftheria; Drosou, Vicky; Dimitriadis, Vlasios K.; Dermaris, Thomas; Kordonias, Rafael; Papaprodromou, Aris; Tsirelis, Triantafillos; Maramis, Christos; Votis, Konstantinos; Tzovaras, Dimitrios; Savarino, Domenico; Maffeo, Manuel; Jasic, Nedim; Nemeth-Blažić, Tatjana; Dominković, Zoran; Pogledić, Dubravko; Jovovic, Iva; Simkunaite-Zazecke, Agne; Stoniene, Loreta; Sammut, Antonella; Cosmaro, Lella; Natsiavas, Pantelis",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06501-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34517826/,361

Methods: We present a multicenter case series from 9 centers in the United States of patients with acute neurological deficits consistent with AIS and COVID-19 who were treated with IV tPA. Results: We identified 13 patients (mean age 62 (±9.8) years, 9 (69.2%) male). All received IV tPA and 3 cases also underwent mechanical thrombectomy. All patients had systemic symptoms consistent with COVID-19 at the time of admission: fever (5 patients), cough (7 patients), and dyspnea (8 patients). The median admission NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score was 14.5 (range 3-26) and most patients (61.5%) improved at follow up (median NIHSS score 7.5, range 0-25). No systemic or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages were seen. Stroke mechanisms included cardioembolic (3 patients), large artery atherosclerosis (2 patients), small vessel disease (1 patient), embolic stroke of undetermined source (3 patients), and cryptogenic with incomplete investigation (1 patient). Three patients were determined to have transient ischemic attacks or aborted strokes. Two out of 12 (16.6%) patients had elevated fibrinogen levels on admission (mean 262.2 ± 87.5 mg/dl), and 7 out of 11 (63.6%) patients had an elevated D-dimer level (mean 4284.6 ±3368.9 ng/ml).

The simulations reveal the efficient blocking of ACE2 by caffeine and nicotine in the exposure to the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have selected the two most important active sites of ACE2-S protein, i.e., 6LZG and 6VW1, which are critically responsible in the interaction of S protein to the receptor and thus, we investigated their interaction with nicotine and caffeine through MD simulations. Caffeine and nicotine are interesting structures for interactions because of their similar structure to the candidate antiviral drugs. Our results reveal that caffeine or nicotine in a specific molar ratio to 6LZG shows a very strong interaction and indicate that caffeine is more efficient in the interaction with 6LZG and further blocking of this site against S protein binding. Further, we investigated the interaction of ACE2 receptor- S protein with nicotine or caffeine when mixed with candidate or approved antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Our MD simulations suggest that the combination of caffeine with ribavirin shows a stronger interaction with 6VW1, while in case of favipiravir+nicotine, 6LZG shows potent efficacy of these interaction, proposing the potent efficacy of these combinations for blocking ACE2 receptor against SARS-CoV-2.","Mohammadi, Saeedeh; Heidarizadeh, Mohammad; Entesari, Mehrnaz; Esmailpour, Ayoub; Esmailpour, Mohammad; Moradi, Rasoul; Sakhaee, Nader; Doustkhah, Esmail",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080900/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8101600,361

However, no comprehensive data have been reported on pre-existing neurological comorbidities and COVID-19. This study aims at evaluating the prevalence of neurological comorbidities, and their association with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We evaluated all consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) of our hospital between the 3rd March and the 14th April 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Data on neurological and non-neurological diseases were extracted, as well as data on demographic characteristics and on severity degree of COVID-19. The prevalence of neurological comorbidities was calculated, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between neurological diseases and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 344 patients. Neurological comorbidities accounted for 22.4% of cases, with cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment being the most frequent. Neurological comorbidity resulted independently associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 2.305; p = 0.012), as well as male gender (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.001), neoplastic diseases (p = 0.039), and arterial hypertension (p = 0.045). When neurological comorbidity was associated with non-neurological comorbidities, the OR for severe COVID-19 rose to 7.394 (p = 0.005). Neurological patients, in particular cerebrovascular and cognitively impaired ones, received more respiratory support indication.

There remains a need to improve wastewater RNA extraction methods’ sensitivity, speed, and reduce reliance on often expensive commercial reagents to make wastewater-based epidemiology more accessible. We present a kit-free wastewater RNA extraction method, titled “Sewage, Salt, Silica and SARS-CoV-2” (4S), that employs the abundant and affordable reagents sodium chloride (NaCl), ethanol and silica RNA capture matrices to recover 6-fold more SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater than an existing ultrafiltration-based method. The 4S method concurrently recovered pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human 18S ribosomal subunit rRNA, both suitable as fecal concentration controls. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in three sewersheds corresponded to the relative prevalence of COVID-19 infection determined via clinical testing. Lastly, controlled experiments indicate that the 4S method prevented RNA degradation during storage of wastewater samples, was compatible with heat pasteurization, and could be performed in approximately 3 hours. Overall, the 4S method is promising for effective, economical, and accessible wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2, providing another tool to fight the global pandemic.","Whitney, Oscar N.; Kennedy, Lauren C.; Fan, Vinson; Hinkle, Adrian; Kantor, Rose; Greenwald, Hannah; Crits-Christoph, Alexander; Al-Shayeb, Basem; Chaplin, Mira; Maurer, Anna C.; Tjian, Robert; Nelson, Kara L.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.20242131; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20242131v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33300015/,361
676592,Influence of sleep difficulty on post-traumatic stress symptoms among frontline medical staff during COVID-19 pandemic in China,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new disease which has spread rapidly and widely. We wished to know whether evaluation of in vitro cytokine production could contribute to improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and to better patient management. Numbers of unstimulated and mitogen-stimulated cytokine-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured repeatedly during and after hospitalization in 13 patients with SARS using enzyme-linked immunospot technology. Numbers of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12 secreting cells induced by T cell activators were below normal in many or most patients before and during treatment with corticosteroids and ribavirin but returned essentially to normal after completion of treatment. Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC)-stimulated IL-10 secreting cells were increased in early SARS but fell during treatment. SAC-induced IL-12 secreting cells were deficient before, during and long after treatment. Numbers of cells induced to produce IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha by T cell or monocyte activators were higher than normal in many early SARS patients and were still increased in some during and after treatment. We conclude that prolonged dysregulated cytokine production occurs in SARS and that future studies should be directed at improving anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapies in order to limit cytokine impairment.","JONES, B M; MA, E S K; PEIRIS, J S M; WONG, P C; HO, J C M; LAM, B; LAI, K N; TSANG, K W T",Clinical and Experimental Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15008980/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2003.02391.x,361

In rare cases of COVID 19 patients without these factors the outcome is better but the literature is scarce on the topic. The aim of this work is to look at the prevalence of outcomes in these patients with only hyperlipidemia and in cases in which only one risk factor is associated. Methods: From January to December 2020, 758 COVID 19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit at a hospital in Sao Paulo and 315 had indication of hemodyalisis. COVID 19 patients were classified as to Dyslipidemia, Hypertension and Diabetes and sequentially reclassified as Hyperlipidemia (DLP) alone, DLP plus Hypertension and DLP plus Diabetes. Results: As of October the outcome of these patients were discharged was in May 2020 and December, respectively, for DLP of 2 and 20%;DLP plus Diabetes of 15 and 7%;DLP and Hypertension of 15 and 7% was 3.7% and in December the second wave brought it up to 8.3%. Association with Hypertension was in 230 cases. Diabetes coincided with lipid abnormalities in 169 cases. Outcome was better when only one factor coincided with only one more risk factor. Conclusions: COVID 19 patients in ICU have better outcomes when submitted to Hemodialysis if the number of patients with only Diabetes or Hypertension be present risk factors associated to lipid disorders are less.","Martinez, T.L.R.; Saldanha, A.L.R.; Margeotto, A.P.P.; Gasparoto, A.

677125,To what extent is telehealth reported to be incorporated into undergraduate and postgraduate allied health curricula: A scoping review,2021-08-19,"BACKGROUND: One in five patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) develop comorbid depression or anxiety. Depression is associated with risk of non-adherence to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and dropout, inadequate risk factor management, poor quality of life (QoL), increased healthcare costs and premature death. In 2020, IHD and depression are expected to be among the top contributors to the disease-burden worldwide. Hence, it is paramount to treat both the underlying somatic disease as well as depression and anxiety. eMindYourHeart will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a therapist-assisted eHealth intervention targeting depression and anxiety in patients with IHD, which may help fill this gap in clinical care. METHODS: eMindYourHeart is a multi-center, two-armed, unblinded randomised controlled trial that will compare a therapist-assisted eHealth intervention to treatment as usual in 188 CR patients with IHD and comorbid depression or anxiety. The primary outcome of the trial is symptoms of depression, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months include symptoms of depression and anxiety (HADS), perceived stress, health complaints, QoL (HeartQoL), trial dropout (number of patients dropped out in either arm at 3 months) and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first trial to evaluate both the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a therapist-assisted eHealth intervention in patients with IHD and comorbid psychological distress as part of CR. Integrating screening for and treatment of depression and anxiety into standard CR may decrease dropout and facilitate better risk factor management, as it is presented as “one package” to patients, and they can access the eMindYourHeart program in their own time and at their own convenience. The trial holds a strong potential for improving the quality of care for an increasing population of patients with IHD and comorbid depression, anxiety or both, with likely benefits to patients, families, and society at large due to potential reductions in direct and indirect costs, if proven successful.

METHODS: From March 1 to 31, 2020, 916 caregivers of older adults participated in an online cross-sectional survey on the prevalence of anxiety, depression and sleep problems. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was administered to measure anxiety symptoms, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was used to assess depressive symptoms, and a self-developed questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality and duration. Six questions about COVID-19-related experiences were used to assess community-level infection contact and the level of exposure to media information. The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression and sleep problems were computed. The Wald chi-square tests were applied to compare the differences between subgroups. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with anxiety, depression, sleep problems and multimorbidity. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems were 46.8%, 29.8% and 10.8%, respectively. Approximately 263 participants (28.7%) presented with 2 or more mental health problems. Being female (OR, 2.254; 95% CI, 1.510-3.363), having community-level COVID-19 contact (OR, 1.856; 95% CI, 1.189-2.898), and having a mental disorder (OR, 3.610; 95% CI, 1.644-7.930) were associated with increased risk of multimorbidity among caregivers. Caregivers who preferred positive information (OR, 0.652; 95% CI, 0.472-0.899) had reduced risk of multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression were common among caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 epidemic. Being female and having community-level COVID-19 contact were independent risk factors for experiencing multiple mental health problems. Preexisting mental disorders increased the risk of multimorbidity among caregivers, while enhanced access to positive media information decreased the risk of multimorbidity.","Li, Qiuxuan; Zhang, Haifeng; Zhang, Ming; Li, Tao; Ma, Wanxin; An, Cuixia; Chen, Yanmei; Liu, Sha; Kuang, Weihong; Yu, Xin; Wang, Huali",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509676/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1064748121000178; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748121000178?v=s5,361

Nevertheless, full virion maturation was blocked. Studies of the rTGEV-ΔE subcellular localization by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy in infected E(−) cells showed that in the absence of E protein virus trafficking was arrested in the intermediate compartment. Therefore, the absence of E protein in TGEV resulted in two actions, a blockade of virus trafficking in the membranes of the secretory pathway, and prevention of full virus maturation.","Ortego, Javier; Ceriani, Juan E.; Patiño, Cristina; Plana, Juan; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207003698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17692883/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207003698,361

It then penetrates a subcellular membrane, reaching a destination that supports transcription, translation, and replication of the viral genome. These steps lead to assembly and morphogenesis of the new viral progeny. The mature virus finally exits the host cell to begin the next infection cycle. Strikingly, viruses hijack host molecular chaperones to accomplish these distinct entry steps. Here we highlight how DNA viruses, including polyomavirus and the human papillomavirus, exploit soluble and membrane-associated chaperones to enter a cell, penetrating and escaping an intracellular membrane en route for infection. We also describe the mechanism by which RNA viruses—including flavivirus and coronavirus—co-opt cytosolic and organelle-selective chaperones to promote viral endocytosis, protein biosynthesis, replication, and assembly. These examples underscore the importance of host chaperones during virus infection, potentially revealing novel antiviral strategies to combat virus-induced diseases.","Speckhart, Kaitlyn; Williams, Jeffrey M.; Tsai, Billy",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13060958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064125/,361

This study proposes a novel measure for the probable pathogenic virus transmission risk of a high-rise drainage stack with the occurrence of positive air pressure. The proposed approach is based on time-variant positive air pressures measured in a 38 m high drainage stack of a full-scale experimental tower under steady flow conditions of flow rate 1–4 Ls(−1) discharging at a height between 15 m to 33 m above the stack base. The maximum pressure and probabilistic positive air pressures in the discharging stack ventilation section with no water (Zone A of the discharging drainage stack) were determined. It was demonstrated that the positive air pressures were lower in frequency as compared with those in other stack zones and could propagate along the upper 1/3 portion of the ventilation pipe (H’ ≥ 0.63) towards the ventilation opening at the rooftop. As the probabilistic positive pressures at a stack height were found to be related to the water discharging height and flow rate, a risk model of positive air pressure is proposed. Taking the 119th, 124th, 140th and 11,547th COVID-19 cases of an epidemiological investigation in Hong Kong as a baseline of concern, excessive risk of system overuse was evaluated.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study from late January to mid-February at the MedStar Health Hospitals in Baltimore, Maryland. Eligible HCWs completed the questionnaires anonymously. The primary outcomes were attitudes of HCWs towards vaccination and the impact on HCWs’ comfort and anxiety in caring for patients, sleep, mood, attendance of social gatherings, and utilization of health clubs, before and after vaccination. RESULT: A total of 300 respondents completed the questionnaires. The mean age was 37.2 years with 37.7% physicians and 45.7% registered nurses. Of the respondents only, 15.7% refused vaccination. The most common reason for refusal was concerns for long-term adverse effects, cited by 59.5%.

The aim of the project was to determine the feasibility of utilizing a combined synchronous and asynchronous self-administered smartphone application to characterize PD symptoms. METHODS: A synchronous video virtual visit was completed for the administration of virtual Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (vMDS-UPDRS III). Participants asynchronously completed a mobile application consisting of a measure of upper extremity bradykinesia (Finger Tapping Test) and information processing. RESULTS: Twenty-three individuals completed the assessments. The mean vMDS-UPDRS III was 23.65 ± 8.56 points. On average, the number of taps was significantly greater for the less affected limb, 97.96 ± 17.77 taps, compared to the more affected, 89.33 ± 18.66 taps (p = 0.025) with a significantly greater number of freezing episodes for the more affected limb (p < 0.05). Correlation analyses indicated the number of errors and the number of freezing episodes were significantly related to clinical ratings of vMDS-UPDRS III bradykinesia (Rho = 0.44, p < 0.01; R = 0.43, p < 0.01, resp.) and finger tapping performance (Rho = 0.31, p = 0.03; Rho = 0.32, p = 0.03, resp.).

683723,Fear and anxiety about COVID‐19 among local and overseas Chinese university students,2021-04-06,"Laboratory testing is an important component in the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections such as with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, specimen collection not only risks exposure of health care workers and other patients to infection, but also necessitates use of personal protective equipment that may be in short supply during periods of heightened disease activity. Self-collection of nasal or oropharyngeal swabs offers an alternative to address these drawbacks. Although studies in the past decade have demonstrated the utility of this approach for respiratory infections, it has not been widely adopted in routine clinical practice. The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has focused attention on the need for safe, convenient, timely, and scalable methods for collecting upper respiratory specimens for testing. The goals of this article are to highlight the literature regarding self-collected nasal or oropharyngeal specimens for respiratory pathogen testing; discuss the role of self-collection in helping prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease from infected patients and facilitating a shift toward “virtual” medicine or telemedicine; and describe the current and future state of self-collection for infectious agents, and the impacts these approaches can have on population health management and disease diagnosis and prevention.","Cockerill, Franklin R.; Wohlgemuth, Jay G.; Radcliff, Jeff; Sabol, Christine E.; Kapoor, Hema; Dlott, Jeffrey S.; Marlowe, Elizabeth M.; Clarke, Nigel J.",Popul Health Manag,https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544647/,361
684022,The COVID-19 Pandemic Highlights Shortcomings in US Health Care Informatics Infrastructure: A Call to Action,2020-05-12,"Monitoring exhaled breath is a safe, noninvasive method for determining the health status of the human body. Most of the components in our exhaled breath can act as health biomarkers, and they help in providing information about various diseases. Nitric oxide (NO) is one such important biomarker in exhaled breath that indicates oxidative stress in our body. This work presents a simple and noninvasive quantitative analysis approach for detecting NO from exhaled breath. The sensing is based on the colorimetric assisted detection of NO by m-Cresol Purple, Bromophenol Blue, and Alizaringelb dye. The sensing performance of the dye was analyzed by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy. The study covers various sampling conditions like the pH effect, temperature effect, concentration effect, and selective nature of the dye. The m-Cresol Purple dye exhibited a high sensitivity towards NO with a detection limit of ~0.082 ppm in the linear range of 0.002–0.5 ppm. Moreover, the dye apprehended a high degree of selectivity towards other biocompounds present in the breath, and no possible interfering cross-reaction from these species was observed. The dye offered a high sensitivity, selectivity, fast response, and stability, which benchmark its potential for NO sensing. Further, m-Cresol Purple dye is suitable for NO sensing from the exhaled breath and can assist in quantifying oxidative stress levels in the body for the possible detection of COVID-19.","Maurya, Muni Raj; Onthath, Haseena; Morsy, Hagar; Riyaz, Najam-US-Sahar; Ibrahim, Muna; Ahmed, Alaa Elsafi; Abuznad, Raghad; Alruwaili, Aeshah; Alsaedi, Fatimatulzahraa; Kasak, Peter; Sadasivuni, Kishor Kumar",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442192/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9081055,361
684367,Telepsychiatry During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development of a Protocol for Telemental Health Care,2020-09-23,"The genome of Eptesipoxvirus (EPTV) is the first poxvirus genome isolated from a microbat. The 176,688 nt sequence, which is believed to encompass the complete coding region of the virus, is 67% A+T and is predicted to encode 191 genes. 11 of these genes have no counterpart in GenBank and are therefore unique to EPTV. The presence of a distantly related ortholog of Vaccinia virus F5L in EPTV uncovered a link with fragmented F5L orthologs in Molluscum contagiosum virus/squirrelpox and clade II viruses. Consistent with the unique position of EPTV approximately mid-point between the orthopoxviruses and the clade II viruses, EPTV has 11 genes that are specific to the orthopoxviruses and 13 genes that are typical, if not exclusive, to the clade II poxviruses. This mosaic nature of EPTV blurs the distinction between the old description of the orthopoxvirus and clade II groups. Genome annotation and characterization failed to find any common virulence genes shared with the other poxvirus isolated from bat (pteropoxvirus); however, EPTV encodes 3 genes that may have been transferred to or from deerpox and squirrelpox viruses; 2 of these, a putative endothelin-like protein and a MHC class I-like protein are likely to have immunomodulatory roles.

684645,Equity in telemedicine for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-23,"INTRODUCTION: The global abrupt progression of the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt critical life-saving services such as routine immunization (RI), thus increasing the susceptibility of countries to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Being endemic to several infectious diseases, Lebanon might be at increased risk of outbreaks as the utilization of RI services might have deteriorated due to the pandemic and the country’s political unrest following the October 2019 uprising. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in the utilization of RI services in both the public and private sectors following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was completed electronically, in April 2020, by 345 private pediatricians who are registered in professional associations of physicians in Lebanon and provide immunization services at their clinics. Means of the reported percentages of decrease in the utilization of vaccination services by pediatricians were calculated. As for the public sector, an examination of the monthly differences in the number of administered vaccine doses in addition to their respective percentages of change was performed. Adjustment for the distribution of RI services between the sectors was performed to calculate the national decrease rate. RESULTS: The utilization of vaccination services at the national level decreased by 31%. In the private sector, immunization services provision diminished by 46.9% mainly between February and April 2020. The highest decrease rates were observed for oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and hepatitis A, followed by measles and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. The number of vaccine doses administered in the public sector decreased by 20%. The most prominent reductions were detected for the OPV and measles vaccines, and during October 2019 and March 2020. CONCLUSION: The substantial decrease in the utilization of RI as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic requires public health interventions to prevent future outbreaks of VPDs.","Mansour, Ziad; Arab, Jinan; Said, Racha; Rady, Alissar; Hamadeh, Randa; Gerbaka, Bernard; Bizri, Abdul Rahman",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596271/,361

In the first a husband, wife, and 4 children had Crohn's disease; in the second 7 of 11 children had the disease. There was no history of Crohn's disease in antecedent generations and no linkage to HLA haplotypes. Methods: Methods included family interviews; review of medical records, radiographs, and pathology slides; serology; selective stool culture; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for fecal viral detection; and immunocytochemistry. Results: In both families multiple cases occurred among siblings in 7–13-month periods. There appeared to be a 4–8-year recurrence of new disease in both families. Radiographs showed a remarkable similarity in the pattern of disease, confined to distal ileum and cecum, in the members of family 1. Examination for pathology showed granulomas in all 8 patients for whom tissues were available. Acid-fast organisms or Campylobacter-like organisms were not found in tissue sections, and immunocytochemistry was negative for mycobacteria and Yersinia. Stool cultures were negative for mycobacteria, Yersinia, and Mycoplasma. Torovirus and coronavirus antigens were not found in stool. Serology was negative for antibodies to Brucella, Yersinia, influenza, and three enteropathogenic viruses of animals.

Using comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during active infection. Integration of this data with ChIRP-MS data from three other RNA viruses defined viral specificity of RNA-host protein interactions. Targeted CRISPR screens revealed that the majority of functional RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and comparative CRISPR screens across seven RNA viruses revealed shared and SARS-specific antiviral factors. Finally, by combining the RNA-centric approach and functional CRISPR screens, we demonstrated a physical and functional connection between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondria, highlighting this organelle as a general platform for antiviral activity. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive catalog of functional SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform studies to understand the host-virus interface and nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.","Flynn, Ryan A.; Belk, Julia A.; Qi, Yanyan; Yasumoto, Yuki; Wei, Jin; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Shi, Quanming; Mumbach, Maxwell R.; Limaye, Aditi; DeWeirdt, Peter C.; Schmitz, Cameron O.; Parker, Kevin R.; Woo, Elizabeth; Chang, Howard Y.; Horvath, Tamas L.; Carette, Jan E.; Bertozzi, Carolyn R.; Wilen, Craig B.; Satpathy, Ansuman T.",Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743211/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742100297X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009286742100297X,361

686244,Characteristics of Misinformation Spreading on Social Media During the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: A Descriptive Analysis,2021-05-10,"As one of the most vulnerable sectors exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, transport sectors have been severely affected. However, the shocks and impact mechanisms of infectious diseases on transport sectors are not fully understood. This paper employs a multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model of China, CHINAGEM, with highly disaggregated transport sectors to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on China’s transport sectors and reveal the impact mechanisms of the pandemic shocks with the decomposition analysis approach. This study suggests that, first, multiple shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic to transport sectors are specified, including the supply-side shocks that raised the protective cost and reduced the production efficiency of transport sectors, and the demand-side shocks that reduced the demand of households and production sectors for transportation. Second, the outputs of all transport sectors in China have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and passenger transport sectors have larger output decreases than freight transport sectors. While the outputs of freight transport sectors are expected to decline by 1.03–2.85%, the outputs of passenger transport sectors would decline by 3.08–11.44%. Third, with the decomposition analysis, the impacts of various exogenous shocks are quite different, while the changes in the output of different transport sectors are dominated by different exogenous shocks. Lastly, while the supply-side shocks of the pandemic would drive output decline in railway, waterway, and aviation transport sectors, the demand-side shocks would drive so in the road, pipeline, and other transport sectors. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has negative impacts on the output of most non-transport sectors and the macro-economy in China. Three policy implications are recommended to mitigate the damages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to the transport sectors.","Cui, Qi; He, Ling; Liu, Yu; Zheng, Yanting; Wei, Wei; Yang, Bo; Zhou, Meifang",Transp Policy (Oxf),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21000238?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551584/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967070X21000238; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.01.017,361

Notre objectif était d’évaluer l’ampleur du retard pour ce type d’interventions en Ontario, au Canada, ainsi que le temps et les ressources nécessaires pour y remédier. MÉTHODES: Nous avons consulté 6 bases de données administratives décrivant la population ontarienne et canadienne pour dégager la distribution du volume chirurgical et de la cadence des salles d’opération pour chaque type d’interventions et chaque région, et connaître la durée d’occupation d’un lit d’hôpital et d’un lit de soins intensifs. Les données utilisées concernent l’ensemble ou une partie de la période du 1(er) janvier 2017 au 13 juin 2020. Nous avons estimé l’ampleur du retard accumulé et prédit le temps nécessaire pour le reprendre dans un scénario avec capacité d’appoint de + 10 % (ajout d’un jour à 50 % de la capacité par semaine) à l’aide de modèles de séries chronologiques, de modèles de files d’attente et d’une analyse de sensibilité probabiliste.

Understanding these associations is important to clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational study between March 10–May 30, 2020 at a large quaternary academic medical center in New York City. Patient characteristics, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were abstracted from the electronic medical records. Of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 during this time (N=16,384), there were 5,467 patients with positive tests, of which 4,254 had available Ct values and were included in further analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to test associations between Ct values, duration of symptoms prior to testing, patient characteristics and mortality. The primary outcome is defined as death or discharge to hospice. RESULTS: Lower Ct values at diagnosis (i.e. higher viral load) were associated with significantly higher mortality among both in- and out-patients. Interestingly, patients with a shorter time since the onset of symptoms to testing had a worse prognosis, with those presenting less than three days from symptom onset having 2-fold increased odds of death. After adjusting for time since symptom onset and other clinical covariates, Ct values remained a strong predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct value and duration of symptoms are strongly associated with mortality. These two factors add useful information for clinicians to risk stratify patients presenting with COVID-19.","Miller, Emily Happy; Zucker, Jason; Castor, Delivette; Annavajhala, Medini K; Sepulveda, Jorge L; Green, Daniel A; Whittier, Susan; Scherer, Matthew; Medrano, Nicola; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Yin, Michael T; Kuhn, Louise; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604401/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab003,361

Operational partners recognized the national gap and rapidly scaled-up an IPC training and infrastructure package. This prompted us to carry out a mixed-methods research study which aimed to evaluate adherence to IPC practices and understand how to improve IPC at the primary care level, where most cases of Ebola were initially presenting. The study was carried out during the national peak of the epidemic. DISCUSSION: We successfully carried out a rapid response research study that produced several expected and unexpected findings that were used to guide IPC measures during the epidemic. Although many research challenges were similar to those found when conducting research in low-resource settings, the presence of Ebola added risks to safety and security of data collectors, as well as a need to balance research activities with the imperative of response to a humanitarian crisis. A participatory approach that attempted to unify levels of the response from community upwards helped overcome the risk of lack of trust in an environment where Ebola had damaged relations between communities and the health system. CONCLUSION: In the context of a national epidemic, research needs to be focused, appropriately resourced, and responsive to needs. The partnership between local academics and a humanitarian organization helped facilitate access to study sites and approvals that allowed the research to be carried out quickly and safely, and for findings to be shared in response forums with the best chance of being taken up in real-time.","Ho, Lara Shiu-yi; Ratnayake, Ruwan; Ansumana, Rashid; Brown, Hannah",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11634-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465334/,361

We aimed to examine whether patients with rheumatological conditions receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy are at less risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not receiving hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included de-identified information of all veterans in the US Veterans Health Administration clinical administrative database aged 18 years or older with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or associated rheumatological conditions (based on International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, diagnostic codes) who were alive on March 1, 2020. A propensity score was calculated for each patient, and each patient who was receiving hydroxychloroquine was matched to two patients who were not receiving hydroxychloroquine (controls). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among those receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine versus the propensity-matched patients not receiving chronic hydroxychloroquine between March 1 and June 30, 2020. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; intensive care requirement associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; and overall rates of any hospital admission and mortality (ie, all cause). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent variables for the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and June 30, 2020, 10 703 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 21 406 patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine were included in the primary analysis. The incidence of active SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period did not differ between patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and patients not receiving hydroxychloroquine (31 [0·3%] of 10 703 vs 78 [0·4%] of 21 406; odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·52–1·20, p=0·27). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups in patients who developed active SARS-CoV-2 infection. For all patients in the study, overall mortality was lower in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the group of patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (odds ratio 0·70, 95% CI 0·55–0·89, p=0·0031). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, receipt of hydroxychloroquine was not associated with the development of active SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·51–1·42). INTERPRETATION: Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a preventive effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large group of patients with rheumatological conditions. FUNDING: None.","Gentry, Chris A; Humphrey, Mary Beth; Thind, Sharanjeet K; Hendrickson, Sage C; Kurdgelashvili, George; Williams, Riley J",Lancet Rheumatol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2665991320303052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984847/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2665-9913(20)30305-2; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665991320303052,361
690196,How did Occupational and Employee Health Services Provide Strategic Input to Organizational Emergency Contingency Planning During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Case Study,2021-01-20,"High-temperature and waterlogging are major abiotic stresses that affect the yield and quality of cauliflower. Cauliflower cultivars ‘H41’ and ‘H69’ are tolerant to high temperature and flooding, respectively; however, ‘H71’ is sensitive to both stresses. The objectives of this study were to identify the proteins that were differentially regulated and the physiological changes that occurred during different time periods in ‘H41’, ‘H69’, and ‘H71’ when responding to treatments of flooding, 40 °C, and both stresses combined. Changes in the leaf proteome were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and identified by Mascot peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and database searching. Stress treatments caused significant reductions in electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll fluorescence Fv/Fm, chlorophyll content, and water potential as stress times were prolonged. By the comparative proteomic analysis, 85 protein peaks that were differentially expressed in response to combination treatments at 0, 6, and 24 h, 69 (33 in ‘H41’, 29 in ‘H69’, and 9 in ‘H71’) were identified, of which were cultivar specific. Differentially regulated proteins predominantly functioned in photosynthesis and to a lesser extent in energy metabolism, cellular homeostasis, transcription and translation, signal transduction, and protein biosynthesis. This is the first report that utilizes proteomics to discover changes in the protein expression profile of cauliflower in response to heat and flooding.","Lin, K.H.; Chen, L.F.O.; Li, S.D.; Lo, H.F.",Sci Hortic (Amsterdam),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304423814006864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287882/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.12.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423814006864,361

The African Academy of Sciences has formed an expert maternal and newborn health group to discuss actions to improve MNH SDG targets. The team, among other recommendations, chose to implement an MNH research prioritization exercise for Africa covering four grand challenge areas. Methods: The team used the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) research prioritization method to identify research priorities in maternal and newborn health in Africa. From 609 research options, a ranking of the top 46 research questions was achieved. Research priority scores and agreement statistics were calculated, with sub-analysis possible for the regions of East Africa, West Africa and those living out of the continent. Results: The top research priorities generally fell into (i) improving identification of high-risk mothers and newborns, or diagnosis of high-risk conditions in mothers and newborns to improve health outcomes; (ii) improving access to treatment through improving incentives to attract and retain skilled health workers in remote, rural areas, improving emergency transport, and assessing health systems' readiness; and (iii) improving uptake of proven existing interventions such as Kangaroo Mother Care. Conclusions: The research priorities emphasized building interventions that improved access to quality healthcare in the lowest possible units of the provision of MNH interventions. The lists prioritized participation of communities in delivering MNH interventions. The current burden of disease from MNCH in Africa aligns well with the list of priorities listed from this exercise but provides extra insights into current needs by African practitioners. The MNCH Africa expert group believes that the recommendations from this work should be implemented by multisectoral teams as soon as possible to provide adequate lead time for results of the succeeding programmes to be seen before 2030.","Alobo, Moses; Mgone, Charles; Lawn, Joy; Adhiambo, Colette; Wazny, Kerri; Ezeaka, Chinyere; Molyneux, Elizabeth; Temmerman, Marleen; Okong, Pius; Malata, Address; Kariuki, Thomas",AAS Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/aasopenres.13189.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151141/,361
