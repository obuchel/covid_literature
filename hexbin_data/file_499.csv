Activation of the inflammasome complex mediates both the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and the execution of a form of inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis. In most cases, these mediators of inflammation provide protection against bacterial, viral and protozoal infections. However, unchecked inflammasome activities perpetuate chronic inflammation, which underpins the molecular and pathophysiological basis of gastritis, IBD, upper and lower gastrointestinal cancer, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity. Studies have also highlighted an inflammasome signature in the maintenance of gut microbiota and gut–brain homeostasis. Harnessing the immunomodulatory properties of the inflammasome could transform clinical practice in the treatment of acute and chronic gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal diseases. This Review presents an overview of inflammasome biology in gastrointestinal health and disease and describes the value of experimental and pharmacological intervention in the treatment of inflammasome-associated clinical manifestations.","Man, Si Ming",Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,499,28

Mathematical models of emergent pathogens allow forecasts of case numbers, investigation of transmission mechanisms, and evaluation of control options. Yet, there are numerous limitations and pitfalls to their use, often driven by data scarcity. Growing availability of data on pathogen genetics and human ecology, coupled with computational and methodological innovations, is amplifying the power of models to inform the public health response to emergence events. Tighter integration of infectious disease models with public health practice and development of resources at the ready has the potential to increase the timeliness and quality of responses.","Metcalf, C Jessica E; Lessler, Justin",Science,499,1

Irbesartan and other angiotensin II blockers offer significant nephroprotective effect through improvement of renal function and reduction of renal inflammation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to illustrate the nephroprotective effect of irbesartan in rats regarding the oxidative stress of irbesartan biomarkers. Methods Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were used; they were divided into three groups: Group I (10 rats) treated with distilled water, Group II (10 rats) treated with gentamicin, and Group III (10 rats) treated with gentamicin plus irbesartan for 12 days. Blood urea, serum creatinine, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GSH), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule (KIM-1), and cystatin-c were measured in each group. Results Irbesartan significantly reduced blood urea, serum creatinine, serum MDA, NGAL, KIM-1, and cystatin-c [P < 0.05]. Irbesartan significantly increases SOD [P < 0.05] without significant effect in elevation of GSH serum levels. Conclusions This study concluded that irbesartan has a nephroprotective effect in attenuation of acute nephrotoxicity through modulation of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in rats.","Al-Kuraishy, Hayder M; Al-Gareeb, Ali I; Al-Nami, Marwa S",International journal of preventive medicine,499,30

Methods: Clinical data of 30 patients with OSAS were reviewed between December 2017 and December 2018. OSAS were defined as arising from the internal carotid artery (ICA), reaching from the distal dural ring to the origin of the posterior communicating artery. OSAS were classified into four types based on the angiographic findings. The balloon-assisted coils technique was used for the embolization of aneurysms. The duration of balloon inflation cycles, as well as difficulty and complications during the embolization procedure, were recorded. The immediate angiographic results were evaluated according to the Raymond scale. Clinical results were evaluated based on the MRS score. Follow-ups were performed at 18 months post-embolization by DSA or MRA at our institution. Results: Thirty-two aneurysms in 30 patients were detected by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which included 30 unruptured and two ruptured cases. The patients with ruptured aneurysms were grade II status according to the Hunt-Hess scale. Three cases were type A, nine cases were type B, 17 cases were type C, and three cases were type D. According to aneurysm size, there were 19 cases of small, 11 cases of medium, two cases of large aneurysm. Thirty-two aneurysms were successfully embolized in 30 patients by balloon-assisted coils technique. The ophthalmic artery could be protected by an engorged balloon in the procedure, especially for type A aneurysms. Considering that type D aneurysm arises from the side-wall of the artery and near to tortuous ICA siphon, the balloon catheter was inflated to stabilize the microcatheter allowing for overinflation when necessary. The average duration of balloon dilatation was 4 min, and the average time was 2.5 times. Raymond class was one in 28 aneurysms and two in four aneurysms according to the immediate post-embolization angiographic results. All the patients achieved good clinical effects, except for one patient who presented with brain ischemia resulting in dizziness and contralateral limb weakness for 10 h due to prolonged temporary clamping of the responsible ICA. The follow-up angiography results were satisfactory at 18 months post-embolization. Conclusion: OSAS endovascular treatment with balloon-assisted coils has different advantages in a different classification. The technique is safe, effective, and relatively inexpensive, especially for small and medium OSAS.","Chaohui, Liang; Yu, Zhang Guang; Kai, Hou",Frontiers in neurology,499,12

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of BW training on patients with stroke. METHODS A keyword search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for articles published until November, 2019. Two investigators screened the articles and extract data from each included study. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the effect of BW on stroke. In addition, the quality of evidence was evaluated by GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation; version:3.6) approach. RESULTS A total of ten studies were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the review. All included studies described some positive influences of BW on stroke relative to the control group (forward walking or conventional treatment). Compared to control group, there is a statistically significant improvement for BW group in gait velocity (mean difference [MD] = 6.87, 95%CI: [1.40, 12.33], P = .01, I = 3%), Berg balance score (MD =3.82, 95%CI: [2.12, 5.52], P < .0001, I = 0%), and walk test (MD =0.11, 95%CI: [0.02, 0.20], P = .02, I = 36%). CONCLUSIONS For patients with stroke, BW training, as an adjunct an adjunct to conventional treatment, can improve Berg balance score (moderate evidence), walk test performance (very low evidence), gait velocity (very low evidence). More large-scale and high-quality studies are warranted.","Chen, Ze-Hua; Ye, Xiang-Ling; Chen, Wei-Jian; Chen, Guo-Qian; Wu, Jia-Tao; Wu, Huai; Xu, Xue-Meng",Medicine,499,12

Rate of recanalisation is varied and can range from 43-57% and the factors that affect recanalisation are still a dilemma. Objective To know the factors for recanalisation following Deep Vein Thrombosis. Method This is a single institution based retrospective-prospective analytical study encompassing all ultrasonologically diagnosed cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis in adults from January 2015 to November 2017. All the cases were admitted with oral warfarin bridged by Heparin/ Enoxaparin and were discharged once International Normalization Ratio was in therapeutic range. The patients were followed up for three months with minimal of three outpatient followup. Best finding in the doppler ultrasonography (done by Acuson P500, Seimens) in relation to recanalisation was taken for the study. Result There were 67 cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Of these cases male to female ratio was 0.91. The mean age was 48.07. Most common extent was up to common femoral vein (47.8%) followed by upto popliteal vein (40.3%). Remaining 11.9% had extension upto iliac veins. There was no recanalisation in 2 cases (3%). Partial recanalisation was seen in 23 cases (34.3%) while complete recanalisation was seen in 42 cases (62.7%). Recanalisation is more in DVT involving popliteal vein while it decreases as the extension goes up. In contrast to 79.4% complete recanalisation in popliteal vein, that in common femoral vein is 62.5% while in iliac vein is only 37.5%. Mean age in no recanalisation group is much younger than partial or complete recanalisation groups. Conclusion Recanalisation following Deep Vein Thrombosis distal to popliteal vein is more than that in proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis. The information on recanalization can be considered to use to decide upon the duration of medical management of Deep Vein Thrombosis.","Karmacharya, R M; Shrestha, B; Devbhandari, M; Tuladhar, S M; Pradhan, A",Kathmandu University medical journal,499,16

The deduced sequence contains a probable cleaved signal peptide sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane helix, indicating that protein X4 is likely to be a type I membrane protein. This study was conducted to demonstrate whether the protein X4 was expressed and its essential function in the process of SARS-CoV infection. METHODS The prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein X4-expressing plasmids were constructed. Recombinant soluble protein X4 was purified from E. coli using ion exchange chromatography, and the preparation was injected into chicken for rising specific polyclonal antibodies. The expression of protein X4 in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells and lung tissues from patients with SARS was performed using immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry technique. The preliminary function of protein X4 was evaluated by treatment with and over-expression of protein X4 in cell lines. Western blot was employed to evaluate the expression of protein X4 in SARS-CoV particles. RESULTS We expressed and purified soluble recombinant protein X4 from E.coli, and generated specific antibodies against protein X4. Western blot proved that the protein X4 was not assembled in the SARS-CoV particles. Indirect immunofluorescence assays revealed that the expression of protein X4 was detected at 8 hours after infection in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. It was also detected in the lung tissues from patients with SARS. Treatment with and overexpression of protein X4 inhibited the growth of Balb/c 3T3 cells as determined by cell counting and MTT assays. CONCLUSION The results provide the evidence of protein X4 expression following SARS-CoV infection, and may facilitate further investigation of the immunopathological mechanism of SARS.","Chen, Ying-yu; Shuang, Bao; Tan, Ya-xia; Meng, Min-jie; Han, Pu; Mo, Xiao-ning; Song, Quan-sheng; Qiu, Xiao-yan; Luo, Xin; Gan, Qi-ni; Zhang, Xin; Zheng, Ying; Liu, Shun-ai; Wang, Xiao-ning; Zhong, Nan-shan; Ma, Da-long",Chinese medical journal,499,10

To characterize the cellular response to IBDV infection, the differential proteomes of chicken embryo fibroblasts, with and without IBDV infection, were analyzed at different time points with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF identification. Comparative analysis of multiple 2-DE gels revealed that the majority of protein expression changes appeared at 48 and 96 h after IBDV infection. Mass spectrometry identified 51 altered cellular proteins, including 13 up-regulated proteins and 38 down-regulated proteins 12-96 h after infection. Notably 2-DE analysis revealed that IBDV infection induced the increased expression of polyubiquitin, apolipoprotein A-I, heat shock 27-kDa protein 1, actins, tubulins, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A isoform 2, acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein, and ribosomal protein SA isoform 2. In addition, IBDV infection considerably suppressed those cellular proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, energy metabolism, intermediate filaments, host translational apparatus, and signal transduction. Moreover 38 corresponding genes of the differentially expressed proteins were quantitated by real time RT-PCR to examine the transcriptional profiles between infected and uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts. Western blot further confirmed the inhibition of Rho protein GDP dissociation inhibitor expression and the induction of polyubiquitin during IBDV infection. Subcellular distribution analysis of the cytoskeletal proteins vimentin and beta-tubulin clearly demonstrated that IBDV infection induced the disruption of the vimentin network and microtubules late in IBDV infection. Thus, this work effectively provides useful dynamic protein-related information to facilitate further investigation of the underlying mechanism of IBDV infection and pathogenesis.","Zheng, Xiaojuan; Hong, Lianlian; Shi, Lixue; Guo, Junqing; Sun, Zhen; Zhou, Jiyong",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,499,1

The present serological study was performed to obtain insight into the epizootiology of PRCV and of TGEV. PRCV-induced neutralizing antibodies were found in 90.6 per cent of the 160 sera collected from sows at slaughter, demonstrating the enzootic appearance of PRCV in the Belgian swine population. A serological study of fattening swine on 33 farms revealed that 11 farms situated in an area with a high farm density (all farms within 4 km2) and 11 on 22 closed breeding-fattening farms situated in areas with a low farm density (only one to four farms per 12 km2) were infected with PRCV throughout the year, whereas the other 11 closed breeding-fattening farms were temporarily free of PRCV. PRCV disappeared from the farms mainly in spring and summer. All the 11 farms became reinfected in autumn or winter, indicating that PRCV is regularly reintroduced in farms in the colder seasons. There was no correlation between the herd size and the temporary disappearance of PRCV from farms. It was observed on some farms that PRCV could infect pigs shortly after weaning in the presence of declining maternal antibodies, indicating that PRCV can persist on a farm by regularly infecting newly weaned pigs.

MATERİAL AND METHODS: A total of 262 COVID-19-confirmed patients and 157 healthy controls were included in the study. RESULTS: The mean vitamin D level in the COVID-19 group (12.8±8.9 ng/mL) was significantly lower than the control group (15.2±12.1 ng/mL) (p=0.015). The rate of those with vitamin D levels below 10 ng/mL in the COVID- 19 group (49.6%) was significantly higher than the control group (39.5%) (p=0.044). In the logistic regression analysis, it was found that those with a vitamin D level below 10 ng/mL had a 1.508-fold increased risk of COVID-19 compared to those who had 10 ng/mL and above (Odds ratio: 1.01-2.252). According to the risk analysis, those who have vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL are 1,224 times higher than those who have 20 ng/mL and above; those under 30 ng/mL were found to have an increased risk of 2.01 times compared to those of 30 ng/mL and above.

By a forced recombination approach based on the transduction of Akv murine leukemia virus vectors harboring a primer binding site knockout mutation and the entire 5' untranslated region, we studied recombination between two closely related naturally occurring retroviral sequences. On the basis of 24 independent template switching events within a 481-nucleotide target sequence containing multiple sequence identity windows, we found that shifting from vector RNA to an endogenous retroviral RNA template during minus-strand DNA synthesis occurred within defined areas of the genome and did not lead to misincorporations at the crossover site. The nonrandom distribution of recombination sites did not reflect a bias for specific sites due to selection at the level of marker gene expression. We address whether template switching is affected by the length of sequence identity, by palindromic sequences, and/or by putative stem-loop structures. Sixteen of 24 sites of recombination colocalized with the kissing-loop dimerization region, and we propose that RNA-RNA interactions between palindromic sequences facilitate template switching. We discuss the putative role of the dimerization domain in the overall structure of the reverse-transcribed RNA dimer and note that related mechanisms of template switching may be found in remote RNA viruses.","Mikkelsen, J G; Lund, A H; Duch, M; Pedersen, F S",Journal of virology,499,1

In addition to increasing accessibility of mail-in voting by mailing applications to all registered voters, RI has suspended their notary/witness requirement for both the primary and general election. However, RI's ""emergency"" voting process still plays a crucial role in allowing voters who missed the mail-in ballot application deadline, such as those unexpectedly hospitalized in the days leading up to the election, to still cast their ballot. COVID-19 has also forced RI to modify its emergency voting procedures, most notably allowing healthcare workers to serve on bipartisan ballot delivery teams. This commentary highlights these salient updates to voting procedures and serves as a primer as to how interested health care workers may navigate this process alongside patients and lead in the arena of patient voting rights.","Burns, Nicole M; Zahiri, Keyana; Ganguli, Reetam; Kozel, Giovanni; Paracha, Saba; Tang, Kevin P; Tang, Oliver Y; Wong, Kelly E",Rhode Island medical journal,499,24

Methods: Data were collected retrospectively of patients who received anti-VEGF injections during four months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Visual acuities, indication for treatment were noted along with basic demographic characteristics. Results: Data were analyzed for 303 eyes of 263 patients. The indication for treatment was age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 60 eyes (19.8%), while 162 eyes (53.5%) had Diabetic Macular Edema, 71 eyes (23.4%) had Retinal Vein Occlusion and 10 eyes (3.3%) had other diagnosis. The visual acuity in the treatment naïve eyes (Group A, n = 168) was significantly worse (P <0.001) than those who presented for retreatment (Group B, n = 135). In Group B, there was a significant decline in vision for the entire cohort (P = 0.009) and those with AMD (P = 0.036). Those in Group B presented at a mean interval of 19.1 ± 10.6 (range, 4-64) weeks for retreatment. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a delay in patients receiving anti-VEGF injections. The visual acuity is worse in both treatment naïve as well as those requiring retreatment. This could have long-term impact on vision of patients requiring this vision preserving treatment.","Sindal, Manavi D; Chhabra, Kanika; Khanna, Vaibhav",Indian J Ophthalmol,499,6

This metanalysis assesses the fundamental, logistical and behavioral barriers to continuing clinical research during the pandemic and discusses their short- and long-term impact to the sector. Methods: A comprehensive review of published research, articles and regulations was conducted to understand the changing landscape of non-COVID-19 US clinical trials during the pandemic. Results: Impacts to clinical trial execution include heightened risk of patient drop out, study noncompliance and reduced patient enrollment. New patient enrollment year-over-year was down 65% worldwide in March 2020. Digital capabilities including telemedicine visits, remote monitoring, eConsent and data collection tools are being used in response to these challenges. Conclusions: While many of these enablers are not novel – the FDA, for example, recommended a shift to remote monitoring for clinical trials back in 2013 – they have not yet been widely adopted. The COVID-19 environment, however, has accelerated the adoption of new technologies and heightened the focus on patient data protection. In turn, it has presented an opportunity for sponsors, sites and investigators alike to optimize the research business model, deliver value more efficiently and expand trial access. Amid the uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations that invest in a participant-first approach that capitalizes on new methods of delivery will be well-poised to realize time and cost savings, patient safety improvement and participant diversity increases — now and in the long-term, beyond COVID-19.","Hildreth, C.; Infante, K.; Eslami, N.; Garfield, S.",Value in Health,499,15

In this study, the RNA-binding N terminal domain (NTD) of the N protein was targeted for the identification of possible inhibitors of RNA binding. Two NTD structures of N proteins were selected (2OFZ and 1SSK, 92% homology) for virtual screening of 56,079 compounds from Asinex and Maybridge library to identify top 15 hits for each of the targets based on 'docking score'. These top-hits were further screened for MM-GBSA binding free energy, pharmacokinetic properties (QikProp) and drug-likeness (SwissADME) and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Two suitable binders (ZINC00003118440 and ZINC0000146942) against the target 2OFZ were identified. ZINC00003118440 is a theophylline derivative under the drug class 'bronchodilators' and further screening with approved bronchodilators was also studied to identify their ability to bind to the RNA binding region on the N protein. The other identified top hit is ZINC0000146942, which is a 3,4dihydropyrimidone class molecule. Hence this study suggests two important class of compounds, theophylline and pyrimidone derivaties as possible inhibitors of RNA binding to the N terminal domain of N protein of coronavirus, thus opening new avenues for in vitro validations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Therefore, it becomes a critical issue to make policies by using scientific knowledge in a highly uncertain and unpredictable context. The key issue of risk-based decision-making (RBDM) is how to strike a balance between science and politics. After reviewing existing literature and practice, three main approaches to risk-based decision-making (RBDM) can be summarized: politics-based, science-led, and the integration and negotiation of science and politics. On the basis of public reports from current mass media, this article focuses on the time period from the releasing of the first COVID-19 case in Wuhan to the lockdown policy made by Wuhan municipal government, and we divide important stakeholders in early stage into two groups：scientist group and politician group. It finds that the RBDM process of Wuhan municipal government against COVID-19 demonstrated that politics intertwined tightly with science. Its RBDM process could be categorized into three phases: politics-based, science-involved, and science-led. We conclude six main characteristics of RBDM mechanisms in contemporary China. Finally, we argue that Chinese governments should establish institutionalized mechanisms for the negotiation and cooperation of science and politics in its RBDM process like COVID-19 epidemic.

As data on COVID-19 has grown, it has become clear that older adults have a disproportionately high rate of death from COVID-19. This study describes the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with more than 80 years of age. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data from 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 20 and February 20, 2020 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Treatment outcomes among subgroups of patients with non-severe and severe symptoms of COVID-19 were compared. RESULTS: Of the 17 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 88.0 years (interquartile range, 86.6-90.0 years; range, 80.0-100.0 years) and 12 (70.6%) were men. The age distribution of patients was not significantly different between non-severe group and severe group. All patients had chronic pre-existing conditions. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were the most common chronic conditions in both subgroups. The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 were fever (n = 13; 76.5%), fatigue (n = 11; 64.7%), and cough (n = 5; 29.4%). Lymphopenia was observed in all patients, and lymphopenia was significantly more severe in the severe group than that in non-severe group (0.4 × 109/L vs 1.2 × 109/L, P = 0.014). The level of serum creatinine was higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (99.0 µmol/L vs 62.5 µmol/L, P = 0.038). The most common features of chest computed tomography images were nodular foci in 10 (58.8%) patients and pleural thickening in 7 (41.2%) patients. All patients received antiviral therapy, while some patients also received intravenous antibiotics therapy (76.5%), Chinese medicinal preparation therapy (Lianhuaqingwen capsule, 64.7%), corticosteroids (35.3%) or immunoglobin (29.4%). Eight patients (47.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit because of complications. Ten patients (58.8%) received intranasal oxygen, while 3 (17.6%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4 (23.5%) received high-flow oxygen. As of June 20, 7 (41.2%) patients had been discharged and 10 (58.8% of this cohort, 77.8% of severe patients) had died. CONCLUSION: The mortality of patients aged 80 years and older with severe COVID-19 symptoms was high. Lymphopenia was a characteristic laboratory result in these patients, and the severity of lymphopenia was indicative of the severity of COVID-19. However, the majority of patients with COVID-19 in this age cohort had atypical symptoms, and early diagnosis depends on prompt use of a viral nucleic acid test.","Dang, Jian-Zhong; Zhu, Gang-Yan; Yang, Ying-Jie; Zheng, Fang",J Integr Med,499,16

The hospital screening procedures for quickly recognizing neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are often complicated by other coexisting symptoms and can be obscured by the deep sedation procedures required for critically ill patients. Here, we present two different case-reports of COVID-19 patients, describing neurological complications, diagnostic imaging such as olfactory bulb damage (a mild and unclear underestimated complication) and a severe and sudden thrombotic stroke complicated with hemorrhage with a low-level cytokine storm and respiratory symptom resolution. We discuss the possible mechanisms of virus entrance, together with the causes of COVID-19-related encephalitis, olfactory bulb damage, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage.","Melegari, G.; Rivi, V.; Zelent, G.; Nasillo, V.; De Santis, E.; Melegari, A.; Bevilacqua, C.; Zoli, M.; Meletti, S.; Barbieri, A.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],499,30

In the infected animals, viral variants arose that harbored mutations in the spike (S) protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and these variants were transmitted back to humans. This raised concerns that mink might become a constant source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with an increased threat to human health and resulted in mass culling of mink. Here, we report that mutations frequently found in the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 from mink are mostly compatible with efficient entry into human cells and its inhibition by soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In contrast, mutation Y453F reduces neutralization by an antibody with emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy and sera/plasma from COVID-19 patients. These results suggest that antibody responses induced upon infection or certain antibodies used for treatment might offer insufficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants from mink.","Hoffmann, Markus; Zhang, Lu; Krüger, Nadine; Graichen, Luise; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Kempf, Amy; Nessler, Stefan; Riggert, Joachim; Winkler, Martin Sebastian; Schulz, Sebastian; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Cell Rep,499,24

Because of the limiting coding capacity of (+)RNA viruses, their replication requires a complex orchestration of interactions between the viral genome, viral proteins and exploited host factors. To replicate their genomic RNAs, (+)RNA viruses induce membrane rearrangements that create membrane-linked RNA replication compartments. Along with substantial advances on the ultrastructure of the membrane-bound RNA replication compartments, recent results have shed light into the role that host factors play in rearranging these membranes. This review focuses on recent insights that have driven a new understanding of the role that the membrane-shaping host reticulon homology domain proteins (RHPs) play in facilitating the replication of various (+)RNA viruses.","Diaz, Arturo; Ahlquist, Paul",Current Opinion in Microbiology,499,1
