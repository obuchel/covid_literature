209983,Early IL-1 receptor blockade in severe inflammatory respiratory failure complicating COVID-19,2020,"Social distancing, an essential public health measure to limit the spread of contagious diseases, has gained significant attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, the problem of visual social distancing compliance assessment in busy public areas, with wide field-of-view cameras, is considered. A dataset of crowd scenes with people annotations under a bird's eye view (BEV) and ground truth for metric distances is introduced, and several measures for the evaluation of social distance detection systems are proposed. A multi-branch network, BEV-Net, is proposed to localize individuals in world coordinates and identify high-risk regions where social distancing is violated. BEV-Net combines detection of head and feet locations, camera pose estimation, a differentiable homography module to map image into BEV coordinates, and geometric reasoning to produce a BEV map of the people locations in the scene. Experiments on complex crowded scenes demonstrate the power of the approach and show superior performance over baselines derived from methods in the literature. Applications of interest for public health decision makers are finally discussed. Datasets, code and pretrained models are publicly available at GitHub.","Dai, Zhirui; Jiang, Yuepeng; Li, Yi; Liu, Bo; Chan, Antoni B.; Vasconcelos, Nuno",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04931v2.pdf,955
239964,"Enforcement may crowd out voluntary support for COVID-19 policies, especially where trust in government is weak and in a liberal society",2021,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Mobility restrictions imposed to suppress transmission of COVID-19 can alter physical activity (PA) and sleep patterns that are important for health and wellbeing. Characterization of response heterogeneity and their underlying associations may assist in stratifying the health impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We obtained wearable data covering baseline, incremental mobility restriction and lockdown periods from 1824 city-dwelling, working adults aged 21-40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038 days of PA. Distinct rest-activity rhythm (RAR) profiles were identified using k-means clustering, indicating participants' temporal distribution of step counts over the day. Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of days spent in each of these RAR profiles revealed 4 groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: Time in bed increased by 20 min during the lockdown without loss of sleep efficiency, while social jetlag measures decreased by 15 min. Resting heart rate declined ~2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 42%. 4 groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown. The least active group comprising ~51% of the sample, were younger and predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend differences. CONCLUSION: In the early aftermath of COVID-19 mobility restriction, physical activity appears to be more severely affected than sleep. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of responses to lockdown that could associate with different outcomes should the resolution of COVID-19 be protracted.","Ong, Ju Lynn; Lau, TeYang; Massar, Stijn A A; Chong, Zhi Ting; Ng, Ben K L; Koek, Daphne; Zhao, Wanting; Yeo, B T Thomas; Cheong, Karen; Chee, Michael W L",Sleep,,955
249265,Pandemic precarity: COVID-19 is exposing and exacerbating inequalities in the American heartland,2021,"Background Although pneumonia is the hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), multiple organ failure may develop in severe disease. TNFα receptors in their soluble form (sTNFR) are involved in the immune cascade in other systemic inflammatory processes such as septic shock, and could mediate the inflammatory activation of distant organs. The aim of this study is to analyse plasma levels of sTNFR 1 and 2 in association with organ failure and outcome in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods After informed consent, we included 122 adult patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 at ICU admission. Demographic data, illness severity scores, organ failure and survival at 30 days were collected. Plasma sTNFR 1 and 2 levels were quantified during the first days after ICU admission. Twenty-five healthy blood donors were used as control group. Results Levels of sTNFR were higher in severe COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p<0.001). Plasma levels of sTNFR were associated to illness severity scores (SAPS 3 and SOFA), inflammation biomarkers such as IL-6, ferritin and PCT as well as development of AKI during ICU stay. sTNFR 1 higher than 2.29 ng/mL and? sTNFR 2 higher than 11.7 ng/mL were identified as optimal cut-offs to discriminate survivors and non-survivors 30 days after ICU admission and had an area under the curve in receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 and 0.67 respectively. Conclusion Plasma levels of sTNFR 1 and 2 were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls and were strongly associated with other inflammatory biomarkers, severity of illness and acute kidney injury development during ICU stay. In addition, sTNFR 1 was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality after adjustment for age and respiratory failure.","Sancho Ferrando, Elena Hanslin Katja Hultström Michael Larsson Anders Frithiof Robert Lipcsey Miklos the Uppsala Intensive Care Covid-Research Group",Cytokine,,955

As many facilities resume clinical work owing to the currently low burden of disease in our community, we are faced with operative booking protocols and procedures that are not mathematically designed to optimize efficiency. Using a subset of artificial intelligence called ""machine learning,"" we have shown how the use of operating time can be optimized with a custom Python (a high-level programming language) script and an open source machine-learning algorithm, the ORTools software suite from the Google AI division of Alphabet Inc. This allowed the creation of customized models to optimize the efficiency of operating room booking times, which resulted in a reduction in nursing overtime of 21% - a theoretical cost savings of $469 000 over 3 years.","Rozario, Natasha; Rozario, Duncan",Can J Surg,,955

The studies used are from 1975-2020Study selection The authors have performed a scoping review using 84 studies ranging from 1975-2020. The majority of these are from before the 2019-2020 COVID-19 outbreak period. This is indicative of the lack of evidence on this topic and exemplifies why a scoping review was carried out rather than a systematic review. The studies that were reviewed were predominately cohort and case studies. With regards to previous treatment outcomes, a few systematic reviews were included, but again, the novel nature of this outbreak means that largely, there are only cohort or case studies available for review.Data extraction and synthesis There are ten authors, with no indication of how many performed the literature review or if a mediator was involved in the final decision making on what papers would be reviewed.Results Excessive consumption of alcohol, history of tobacco use, an ageing population, and comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary issues are substantial risk factors for episodes of unfavourable respiratory outcomes. The risk of these outcomes is increased by some of the toxic effects of treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy.Conclusions The COVID-19 outbreak has a potentially disproportionate impact on the cohort of head and neck cancer patients, and the respiratory effects this has on these patients may increase morbidity and mortality. It is important to include alcohol and smoking cessation, along with good oral hygiene instruction in the care of these patients.","Dolan, Sean",Evid Based Dent,,955

459535,COVID-19 lockdowns show reduced pollution on snow and ice in the Indus River Basin,2021,"PURPOSE: To describe a case of sudden visual loss from acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) as the presenting manifestation of active Covid-19 infection. CASE REPORT: During the quarantine period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a 70-year-old man presented with a 1-day history of a paracentral scotoma of the left eye (OS) associated with diaphoresis. Four days later, the patient developed fever (38° C) followed by cough. Oral and nasal swab PCR testing was positive for COVID-19. Visual acuity in the day of presentation was 20/20 in OD and 20/100 in OS. Multimodal retinal imaging was unremarkable in OD but cross-sectional OCT displayed focal hyperreflectivity at the level of the outer nuclear layer associated with disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ). The corresponding en face OCT revealed an inferonasal hyperreflective parafoveal lesion. At 1 month of follow-up, tracked OCT of the macula showed resolution of the hyperreflective signal, thinning of the outer nuclear layer, and near-complete recovery of EZ integrity. CONCLUSION: Patients with Covid-19 may rarely present with signs and symptoms of ocular disease. This case report describes a case of sudden visual loss caused by AMN as the presenting manifestation of active Covid-19 infection.","Preti, Rony C; Zacharias, Leandro C; Cunha, Leonardo P; Monteiro, Mario L R",Retin. cases brief rep.

488724,Old vaccines for new infections: Exploiting innate immunity to control COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics,2021,"The goal of our research was to determine how crisis management competence affects employee performance of teams and the conditions in the acute stage of the crisis during the pandemic. We have used the mediator model to identify the relations. The study was carried out on a research sample of 122 companies after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia (March - April 2020). The respondents in the research sample were managers at different company levels. The study tests the positive association between leadership in crisis and employee performance of teams, which is mediated through the sharing of information, team organization of work and cognitive diversity, supporting crisis management competency. The research results prove that employee performance of teams during the acute stage of the crisis may be positively affected through crisis management competences amplified by information sharing and team cooperation. The study contains knowledge important for managing company competitiveness, because it introduces demonstrable findings on the content of crisis management competences in relation to employee performance. The study results are internationally relevant and the content of the discussion applicable, because the pandemic has hit globally regardless the political or economical borders.","Jankelova, N.; Joniakova, Z.; Blstakova, J.; Prochazkova, K.; Skorkova, Z.; Abuladze, L.",Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues,,955

494002,"Besides population age structure, health and other demographic factors can contribute to understanding the COVID-19 burden",2020,"Previous domain adaptation research usually neglect the diversity in translation within a same domain, which is a core problem for adapting a general neural machine translation (NMT) model into a specific domain in real-world scenarios. One representative of such challenging scenarios is to deploy a translation system for a conference with a specific topic, e.g. computer networks or natural language processing, where there is usually extremely less resources due to the limited time schedule. To motivate a wide investigation in such settings, we present a real-world fine-grained domain adaptation task in machine translation (FDMT). The FDMT dataset (Zh-En) consists of four sub-domains of information technology: autonomous vehicles, AI education, real-time networks and smart phone. To be closer to reality, FDMT does not employ any in-domain bilingual training data. Instead, each sub-domain is equipped with monolingual data, bilingual dictionary and knowledge base, to encourage in-depth exploration of these available resources. Corresponding development set and test set are provided for evaluation purpose. We make quantitative experiments and deep analyses in this new setting, which benchmarks the fine-grained domain adaptation task and reveals several challenging problems that need to be addressed.","Zhu, Wenhao; Huang, Shujian; Pu, Tong; Zhang, Xu; Yu, Jian; Chen, Wei; Wang, Yanfeng; Chen, Jiajun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15717v1.pdf,955
632293,Reply to Kesici et al. and Zeng et al.: Blocking the virus and reducing the inflammatory damage in COVID-19,2020-06-09,"Viruses in avian hosts can pose threats to avian health and some have zoonotic potential. Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria’s Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 was detected from a powerful owl (Ninox strenua) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to Avian avulavirus 5 was detected from a musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) and a tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health.","Amery-Gale, Jemima; Hartley, Carol A.; Vaz, Paola K.; Marenda, Marc S.; Owens, Jane; Eden, Paul A.; Devlin, Joanne M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570719/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194457,955

It is often used for salad ingredients, boiled tsukudani, soups, etc., due to its health benefits. M. nitidum is composed of many cell aggregates, and the various substances that fill the intercellular space are dietary fibers, vitamins, and minerals. Rhamnan sulfate (RS), a sulfated polysaccharide, is main the component of the fiber extracted from M. nitidum. Recently, some biological properties of RS have been demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies that probably protect human subjects from viruses and ameliorate vascular dysfunction caused by metabolic disorders, especially lifestyle-related diseases.

To do so, we integrated South Korean residents’ perceptions of country image (PCI), mass media, and concerns about travel into the framework of the original model of goal-directed behaviour (MGB). Structural equation modelling was used to identify the structural relationships among the latent variables. The results show that mass media had a positive influence on South Korean residents’ perception of China’s image, a negative influence on residents’ concerns, and a positive influence on residents’ behavioural intentions for travel overseas. Meanwhile, PCI had a positive influence on residents’ attitude towards travel overseas.

686354,Reduced development of COVID-19 in children reveals molecular checkpoints gating pathogenesis illuminating potential therapeutics,2020-10-06,"Summary Our aim was to evaluate the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique for the detection of rotavirus shedding by infected children as a routine diagnostic procedure, in comparison to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electron microscopy (EM) and polyacrylamide gel etectrophoresis (PAGE) of rotavirus double stranded RNA. Two-hundred and twenty stool specimens were collected from infants and young children with diarrhoea, and 10–20% faecal suspensions were made. Several methods of rotavirus dsRNA extraction were assayed. Electrophoretic analysis of viral RNA was carried out on 10% polyacrylamide gols followed by silver staining. RT/PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for both 3′ and 5′ ends of the rotavirus gene encoding VP7 which ere highly conserved among group A rotaviruses. Following RNA extraction with phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, RT/PCR could detect rotaviral RNA in only 11 of 25 samples known to contain rotaviruses by conventional methods. The purification of RNA extracts by CF11 cellulose and the application of the RNAID method were equally effective in extracting RNA and/or removing inhibitory substances from the faecal samples. RT/PCR led to the detection of 66 positive samples from 220 specimens tested (30%). whilst 64 specimens were positive by EUSA (29%), 59 (26.3%) by PAGE and 56 (25.4%) by EM. In our study, RT/PCR was 100 times more sensitive than the ELISA test in detecting rotaviruses serially diluted in a faecal suspension. Although RT/PCR is theoretically much more sensitive than ELISA, PAGE and EM for detection of rotaviruses, great care must be taken to remove inhibitory substances from the enzymatic reactions. We do not consider that RT/PCR should replace immunoassays with high sensitivity and specificity for rotavirus testing in faecal samples, although this technique has other applications, like the search for rotavirus in different clinical specimens (sera, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory secretions, etc.) and in environmental samples, as well as the typing of viral strains using serotype-specific primers.","Buesa, J.; Colomina, J.; Raga, J.; Villanueva, A.; Prat, J.",Research in Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923251697851278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8958588/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923251697851278,955
