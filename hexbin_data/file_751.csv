28616,Reproducible Online Search Experiments,2020-03-24,"Die Bedeutung der Luft als Infektionsüberträger wird nicht selten überschätzt: Nur wenige Infektionen wie Tuberkulose oder Aspergillose werden tatsächlich aerogen, d. h. durch die Luft in Form von Aerosolen übertragen. Aerosole sind z. B. wässrige, feste, ölige Schwebstoffe, d. h. winzige Partikel, die wegen ihres geringen Gewichts lange Zeit in der Luft schweben, bevor sie sedimentieren. Hiervon abzugrenzen sind Kontaktinfektionen durch erregerhaltige »große Tröpfchen« (z. B. Influenza, RSV), die durch Husten, Sprechen oder Niesen ausgestoßen werden. Als aerogen übertragbare Infektionen gelten neben Tuberkulose und Aspergillose unter bestimmten Bedingungen auch Masern, Windpocken und Zoster sowie Mukormykosen. Für die von Mensch zu Mensch übertragbaren Infektionen gilt als wichtigste Isolationsmaßnahme die Unterbringung der Patienten in einem Einzelzimmer, möglichst mit negativer Druckführung. Wegen der besonderen klinischen und krankenhaushygienischen Relevanz wird die invasive Aspergillose im Folgenden ausführlich dargestellt, die übrigen Infektionen werden kurz abgehandelt. Die invasive Aspergillose ist eine seltene, überwiegend bei immungeschwächten Patienten nach lang andauernder Neutropenie auftretende Pilzinfektion, die häufig letal verläuft.","Häfner, H.; Lemmen, S.

This research note combines insights from historical institutionalism with recent economic and fiscal projections to explore avenues for reform in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Given the magnitude of the crisis, provincial governments may be unable to absorb the fiscal costs on their own. But vast differences in fiscal and economic circumstances across provinces make federal arrangements difficult to design. We argue that intergovernmental power dynamics and the principle of provincial autonomy are particularly important considerations in thinking about fiscal federalism post–COVID-19.","Béland, Daniel; Lecours, André; Paquet, Mireille; Tombe, Trevor",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198463/,751

34679,Enabling Hardware Affinity in JVM-Based Applications: A Case Study for Big Data,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Parasites employ proteases to evade host immune systems, feed and replicate and are often the target of anti-parasite strategies to disrupt these interactions. Myxozoans are obligate cnidarian parasites, alternating between invertebrate and fish hosts. Their genes are highly divergent from other metazoans, and available genomic and transcriptomic datasets are limited. Some myxozoans are important aquaculture pathogens such as Sphaerospora molnari replicating in the blood of farmed carp before reaching the gills for sporogenesis and transmission. Proliferative stages cause a massive systemic lymphocyte response and the disruption of the gill epithelia by spore-forming stages leads to respiratory problems and mortalities. In the absence of a S. molnari genome, we utilized a de novo approach to assemble the first transcriptome of proliferative myxozoan stages to identify S. molnari proteases that are upregulated during the first stages of infection when the parasite multiplies massively, rather than in late spore-forming plasmodia. Furthermore, a subset of orthologs was used to characterize 3D structures and putative druggable targets. RESULTS: An assembled and host filtered transcriptome containing 9436 proteins, mapping to 29,560 contigs was mined for protease virulence factors and revealed that cysteine proteases were most common (38%), at a higher percentage than other myxozoans or cnidarians (25–30%). Two cathepsin Ls that were found upregulated in spore-forming stages with a presenilin like aspartic protease and a dipeptidyl peptidase. We also identified downregulated proteases in the spore-forming development when compared with proliferative stages including an astacin metallopeptidase and lipases (qPCR). In total, 235 transcripts were identified as putative proteases using a MEROPS database. In silico analysis of highly transcribed cathepsins revealed potential drug targets within this data set that should be prioritised for development. CONCLUSIONS: In silico surveys for proteins are essential in drug discovery and understanding host-parasite interactions in non-model systems. The present study of S. molnari’s protease arsenal reveals previously unknown proteases potentially used for host exploitation and immune evasion. The pioneering dataset serves as a model for myxozoan virulence research, which is of particular importance as myxozoan diseases have recently been shown to emerge and expand geographically, due to climate change.","Hartigan, Ashlie; Kosakyan, Anush; Pecková, Hana; Eszterbauer, Edit; Holzer, Astrid S.",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296530/,751

While all participants uniformly believed that neither of those possibilities would be desirable, it was conceded that history has shown that significant geopolitical changes can happen even when totally unexpected, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fall of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War and Brexit. The paper notes that such discussions of a “post-WTO” are necessary: (1) to help keep the current regime alive by showing how difficult and challenging (dystopian) might be the international economic legal order in a post-WTO world; (2) to show in its utopian scenarios, ideas that could be used for future reform of the WTO; (3) and because it was the role of academics to be forward thinking about such very sensitive issues, when governments and international organisations likely would be unable to do so. In addition to discussing the traditional methodologies that could be employed when conducting such analyses, this paper also suggests some general approaches to help scholars undertake such studies.","Nakagawa, Junji; Picker, Colin B.",A Post-WTO International Legal Order,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296557/,751
34698,Community Aware Models of Meme Spreading in Micro-blog Social Networks,2020-05-26,"The bin packing problem is a widespread combinatorial problem. It aims at packing a set of items by using as few bins as possible. Among the many available solving methods, approximation ones such as heuristics have become popular due to their reduced cost and generally acceptable solutions. A further step in this regard is given by hyper-heuristics, which literature usually defines as “high-level heuristics to choose heuristics”. Hyper-heuristics choose one suitable heuristic from a set of available ones, to solve a particular portion of an instance. As the search progresses, heuristics can be exchanged, adapting the solution process to the current problem state under exploration. In this work, we describe how to generate and use hyper-heuristics that keep a record of the scores achieved by individual heuristics on previously solved bin packing problem instances in the form of rules. Then, hyper-heuristics manage those scores to estimate the performance of such heuristics on unseen instances. In this way, the previous actions of the hyper-heuristics determine which heuristic to use on future unseen cases. The experiments conducted under different scenarios yield promising results where some of the hyper-heuristics produced outperform isolated heuristics.","Silva-Gálvez, A.; Lara-Cárdenas, E.; Amaya, I.; Cruz-Duarte, J.

Social distancing restrictions and lockdown measures have been the most effective course of action and an inarguably imperative approach at this time. However, in trying to keep the global population safe, social distancing measures unwittingly placed children already experiencing maltreatment and disadvantage in harm’s way. This paper will consider the evidence base which attests to the importance of considering the accumulation of adversity when seeking to understand risk and impact of child maltreatment and disadvantage. Given the unique and unprecedented circumstances which have accompanied the COVID-19 outbreak, and the dearth of research pertaining to the impact of pandemics on child welfare, the paper draws on an emerging body of literature about the effect of natural disasters, conflict and significant global events on child maltreatment. The paper synthesises the research to date in order to call attention to the cumulative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children already experiencing abuse and neglect. The paper concludes with an outline of the implications for practice in the helping professions.","Bryce, India",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298091/,751

In this study, we follow novel approaches that target the absence of actionable insights by classifying reviews as defect reports and requests for improvement. Unlike traditional classification methods based on expert rules, we reduce the manual labour by employing a supervised system that is capable of learning lexico-semantic patterns through genetic programming. Additionally, we experiment with a distantly-supervised SVM that makes use of the noisy labels generated by patterns. Using a real-world dataset of app reviews, we show that the automatically learned patterns outperform the manually created ones. Also the distantly-supervised SVM models are not far behind the pattern-based solutions, showing the usefulness of this approach when the amount of annotated data is limited.","Mangnoesing, Gino V.

34748,Comparative Analysis of Time Series Databases in the Context of Edge Computing for Low Power Sensor Networks,2020-05-25,"Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is the task of identifying sentiment polarity of a text given another text segment or aspect. In ABSA, a text can have multiple sentiments depending upon each aspect. Aspect Term Sentiment Analysis (ATSA) is a subtask of ABSA, in which aspect terms are contained within the given sentence. Most of the existing approaches proposed for ATSA, incorporate aspect information through a different subnetwork thereby overlooking the advantage of aspect terms’ presence within the sentence. In this paper, we propose a model that leverages the positional information of the aspect. The proposed model introduces a decay mechanism based on position. This decay function mandates the contribution of input words for ABSA. The contribution of a word declines as farther it is positioned from the aspect terms in the sentence. The performance is measured on two standard datasets from SemEval 2014 Task 4. In comparison with recent architectures, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated.","Madasu, Avinash; Rao, Vijjini Anvesh",Natural Language Processing and Information Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298182/,751

For instance, during the 2005 London bombings, it was reported that evacuees helped injured persons to escape the place of danger. In terms of game theory, it can be understood that such helping behavior provides a collective good while it is a costly behavior because the volunteers spend extra time to assist the injured persons in case of emergency evacuations. In order to study the collective effects of helping behavior in emergency evacuations, we have performed numerical simulations of helping behavior among evacuees in a room evacuation scenario. Our simulation model is based on the volunteer’s dilemma game reflecting volunteering cost. The game theoretic model is coupled with a social force model to understand the relationship between the spatial and social dynamics of evacuation scenarios. By systematically changing the cost parameter of helping behavior, we observed different patterns of collective helping behaviors and these collective patterns are summarized with a phase diagram.","Kwak, Jaeyoung; Lees, Michael H.; Cai, Wentong; Ong, Marcus E.

The use of GPU parallelism accelerates the execution of RDP, but the recursive behavior and the dynamic size of the generated sub-tasks, requires adapting the algorithm to use the GPU resources efficiently. While previous research approaches propose the exploitation of task-based parallelism, our research advocates a general fine-grained solution, which avoids the dynamic and recursive execution of kernels. The segmentation of depth images, a typical application used on autonomous driving, reaches speeds of almost 1000 frames per second for typical workloads using our massively parallel proposal on low-consumption, embedded GPUs.

The actual reconstruction of neutrino events in the GeV range is computationally challenging due to the scarcity of data produced by single events. This can lead to run times of several weeks for the state-of-the-art reconstruction method – Pegleg – on CPUs for typical workloads of many ten-thousand events. We propose a GPU version of Pegleg that probes the likelihood space with several hypotheses in parallel while adapting the amount of parallel sampled hypotheses dynamically in order to reduce computation time significantly.

During this step a significant loss of information occurs and the use of inappropriate thresholding methods may cause difficulties in further shape analysis or even make it impossible to recognize different shapes of objects or characters. Some of the most typical applications utilizing the analysis of binary images are Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), which may also be applied for unevenly illuminated natural images, as well as for challenging degraded historical document images, considered as typical benchmarking tools for image binarization algorithms. To face the still valid challenge of relatively fast and simple, but robust binarization of degraded document images, a novel two-step algorithm utilizing initial thresholding, based on the modelling of the simplified image histogram using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Monte Carlo method, is proposed in the paper. This approach can be considered as the extension of recently developed image preprocessing method utilizing Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD), based on the assumption of its similarity to the histograms of ground truth binary images distorted by Gaussian noise. The processing time of the first step, producing the intermediate images with partially removed background information, may be significantly reduced due to the use of the Monte Carlo method. The proposed improved approach leads to even better results, not only for well-known DIBCO benchmarking databases, but also for more demanding Bickley Diary dataset, allowing the use of some well-known classical binarization methods, including the global ones, in the second step of the algorithm.","Krupiński, Robert; Lech, Piotr; Okarma, Krzysztof",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302549/,751
34923,Fusion Learning: A One Shot Federated Learning,2020-05-22,"Genetic learning particle swarm optimization (GL-PSO) is a hybrid optimization method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). The GL-PSO method improves the performance of PSO by constructing superior exemplars from which individuals of the population learn to move in the search space. However, in case of complex optimization problems, GL-PSO exhibits problems to maintain appropriate diversity, which leads to weakening an exploration and premature convergence. This makes the results of this method not satisfactory. In order to enhance the diversity and adaptability of GL-PSO, and as an effect of its performance, in this paper, a new modified genetic learning method with interlaced ring topology and flexible local search operator has been proposed. To assess the impact of the introduced modifications on performance of the proposed method, an interlaced ring topology has been integrated with GL-PSO only (referred to as GL-PSOI) as well as with a flexible local search operator (referred to as GL-PSOIF). The new strategy was tested on a set of benchmark problems and a CEC2014 test suite.

Current methods assume fixed travel time between any pairs, thus the efficiency of these approaches is limited because the travel time in reality can dynamically change due to factors including the weather conditions, the traffic conditions, the time of the day and the day of the week, etc. To address this dynamic situation, we propose a novel two-stage approach to find the shortest route. Firstly deep learning is utilised to predict the travel time between a pair of origin and destination. Weather conditions are added into the input data to increase the accuracy of travel time predicition. Secondly, a customised Memetic Algorithm is developed to find shortest route using the predicted travel time. The proposed memetic algorithm uses genetic algorithm for exploration and local search for exploiting the current search space around a given solution. The effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method is evaluated based on the New York City taxi benchmark dataset.

The main feature of the proposed strategy is using Bézier surfaces for global modeling of inclusions. Polygonal inclusions are defined by bilinear surfaces, while others by bicubic surfaces. It is beneficial over other numerical methods (such as FEM and BEM) due to the lack of discretization. Integration over inclusions defined by surfaces is also performed globally without division into subareas. The considered problem is solved iteratively in order to simulate different material properties by applying initial stresses within the inclusion. This way of solving avoids increasing the number of unknowns and can also be used for elasto-plastic problems without significant changes. Some numerical tests are presented, in which the results obtained are compared with those calculated by other numerical methods.","Bołtuć, Agnieszka; Zieniuk, Eugeniusz; Szerszeń, Krzysztof; Kużelewski, Andrzej",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302805/,751

Existing approaches involve the application of either time-consuming model reduction techniques or resource-demanding statistical approaches. Such requirements prevent any opportunistic model exploration, e.g., exploring various scenarios on environmental models. This limits the ability to analyse new models for scientists, to support trade-off analysis for decision-makers and to empower the general public towards informed environmental intelligence. In this paper, we present a new approximate computing technique, aka. loop aggregation, which consists in automatically reducing the main loop of a simulation model by aggregating the corresponding spatial or temporal data. We apply this approximate scientific computing approach on a geophysical model of a hydraulic simulation with various input data. The experimentation demonstrates the ability to drastically decrease the simulation time while preserving acceptable results with a minimal set-up.

In this paper, we propose hashing based prediction, a fast kernel prediction algorithm leveraging hash technique. The algorithm samples a small subset from the input dataset through the locality-sensitive hashing method and computes prediction value approximately using the subset. Hashing based prediction has the minimum time complexity compared to the state-of-art kernel machine prediction approaches. We further present a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm showing that it can keep comparable accuracy. Experiment results on most commonly used large-scale datasets, even with million-level data points, show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-art kernel prediction methods in time cost while maintaining satisfactory accuracy.","Lu, Lijing; Yin, Rong; Liu, Yong; Wang, Weiping",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302813/,751

34968,Interval Methods for Seeking Fixed Points of Recurrent Neural Networks,2020-05-22,"Anti-tracking network plays an important role in protection of network users’ identities and communication privacy. Confronted with the frequent network attacks or infiltration to anti-tracking network, a robust and destroy-resistant network topology is an important prerequisite to maintain the stability and security of anti-tracking network. From the aspects of network stability, network resilience and destroy-resistance, we propose the convex-polytope topology (CPT) applied in the anti-tracking network. CPT has three main advantages: (1) CPT can easily avoid the threat of key nodes and cut vertices to network structure; (2) Even the nodes could randomly join in or quit the network, CPT can easily keep the network topology in stable structure without the global view of network; (3) CPT can easily achieve the self-optimization of network topology. Anti-tracking network based on CPT can achieve the self-maintenance and self-optimization of its network topology. We compare CPT with other methods of topology optimization. From the experimental results, CPT has better robustness, resilience and destroy-resistance confronted with dynamically changed topology, and performs better in the efficiency of network self-optimization.","Tian, Changbo; Zhang, Yongzheng; Yin, Tao",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302821/,751
34979,Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Using Simulated Quantum Annealing,2020-05-25,"Reversible circuits are one of the technologies that can provide future low energy circuits. The synthesis of an optimal reversible circuit for a given function is an np-hard problem. The meta-heuristic approaches are one of the most promising methods for these types of optimization problems. In this paper, a new approach for ACO reversible synthesis is presented. Usually, authors build an ACO system with the use of truth table or permutation representation of the reversible function. In this work, a Walsh spectral representation of a Boolean function is used. This allows dividing search spaces into smaller “promising” areas with well-defined transition operations between them. As a result, we can minimize the enormous search space and generate better solutions than obtained by ACO synthesis with classical reversible function representation. The proposed approach was applied to benchmark reversible functions of 4,5 and 6 variables and compared to other meta-heuristic results and best-known solutions.","Podlaski, Krzysztof",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302832/,751

Unfortunately, all proposed up to now frameworks capable of estimating the contamination source localization based on recorded by the sensors network the substance concentrations are not able to work in real-time. The reason is the significant computational time required by the applied dispersion models. In such reconstruction systems, the parameters of the given dispersion model are sampled to fit the model output to the registrations; thus, the dispersion model is run tens of thousands of times. In this paper, we test the possibility of training an artificial neural network (ANN) to effectively simulate the atmospheric toxin transport in the highly urbanized area. The use of a fast neural network in place of computationally costly dispersion models in systems localizing the source of contamination can enable its fast response time. As a training domain, we have chosen the center of London, as it was used in the DAPPLE field experiment. The training dataset is generated by the Quick Urban & Industrial Complex (QUIC) Dispersion Modeling System. To achieve the ANN capable of estimating the contaminant concentration, we tested various ANN structures, i.e., numbers of ANN layers, neurons, and activation functions. The performed tests confirm that trained ANN has the potential to replace the dispersion model in the contaminant source localization systems.","Wawrzynczak, Anna; Berendt-Marchel, Monika",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302839/,751

The packing problem to be solved corresponds to a two-dimensional packing of convex-shape polygons and is based on the locus operation used for the advancing front approach. Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, we decided to restrain the polygon rotation in the packing process. Three heuristics are presented to simplify the packing problem: density heuristic, gravity heuristic and the multi-layer packing. The decision made by those three heuristic are prioritizing on minimizing the area, inserting polygons on the minimum Y coordinate and pack polygons in multiple layers dividing the input in multiple lists, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the generated meshes by solving a diffusion problem, where the discretized domain consisted in polygons and spaces with different conductivities. Due to the arbitrary shape of polygons and spaces that are generated by the packing algorithm, the virtual element method was used to solve the diffusion problem numerically.","Torres, Joaquí­n; Hitschfeld, Nancy; Ruiz, Rafael O.; Ortiz-Bernardin, Alejandro",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302853/,751
35013,A Simple Stochastic Process Model for River Environmental Assessment Under Uncertainty,2020-05-25,"The paper highlights a lifetime experience of knowledge gained through interactions with Professor Hung T. Nguyen and the profound impact he has made in advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling, simulating, and understanding the dynamics of uncertain systems. His seminal works on Random Fuzzy Sets have (a) significantly impacted our perceptions of seeking methods and approaches to acquire and assimilate data or information from uncertain sources, (b) enhanced our understanding to develop strategies for deep learning the interconnections, implications, and consequences, thereby allowing the processing of data to its logical conclusions and (c) has infinitely broadened the horizon towards conceiving machine-based decision-making architectures that optimize our perceived understanding to build systems that can mimic human decision-making capabilities. These three universal attributes fit the breadth and scope of Soft Computing. The paper focuses on three distinct topics wherein we explore human perceptions that merge the conscious attributes combining facts, myths, traditions, culture, beliefs, and a sense of reasoning towards a higher level of consciousness, and provides avenues for their adoption and physical realizations. The first topic discusses the possibilities of harvesting vast amounts of hydrokinetic energy from low-head flows in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The Mekong River has a perceived power potential of between 50 and 70 Gigawatts (GW). The reality is only one-quarter of the perceived power is plausible for harvesting. We discuss the possibility of transforming existing concrete structures across the arteries and tributaries of the Mekong River in the Delta Region to mini-hydropower plants. One example shows the possibilities of harvesting up to 250 KW at an existing structure that can serve the energy needs of local businesses involved in aquaculture, local commerce, and residential needs. Since recognizing conventional hydropower is ecologically damaging, Vietnam has focused its energy policy solely on Solar and Wind, which are 3–4 times higher in cost than Water. Low-head energy, which is currently unused, could be perceived as a significant contributor to the renewable energy portfolio for Vietnam. The second topic discusses the possibility for Ayurvedic medicine, an ancient Indian practice of herbal medicine, as a complementary form of medication compared to modern medicine. The Tulsi plant is recognized for its life-saving properties that make Hindus believe it is a Holy plant. Scientific observations have shown the plant can produce substantial amounts of pure Oxygen by absorbing carbon dioxide from the ambient. Research has also shown that Tulsi can absorb fluorides from water. The discussions highlight the adoption of Ayurvedic medicine based on historical and traditional beliefs that Nature grown ingredients can induce natural body responses that aid in recovery from illnesses. Ayurvedic medicine exploits the power of the mind based on beliefs and traditions as a means for healing from illnesses. Finally, the third topic is a search for the meaning to the phrase “Pointing the finger at the Moon,” and leading to the discovery of a three-dimensional holographic image on the Moon. The discovery sheds light on a long-standing question of what The Buddha was pointing to on the Moon. Historical background based on art is combined with basic Moon facts and a sense of geometry to uncover a three-dimensional holographic image that symbolizes Gautama Buddha’s path to enlightenment. The form is identified as Abhaya Mudra, the Fearless Form. Among the many forms displayed in Buddhist sculptures of the meditation posture, the Abhaya Mudra is significant as it is a gesture for tolerance, fearlessness, and compassion. In Buddhist philosophy, the attributes of intolerance, fearfulness, and hatred are erased from the human mind through detachment.","Prasad, Nadipuram R.","Statistical and Fuzzy Approaches to Data Processing, with Applications to Econometrics and Other Areas",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302926/,751

Among these problems, in Brazil, the lack of a transparent, formal and standardized mental health information model stands out, thus hindering the generation of knowledge, which directly influences the quality of the mental healthcare services provided to the population. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a computational ontology to serve as a common knowledge base among those involved in this domain, to make inferences about treatments, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention methods, helping health professionals in clinical decisions. To do this, we initially carried out a literature review involving scientific papers and the most current WHO guidelines on mental health, later we transferred this knowledge to a formal computational model, building the proposed ontology. Also, the Hermit Reasoner inference engine was used to deduce facts and legitimize the consistency of the logic rules assigned to the model. Hence, it was possible to develop a semantic computational artifact for storage and generate knowledge to assist mental health professionals in clinical decisions.","Yamada, Diego Bettiol; Bernardi, Filipe Andrade; Miyoshi, Newton Shydeo Brandão; de Lima, Inácia Bezerra; Vinci, André Luiz Teixeira; Yoshiura, Vinicius Tohoru; Alves, Domingos",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303686/,751

For example the distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack introduces an excessive traffic load to a web server to make it unusable. A popular method for detecting attacks is to use the sequence of source IP addresses to detect possible anomalies. With the aim of predicting the next IP address, the Probability Density Function of the IP address sequence is estimated. Prediction of source IP address in the future access to the server is meant to detect anomalous requests. In other words, during an access to the server, only predicted IP addresses are permitted and all others are blocked. The approaches used to estimate the Probability Density Function of IP addresses range from the sequence of IP addresses seen previously and stored in a database to address clustering, normally used by combining the K-Means algorithm. Instead, in this paper we consider the sequence of IP addresses as a numerical sequence and develop the nonlinear analysis of the numerical sequence. We used nonlinear analysis based on Volterra’s Kerners and Hammerstein’s models. The experiments carried out with datasets of source IP address sequences show that the prediction errors obtained with Hammerstein models are smaller than those obtained both with the Volterra Kernels and with the sequence clustering by means of the K-Means algorithm.","Cuzzocrea, Alfredo; Mumolo, Enzo; Fadda, Edoardo; Tessarotto, Marco",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975372/,751

Improve the accuracy of pedestrian positioning is a key research issue. In order to solve the problem that the indoor and outdoor pedestrian navigation is not continuous and the accuracy is low, a pedestrian seamless navigation and positioning method based on BDS/GPS/IMU is proposed. In outdoor environment, in order to improve the availability of dynamic positioning when the single-system observation geometry is not ideal, the key techniques such as the differential coordinates and time benchmark in BDS/GPS positioning are studied, and a method of eliminating time difference by the independent combination difference in the system is proposed. This method simplifies the operation steps and overcomes the current compatible positioning difficulties without the time difference between BDS and GPS. It can be seen that the more the number of visible satellites, the better the space geometric distribution. In the combined positioning experiment results of BDS and GPS, the number of visual satellites are about 6–8 when GPS is used alone. When using the combined system, the number of visible satellites increased to about 16. The increase in the number of visible satellites greatly improves the observation geometry. For the Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP), the maximum PDOP of the dual system is 2.7, which is significantly lower than that of the single system, and the observation geometry performance is greatly improved. In the effective positioning time, for BDS/GPS, the positioning accuracy of elevation (U) direction is better than 4 cm, and the positioning accuracy of North (N) and East (E) direction is better than 2 cm. Based on the analysis of pedestrian gait characteristics, a multi-condition constrained zero-velocity detection algorithm is proposed. For the error of the inertial sensor error is accumulated over the time, the zero velocity update (ZUPT) algorithm is implemented to correct the cumulative errors by using to the designed extended Kalman filter (EKF) with the velocity and angular velocity information as the measurements. The results show that the accuracy of dual-mode positioning system of BDS compatible with GPS is better than the single-mode GPS positioning, the outdoor position accuracy can reach centimeter level, and under ZUPT compensation the indoor error ratio is 1%, which can achieve more accurate pedestrian seamless navigation.","Wang, Kailong; Li, Huixia; Guo, Hang",Multimedia Technology and Enhanced Learning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991395/,751

50663,Implementing Grover Oracles for Quantum Key Search on AES and LowMC,2020-03-25,"There have been growing concerns in Nepal and other South Asian less developed countries (LDCs) with the acceleration of global environment changes due to continuing increases in greenhouse gas emissions and accelerated deforestation rates. Available literature on forestry’s dilemmas reveals that, except for the extreme temperature, moisture, and nutrient deficient situations, vegetation can (a) efficiently conserve elevated atmospheric carbon; (b) use the absorbed carbon in biomass production through the process of photosynthesis; and (c) if properly managed, can help to boost gross and net primary productivity of an ecosystem while mitigating global climate change. Within Nepal, conservationists, scientists, and administrators have expressed growing concerns about the rapid deterioration of the Himalayan environment because of deforestation, landslide increases, and large-scale downstream flooding. These processes are frequently linked together into a wide-ranging cause-and-effect drama of the Himalayan Degradation. Effective management of forest resources is considered one of the solutions to ameliorating environmental and land degradations. Recent Nepal’s government statistics show that Nepal’s total forest area has increased from 29 to 44%; however, forests are constantly facing new socio-environmental pressures from the growing population and from bulldozer-based development. Further complicating this issue, the statistics on Nepal’s forests have been disputed by various scholars. Nonetheless, through a set of policies, Nepal has been actively involved in the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, Plus Related Pro-forest Activities) programs since 2009 involving local communities to conserve and manage existing forests and creating new forest on non-forested lands through afforestation programs. If applied effectively, the full range of REDD+ activities can turn forests from a source of global warming emissions into a counteracting “sink.” REDD+’s incentives in the form of carbon fund allocations and can act as a development catalyzer, involving many communities in greening the denuded lands of Nepal while also generating employment opportunities at local grass-root levels. Government agencies, many private organizations, religious institutions, and over 22,266 community forestry user groups have been involved in the management of Nepal’s forests, and their activities are contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions through forest conservation as well as deriving economic benefits to local communities. Though mountainous Nepal contributes merely 0.027% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, it unwillingly exports top fertile soils along the rivers flowing down steep to very steep gradients. Sedimentation from Nepal’s Himalayan region often clogs rivers and canals along the Indo-Gangetic belt and causes massive floods in the Indian state of Bihar before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Participatory natural resource management and the ecosystem services concept proposed in this chapter—which have been instrumental across many South Asian, European, and North American countries in claiming degraded lands and mutually benefitting the upstream and downstream communities—could be instrumental in the restoration and management of degraded ecosystems in various parts of Nepal. We propose such a concept to solve the ongoing problems of land degradation of the Churia Range of Nepal. We have divided the entire Churia and corresponding Tarai-Madhesh regions into 91 watersheds and recast them as the operational service providing units (SPUs) for handling this deforestation dilemma. There are several sub-SPUs within SPUs, serving local communities. It is hoped that with the delineation of SPUs and sub-SPUs, it will be possible to make individual households living within the watersheds responsible for managing their lands and forest resources of their territories and creating an environment of communalism where both upstream and downstream communities will benefit in this “win-win” environmental scenario. The woodlots and vegetated areas that the households living within SPU and sub-SPUs manage will provide a wide range of ecosystem services to the downstream communities. In turn, the upstream communities will benefit from the downstream communities and REDD+’s incentives programs while also ameliorating the global climate from carbon sequestration. The upstream communities benefit from grant money or development funds granted from the government. The government might increase nominal revenue on the farmlands of downstream communities for the regulated ecosystem services from upstream communities. Revenues paid to the government by the downstream communities can be redirected as the government grants money to upstream communities to further improve the ecosystem services to the downstream communities. Properly identifying, assessing, and valuing natural resources and ecosystem services within SPUs and sub-SPUs will help in the management of natural resources in various ways. One such approach proposed here is the prioritization of SPU’s management options by assessing the trade-offs in ecosystem services and developing resilient communities who will eventually contribute to the sustainable management of available resources while contributing to the mitigation of global climate changes. Different computer-based models along with this chapter will help local communities to assess their benefits from each SPU or sub-SPU and change their course of actions in the future.","Bhattarai, Keshav; Conway, Dennis",Contemporary Environmental Problems in Nepal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991407/,751
50664,Lightweight Authenticated Encryption Mode Suitable for Threshold Implementation,2020-03-25,"In view of the low recall of the traditional network text data classification algorithm, an artificial intelligence based network text data classification algorithm is designed. Before feature extraction, text information is preprocessed first, and word stem is extracted from English. Because there is no inherent space between Chinese words, word segmentation is carried out to complete the preprocessing of network text data. On this basis, an evaluation function is constructed to evaluate each feature item in the input space independently, and to reduce the dimension of the features of the network text data. Finally, the artificial intelligence method is used to classify the network text data, and the most similar training text is found through similarity measurement in the network text data training set. The experimental results show that the designed algorithm based on artificial intelligence has higher recall than the traditional algorithm, and can meet the needs of network text data classification.","Kang, Ying-jian; Ma, Lei",Multimedia Technology and Enhanced Learning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991408/,751
50665,Private Aggregation from Fewer Anonymous Messages,2020-03-25,"First open to the outside world after the 1950s, Nepal has passed through different phases of economic development. It has advanced from a mixed type (1951–1980) to a fully liberal economy since the 1980s. However, the liberal economic policy prescribed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank has not only widened income inequality and disparity in resource sharing but has also made the economy very competitive and beyond the accessible limit to millions of low-income people. Trade deficits have increased, and many old industries that were established with the help of donors and lending agencies have been closed because of their inabilities to compete in the international markets. The disparity has been so extreme that the top 20% richest individuals control over 54% of the resources and the poorest 20% of the population has access to only 4% of the resources. Despite Nepal’s geographic location between two Asian economic giants (China and India), Nepal is yet to establish itself as a land-linked country from its current landlocked status and to rip benefits from its geostrategic location. Instead, Nepal has encountered economic blockades twice within the past three decades from its southern neighbor—India. Since the 2015–2016 economic blockade, Nepal’s focus has been shifted towards its northern neighbor, China, a deviation from century long special relationships with India. Nepal experienced severe political upheavals due to the Maoist insurgency between 1996 and 2006. During this period, a large portion of the development budget was funneled to security spending, fully jeopardizing its economy and making millions of working-age people jobless. Historically, many countries either directly or through thousands of I/NGOs have found Nepal a political laboratory; this practice proliferated very quickly after the Maoist insurgency in Nepal either in the form of human rights or in various pretexts. Some I/NGOs found Nepal a favorite place for proselytizing people into Christian faiths in the pretext of social upward mobility of poor, especially the lower-caste Dalits. Despite the claim of poverty reduction from 45% in 1985 to 15% in 2011, the widening gap between the rich and poor has made life harder for low-income people. Almost 8 million working-age people have emigrated to various countries in search of jobs to remit money back to their families; however, many are returning home in boxes. Within Nepal, due to unplanned bulldozer engineering in the name of road and other developments while ignoring the land capability classes, millions of people have become development victims because of resulting landslides, floods, and other natural and mad-made calamities. In a seismically sensitive landscape, unplanned development has induced more inequality than ever before. Political leaders representing frontier areas (less developed areas) have undertaken various construction projects including the construction of roads. Road connectivity is a good step for development, but unplanned land excavation in the name of road construction, irrespective of the land capability, not only has created numerous environmental problems and rendered households homeless. The unplanned development approach has also aggravated rural communities from a self-sustained livelihood tradition with organic agricultural products to a dependent culture of consuming imported food products. Many productive farmlands are plotted for settlements, while others are left fallow that were previously used for organic farming. Ecosystem services are severely degraded. In order to improve the economy, bring the emigrated Nepali working-age people back home to restore the degraded environment; Nepal has a few options. These include but are not limited to (a) consolidation of fragmented farmlands; (b) providing incentives to utilize farmlands that have been left fallow and re-initiate organic farming on them; (c) creating favorable environments for foreign direct investment (FDI) and establishing various industrial estates; (d) producing electricity from available hydro resources; (e) regulating developmental activities based on land capability classes and making them environmentally friendly; (f) commoditizing resources of the mountain and undulated terrain to promote ecotourism; and (g) linking southern and northern neighbors with electric railways making Nepal a land-linked instead of a landlocked country. These steps might help not only reviving the currently distorted social fabric and restoring ecosystem services, but they may also help improve the Nepali economy.","Bhattarai, Keshav; Conway, Dennis",Contemporary Environmental Problems in Nepal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991410/,751

This article aims to develop some strategies in dealing with COVID-19 epidemic to prevent nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of health care workforce and employees. METHODS This is a prospectively registered and retrospective descriptive study investigating the clinical characteristics, results of diagnostic tests, and patients' disposition from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, at a tertiary medical center in Northern Taiwan. RESULTS There is no nosocomial spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in our facility. The following strategies were followed: information transparency, epidemic prevention resources planning by authorities, multidisciplinary cooperation, informative technologies, immigration quarantine policies, travel restrictions, management of diversion/subdivision, self-health monitoring, social distancing, screening of travel, occupation, contact, and cluster (TOCC) history, traffic control bundling (TCB), training of using personal protective equipment, real-name visiting management, and employee care. The patients' basic characteristics and diagnostic results were gathered. Of the 3,832 cases, about 25.9% had travel history. Most of them were traveling to Asia (419 persons/time, 10.9%) and from China (256 persons/time, 6.7%). Meanwhile, health care personnel accounted for 316 persons/time (8.3%) and cleaning personnel, 6 persons/time (0.16%). The 36 cases who care or contact with confirmed cases have negative results from the COVID-19 test. The most frequent symptoms were fever and upper respiratory infection followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION The above strategies were followed. Patients were stratified based on the risk of TOCC history assessment to ensure safety of health care personnel and patients' appropriate and timely medical services.","Lan, Kai-Ping; Hsu, Yueh-Shuang; Chang, Ching-I; Wei, Pi-Ching; Guo, Ti-Gen; Yen, David Hung-Tsang; Hsu, Teh-Fu; Tzeng, Yuann-Meei; Ming, Jin-Lain",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33871390/,751
176834,Applying a Probabilistic Infection Model for studying contagion processes in contact networks,2021,"The declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic led to the closures of schools worldwide to contain disease spread. In the present study, we examine the effects of this mandated homeschooling on parents’ mental health and substance use. In a study of 758 couples, 211 of whom were homeschooling, we contrasted homeschooling effects on general mental health (anxiety and depression) and on COVID-specific mental health (socioeconomic and traumatic stress), and on optimism. We also examined effects on coping-related use of alcohol and cannabis. Actor–partner interdependence model results demonstrated negative impacts of mandatory homeschooling;there were significantly lower levels of optimism and greater use of cannabis to cope and marginally higher use of alcohol to cope in couples who were versus were not homeschooling. These levels were higher than prepandemic norms. We then explored the parenting dynamic through actor and partner effects. Among homeschooling families, more time spent homeschooling was associated with increased anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-specific socioeconomic and traumatic stress in the homeschooling parent;for the homeschooler’s partner, there was significantly increased alcohol use to cope and marginally increased traumatic stress. These findings highlight the need for the design and delivery of educational and mental health supports for parents during mandatory homeschooling required for COVID-19 and other pandemics—so that parents can best support their families through these uncertain times.

216408,Learning Ability and Supporting Capacity of Online Learning In Students during Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: For patients with COVID-19, pneumothorax and hydrothorax are suggested to be negative prognostic indicators. However, the management of these two conditions has rarely been discussed. We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of pleural drainage in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 17 pleural drainages were performed in 11 critically ill patients with pneumothorax or hydrothorax. Either chest tubes or central venous catheters (CVCs) were used. The clinical outcomes, including respiratory and circulation indicators at 24 h and 1 h before the procedure and 24 h and 48 h after the procedure, were retrospectively recorded. RESULTS: (1) Following pleural drainage, there was a 19.1% improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio from 147.4 mmHg (-1 h) to 175.5 mmHg (24 h), while the mean positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreased from 10.7 cmH2O (-1 h) to 8.9 cmH2O (24 h) and 8.1 cmH2O (48 h). The A-a gradients decreased from 313.3 mmHg (-1 h) to 261.3 mmHg (24 h). (2) The dosage of norepinephrine increased from 0.15 µg/kg/min (-1 h) to 0.40 µg/kg/min (24 h). (3) No haemorrhagic or infectious complications were observed. (4) A total of 41.6% of CVCs were partially or fully obstructed, while no chest tubes were obstructed. CONCLUSION: For critically ill patients with COVID-19, pleural drainage leads to a significant improvement in oxygenation and gas exchange, but the deterioration of circulation is not reversed. It is safe to perform pleural drainage even though anticoagulation therapy and glucocorticoids are widely used. Chest tubes rather than CVCs are recommended.","Xu, Yuan; Li, Shanqing; Liu, Hongsheng",Heart Lung,,751
229642,Seven days in medicine: 10-16 February 2021,2021,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes continuous, significant damage to the swine industry worldwide. By RT-PCR-based methods, this study demonstrated the ongoing presence of PEDV in pigs of all ages in Korea at the average detection rate of 9.92%. By the application of Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, it was found that the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PEDV could evolve at similar rates to the spike (S) gene at the order of 10-4 substitutions/site/year. Based on branching patterns of PEDV strains, three main N gene-base genogroups (N1, N2, and N3) and two sub-genogroups (N3a, N3b) were proposed in this study. By analyzing the antigenic index, possible antigenic differences also emerged in both the spike and nucleocapsid proteins between the three genogroups. The antigenic indexes of genogroup N3 strains were significantly lower compared with those of genogroups N1 and N2 strains in the B-cell epitope of the nucleocapsid protein. Similarly, significantly lower antigenic indexes in some parts of the B-cell epitope sequences of the spike protein (COE, S1D, and 2C10) were also identified. PEDV mutants derived from genetic mutations of the S and N genes may cause severe damage to swine farms by evading established host immunities.","Kim, Sung-Jae; Nguyen, Van-Giap; Huynh, Thi-My-Le; Park, Yong-Ho; Park, Bong-Kyun; Chung, Hee-Chun",Viruses,,751
232957,Regional Head Communication Patterns on Social Media in Handling the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in China has influenced every aspect of life worldwide. Given the unique characteristics of the dental setting, the risk of cross-infection between dental practitioners and patients is high in the absence of adequate protective measures, and dentists may develop severe anxiety in relation to the current pandemic. The limited provision of services and widespread closure of dental practices have raised concerns among dental professionals about the financial impact. The present study assessed the frequency of dental practice closure during the pandemic's first wave in several countries and whether closures and their associated factors differ between the private and non-private sectors. METHODS: An electronic cross-sectional survey questionnaire was sent to dentists in several countries, from April to May 2020. The survey assessed professional, practice related and country-level structural factors elucidating the reason for practice closure. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the association between practice closure and these factors, and differences were evaluated by sector type. RESULTS: Dentists from 29 countries (n = 3243) participated in this study. Most of the participants (75.9%) reported practice closure with significantly higher percentage in the private sector than the non-private sector. Greater pandemic-related fears were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of practice closure in the private (odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 1.92) and non-private (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.04, 1.82) sectors. Dentists in non-private rural areas (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.42, 0.81), and those in hospitals (overall OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.36, 0.99) reported a low likelihood of closure. A high likelihood of closure was reported by dentists in the academia (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.23, 3.71). More hospital beds at the country-level were associated with a lower likelihood of closure in the non-private sector (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.46, 0.91). Private- sector dentists in high- income countries (HICs) reported fewer closures than those in non-HICs (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.15, 1.93). CONCLUSIONS: Most dentists reported practice closure because of COVID-19, and greater impacts were reported in the private sector than in the non-private sector.

358046,Effects of ICT Application (Information Communication and Technology) Towards the Transformation of Regional Bureaucracy,2021,"Cognitive dysfunctions, including impaired attention, learning, memory, planning and problem solving, occur in depressive episodes, often persist during remission, predict relapse, worsen with recurrent episodes, and are not treated by current antidepressants or other medications. Cognitive symptoms are also present in other psychiatric disorders, are a hallmark of aging, and define several late-life disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. This pervasive occurrence suggests either a non-specific outcome of a diseased brain, or a shared underlying pathology contributing to this symptom dimension. Recent findings suggest a role for altered GABAergic inhibition in cognitive symptoms. Cellular, molecular and biochemical studies in human subjects report changes affecting the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) system, specifically somatostatin-expressing (SST+) GABAergic interneurons, across brain disorders and during aging. SST+ neurons gate excitatory input onto pyramidal neurons within cortical microcircuits. Experimentally reducing the function of these neurons affects excitatory signal-to-noise ratio, reduces synchronized cellular and neural activity, and leads to cognitive dysfunctions. Conversely, augmenting SST+ cell post-synaptic &#945;5-GABA-A receptor activity has pro-cognitive efficacy in stress and aging models. Together, this suggests that reduced signaling of the SST+ neuron/&#945;5-GABA-A receptor pathway contributes to cognitive dysfunctions, and that it represents a novel therapeutic target for remediating mood and cognitive symptoms in depression, other psychiatric disorders and during aging.","Prévot, Thomas; Sibille, Etienne",Mol. psychiatry,,751

380751,A Social Media Mining Using Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis on Tourism in Malaysia During Covid19,2021,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have gained a key place in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) essentially because of their good safety profile even in the frail population. DPP-4, originally known as 'T-cell antigen CD26', is expressed in many immune cells and regulates their functions, so the initial concern over the use of DPP-4is was the possible increased susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, because of the high affinity between human DPP-4 and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it was suspected that this virus, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), might be able to use the DPP-4 enzyme as a functional receptor to gain entry into the host. However, DPP-4is also exert anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in patients exposed to cytokine storms due to COVID-19. Yet, when observational (mostly retrospective) studies compared clinical outcomes in DPP-4i users vs non-users among diabetes patients with COVID-19, the overall results regarding the risk of progression towards more severe forms of the disease and mortality were heterogeneous, thereby precluding any definite conclusions. Nevertheless, new expectations have arisen following recent reports of significant reductions in admissions to intensive care units and mortality in DPP-4i users. However, given the limitations inherent in such observational studies, any available results should be considered, at best, as hypothetical and only suggestive of potentially substantial benefits with DPP-4is in diabetes patients with COVID-19. While the safe use of DPP-4is in COVID-19 patients appears to be an acceptable hypothesis, all such positive findings still need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials (a few of which are currently ongoing) before any recommendations can be made for clinical practice.","Scheen, André J",Diabetes metab,,751

417444,ASSURE Research and Development: The Documentary Video of Reog Dance to Enhance Learning Outcomes in History Learning,2021,"The way infants learn language is a highly complex adaptive behavior. This behavior chiefly relies on the ability to extract information from the speech they hear and combine it with information from the external environment. Most theories assume that this ability critically hinges on the recognition of at least some syntactic structure. Here, we show that child-directed speech allows for semantic inference without relying on explicit structural information. We simulate the process of semantic inference with machine learning applied to large text collections of two different types of speech, child-directed speech versus adult-directed speech. Taking the core meaning of causality as a test case, we find that in child-directed speech causal meaning can be successfully inferred from simple co-occurrences of neighboring words. By contrast, semantic inference in adult-directed speech fundamentally requires additional access to syntactic structure. These results suggest that child-directed speech is ideally shaped for a learner who has not yet mastered syntactic structure.","You, Guanghao; Bickel, Balthasar; Daum, Moritz M; Stoll, Sabine",Sci Rep,,751
422340,U-radiomics for predicting survival of patients with COVID-19,2021,"Virtual screening of phytochemicals was performed through molecular docking, simulations, in silico ADMET and drug-likeness prediction to identify the potential hits that can inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the published literature on medicinal importance, 154 phytochemicals with analogous structure from limonoids and triterpenoids were selected to search potential inhibitors for the five therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), SGp-RBD (spike glycoprotein-receptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The in silico computational results revealed that the phytochemicals such as glycyrrhizic acid, limonin, 7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, maslinic acid, corosolic acid, obacunone and ursolic acid were found to be effective against the target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that these phytochemicals bind with the amino acid residues at the active site of the target proteins. Therefore, the core structure of these potential hits can be used for further lead optimization to design drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Also, the medicinal plants containing these phytochemicals like licorice, neem, tulsi, citrus and olives can be used to formulate suitable therapeutic approaches in traditional medicines.","Vardhan, Seshu; Sahoo, Suban K",Comput Biol Med,,751

482244,From chaos to a new norm: The Birmingham experience of restructuring the largest plastics department in the UK in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impacts of using face masks, hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals in combating the COVID-19 pandemic in India. We calibrate the proposed model to fit the four data sets, viz. data for the states of Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and overall India, and estimate the rate of infection of susceptible with symptomatic population and recovery rate of quarantined individuals. We also estimate basic reproduction number to illustrate the epidemiological status of the regions under study. Our simulations infer that the infective population will be on increasing curve for Maharashtra and India, and settling for Tamil Nadu and Delhi. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected individuals. Our results reveal that to curtail the disease burden in India, specific control strategies should be implemented effectively so that the basic reproduction number is decreased below unity. The three control strategies are shown to be important preventive measures to lower disease transmission rate. The model is further extended to its stochastic counterpart to encapsulate the variation or uncertainty observed in the disease transmissibility. We observe the variability in the infective population and found their distribution at certain fixed time, which shows that for small populations, the stochasticity will play an important role.","Srivastav, Akhil Kumar; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Srivastava, Prashant K; Ghosh, Mini; Kang, Yun",Math Biosci Eng,,751
501311,The perspective of geography education students on the implementation of online learning during covid-19 pandemic,2021,"We assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on code stroke activations in the emergency department, stroke unit admissions, and referrals to the stroke prevention clinic at London's regional stroke center, serving a population of 1.8 million in Ontario, Canada. We found a 20% drop in the number of code strokes in 2020 compared to 2019, immediately after the first cases of COVID-19 were officially confirmed. There were no changes in the number of stroke admissions and there was a 22% decrease in the number of clinic referrals, only after the provincial lockdown. Our findings suggest that the decrease in code strokes was mainly driven by patient-related factors such as fear to be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2, while the reduction in clinic referrals was largely explained by hospital policies and the Government lockdown.","Bres Bullrich, Maria; Fridman, Sebastian; Mandzia, Jennifer L; Mai, Lauren M; Khaw, Alexander; Vargas Gonzalez, Juan Camilo; Bagur, Rodrigo; Sposato, Luciano A",Can J Neurol Sci,,751

598011,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) neutralising antibodies in a high-risk human population, Morocco, November 2017 to January 2018",2019-11-28,"OBJECTIVES: The current COVID‐19 pandemic stresses an urgency to accelerate much needed health service reform. Rapid and courageous changes being made to address its immediate impact are demonstrating that the means and technology to enable new models of healthcare exist. For example, innovations such as electronic patient portals (ePortal) can facilitate: a) radical reform of out‐patient care; b) cost containment in the economically constrained aftermath of the pandemic; c) environmental sustainability by reduction of unnecessary journeys/transport. Herein the development of PiSCES, an ePortal to the Irish National Epilepsy Electronic Patient Record, is demonstrated. This project, which pre‐dates the COVID‐19 crisis, aims to facilitate better patient‐ and family‐centred epilepsy care. METHODS: A combination of ethnographic research, document analysis and joint application design sessions was used to elicit PiSCES requirements. From these, a specification of desired modules of functionality was established and guided the software development. RESULTS: PiSCES functional features include “My Epilepsy Care Summary”, “My Epilepsy Care Goals”, “My Epilepsy Clinic Letters”, “Help Us Measure Your Progress”, “Prepare For Your Clinic Visit”, “Information for Your Healthcare Provider”. The system provides people with epilepsy access to, and engages them as co‐authors of, their own medical record. It can promote improved patient‐clinician partnerships and facilitate patient self‐management. SIGNIFICANCE: In the aftermath of COVID‐19, it is highly unlikely that the healthcare sector will return to a “business as usual” way of delivering services. The pandemic is expected to accelerate adoption of innovations like PiSCES. It is therefore a catalyst for change that will deliver care that is more responsive to individual patient needs and preferences.","Power, Kevin; McCrea, Zita; White, Maire; Breen, Annette; Dunleavy, Brendan; O’Donoghue, Sean; Jacquemard, Tim; Lambert, Veronica; El‐Naggar, Hany; Delanty, Norman; Doherty, Colin; Fitzsimons, Mary",Epilepsia,https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668026/,751
668037,Pit latrines may be a potential risk in rural China and low-income countries when dealing with COVID-19,2020-10-29,"AIMS: To assess nurses' burnout and its association with their perceived quality of patient care and occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during COVID‐19. BACKGROUND: Burnout is a serious problem among nursing staff internationally with negative impacts on the quality of care and patient safety. METHODS: We conducted a cross‐sectional online study among 1,004 Iranian nurses through the convenience sampling technique. Data were collected using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, five items of questions related to self‐reported poor patient care quality and estimated occurrence of AEs. RESULTS: Prevalence of high burnout among nurses was 31.5%. The risk of AEs ranged from 26.1% to 71.7%. Self‐reported quality of patient care was found to be poor. A positive correlation was found between emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores and patient care quality, whereas a negative correlation was found between personal accomplishment scores and all poor care item scores. Depersonalization was found to increase the risk of the onset of all AEs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06–1.08). Also, Personal accomplishmentreduced the risk of occurrence of ‘medication errors’ (OR = 0.99) and the onset of ‘patient and their family verbal abuse’ (OR = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the hypothesis that a higher degree of burnout is correlated with a perceived higher number of AEs and reduced perceived patient care quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Reducing burnout among nurses through implementing interventions may be an effective strategy to enhance patient care quality and reduce the number of AEs in Iranian public hospitals. Therefore, in order to minimize work burnout, primary approaches include access to psychosocial support, including Web‐based services, psychological first aid, mental support hotlines and self‐care techniques during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Kakemam, Edris; Chegini, Zahra; Rouhi, Amin; Ahmadi, Forouzan; Majidi, Soheila",J Nurs Manag,https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966312/,751
