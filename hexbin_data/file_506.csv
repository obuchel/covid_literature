The role of autophagy in Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) infection is unknown. Here, we found that HSV-2 does not allow induction of an autophagic response to infection, but maintains basal autophagy levels mostly unchanged during productive infection. Thus, we investigated the importance of basal autophagy for HSV-2 infection, using pharmacological autophagy suppression or cells genetically deficient in an autophagy-essential gene (ATG5). Interference with basal autophagy flux in cells significantly reduced viral replication and diminished the infection. These results indicate that basal autophagy plays an indispensable role required for a productive infection. Importantly, this study draws a sharp distinction between induced and basal autophagy, where the former acts as a viral clearance mechanism abrogating infection, while the latter supports infection.","Yakoub, Abraam M.; Shukla, Deepak",Sci Rep,506,28
3207,3207,3207,Therapeutic Potential of Annexin A1 in Ischemia Reperfusion Injury,11.157713,6.8826427,2018-04-16,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the world. Increased inflammation and an enhanced thrombotic milieu represent two major complications of CVD, which can culminate into an ischemic event. Treatment for these life-threatening complications remains reperfusion and restoration of blood flow. However, reperfusion strategies may result in ischemia–reperfusion injury (I/RI) secondary to various cardiovascular pathologies, including myocardial infarction and stroke, by furthering the inflammatory and thrombotic responses and delivering inflammatory mediators to the affected tissue. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) and its mimetic peptides are endogenous anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators, known to have significant effects in resolving inflammation in a variety of disease models. Mounting evidence suggests that AnxA1, which interacts with the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family, may have a significant role in mitigating I/RI associated complications. In this review article, we focus on how AnxA1 plays a protective role in the I/R based vascular pathologies.","Ansari, Junaid; Kaur, Gaganpreet; Gavins, Felicity N. E.",Int J Mol Sci,506,1

Here, we describe the in vivo variability and evolution of the BK polyomavirus by deep sequencing. Our data reveal the highest genomic evolutionary rate described in double-stranded DNA viruses, i.e., 10(−3)–10(−5) substitutions per nucleotide site per year. High mutation rates in viruses allow their escape from immune surveillance and adaptation to new hosts. By combining mutational landscapes across viral genomes with in silico prediction of viral peptides, we demonstrate the presence of significantly more coding substitutions within predicted cognate HLA-C-bound viral peptides than outside. This finding suggests a role for HLA-C in antiviral immunity, perhaps through the action of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. The present study provides a comprehensive view of viral evolution and immune escape in a DNA virus.","Domingo-Calap, Pilar; Schubert, Benjamin; Joly, Mélanie; Solis, Morgane; Untrau, Meiggie; Carapito, Raphael; Georgel, Philippe; Caillard, Sophie; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Paul, Nicodème; Kohlbacher, Oliver; González-Candelas, Fernando; Bahram, Seiamak",PLoS Pathog,506,1

The Pepitope server is a web-based tool that aims at predicting discontinuous epitopes based on a set of peptides that were affinity-selected against a monoclonal antibody of interest. The server implements three different algorithms for epitope mapping: PepSurf, Mapitope, and a combination of the two. The rationale behind these algorithms is that the set of peptides mimics the genuine epitope in terms of physicochemical properties and spatial organization. When the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the antigen is known, the information in these peptides can be used to computationally infer the corresponding epitope. A user-friendly web interface and a graphical tool that allows viewing the predicted epitopes were developed. Pepitope can also be applied for inferring other types of protein–protein interactions beyond the immunological context, and as a general tool for aligning linear sequences to a 3D structure.

We evaluated outcomes of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) in 56 pediatric lymphoma patients. Patients received nitrosourea (51 BCNU; 5 ACNU), etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (BEC; AEC). Median age at HDC/auto-SCT was 12 years (range 2–17 years). Forty-four patients underwent HDC/auto-SCT because they did not achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy. Eight patients showed relapse and four NK/T-cell lymphoma patients also underwent HDC/auto-SCT. BCNU pneumonitis was diagnosed in nine (16.0%) patients. Eight (14.3%) relapsed after HDC/auto-SCT. Treatment-related mortality occurred in three cases.

From 1026 stool specimens of children with acute diarrhea and using nested RT-PCR, 250 samples (24.37%) were positive for human rotavirus group A. Using multiplex RT-PCR, rotavirus common P and G genotypes were detected as 89.20% and 46.40% of the positive clinical specimens respectively. This low percentage of common G genotypes frequency may affect the efficiency of the available live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines [Rotarix® (human rotavirus G1P[8]) and RotaTeq® (reassortant bovine–human rotavirus G1-4P[5] and G6P[8])], however the percentage of clinical specimens which were negative for common G genotypes but positive for P[8] genotype was 12.00%. From 24 positive raw sewage samples for rotavirus group A VP6 collected from Zenin and El-Gabal El-Asfar wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), 21 samples (87.50%) were typeable for common P genotypes while 13 samples (54.17%) were typeable for common G genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of a VP8 partial gene of 45 P-typeable clinical isolates and 20 P-typeable raw sewage samples showed high similarity to reference strains and the majority of mutations were silent and showed lower to non-significant similarity with the two vaccine strains.

However, current evidence in these indications is limited. A European ECCO(2)R Expert Round Table Meeting was convened to further explore the potential for this treatment approach. METHODS: A modified Delphi-based method was used to collate European experts’ views to better understand how ECCO(2)R therapy is applied, identify how patients are selected and how treatment decisions are made, as well as to identify any points of consensus. RESULTS: Fourteen participants were selected based on known clinical expertise in critical care and in providing respiratory support with ECCO(2)R or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. ARDS was considered the primary indication for ECCO(2)R therapy (n = 7), while 3 participants considered ae-COPD the primary indication. The group agreed that the primary treatment goal of ECCO(2)R therapy in patients with ARDS was to apply ultra-protective lung ventilation via managing CO(2) levels. Driving pressure (≥ 14 cmH(2)O) followed by plateau pressure (P(plat); ≥ 25 cmH(2)O) was considered the most important criteria for ECCO(2)R initiation. Key treatment targets for patients with ARDS undergoing ECCO(2)R included pH (> 7.30), respiratory rate (< 25 or < 20 breaths/min), driving pressure (< 14 cmH(2)O) and P(plat) (< 25 cmH(2)O). In ae-COPD, there was consensus that, in patients at risk of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) failure, no decrease in PaCO(2) and no decrease in respiratory rate were key criteria for initiating ECCO(2)R therapy. Key treatment targets in ae-COPD were patient comfort, pH (> 7.30–7.35), respiratory rate (< 20–25 breaths/min), decrease of PaCO(2) (by 10–20%), weaning from NIV, decrease in HCO(3)(−) and maintaining haemodynamic stability. Consensus was reached on weaning protocols for both indications. Anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin was the strategy preferred by the group. CONCLUSIONS: Insights from this group of experienced physicians suggest that ECCO(2)R therapy may be an effective supportive treatment for adults with ARDS or ae-COPD. Further evidence from randomised clinical trials and/or high-quality prospective studies is needed to better guide decision making.","Combes, Alain; Auzinger, Georg; Capellier, Gilles; du Cheyron, Damien; Clement, Ian; Consales, Guglielmo; Dabrowski, Wojciech; De Bels, David; de Molina Ortiz, Francisco Javier González; Gottschalk, Antje; Hilty, Matthias P.; Pestaña, David; Sousa, Eduardo; Tully, Redmond; Goldstein, Jacques; Harenski, Kai",Crit Care,506,1

Whilst this is good practice for non-chemotherapy prescriptions, it is not a requirement of the Clinical Trial Regulations.([2]) Interruption to validate trial prescriptions can have a negative impact on pharmacists’ duty and consequently patient outcomes. With limited data available, this issue has been highlighted by anecdotal evidence. Due to the often complex requirements associated with trials, the research team are responsible for assessing the suitability of treatment. This includes checking interactions with concomitant medication, reviewing blood results and patient counselling. The clinical aspect of the pharmacist validation is therefore removed, allowing technicians to be involved in the screening of suitable prescriptions. Much is written on technicians extending their roles in the clinical setting, but this service improvement focuses on enhancing their role within the pharmacy clinical trials department. AIM: To evaluate the amount of pharmacists’ time saved by the introduction of technician screening of clinical trial prescriptions. METHOD: A risk-based proforma was created and used by a pharmacist to assess clinical trial prescriptions for the suitability of screening by a Band 7 technician. Only prescriptions with pre-printed doses, no aseptic preparation or additional medicines, were approved for technician screening. The process of screening therefore only involves the checking of patient and prescriber details, allergy status and possibly a medication randomisation. The technicians under-went an in-house training including the screening of prescriptions under pharmacist supervision. A quantitative data collection tool was used to review the screening / validation of all nonchemotherapy clinical trial prescriptions received at two sites over a two-week period in September 2020. The data collection tool was piloted and all data was analysed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: A total of 89 prescriptions were received. 56 (63%) were eligible for technician screening, of which a suitable technician validated 50%. Across both sites a total time of 360 minutes were spent validating/screening prescriptions including solving prescription related issues. Combining the time taken by a pharmacist to return from a clinical area and screening time consequently saved a total of 227 minutes of pharmacists’ time. CONCLUSION: Distributing the workload amongst trained staff saves pharmacist’s time, which can be utilised on clinical and complex tasks. This does not eliminate the requirement of a pharmacist to validate prescriptions however; it reduces the frequency and streamlines the service. Further data collection is required to analyse the direct impact on patients’ and any changes in the number of reported errors. A limitation to the study is the lack of data prior to implementation as a comparator. Additionally, during data collection there were no suitable technicians available at one site due to the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in only 50% of eligible prescriptions being screened by a technician. Ultimately, this does not change the outcome; enhancing technician’s roles allows pharmacists’ time to be used more efficiently. REFERENCES: 1. Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

In recent years, activity trackers have become increasingly popular for measuring physical activity. The aim of the present study is to examine whether university students in Hungary meet the health recommendations (10,000 steps/day) for physical activity and investigate the impact of different variables (semester-exam period, days-weekdays, days, months, sex) on the level of physical activity in free-living conditions for 3 months period. In free-living conditions, 57 healthy university students (male: 25 female: 32 mean age: 19.50 SD = 1.58) wore MiBand 1S activity tracker for 3 months. Independent sample t-tests were used to explore differences between sexes. A One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore differences in measures among different grouping variables and step count. A Two-way ANOVA was conducted to test for differences in the number of steps by days of the week, months, seasons and for sex differences. Tukey HSD post-hoc tests were used to examine significant differences. Students in the study achieved 10,000 steps per day on 17% of days (minimum: 0%; maximum: 76.5%; median: 11.1%). Unfortunately, 70% of the participants did not comply the 10,000 steps at least 80% of the days studied. No statistical difference were found between sexes. However, significant differences were found between BMI categories (underweight <18.50 kg/m(2); normal range 18.50–24.99 kg/m(2); overweight: 25.00–29.99 kg/m(2) obese > 30 kg/m(2), the number of steps in the overweight category was significantly lower (F = 72.073, p < 0.001). The average daily steps were significantly higher in autumn (t = 11.457, p < 0.001) than in winter. During exam period average steps/day were significantly lower than during fall semester (t = 13.696, p < 0.001). On weekdays, steps were significantly higher than on weekends (F = 14.017, p < 0.001), and even within this, the greatest physical activity can be done by the middle of the week. Our data suggest that university students may be priority groups for future physical activity interventions. Commercial activity trackers provide huge amount of data for relatively low cost therefore it has the potential to objectively analyze physical activity and plan interventions.","Ráthonyi, Gergely; Takács, Viktor; Szilágyi, Róbert; Bácsné Bába, Éva; Müller, Anetta; Bács, Zoltán; Harangi-Rákos, Mónika; Balogh, László; Ráthonyi-Odor, Kinga",Front Public Health,506,16

Using the PRISMA methodology, we provide a comprehensive review of the economic and historical analysis of the long-term economic consequences of pandemics. Mainstream economists focus on the impact of pandemics on production factors, finding a rich but contrasting set of mechanisms with overall negative or insignificant effects. Historians focus on the institutional impact, finding positive effects of pandemics when they trigger new socioeconomic arrangements. Evolutionary economists can integrate into the economic debate both historical elements and the complex biological characteristics of pandemics.

These slow-moving but increasingly severe crises affect larger populations across many borders and lead to the emergence of increasing population-based, preventable public health emergencies related to water, sanitation, food, shelter, energy, and related health illnesses, and ultimately global health security. This report explores the impact of these crises on Asia and the Pacific region, and their potential for regional conflict.","Burkle, Frederick M",Prehospital and disaster medicine,506,1

These materials are heterogeneous in their procurement and processing techniques, which may ultimately have an impact in their ability to withstand infection. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of varying levels of contamination on biologic graft performance in a chronic ventral hernia animal model. METHODS Four commonly applied biologic grafts were used in the repair of a chronic ventral hernia rat model (n = 218). Each material was repaired in the setting of 1 of 4 surgical wound classifications (clean, clean contaminated, contaminated, dirty infected) with Staphylococcus aureus as our inoculum agent. After a 30-day survival, repairs underwent quantitative cultures, histological, and biomechanical testing. RESULTS Marked differences were observed in biologic graft bacterial burden, biomechanical and histological responses at 30 days. Persistent bacterial burden varied among the biologic grafts and increased with increasing wound contamination (P < .05). Delays in wound healing were observed in the contaminated and dirty infected setting (P < .05). Increasing infection weakened the biomechanical strength of repairs (P < .05). CONCLUSION The degree of bacterial contamination at the time of repair affected the rates of bacterial clearance, wound-healing ability, and subsequent repair strength. Material source and processing techniques might alter graft durability, biocompatibility, and ability to clear bacteria in a contaminated field. Clinical trials are warranted in contaminated settings.","Harth, Karem C; Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Anderson, James M; Jacobs, Michael R; Zeinali, Farhad; Rosen, Michael J",Surgery,506,16

Advances in pediatric cardiology shifted attention from mortality to morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with CHD and impact on their families. The purposes of this study were to assess the validity and reliability of the Italian version of the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Cardiac Module and to create normative data for the Italian population. METHODS This was an observational cross-sectional study of pediatric patients (aged 2-18 years) with congenital or acquired Heart Disease (HD) and their parents. Families were asked to complete the cardiac pediatric health-related quality of life questionnaire (the Italian PedsQL™ 3.0 Cardiac Module) and the generic pediatric health-related quality of life questionnaire (PedsQL™ 4.0 Generic Core Scales). The sequential validation procedure of the original United States version of the PedsQL™ 3.0 Cardiac Module was carried out under the instruction of the MAPI Research Institute. To assess construct validity, Pearson's correlation coefficients were assessed between scores on the Cardiac Module scales and scores on the scales of the General Module. To determine agreement between patient self-report and parent proxy-report, we used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). To evaluate Internal consistency of items, we used Cronbach's alpha Coefficient. RESULTS The study enrolled 400 patients. Construct validity is good between PedsQL Cardiac Module total scores and PedsQL total scores (p < 0.001). The recommended standard value of 0.7 was reached on the Cardiac and General Module core scales. Intercorrelations between PedsQL Cardiac module and PedsQL scores revealed medium to large correlations. In general, correlations between Patient self-reports are poorer than Parent-proxy ones. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac PedsQL scores are valid and reliable for pediatric patients with congenital and acquired HD and may be useful for future research and clinical management.","Grimaldi Capitello, Teresa; Bevilacqua, Francesca; Vallone, Roberta; Dall'Oglio, Anna Maria; Santato, Francesca; Giannico, Salvatore; Calcagni, Giulio; Piga, Simone; Ciofi Degli Atti, Marta; Gentile, Simonetta; Rossi, Angela",BMC cardiovascular disorders,506,26

However, endovascular management of this lesion is challenging. The purpose of our study is to report our endovascular treatment clinical experience of the disease. METHODS From March 2008 to June 2013, we could identify 14 patients (average age: 62.1, median age: 62, range: 50-79) with 'Carotid S occlusion', who underwent endovascular recanalization procedures. Patient's clinical presentations were collected and the imaging findings also analyzed. The technical success rate, 24-hour and follow-up imaging outcome, and the clinical outcome using the 90-day mRS (modified Rankin scale) score were evaluated. RESULTS Patients presented with gradually progressing (n = 8), fluctuating (n = 3), transient ischemic attack (n = 2) and stationary (n = 1) symptoms. DWI showed internal and external border-zone lesions in six patients, only internal ICA border-zone lesions in three patients, and only external border-zone lesions in two patients. Underlying distal ICA stenosis was noted in 12 patients. The technical success rate was 92.8% (13/14). Luminal patency was noted in all patients (100%) after 24 hours and in nine of 10 (90%) on long-term follow-up (median: 6.5, average: 15.1, range: 1-39 months). A 90-day, good functional outcome (mRS ≤ 2) was noted in 13 of 14 patients (92.8%). CONCLUSIONS 'Carotid S occlusion' usually presented with border-zone infarction and endovascular management of the lesions was feasible. A relatively successful clinical outcome could be achieved after successful revascularization.","Park, Soonchan; Park, Eun Suk; Kwak, Jae Hyuk; Lee, Dong-Geun; Suh, Dae Chul; Kwon, Sun U; Lee, Deok Hee",Journal of stroke,506,5

However, there is limited evidence concerning its efficacy. OBJECTIVES This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of MARPE in late adolescents and adults by assessing success rate and skeletal and dental transverse maxillary expansion, as well as treatment duration, dental and periodontal side effects and soft tissue effects. SEARCH METHODS Seven electronic databases were searched (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and ClinicalTrials.gov) without limitations in November 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and observational studies on patients from the age of 16 onwards with transverse maxillary deficiency who were treated with MARPE and which included any of the predefined outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Inclusion eligibility screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently in duplicate. When possible, exploratory meta-analyses of mean differences (MDs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were conducted, followed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) analysis of the evidence quality. RESULTS Eight articles were included: two prospective and six retrospective observational studies. One study had a moderate risk of bias, whereas seven studies had a serious risk of bias. GRADE quality of evidence was very low. MARPE showed a high success rate (mean: 92.5%; 95%CI: 88.7%-96.3%), resulting in a significant skeletal width increase (MD: 2.33 mm; 95%CI: 1.63 mm-3.03 mm) and dental intermolar width increase (MD: 6.55 mm; 95%CI: 5.50 mm-7.59 mm). A significant increase in dental tipping, a decrease in mean buccal bone thickness and buccal alveolar height, as well as nasal soft tissue change was present (P < 0.05). The mean duration of expansion ranged from 20 to 126 days. LIMITATIONS One of the main drawbacks was the lack of high-quality prospective studies in the literature. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS MARPE is a treatment modality that is associated with a high success rate in skeletal and dental maxillary expansion. MARPE can induce dental and periodontal side effects and affect peri-oral soft tissues. Given the serious risk of bias of the included studies, careful data interpretation is necessary and future research of higher quality is strongly recommended. REGISTRATION PROSPERO (CRD42020176618).

Virus infection and some individual viral proteins, including the 3a protein, induce apoptosis. However, the cellular targets leading to 3a protein-mediated apoptosis have not been fully characterized. This study showed that the 3a protein modulates the mitochondrial death pathway in two possible ways. Activation of caspase-8 through extrinsic signal(s) caused Bid activation. In the intrinsic pathway, there was activation of caspase-9 and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. This was the result of increased Bax oligomerization and higher levels of p53 in 3a protein-expressing cells, which depended on the activation of p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) in these cells. For p38 activation and apoptosis induction, the 3a cytoplasmic domain was sufficient. In direct Annexin V staining assays, the 3a protein-expressing cells showed increased apoptosis that was attenuated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. A block in nuclear translocation of the STAT3 transcription factor in cells expressing the 3a protein was also observed. These results have been used to present a model of 3a-mediated apoptosis.","Padhan, Kartika; Minakshi, Rinki; Towheed, Mohammad Aatif Bin; Jameel, Shahid",The Journal of general virology,506,12

We analyzed the effectiveness and safety of 2 different surgical approaches to ligate the uterine artery in SP-LH for women with uterine myomas or adenomyosis. METHODS A single surgeon (TJ Kim) performed 36 retroperitoneal single-port laparoscopic hysterectomies (SP-rH) from September 1st 2012 to April 30th 2013. We compared these cases with 36 cases of conventional single-port laparoscopic abdominal hysterectomy (SP-aH) performed by the same surgeon from November 1st 2011 to July 31th 2012 (historic control). In the SP-rH cases, the retroperitoneal space was developed to identify the uterine artery; then, it was ligated where it originates from the internal iliac artery. RESULTS Estimated blood loss (EBL) was decreased in the SP-rH group compared with the SP-aH group (100 mL vs 200 mL; P = .023). The median total operative time was shorter in the SP-rH group (75 minutes vs 93 minutes; P < .05). The operative time of the Scope I phase, including ligation of the utero-ovarian (or infundibulopelvic) ligament, round ligament, uterine artery, and detachment of the bladder, was longer in the SP-rH group compared with that in the SP-aH group (26.0 minutes vs 24 minutes; P = .043). However, the operative time of the Scope II phase, including detachment of the uterosacral-cardinal ligament, vaginal cutting, and uterus removal, was shorter in the SP-rH group (19.5 minutes vs 30 minutes; P < .05). Operative complications were not significantly different between the groups (P = .374). CONCLUSION Although SP-rH may be considered technically difficult, it can be performed safely and efficiently with surgical outcomes comparable to those of SP-aH.","Kim, Tae-Hyun; Kim, Chul Jung; Kim, Tae-Joong; Lee, Yoo-Young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Bae, Duk-Soo; Kim, Byoung-Gie",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,506,11

We compare the effects of a 3-month nationwide lockdown in Turkey on musculoskeletal pain, coronaphobia, and sleep quality in individuals who SH and in those who CW during the Covid-19 pandemic. Individuals who SH (n: 375) and those who CW (n: 311) during the Covid-19 were included in this case-controlled study. Data on musculoskeletal pain (Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, NMQ), coronaphobia (Covid-19 Phobia Scale, C19P-S), and sleep quality (Jenkins Sleep Scale, JSS) were collected via an online form. During the 3-month Covid-19 lockdown, low back pain was higher in the SH group than CW group (p < .05). Rates of the neck, upper-back, shoulder, and hip/thigh pain were lower, and rate of low back pain was higher in the SH group (p < .05); while, rates of the neck, upper back, shoulder, and elbow pain were lower in the CW group (p < .05) during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown than pre-lockdown values. The total scores of the C19P-S and psychological, psychosomatic, social, and economic subscales were higher in the SH group (p < .05). Sleep quality was similar in both groups (p > .05).

In recent times, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy(SILC) has developed as a less invasive alternative technique to conventional laparoscopy. In the literature, many studies have compared SILC and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) procedures but a limited number of studies have compared the two techniques with regard to quality of life (QOL). The choice of surgical procedure was effected by QOL of the patients. The effects of SILC on QOL remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) and single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) procedures on the clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients by short-term follow-up evaluation. Material and methods In this study, 142 patients who underwent cholecystectomy operations with either technique underwent SILC and CLC were evaluated. The quality of life index in the patients was measured with short form 36 (SF 36) test. Results The results of mean operative time, length of stay and complication rate for SILC and CLC were similar. The postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores were not significantly different between the SILC and CLC patients but only physical functioning score were higher in SILC patients. Conclusions SILC is a safe and effective alternative to CLC. To detect the effects of SILC on HRQOL, we need long-term prospective comparative studies.","Cinar, Hamza; Topgul, Koray; Malazgirt, Zafer; Yuruker, Savas; Buyukakincak, Sercan; Kesicioglu, Tugrul; Tarim, İsmail Alper; Koc, Zeliha; Saglam, Zeynep",Annals of medicine and surgery,506,14

Similarly to healthy cells, prostate epithelial cancer cells produce extracellular vesicles (prostasomes) that can be isolated from seminal fluid, urine, and blood. Prostasomes contain ubiquitously expressed and prostate-specific membrane and cytosolic proteins, as well as RNA. Both quantitative and qualitative changes in protein, mRNA, long noncoding RNA, and microRNA composition of extracellular vesicles isolated from prostate cancer patients have been reported. In general, however, the identified extracellular vesicle-associated single-marker molecules or combinations of marker molecules require confirmation in large cohorts of patients to validate their specificity and sensitivity as prostate cancer markers. Complications include variable factors such as prostate manipulation and urine flux, as well as masking by ubiquitously expressed free molecules and extracellular vesicles from tissues other than the prostate. Herein, we propose that the most promising methods include comprehensive combinational screening for (mutant) RNA in prostasomes that are immunoisolated with antibodies targeting prostate-specific epitopes.","Zijlstra, Carla; Stoorvogel, Willem",The Journal of clinical investigation,506,1

METHODS The medical records and imaging studies of 30 patients (males 18, females 12) who underwent RFA of osteoid osteoma at our institution were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 15.3 years (range 5-34 years) and the mean duration of follow up was 26.9 months (range 3-52 months). The lesions were located in the femur (n=6, 53%), tibia (n = 8, 27%), hand (n = 3, 10%), foot (n = 2, 6%) and humerus (n = 1, 3%). The procedure was performed with general anaesthesia under CT guidance. The nidus was accessed with 11-gauge bone biopsy needle and then the stylet was removed and replaced by monopolar 16.5G radiofrequency probe with a 9-mm active tip through the coaxial axis. Power delivery via the radiofrequency generator was started at 2 W and increased gradually until the end point of 450-500 Ω reached and 'Roll-Off' achieved indicating coagulation necrosis of the target lesion. RESULTS The procedure was technically successful in all patients. The mean procedure time was 72 min and the mean RFA time was 12.7 min. The clinical success rate was 93%. In one patient, the procedure was abandoned due to immature Roll-Off despite all measures. In one patient (3%), recurrence occurred 39 months after the procedure. No major complications were encountered. Two minor skin burns occurred that were resolved with conservative measures. CONCLUSION RFA of osteoid osteoma using Soloist monopolar electrode is a safe and effective treatment. Tissue impedance could be used as an alternative to temperature to indicate osteonecrosis of osteoid osteoma during RFA.","Al-Omari, Ma'moon H; Ata, Khalid J; Al-Muqbel, Kusai M; Mohaidat, Ziyad M; Haddad, Waleed H; Rousan, Liqa A",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,506,1

METHODS From April 1 to April 28, 2020, the authors conducted a national survey advertised via e-mail lists, social media, and direct e-mail. Participants were self-selecting, U.S.-based volunteers. Scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C were used. The relationships between personal resilience and risk factors, work culture and stressors and supports, and COVID-19-related events were examined. RESULTS Of 1,685 participants (76% female, 88% White), 31% (404 of 1,311) endorsed mild anxiety, and 33% (427 of 1,311) clinically meaningful anxiety; 29% (393 of 1,341) reported mild depressive symptoms, and 17% (233 of 1,341) moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 5% (64 of 1,326) endorsed suicidal ideation; and 14% (184 of 1,300) screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder. Pediatric HCWs reported greater anxiety than did others. HCWs' mental health history increased risk for anxiety (odds ratio [OR]=2.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.09-3.70) and depression (OR=3.49, 95% CI=2.47-4.94), as did barriers to working, which were associated with moderate to severe anxiety (OR=2.50, 95% CI=1.80-3.48) and moderate depressive symptoms (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.45-3.21) (p<0.001 for all comparisons).

Here, we report the application of this newly developed advanced type of operating theater for the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), along with an evaluation of our initial experiences. METHODS The study population consisted of 18 patients with parasellar tumor. All patients underwent surgery via the EEA in SCOT®. During all procedures, various types of intraoperative information, including electrophysiological monitoring, anatomical orientation with navigation system, intraoperative MRI, and endoscopic images of the operative field, were collected and stored by OPeLiNK®. Furthermore, the intraoperative information was shared with the surgical strategy desk, where a senior neurosurgeon can direct and manage the surgical procedure in real-time. RESULTS We successfully completed the surgical procedures in SCOT® in all cases. Using OPeLiNK®, operators in SCOT® were able to share various data, such as images obtained intraoperatively and surgical instrument position from navigation systems, as well as images of the surgical field with senior neurosurgeons at the surgical strategy desk in all cases. Surgically relevant information from these sources was transmitted through an application and displayed to all surgical staff. The necessary nuances were reflected in the surgical procedures.

Therefore, we investigate the inhibitory activity of a group of dietary bioactive flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which are identified as one of the potential targets in the drug discovery process of COVID-19. After the initial virtual screening of a number of bioactive flavonoids, the binding affinity of three compounds - Naringin, Naringenin and Amentoflavone - at the active site of Mpro was investigated through MD Simulations, MM-PBSA and DFT Binding Energy calculations. From the MD trajectory analysis, Amentoflavone and Naringin showed consistent protein-ligand interactions with the aminoacid residues of the active site domains of Mpro. The excellent inhibitory activity of Amentoflavone and Naringin was established from its MM-PBSA binding energy values of -190.50 and -129.87 kJ/mol respectively. The MET165 residue of Mpro is identified as one of the key residue which contributed significantly to MM-PBSA binding energy through hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, the DFT binding energy values of Amentoflavone (-182.92 kJ/mol) and Naringin (-160.67 kJ/mol) in active site molecular clusters with hydrogen bonds confirmed their potential inhibitory activity. These compounds are of high interest because of their wide availability, low cost, no side effects, and long history of use. We can prevent the severity of this disease for home care patients using these effective dietary supplements. We are hopeful that our results have implications for the development of prophylaxis of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Regarding its treatment, the use of bariatric procedures is increasing due to their efficacy in weight reduction and improved management of the associated medical conditions. Although comprehensive preoperative evaluation is essential, routine upper endoscopy is controversial. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She had multiple unsuccessful attempts at lifestyle modification for weight reduction. Accordingly, she was scheduled for sleeve gastrectomy. However, the operation was canceled due to the incidental intra-operative finding of a gastric mass. She was diagnosed as having gastric schwannoma, which is considered a rare gastrointestinal neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS Comprehensive preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing bariatric procedures is essential. The present case is a good example of the value of upper endoscopy in the evaluation of patients, including those who are asymptomatic.","Al Dandan, Omran; Hassan, Ali; Anastasiou, Jiannis; Al-Turaifi, Zahra; Alabbad, Aqilah; Refai, Osamah; Alshomimi, Saeed",The American journal of case reports,506,1

It has been shown to stimulate healing across a broad spectrum of soft-tissue wounds, at least in part from the application of mechanical stress on cells and tissues in the wound environment. This study tests the hypothesis that application of NPT to cranial critical-size defects (CSD) in skeletally mature rabbits leads to osseous healing. NPT was delivered 1, 4, 6 or 10 days over CSD-containing calcium phosphate scaffolds placed in contact with intact dura. At 12 weeks after defect creation, NPT groups exhibited significantly greater defect bridging and bone within the scaffolds (P<0.01). Increasing duration of NPT did not result in a greater amount of bone within the scaffolds, but did increase the amount of bone distributed in the upper half of the scaffolds. Appearance of tissue within defects immediately following the removal of NPT at day 6 suggests alternating regions of dural compression and distention indicative of cell stretching. Dura and adjacent tissue were composed of multiple cell layers that extended up into the scaffolds, lining struts and populating pore spaces. An extracellular matrix densely populated with cells and capillaries, as well as larger vessels, infiltrated pores of NPT-treated scaffolds, while scattered spindle-shaped cells and sparse stroma are present within pores of control scaffolds. This rabbit model data suggest that NPT activates within mature dura a natural healing cascade that results in osseous tissue formation without the addition of exogenous factors or progenitor cells.","Swain, Larry D; Cornet, Douglas A; Manwaring, Michael E; Collins, Barbara; Singh, Vinay K; Beniker, Dan; Carnes, David L",BoneKEy reports,506,1

This study aimed to explore the perceived stress and its relation to the duration of dealing with COVID-19 patients in medical doctors. METHODS The doctors who work in different medical settings in Iraqi Kurdistan during coronavirus outbreak were invited into this cross-sectional study. The doctors were invited from one pediatric, one emergency, one special corona, and one maternity and gynecology hospital. The ""Perceived Stress Scale -10 (PSS)"" measured the perceived degree of a doctor who experienced stress. The information was collected through a web-based technique to avoid the disease spread. RESULTS Doctors' mean duration of dealing with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 1.2 (Range: 0-16 days). The mean stress score was 18.81 out of 40. Most of the doctors had a moderate level of stress (69.4%), followed by a low (21.1%) and a high level of stress (9.6%). The general physicians and medical lab specialties had higher stress scores; 21.56 and 19.88, respectively. The high level of stress was among general physicians and community and family medicine doctors; 20.0% and 25.0%, respectively. Whether or not doctors dealt with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19, did not have a significant difference over the perceived stress score; 19.02 vs. 18.87; P=0.786). The mean score of stress was raised with increasing duration of dealing with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19; r=0.202; P=0.004 and decreased with increasing age (r=-0.141; P=0.045), and clinical experience (r=-0.139, P=0.048).

Our research aims to profoundly investigate the correlation between CSR and labor environmental issues based on the International Organization for Standardization's standard 26,000 (ISO 26000) during COVID-19 and to also examine how CSR practices help solve labor environmental issues in the Egyptian small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was adopted, for data analysis and hypotheses testing, on a sample of 307 manager-level employees in the Egyptian SMEs. Results indicate that CSR positively impacts labor practices dimensions (employment relationships, human development and training, social dialog, and health and safety at work). However, CSR has an insignificant effect on social protection and work conditions. This study is scientifically valuable since it helps better understand the pandemic's effects on environmental labor issues in the Egyptian SMEs and shows how CSR helps solve those issues. Also, it discussed the theoretical contributions and practical implications and showed the limitations and future research for this study area.","Kholaif, Moustafa Mohamed Nazief Haggag Kotb; Ming, Xiao; Moosa, Anitha; David, Kashosi Gad",Environmental science and pollution research international,506,7

METHODS We downloaded proteome data (BTO: 0000762) from the Proteomics Identifications database and identified the DEPs in the IAV-infected Calu-3 cells. Then we constructed a protein-protein interaction network and a transcriptional regulatory network of the proteins. Finally, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to study the IAV infection at a functional level. RESULTS A total of 4 protein groups between the normal cells and the Calu-3 cells infected by IAV, severe acute respiratory syndrome or swine influenza were identified. In the networks, we found 5 significant proteins including FAN, CPSF2, AGO1, AGO2 and PAX5. In addition, we demonstrated those proteins were associated with GO terms such as phosphate metabolic process, calcium ion transport, cell division and regulation of cell motion. STAT1, NS2, CD5, NCKX6 and PDGFB were significant DEPs in these GO terms. CONCLUSIONS By referring to the previous studies, we suggest that proteins including FAN, CPSF2, AGO1, AGO2, PAX5, STAT1 and PDGFB can be used as therapeutic targets of IAV infection.","Dong, Qing; Zhu, Haibo; Zhang, Yunyan; Yang, Daren",Journal of molecular microbiology and biotechnology,506,16

We compared aerosol production and virus survival for a Collison nebulizer, vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), and hydraulic spray atomizer (HAS). We also measured the dry size distribution of the aerosols produced, calculated the droplet sizes before evaporation and the dry size distribution from normal saline solution. Dry count median diameters of 0.11, 0.22 and 0.30 μm were found for normal saline from the Collison nebulizer, VMN and HSA, respectively. The volume median diameters were 0.323, 1.70 and 1.30 μm, respectively. The effect of nebulization on the viability of two influenza A viruses (IAVs) (H1N1, H3N2) and human rhinovirus (HRV)-16, was assessed by nebulization into an SKC Biosampler. The HSA had least impact on surviving fractions (SFs) of H1N1 and H3N2 (89±3%, 94±2%), followed by the Collison nebulizer (83±1%, 82±2%). The VMN yielded SFs of 78±2% and 76±2%, respectively. Conversely, for HRV-16, the VMN produced higher SFs (87±8%). Our findings indicate that there were no statistical differences between SFs of the viruses nebulized by these nebulizers. However, VMN produced higher aerosol concentrations within the airborne-size range, making it more suitable where high aerosol mass production is required. Importance Viral respiratory tract infections cause millions of lost days of work and physician visits globally, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory droplets and droplet nuclei from infected hosts are the potential carriers of such viruses within indoor environments. Laboratory-generated bioaerosols are applied in understanding the transmission and infection of viruses, modeling the physiological aspects of bioaerosol generation in a controlled environment. However, little comparative characterization exists for nebulizers used in infectious disease aerobiology, including Collison nebulizer, Vibrating mesh nebulizer, and hydraulic spray atomizer. This study characterized the physical features of aerosols generated by laboratory nebulizers, and their performance in producing aerosols at a size relevant to airborne transmission used in infectious disease aerobiology. We also determined the impact of nebulization mechanisms of these nebulizers on the viability of human respiratory viruses, including IAV H1N1, IAV H3N2 and HRV-16.","Niazi, Sadegh; Philp, Lisa K; Spann, Kirsten; Johnson, Graham R",Applied and environmental microbiology,506,24

Genomics data integrated with multi-omics layering have advanced cancer research. Uncovering such layers of genetic mutations/modifications, epigenetic regulation and their role in the complex pathophysiology of cancer progression could lead to novel therapeutic interventions. Although a plethora of literature is available in public domain defining the role of various tumor driver gene mutations, understanding of epigenetic regulation of cancer is still emerging. This review focuses on epigenetic regulation association with the pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). NMSC has higher prevalence in Caucasian populations compared to other races. Due to lack of proper reporting to cancer registries, the incidence rates for NMSC worldwide cannot be accurately estimated. However, this is the most common neoplasm in humans, and millions of new cases per year are reported in the United States alone. In organ transplant recipients, the incidence of NMSC particularly of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is very high and these SCCs frequently become metastatic and lethal. Understanding of solar ultraviolet (UV) light-induced damage and impaired DNA repair process leading to DNA mutations and nuclear instability provide an insight into the pathogenesis of metastatic neoplasm. This review discusses the recent advances in the field of epigenetics of NMSCs. Particularly, the role of DNA methylation, histone hyperacetylation and non-coding RNA such as long-chain noncoding (lnc) RNAs, circular RNAs and miRNA in the disease progression are summarized.","Kashyap, Mahendra Pratap; Sinha, Rajesh; Mukhtar, M Shahid; Athar, Mohammad",Seminars in cancer biology,506,13

We aimed to evaluate an internal quality control (iQC) program that controls the total ANA IIF process in routine practice. METHODS In addition to the kit iQC materials, supplemental quality indicators were integrated in a total quality assurance (QA) program: patient-derived iQC's samples (negative, 1/160 fine speckled and 1/160 homogeneous), median sample FI per run and percentage of ANA IIF positive samples per run.Analytical rejection criteria were based on the imprecision of the positivity index (PI) measure of the Zenit PRO system (Menarini). Clinical rejection criteria were based on changes in FI that correspond to a change in ANA IIF titer of ≥2. To evaluate the QA program, different artificial errors were introduced during the ANA IIF process. After every run, quality indicators were evaluated and compared to the pre-set target values. RESULTS Rescanning the ANA IIF slides five times, using an old conjugate and a needle obstruction resulted in analytically and even clinically relevant errors in ANA IIF results. All errors were correctly detected by the different defined quality indicators. Traditional Westgard rules, including analytically (and clinically) defined rejection limits were useful in monitoring quality indicators.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the strategies and outcomes for retreatment of recurrent VADAs after SAC. METHODS Between September 2009 and November 2013, six consecutive patients presenting with recurrent intracranial VADAs after SAC were enrolled in this study. They were all male with age ranging from 29 to 54 years (mean age, 46.2 years). The procedures of treatments and angiographic and clinical follow-up were reviewed retrospectively. Retreatment modalities were selected individually according to the characteristics of recurrence. The outcomes of retreatment were evaluated by angiographic and clinical follow-up. RESULTS Six patients with recurrent intracranial VADAs after SAC were retreated, with second SAC in three patients, coil embolization, double overlapping stents placement and endovascular occlusion with aneurysm trapping in one patient, respectively. Immediate angiographic outcomes of retreatment were: complete occlusion in three patients, nearly complete occlusion in two patients, and contrast medium retention in dissecting aneurysm in one patient. All cases were technically successful. No complications related to endovascular procedures occurred. Angiographic follow-up was available in all five patients treated with second SAC or double overlapping stents, which was complete occlusion in four patients, obliteration of parent artery in one patient, showing no recurrence at 4-11 months (mean: 8.6 months). Clinical follow-up was performed in all six patients at 11-51 months after initial endovascular treatment and at 9-43 months after retreatment. The mRS of last clinical follow-up was excellent in five patients and mild disability in only one patient. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular retreatment is feasible and effective for recurrent intracranial VADAs after SAC. Individualized strategies of retreatment should be enacted according to the characteristics and reasons for the recurrence.","Song, Ying; Wang, Yang; Li, Chuanhui; Wang, Yanmin; Mu, Shiqing; Yang, Xinjian",PloS one,506,16

Appropriate risk assessment and intervention are imperative since evidence demonstrates that a large proportion of those who die by suicide visit health professionals prior to their death. Much previous research has focused on identifying patient-level risk factors that can improve the risk assessment process through scales and algorithms. However, the best practice guidelines emphasise the importance of clinical interviews and prioritise the clinician's final judgement. The purpose of this review is to (1) understand the clinician and organisational level barriers and facilitators that influence a clinician's assessment of suicide risk, (2) identify the types of biases that exist within this process and (3) list any evidence-based training protocols and educational initiatives to aid (or support) clinicians with this process. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review protocol uses the Arksey and O'Malley framework, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines for scoping reviews. Literature will be identified using a multidatabase search strategy developed in consultation with a medical librarian. The proposed screening process consists of a title and abstract scan, followed by a full-text review by two reviewers to determine the eligibility of articles. Studies outlining any factors that affect a clinician's suicide risk assessment process, ranging from individual experience and behaviours to organisational level influences, will be included. A tabular synthesis of the general study details will be provided, as well as a narrative synthesis of the extracted data, organised into themes using the Situated Clinical Decision-Making framework. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this review. Results will be translated into educational materials and presentations for dissemination to appropriate knowledge users. Knowledge outputs will also include academic presentations at relevant conferences, and a published, peer-reviewed journal article.","Sequeira, Lydia; Strudwick, Gillian; Bailey, Sharon M; De Luca, Vincenzo; Wiljer, David; Strauss, John",BMJ open,506,5

The upfront use of immunomodulatory drug and proteasome inhibitor combinations followed by maintenance has resulted in transformative clinical benefit. Four-drug regimens incorporating monoclonal antibodies are reporting unprecedented rates of complete response and MRD negativity in the absence of intensification. In the context of these advances, the added value of high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplant (HDM-ASCT) is a key question. From a safety standpoint, HDM-ASCT is associated with both acute toxicities that reduce quality of life and long-term toxicities that may limit life expectancy for some patients. The present review discusses the recent advances in induction therapy, the impact of these advances on HDM-ASCT, the evolving role of MRD testing and the short- and long-term risks of HDM-ASCT. Recognising that prospective data remains limited, we suggest that HDM-ASCT not be considered mandatory for eligible newly diagnosed patients who are treated with highly efficacious regimens and achieve deep responses, but rather be held in reserve without early exposure to the clinical and genomic toxicity inherent to this approach.","Kazandjian, Dickran; Mo, Clifton C; Landgren, Ola; Richardson, Paul G",British journal of haematology,506,17

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet αIIbβ3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immunemediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aδSPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatment of the underlying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aδSPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed. Although no guidelines are available for the management of these very rare conditions, presentation of all cases reported so far can help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these life-threatening diseases.","Bacci, Monica; Ferretti, Antonietta; Marchetti, Marina; Alberelli, Maria A; Falanga, Anna; Lodigiani, Corrado; De Candia, Erica",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,506,1

This method has not been widely adopted. We piloted the use of trained community health workers (CHW) to investigate the extent of unreported maternal and infant deaths in Khayelitsha and explored requirements of such a programme and the role of CHWs in bridging gaps. METHODS This was a mixed methods study, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods. Case identification and data collection were done by ten trained CHWs. Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interview guides for key informant interviews, focus group discussions and informal conversations. Qualitative data were analysed thematically using a content analysis approach. RESULTS Although more than half of the infant deaths occurred in hospitals (n = 11/17), about a quarter that occurred at home (n = 4/17) were unreported. Main causes of deaths as perceived by family members of the deceased were related to uncertainty about the quality of care in the facilities, socio-cultural and economic contexts where people lived and individual factors. Most unreported deaths were further attributed to weak facility-community links and socio-cultural practices. Fragmented death reporting systems were perceived to influence the quality of the data and this impacted on the number of unreported deaths. Only two maternal deaths were identified in this pilot study. CONCLUSIONS CHWs can conduct verbal and social autopsy for maternal and infant deaths to complement formal vital registration systems. Capacity development, stakeholder's engagement, supervision, and support are essential for a community-linked death review system. Policymakers and implementers should establish a functional relationship between community-linked reporting systems and the existing system as a starting point. There is a need for more studies to confirm or build on our pilot findings.","Igumbor, Jude; Adetokunboh, Olatunji; Muller, Jocelyn; Bosire, Edna N; Ajuwon, Ademola; Phetlhu, Rene; Mbule, Marjorie; Ronan, Agnes; Burtt, Fiona; Scheepers, Esca; Schmitz, Kathrin",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,506,1

The stability of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium is studied. And then, the conditions which guarantee the existence of local Hopf bifurcation are given. Furthermore, we show that the local Hopf bifurcation implies the global Hopf bifurcation after the second critical value of delay. The obtained results show that the time delay in media coverage can not affect the stability of the disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. However, the time delay affects the stability of the endemic equilibrium and produces limit cycle oscillations while the basic reproduction number is greater than unity. Finally, some examples for numerical simulations are included to support the theoretical prediction.","Zhao, Huitao; Zhao, Miaochan",Journal of biological dynamics,506,1

We present a single surgeon's transition from laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (L-TEP) to robotic transabdominal preperitoneal (R-TAPP) inguinal hernia repair and compare outcomes from the two approaches. METHODS This retrospective review and analysis of prospectively collected data compare outcomes during the transition from L-TEP to R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair by a single surgeon at one institution. Operating times and surgical outcomes and complications are analyzed. All consecutive L-TEP cases from November 2012 to August 2014 and all consecutive R-TAPP cases from March 2013 to October 2015 were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 157 and 118 patients underwent L-TEP and R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair, respectively. The groups were similar regarding demographics and ASA class. A significantly higher number of complex cases were performed in the R-TAPP group compared to L-TEP group (n = 11 vs. n = 1, p = 0.0001). Mean surgical times were nearly identical (69.12 ± 35.13 min, R-TAPP; 69.05 ± 26.31, L-TEP) as were intraoperative and postoperative complication rates-despite the significantly higher number of complex cases in the R-TAPP group. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study in the literature comparing a single surgeon's experience transitioning from L-TEP to R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair. Results from the R-TAPP cases were similar to those achieved from laparoscopic cases.

Prompted by the search for viable alternatives, we compared the utility of tear and saliva SIgA to predict URTI prospectively (study 1) and assessed the influence of exercise (study 2) and dehydration (study 3) using a repeated-measures crossover design. METHODS In study 1, 40 subjects were recruited during the common-cold season. Subjects provided tear and saliva samples weekly and recorded upper respiratory symptoms (URS) daily for 3 wk. Real-time PCR confirmed common-cold pathogens in 9 of 11 subjects reporting URS (82%). Predictive utility of tear and saliva SIgA was explored by comparing healthy samples with those collected during the week before URS. In study 2, 13 subjects performed a 2-h run at 65% V˙O2peak. In study 3, 13 subjects performed exercise heat stress to 3% body mass loss followed by overnight fluid restriction. RESULTS Tear SIgA concentration and secretion rate were 48% and 51% lower, respectively, during URTI and 34% and 46% lower the week before URS (P < 0.05), but saliva SIgA remained unchanged. The risk of URS the following week increased ninefold (95% confidence interval, 1.7-48) when the tear SIgA secretion rate was <5.5 μg·min(-1) and sixfold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-29) when the tear SIgA secretion rate decreased >30%. Tear SIgA secretion rate >5.5 μg·min(-1) or no decrease of >30% predicted subjects free of URS in >80% of cases. Tear SIgA concentration decreased after exercise (-57%, P < 0.05) in line with the ""open-window theory"" but was unaffected by dehydration. Saliva flow rate decreased and saliva SIgA concentration increased after exercise and during dehydration (P < 0.05).

However, their modulation and effect in osteoclastogenesis remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-346-3p in regulating the osteoclast differentiation from RAW264.7 cells. We used the miRNA microarray assay, miR-346-3p mimic transfection, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, bone resorption assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot. Our results showed that the expression of miR-346-3p was significantly upregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Further, by transfecting cells with miR-346-3p mimic, we observed an increased number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, increased pit area caused by bone resorption, and enhanced expression of osteoclast-specific genes and proteins. Conversely, miR-346-3p inhibition attenuated the osteoclast differentiation and function. Software-mediated prediction and validation using luciferase reporter assay showed that TRAF3, a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation, was inhibited by miR-346-3p overexpression. Our results showed that miR-346-3p directly targeted TRAF3 mRNA via binding to its 3'-UTR and inhibited the expression of TRAF3 protein. Taken together, our results revealed that miR-346-3p promotes the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the TRAF3 gene. In conclusion, miR-346-3p could be a novel therapeutic target for bone loss-related pathogenesis.","Mao, Yingji; Chen, Yu; Fu, Yingxiao; Guan, Jingjing; Liang, Mengxiang; Zhu, Yansong; Yang, Fugen; Li, Feixiang; Zhang, Zhe; Wan, Chuanfeng; Zhou, Pinghui",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of CO2 insufflation in deeply sedated children undergoing colonoscopy. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. We recruited 100 consecutive pediatric patients who had colonoscopy under deep sedation for various indications. Patients were first randomized by history of abdominal pain and then randomly assigned to either CO2 or air insufflation. Post-procedural abdominal pain scores were registered on a 10-point visual analog rating scale and significant pain was defined as a score of 3 or higher. Abdominal circumferences and end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) levels were measured. Complications during and after the procedure were recorded. RESULTS We did not find statistically significant difference between CO2 and Air insufflation on univariate analysis due to low number of children experiencing significant pain after colonoscopy. After adjusting for baseline pain, we found that pain was significantly lower in patients after CO2 versus air insufflation on multivariable analysis (P = 0.03). The significant factors related to pain were duration of the procedure (P = 0.006), history of abdominal pain (P = 0.002) and previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.02). CO2 insufflation was associated with decreased abdominal circumference after colonoscopy (P = 0.002). Females were more likely to have pain regardless of intervention (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS Most children tolerate endoscopic procedures without significant pain. Our study was underpowered to show significant difference between Air and CO2 on univariate analysis. However, CO2 insufflation during colonoscopy may reduce post-procedural abdominal pain. Significant factors for increased pain on multivariate analysis included colonoscopy length over 30 min, history of abdominal pain and previous abdominal surgery.","Dharmaraj, Rajmohan; Dunn, Rachel; Fritz, Julia; Dasgupta, Mahua; Simpson, Pippa; Cabrera, Jose; Miranda, Adrian; Lerner, Diana G",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,506,1

Our aim was to develop a classification of the causes and clinical relevance of CADe FPs, and to assess the relative distribution of FPs in real-life setting. METHODS In a post-hoc analysis of a randomized trial comparing colonoscopy with and without CADe (NCT: 04079478), we extracted 40 CADe-colonoscopy videos. By modified Delphi process, 4 expert endoscopists identified the main domains for reasons and clinical relevance of FPs. Then, 2 expert endoscopists manually examined each FP activation, and classified it according to the proposed domains. Analysis was limited to the withdrawal phase. RESULTS The 2 main domains for the causes of CADe-FPs were identified as artifacts due to either mucosal wall or bowel content, whereas clinical relevance was defined by the time spent for FP and the FP rate per minute. Mean FPs per colonoscopy was 27.3 ± 13.1, of which 24 ± 12 (88%) and 3.2 ± 2.6 (12%) due to artifacts from bowel wall and bowel content, respectively. Of the 27.3 FP per colonoscopy, 1.6 (5.7%) required an additional exploration time of 4.8 ± 6.2 seconds per FP, ie, 0.7% of the mean withdrawal time (WT). In detail, 15 (24.2%), 33 (53.2%) and 14 (22.6%) FPs were classified as of mild, moderate, or severe clinical relevance. Rate of FP per minute of WT was 2.4 ± 1.2, being higher for FPs due to artifacts from bowel wall than for those from bowel content (2.4 ± 0.6 vs 0.3 ± 0.2, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS False positives by CADe are primarily due to artifacts from the bowel wall. Despite a high frequency, FPs result in a negligible 1% increase of the total withdrawal time as most of them are immediately discarded by the endoscopists.","Hassan, Cesare; Badalamenti, Matteo; Maselli, Roberta; Correale, Loredana; Iannone, Andrea; Radaelli, Franco; Rondonotti, Emanuele; Ferrara, Elisa; Spadaccini, Marco; Alkandari, Asma; Fugazza, Alessandro; Anderloni, Andrea; Galtieri, Piera Alessia; Pellegatta, Gaia; Carrara, Silvia; Di Leo, Milena; Craviotto, Vincenzo; Lamonaca, Laura; Lorenzetti, Roberto; Andrealli, Alida; Antonelli, Giulio; Wallace, Michael; Sharma, Prateek; Rosch, Thomas; Repici, Alessandro",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,506,1

We present the SEIR-Net model, for a network of social group interactions, as a development of the classic mathematical model of SEIR epidemics (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic)-Removed). In the SEIR-Net model, we can simulate social contacts between groups divided by age groups and analyze different strategies of social distancing. In the vertical distancing policy, only older people are distanced, whereas in the horizontal distancing policy all age groups adhere to social distancing. These two scenarios are compared to a control scenario in which no intervention is made to distance people. The vertical distancing scenario is almost as bad as the control, both in terms of people infected and in the acceleration of cases. On the other hand, horizontal distancing, if applied with the same intensity in all age groups, significantly reduces the total infected people ""flattening the disease growth curve"". Our analysis considers the city of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, but similar conclusions apply to other cities as well.

METHODS The patients who underwent LDP with a left-posterior approach at our hospital from January 2016 to April 2020 were reviewed to evaluate the short-term postoperative outcomes. In LDP, we first dissected retroperitoneal tissues above the left renal vein and superior mesenteric artery, yielding the mobilization of the pancreatic body widely. Then, the splenic artery was divided behind the ventrally lifted pancreas as an artery-first approach. The regional lymphadenectomy was performed in an en bloc manner consecutively in the same operative field. The neck of the pancreas was transected with a linear stapler after mobilization of the spleen. RESULTS In nine patients (five men and four women) aged 76 years (range: 64-82 years), the operative time was 398 min (276-482 min) with the estimated blood loss of 40 ml (0-80 ml). No patients developed grade B/C pancreatic fistula or delayed gastric emptying. Postoperative complications classified as grade III in the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in one patient (abdominal abscess). The pathology confirmed R0 resection in all patients who had pancreatic cancer (n = 5), IPMNs (n = 3), and high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) (n = 1). The number of retrieved lymph nodes was 35 (11-49).

In many healthcare settings, longitudinal trends indicate rising numbers and proportions of patients admitted to ICU who are older; elsewhere, including some parts of the UK, a decrease has raised concerns with regard to rationing according to age. Our aim was to investigate admission trends in Wales, where critical care capacity has not risen in the last decade. We used the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank to identify and characterise critical care admissions in patients aged ≥ 18 years from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. We categorised 85,629 ICU admissions as youngest (18-64 years), older (65-79 years) and oldest (≥ 80 years). The oldest group accounted for 15% of admissions, the older age group 39% and the youngest group 46%. Relative to the national population, the incidence of admission rates per 10,000 population in the oldest group decreased significantly over the study period from 91.5/10,000 in 2008 to 77.5/10,000 (a relative decrease of 15%), and among the older group from 89.2/10,000 in 2008 to 75.3/10,000 in 2017 (a relative decrease of 16%). We observed significant decreases in admissions with high comorbidity (modified Charlson comorbidity index); increases in the proportion of older patients admitted who were considered 'fit' rather than frail (electronic frailty index); and decreases in admissions with a medical diagnosis. In contrast to other healthcare settings, capacity constraints and surgical imperatives appear to have contributed to a relative exclusion of older patients presenting with acute medical illness.","Pugh, R J; Bailey, R; Szakmany, T; Al Sallakh, M; Hollinghurst, J; Akbari, A; Griffiths, R; Battle, C; Thorpe, C; Subbe, C P; Lyons, R A",Anaesthesia,506,8

Iron status can affect immune function and wound healing, thus may influence peri-operative complications. Common mutations in the HFE gene, the gene responsible for the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis, may impact iron status. METHODS We analyzed 1064 extremely obese Caucasian individuals who underwent open and laparoscopic Roux-n-Y gastric bypass surgery at the Geisinger Clinic. Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and iron binding capacity were measured pre-operatively. All patients had intra-operative liver biopsies and were genotyped for the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene. Associations between surgical complications and serum iron measures, HFE gene status, and liver iron histology were determined. RESULTS We found that increased serum iron and transferrin saturation were present in patients with any post-operative complication, and that increased serum ferritin was also increased in patients with major complications. Increased serum transferrin saturation was also associated with wound complications in open RYGB, and transferrin saturation and ferritin with prolonged lengths of stay. The presence of 2 or more HFE mutations was associated with overall complications as well as wound complications in open RYGB. No differences were found in complication rates between those with stainable liver iron and those without. CONCLUSION Serum iron status and HFE genotype may be associated with complications following RYGB surgery in the extremely obese.","Gerhard, Glenn S; Chokshi, Ravi; Still, Christopher D; Benotti, Peter; Wood, G Craig; Freedman-Weiss, Mollie; Rider, Cody; Petrick, Anthony T",Patient safety in surgery,506,1

Sleep is essential to health, and children and adolescents with primary headaches have more sleep complaints than do healthy controls. A treatment approach that addresses multifactorial causes is likely important. Nonpharmacological interventions seem promising. However, knowledge about effective strategies is limited. The objective of this review is to assess the effect of nonpharmacological interventions in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among children and adolescents with primary headache in order to identify useful strategies. Patients and methods Outcome measures are pain, sleep, Qol, and coping versus no intervention or control intervention. Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched for eligible trials. ClinicalTrials.gov. was searched for ongoing trials. Initial searches yielded 2588 publications. After initial screening and subsequent full-text review and quality assessment, 13 RCTs reported in 15 articles were selected for review. All reviewers independently assessed study quality using the CONSORT criteria for nonpharmacological interventions. Results Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), including education on pain-related topics, sleep, coping, and stress management, is an effective strategy for reducing headache and pain within groups over time. Fifteen studies assessed pain, 3 studies assessed sleep, 6 studies assessed Qol, and 11 studies assessed coping. Conclusion Strategies identified as useful were parts of CBT interventions. However, it was not possible to identify a single effective intervention addressing pain, sleep, Qol, and coping in children and adolescents with headache, primarily because sleep was infrequently addressed. Various aspects of Qol and coping strategies were assessed, rendering comparison difficult. Strategies for future interventions should include descriptions of theory-driven CBT interventions, depending on clinical setting and based on local resources, to promote a solid evidence base for nonpharmacological interventions.","Klausen, Susanne Hwiid; Rønde, Gitte; Tornøe, Birte; Bjerregaard, Lene",Journal of pain research,506,1

METHODS We explored the publications on coronavirus in the Web of Science core collection (WOSCC) from 2003 to 2020. Bibliometric analysis, evaluating knowledge base, and research hotspots were performed based on CiteSpace V (Drexel University, Chaomei Chen). RESULTS There were a total of 8433 publications of coronavirus. The research on coronavirus boomed when a novel coronavirus triggered outbreaks in people. The leading country was the United States, and the leading institution was the University of Hong Kong. The most productive researchers were: Yuen KY, Drosten C, Baric RS. The keywords analysis showed that SARS-CoV, infection, acute respiratory syndrome, antibody, receptor, and spike protein were research hotspots. The research categories analysis showed that virology, microbiology, veterinary sciences, infectious diseases, and biochemistry and molecular biology were hot research categories. CONCLUSIONS Bibliometric analysis of the literature shows the research on coronavirus boomed when a novel coronavirus triggered outbreaks in people. With the end of the epidemic, the research tended to be cooling. Virus identification, pathogenesis, and coronavirus-mediated diseases attracted much attention.

Therefore, in this paper, machine learning that incorporates the moving average method is proposed to reflect the latest fluctuation trend. Furthermore, a forecasting method using deep learning is proposed to improve forecasting accuracy. In the method using deep learning, the analysis results on the normalization of training data and the contribution of meteorological data to the forecasting accuracy are described. It was found that the introduction of the moving average into the explanatory variables is effective when the trend of the number of customers visiting fluctuates rapidly.

As oncologists play a key role in initiating GOC discussions, we implemented a clinical initiative to improve their GOC documentation and evaluated the impact of such documentation on patient care during the EOL (last 30 days of life). Methods: We launched the initiative among 270 medical oncologists in an academic cancer center in 4/2020. A newly formulated GOC note to ease documentation was embedded in oncology outpatient and inpatient notes. Oncologists completed components in the GOC note that applied to their communication about GOC with the patient: 1) cancer natural history, 2) patient goals, and 3) EOL discussion: patient resuscitation preferences and, when pertinent, receptivity to hospice referral. GOC notes were pulled to a centralized location in the electronic health record (EHR) that displays documents relevant to patients' values, goals and preferences. A dashboard allowed continual monitoring of documentation performance. We evaluated the association between GOC notes and outcomes of patient care at EOL. We further analyzed the impact of EOL discussion on EOL care. Results: The GOC note completion rate steadily rose after implementation. GOC notes were present in EHR for 46% of 10,006 patients who were either seen in outpatient clinic or discharged from hospital during the 1 week of January 2021. Among 1790 patients who died between 7/1/20 and 12/31/20 and had either at least an outpatient visit or hospitalization during EOL, the median days from first GOC note and first EOL discussion to the patient's death were 71 days and 24 days, respectively. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that patients who had GOC note 60 days before death spent less time as inpatient during EOL (0.4 day less/patient, from 8.1 to 7.7, P = 0.01). When EOL discussion was documented 30 days before death, patients also spent less time in the hospital (1.2 days less/patient, from 9.7 to 8.5, P &lt; 0.001) and in the ICU (0.3 days less/patient, from 1.7 to 1.4 ICU days, P = 0.04), and were 4% less likely to receive chemotherapy (from 38% to 34%, P = 0.004) at EOL. During the same period, among 1,009 patients with hospital admission in the last 30 days of life, those with a prior documented EOL discussion had shorter inpatient stay (7.7 vs 13.1 days, P &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to be discharged to hospice (34% vs 22%, P = 0.003). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we successfully implemented GOC documentation by medical oncologists that is easily visible by the full care team. Documentation of GOC including EOL discussion was associated with fewer days in the hospital and ICU, increased hospice referral, and lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy during patients' last 30 days of life.","Xiao, H.; Riley, M.; Donopria, R.; Martin, S.; Nelson, J.

This article reports an inductive content analysis of 500 randomly selected journal articles mentioning Covid-19, as recorded by the Dimensions scholarly database on 19 March 2021. Covid-19 mentions were coded for the influence of the disease on the research. Whilst two thirds of these articles were about biomedicine (e.g. treatments, vaccines, virology), or health services in response to Covid-19, others covered the pandemic economy, society, safety, or education. In addition, some articles were not about the pandemic but stated that Covid-19 had increased or decreased the value of the reported research or changed the context in which it was conducted. The findings relate only to Covid-19 influences declared in published journal articles. Research managers and funders should consider whether their current procedures are effective in supporting researchers to address the evolving demands of pandemic societies, particularly in terms of timeliness.

At the beginning of an epidemic outbreak the computation of R0 relies on limited data based mostly on symptomatic cases, since asymptomatic infected individuals are not detected by the surveillance system. R0 has been widely used as an indicator to assess the dissemination of infectious diseases. Asymptomatic individuals are assumed to either become symptomatic after a fixed period of time or they are removed (recovery or disease-related death). We determine R0 understood as the expected secondary symptomatic cases produced by a symptomatic primary case through a chain of asymptomatic infections. R0 is computed directly by interpreting the model ingredients and also using a more systematic approach based on the next-generation operator. Reported Covid-19 cases data during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain are used to fit the model and obtain both values of R0 before and after the severe lockdown imposed in March 2020. The results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 was expanding within the population before the lockdown whereas the virus spreading was controlled two weeks after the lockdown.

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of wild-type CCR5 in an active conformation bound to the chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric Gi protein. The structure provides the rationale for the sequence-activity relation of agonist and antagonist chemokines. The N-terminus of agonist chemokines pushes onto an aromatic connector that transmits activation to the canonical GPCR microswitch network.

Aging and the dependence on mandatory levies applied to the employed population on the labor market represent a threat for the sustainability of public social protection systems. In terms of sustainability, our purpose was to highlight the factors influencing social insurance budgets, considering the fiscal policies implemented in six countries of Central and Eastern Europe and their particular labor market characteristics. Therefore, a panel study based on a regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares method (OLS) with cross section random effects was used to determine the correlations between funding sources and labor market specific indicators. The data analyzed led to relevant results that emphasize the dependence of social insurance budgets on positive factors such as the average level of salaries, the share of compulsory social contributions, the unemployment rate, and the human development index, suggesting the continuing need for professional and personal development of the workforce.","Popa, A.

Design/methodology/approach: Using covariance-based structural equations modelling and based on contingency theory, a hypothesized model was developed and tested. The sample involves a survey of 214 public health institutions in Ghana. Findings: Both external and internal integration were found to have a significant positive effect on MCS information and, in turn, on the supply chain operational performance of public health institutions. Also, customer integration has a significant positive impact on the four dimensions with a corresponding impact on supply chain operational performance. Practical implications: The paper provides practitioners and policymakers with the usefulness of the contingency paradigm in enhancing the supply chain network of public health institutions during epidemics, hence, the need to adopt and develop the contingency approach in designing MCS within the public health sector. Effective public health management through a collaborative process between stakeholders (suppliers, customers and personnel) will mitigate stockouts of medical supplies and systematic disruptions in the public health supply chain. Originality/value: The MCSs – supply chain integration interaction on organizational performance is one of the areas that has received very little attention in the literature particularly in service-oriented organizations. In this regard, this paper represents one of the few studies in Africa that examines performance implications of MCS – supply chain nexus with respect to public health emergencies service-orientec organizations. The paper contributes to the literature by providing invaluable insights into the usefulness of the MCS in enhancing the supply chain performance of public health emergencies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Nartey, E.; Aboagye-Otchere, F.

Several therapies have been approved, or are going through clinical trials, aimed at the replacement of lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder. One candidate small molecule is ebselen, a selenium-containing antioxidant, which has been demonstrated to produce lithium-like effects, both in a murine model and in clinical trials. Here we present the crystallization and first structure of human IMPase covalently complexed with ebselen, a 1.47Å crystal structure (PDB entry 6ZK0). In the human-IMPase-complex ebselen, in a ring opened conformation, is covalently attached to Cys141, a residue located away from the active site. IMPase is a dimeric enzyme and, in the crystal structure, two adjacent dimers share four ebselen molecules, creating a tetramer with ∼222 symmetry. In the crystal structure presented in this publication, the active site in the tetramer is still accessible, suggesting that ebselen may function as an allosteric inhibitor, or may block the binding of partner proteins. Synopsis Here we present a 1.47Å crystal structure of human inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) bound to the inhibitor ebselen (PDB entry 6ZK0). In the structure, ebselen forms a seleno-sulfide bond with cysteine 141 and ebselen-mediated contacts between two dimers give a ∼222 tetramer.","Fenn, Gareth D.; Waller-Evans, Helen; Atack, John R.; Bax, Benjamin D.",bioRxiv,506,16

We found that neutrophils expressing intermediate levels of Ly6G (Ly6GInt) were present in mouse cancer models and more abundant in those with high rates of spontaneous metastasis. Maturation, age, tissue localization and functional capacity all drive neutrophil heterogeneity. Recent studies have proposed various markers to distinguish between these heterogeneous sub-populations; however, these markers are limited to specific models of inflammation and cancer. Here, we identify and define Ly6G expression level as a robust and reliable marker to distinguish neutrophils at different stages of maturation. Ly6GInt neutrophils were bona fide ‘immature neutrophils’ with reduced immune regulatory and adhesion capacity. Whereas the bone marrow is a more recognised site of granulopoiesis, the spleen also produces neutrophils in homeostasis and cancer. Strikingly, neutrophils matured faster in the spleen than in the bone marrow with unique transcriptional profiles. We propose that developmental origin is critical in neutrophil identity and postulate that neutrophils that develop in the spleen supplement the bone marrow by providing an intermediate more mature reserve before emergency haematopoiesis.","Mackey, John B.

Unexpectedly, lower dose prime and longer prime-boost intervals have yielded higher efficacies in clinical trials. To elucidate the origins of these effects, we developed a stochastic simulation model of the germinal centre (GC) reaction and predicted the antibody responses elicited by different vaccination protocols. The simulations predicted that a lower dose prime could increase the selection stringency in GCs due to reduced antigen availability, resulting in the selection of GC B cells with higher affinities for the target antigen. The boost could relax this selection stringency and allow the expansion of the higher affinity GC B cells selected, improving the overall response. With a longer dosing interval, the decay in the antigen with time following the prime could further increase the selection stringency, amplifying this effect. The effect remained in our simulations even when new GCs following the boost had to be seeded by memory B cells formed following the prime. These predictions offer a plausible explanation of the observed paradoxical effects of dosage and dosing interval on vaccine efficacy. Tuning the selection stringency in the GCs using prime-boost dosages and dosing intervals as handles may help improve vaccine efficacies.","Garg, A.

Understanding reinfection, including protection longevity after natural infection, will allow us to better know the prospect of herd immunity, which hinges on the assumption that natural infection generates sufficient, protective immunity. The primary aim of this paper is to provide data on SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over a 10-month period. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to establish the incidence of reinfection of COVID-19 among healthcare employees who experienced a prior COVID-19 infection. Design: This observational cohort study followed a convenience sample of 2,625 participants who experienced a COVID-19 infection for subsequent COVID-19 infection. Setting: Healthcare employees were recruited across a large Midwestern healthcare system. Positive PCR test results were administered and recorded by the system-affiliated lab serving Illinois and Wisconsin. Participants: Adult healthcare system employees who enrolled in a research study focused on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (N = 16,357) and had at least one positive PCR test result between March 1, 2020 and January 10, 2021 were included (N = 2,625). Exposure: Positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary outcome is incidence of COVID-19 reinfection, defined by current CDC guidelines (i.e. subsequent COVID-19 infection [≥] 90 days from prior infection). COVID-19 recurrence, defined as subsequent COVID-19 infection after prior infection irrespective of time, is also described. Results: Of 2,625 participants who experienced at least one COVID-19 infection during the 10-month study period, 156 (5.94%) experienced reinfection and 540 (20.57%) experienced recurrence after prior infection. Median days were 126.50 (105.50-171.00) to reinfection and 31.50 (10.00-72.00) to recurrence. Incidence rate of COVID-19 reinfection was 0.35 cases per 1,000 person-days, with participants working in COVID-clinical and clinical units experiencing 3.77 and 3.57 times, respectively, greater risk of reinfection relative to those working in non-clinical units. Incidence rate of COVID-19 recurrence was 1.47 cases per 1,000 person-days. Conclusions and Relevance: This study supports the consensus that COVID-19 reinfection, defined as subsequent infection [≥] 90 days after prior infection, is rare, even among a sample of healthcare workers with frequent exposure.","Rivelli, A.; Fitzpatrick, V.; Blair, C.; Richards, J.; Copeland, K.",,506,2

Here, we address this question by studying the CD4+ T cell response in unexposed individuals to live attenuated yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine. We quantified virus-specific population dynamics over time using class II peptide-MHC tetramers. Our data revealed that, even in the absence of known viral exposure, memory phenotype T cells were found in the majority of virus-specific precursors in healthy adults. Pre-existing memory T cells can be divided into two groups; abundant pre-vaccine populations that underwent limited overall expansion and rare cells that generated naïve-like responses and preferentially contributed to the memory repertoire after vaccination. Single cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing was used to track the evolution of immune responses to different epitopes and showed an association between preservation of unexpanded TCRs before exposure and the robustness of post-vaccine responses. Instead of a further increase in pre-established TCR clones, vaccination boosted the representation of rare TCRs. Thus, vaccine restructures the abundance and clonal hierarchy of virus-specific T cells. Our results link T cell precursor states to post-exposure responses, identifying peripheral education of virus-specific repertoire as a key component of effective vaccination. ∘ YFV-specific precursors contain abundant memory phenotype cells in healthy adults. ∘ Precursor frequency and phenotype are linked to post-immune response. ∘ Vaccination recruits rare virus-specific populations. ∘ Vaccination overrides pre-established clonal hierarchy","Pan, Yi-Gen; Aiamkitsumrit, Benjamas; Bartolo, Laurent; Wang, Yifeng; Lavery, Criswell; Marc, Adam; Holec, Patrick V.; Rappazzo, C.

Methods In the Recovery- Respiratory Support multi-center, three-arm, open-label, adaptive, randomized controlled trial, adult hospitalized patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, deemed suitable for treatment escalation, were randomly assigned to receive CPAP, HFNO, or conventional oxygen therapy. Comparisons were made between each intervention and conventional oxygen therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of tracheal intubation or mortality within 30-days. Results Over 13-months, 1272 participants were randomized and included in the analysis (380 (29.9%) CPAP; 417 (32.8%) HFNO; 475 (37.3%) conventional oxygen therapy). The need for tracheal intubation or mortality within 30-days was lower in the CPAP group (CPAP 137 of 377 participants (36.3%) vs conventional oxygen therapy 158 of 356 participants (44.4%); unadjusted odds ratio 0.72; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96, P=0.03). There was no difference between HFNO and conventional oxygen therapy (HFNO 184 of 414 participants (44.4%) vs conventional oxygen therapy 166 of 368 participants (45.1%); unadjusted odds ratio 0.97; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29, P=0.85). Conclusions CPAP, compared with conventional oxygen therapy, reduced the composite outcome of intubation or death within 30 days of randomisation in hospitalized adults with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. There was no effect observed, compared with conventional oxygen therapy, with the use of HFNO. (Funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research; ISRCTN 16912075).","Perkins, G.

There has been limited research on the impact of anticoagulant and antiplatelet choice in COVID-19. Methods This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of 933 patients with COVID-19 infection presenting between 01/02/2020 and 31/05/2020. Survival time at 90 days post-diagnosis and thromboembolism development were the measured outcomes. Results Of 933 total patients, mean age was 68 years and 54.4% were male. 297 (31.8%) did not survive at 90 days. A Cox proportional hazards model analysis found no statistically significant relationship between anticoagulant or antiplatelet choice and survival (p<0.05). 57 (6.3%) developed thromboembolism. Antiplatelet choice was not shown to have a statistically significant relationship with thromboembolism development. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use did not have a statistically significant impact on thromboembolism development (p<0.05). Therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use was associated with increased thromboembolism risk (Odds ratio = 14.327, 95% CI 1.904 - 107.811, p = 0.010). Conclusions Antiplatelet choice was shown to have no impact on survival or thromboembolism development in COVID-19. Anticoagulant choice did not impact survival or thromboembolism development, aside from LMWH. Therapeutic LMWH use was associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. However, it should be noted that the sample size for patients using therapeutic LMWH was small (n=4), and there may be confounding variables affecting both LMWH use and thromboembolism development. These findings should be repeated with a larger sample of patients using therapeutic LMWH with additional adjustment for cofounding variables.","Salmon, T.; Titley, M.; Noori, Z.; Crosby, M.; Sankaranarayanan, R.",,506,17

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the ABO blood group types and mortality in patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Methods: This cross-sectional study included 427 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020. SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid was investigated in the naso/oropharyngeal swab samples of the patients by polymerase chain reaction. The blood group types, clinical and demographic data of the cases were obtained from the hospital automation system and patient files. Results: The age range of the patients was between 18 and 96, and 53.4% (228/427) of them were male. The ABO blood group distribution was 47.1% A, 29.5% O, 15.9% B, 7.5% AB. The overall mortality rate of COVID-19 cases was 16.9%. COVID-19 mortality risks were not significant in any of the ABO blood group types. Conclusion: We did not find a significant relationship between blood group types and mortality in patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and received treatment and follow-up.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data show distinct and severe manifestations in children necessitating critical care. Children need prioritization as they are susceptible to COVID-19 as part of the family cluster, varied presentations, and mortality. The purpose of this report is to discuss the optimization of the health care system for pediatric care. The key initiatives were to identify our objectives, bring out changes to the organizational processes, and integrate the same into the existing system. A systems approach to health care delivery by optimizing infrastructure, human resources, materials, funding, leadership, and governance was undertaken. This resulted in creation of distinct COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 service areas, management protocols, and trained health care workers. Partnership was forged with the public health system. This preparedness and continued responses to the demands of the health care system helped us manage children ranging from neonates to adolescents efficiently. Though the health care system is mostly open, acting upon the modifiable factors gave better preparedness in a short time.","Shenoy, R. D.; Nayak, P.; Jacob, A. M.; Rao, S.

We explored whether CURB-65, PSI, and APACHE-II could predict COVID-19 pneumonia severity and mortality. We included 167 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in this retrospective study. The severity and 30-day mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia were predicted using PSI, CURB-65, and APACHE-II scales. Kappa test was performed to compare the consistency of the three scales. There was a significant difference in the distribution of the scores of the three scales (P &lt; 0.001). Patients with PSI class ⩽III, CURB-65 ⩽1, and APACHE-II-I all survived. The ROC analysis showed the areas under the curve of the PSI, CURB-65, and APACHE-II scales were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74–0.93), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69–0.90), and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75–0.92), respectively. Our findings suggest that PSI and CURB-65 might be useful to predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia.

The number of chest X-rays required to be reviewed by doctors of relevant specialties is more than ever before. Besides, in the process of recognition, there are many difficulties for human identification of chest X-ray images, such as the naked eye is difficult to find tiny abnormalities, the chest X-ray images researchers have is limited and doctors is unfamiliar with this new disease. In this case, it is very necessary to use deep learning to help doctors diagnose pneumonia and solve some urgent difficulties. In the field of deep learning, transfer learning focuses on saving solution model of previous problems, and takes advantage of it on other different but related problems. Therefore, we can use the existed Imagenet model to help us train the dataset of COVID-19 and pneumonia. Moreover, deep learning depends on a large amount of data, but when the data is few, data augmentation is able to increase data by some methods, so it is a effective way to overcome the lack of train data. In terms of the good function of these two ways, we use them to improve performance and help doctors improve diagnosis so as to relieve the current tense medical situation.","Li, Zhe",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,506,24

Here we report that several commensal bacteria contribute to the generation of cross-reactive IgA antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. We identified SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals with RBD-binding IgA antibodies at their mucosal surfaces. Conversely, neutralising monoclonal anti-RBD antibodies recognised distinct commensal bacterial species. Some of these bacteria, such as Streptococcus salivarius, induced a cross-reactive anti-RBD antibodies upon supplementation in mice. Conversely, severely ill COVID-19 patients showed reduction of Streptococcus and Veillonella in their oropharynx and feces and a reduction of anti-RBD IgA at mucosal surfaces. Altogether, distinct microbial species of the human microbiota can induce secretory IgA antibodies cross-reactive for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2.","Ninnemann, Justus; Budzinski, Lisa; Bondareva, Marina; Witkowski, Mario; Angermair, Stefan; Kreye, Jakob; Durek, Pawel; Reincke, S.

Dynamic energy simulations were performed using Termolog EpiX 11, first with conventional climate data and then with future year climate data exported from the CCWorldWeatherGen computational software. To date, many incentive actions are promoted for school renovations, but are these measures effective in preventing the discomfort that will be found due to overheating generated by climate change? Today, one of the main objectives in retrofit measures is the achievement of ZEB (Zero Energy Building) performance. Achieving this target requires first and foremost a high-performance envelope. This study evaluates the impact of retrofit strategies mostly applied to the school building envelope, over the years, considering three different time horizons, until 2080. Thermal performance indices and indoor operative temperature under free-floating were evaluated. The results highlight that, with a changing climate, it is no longer possible to assume a constant static condition to evaluate retrofit actions, but it is necessary to develop a predictive mathematical model that considers the design variability for future years. There is an urgent necessity to ensure both the safety and comfort of buildings while also anticipating future variations in climate.","Baglivo, C.",Sustainability,506,25

Objective: To develop and validate a questionnaire to assess attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and pandemic. Methods: We performed a reliability and validity study in a sample of the general population in Greece. Data were collected online through social media between 15 August and 7 September 2021. Thus, a convenience sample was obtained. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were assessed with a Delphi study, an exploratory factor analysis, and a test-retest study. Also, we calculated Cronbach coefficient alpha for the factors that emerged from the exploratory factor analysis. Results: The final study included 1959 adults from the general population in Greece. Our four-factor model explained 73% of the variance and confirmed out initial hypothesis regarding the factors of the questionnaire. In particular, we found the following four factors: (a) fear against the COVID-19 (five items), (b) information regarding the COVID-19 (two items), (c) compliance with hygiene measures (two items), and (d) trust in COVID-19 vaccination (seven items). Cronbach coefficients alpha for the four factors that emerged from the exploratory factor analysis were greater than 0.82. Pearson correlation coefficients for the 16 items and the four factors were greater than 0.67 (p-value<0.001 in all cases).

The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) is a WHO-led initiative to promote vaccine access equity to LMICs and is providing many of the doses available in these settings. However, initial doses are limited and countries, such as Madagascar, need to develop prioritization schemes to maximize the benefits of vaccination with very limited supplies. There is some consensus that dose deployment should initially target health care workers, and those who are more vulnerable including older individuals. However, questions of geographic deployment remain, in particular associated with limits around vaccine access and delivery capacity in underserved communities, for example in rural areas that may also include substantial proportions of the population. Methods: To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and simulated various vaccination allocation strategies for Madagascar. Simulated strategies were based on a number of possible geographical prioritization schemes, testing sensitivity to initial susceptibility in the population, and evaluating the potential of tests for previous infection. Results: Using cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 as the main outcome of interest, our results indicate that distributing the number of vaccine doses according to the number of elderly living in the region or according to the population size results in a greater reduction of mortality compared to distributing doses based on the reported number of cases and deaths. The benefits of vaccination strategies are diminished if the burden (and thus accumulated immunity) has been greatest in the most populous regions, but the overall strategy ranking remains comparable. If rapid tests for prior immunity may be swiftly and effectively delivered, there is potential for considerable gain in mortality averted, but considering delivery limitations modulates this. Conclusion: At a subnational scale, our results support the strategy adopted by the COVAX initiative at a global scale.","Rasambainarivo, F.; Ramiadantsoa, T.; Raherinandrasana, A.; Randrianarisoa, S.; Rice, B.

Methods: We analyzed administrative data from Ontario, Canada two ways: cross-sectional and longitudinal. First, we identified the percentage and characteristics of all family physicians who had a minimum of 50 billing days in 2019 but no billings during the first six months of the pandemic. Second, for each year from 2010 to 2020, we calculated the percentage of physicians who billed for services in the first quarter of the calendar year but submitted no bills between April and September of the given year. Results: We found 3.1% of physicians working in 2019 (N=385/12,247) reported no billings in the first six months of the pandemic. Compared with other family physicians, a higher portion were age 75 or older (13.0% vs. 3.4%, p<0.001), had fee-for-service reimbursement (38% vs 25%, p<0.001), and had a panel size under 500 patients (40% vs 25%, p<0.001).

So the accurate estimation of heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of HVAC system in a building is very much important. It has been studied that the building design parameters optimization approach alone can provide up to 62.1% electrical energy consumption reduction compared to buildings that are not designed for efficient energy usage. Recent research has demonstrated that a combination of existing HVAC technologies can offer effective solutions for energy conservation and thermal comfort.

It was not allowed to provide agricultural machinery services in different places across regions to reduce the flow and gathering of people. Improvement of utilization efficiency of agricultural machinery resources is required through scientific scheduling of agricultural machinery. With seizing the farming season and stabilizing production as the goal, this paper studied the scientific scheduling of tractors within the scope of town and established agricultural machinery operation scheduling model with the minimization of total scheduling cost as the optimization objective. Factors such as farmland area, agricultural machinery, and farmland location information and operating time window are considered in this model to improve the accuracy of the agricultural machinery operation scheduling model. The characteristics of multiple scheduling algorithms are analyzed comprehensively. The scheduling requirements of agricultural machinery operation to ensure spring ploughing are combined to design the agricultural machinery scheduling algorithm based on the SA algorithm. With Hushu Street, Jiangning District, Nanjing City, as an example, a comparative experiment is conducted on the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) designed in this paper and the empirical algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). The results suggest that the total cost of the scheduling scheme generated by the SA algorithm is 19,042.07 yuan lower than that by the empirical scheduling algorithm and 779.19 yuan lower than that by the genetic algorithm on average. Compared with the GA algorithm, the transfer distance, waiting cost, and delay cost of the SA algorithm are reduced by 11.6%, 100%, and 98.1% on average, indicating that the transfer distance of agricultural machinery in the scheduling scheme generated by the SA algorithm is shorter, so is the waiting and delay time. Meanwhile, it can effectively obtain the near-optimal solution that meets the time window constraint, with good convergence, stability, and adaptability.

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic had suspended dental practice globally for over 3 months. While dental practice is being resumed cautiously, standard infection control protocols that were traditionally overlooked are now being strictly implemented. Post-COVID-19, dental care is expected to see a drastic change in the way it is practiced. REVIEW RESULTS With a view on the natural history and disease dynamics of COVID-19, this review reports various aspects of dental care, viz., patient triaging, engineering and work practice controls, and administrative, financial, and ethical aspects of dental care during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Current evidence-based recommendations with regard to infection-control practices are discussed. A call for universal oral health care with suggestions regarding integration of medical and health care is also proposed. CONCLUSION COVID-19 is expected to be a watershed moment in the field of dentistry. While we expect to see positive changes in safe delivery of dental care, an increase in cost of availing care is imminent. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The practice of dentistry and dental infection control has undergone dimensional changes due to bloodborne infectious diseases such as hepatitis B virus infections and human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. Due to these pandemics, many regulatory organizations have provided safety recommendations and guidelines that impact the dental practice. Currently, we are faced with a highly infective disease with a high mortality rate among people with comorbidities and of predominantly droplet transmission and no concrete safety recommendations and guidelines. This manuscript addresses multiple issues, gaps, and pragmatic solutions in controlling transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental settings, during and after the pandemic.","Janakiram, Chandrashekar; Nayar, Suresh; Varma, Balagopal; Ramanarayanan, Venkitachalam; Mathew, Anil; Suresh, Rakesh; Puttaiah, Raghunath",The journal of contemporary dental practice,506,1

Countries that are most vulnerable to such outbreaks might be higher priorities for technical support. RAND created the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index to help U.S. government and international agencies identify these countries and thereby inform programming to preemptively help mitigate the spread and effects of potential transnational outbreaks. The authors employed a rigorous methodology to identify the countries most vulnerable to disease outbreaks. They conducted a comprehensive review of relevant literature to identify factors influencing infectious disease vulnerability. Using widely available data, the authors created an index for identifying potentially vulnerable countries and then ranked countries by overall vulnerability score. Policymakers should focus on the 25 most-vulnerable countries with an eye toward a potential ""disease belt"" in the Sahel region of Africa. The infectious disease vulnerability scores for several countries were better than what would have been predicted on the basis of economic status alone. This suggests that low-income countries can overcome economic challenges and become more resilient to public health challenges, such as infectious disease outbreaks.","Moore, Melinda; Gelfeld, Bill; Okunogbe, Adeyemi; Paul, Christopher",Rand health quarterly,506,2

Although the epidemiological aspects of the three 20th century influenza pandemics have been widely investigated, little is known about population behaviour in a pandemic situation. Such knowledge is however critical, notably for predicting population compliance with non pharmaceutical interventions. This paper reviews the relevant scientific literature for the 1918-1920, 1957-1958, 1969-1969 influenza epidemics and the 2003 SARS outbreak. Although the evidence base of most non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and personal protection measures is debated, it appears on the basis of past experience that NPIs implemented the most systematically, the earliest, and for the longest time could reduce overall mortality rates and spread out epidemic peaks. Adequate, transparent, and targeted communication on the part of public health authorities would be also of crucial importance in the event of a serious influenza pandemic.","Balinska, Marta; Rizzo, Caterina",PLoS currents,506,7

The minigenome was efficiently replicated in trans and packaged by the helper virus, leading to the formation of true recombinant and pseudorecombinant viruses containing the S proteins of both enteric and respiratory TGEV strains in their envelopes. The recombinants acquired an enteric tropism, and their analysis showed that they were generated by homologous recombination that implied a double crossover in the S gene resulting in replacement of most of the respiratory, attenuated strain S gene (nucleotides 96 to 3700) by the S gene of the enteric, virulent isolate. The recombinant virus was virulent and rapidly evolved in swine testis cells by the introduction of point mutations and in-phase codon deletions in a domain of the S gene (nucleotides 217 to 665) previously implicated in the tropism of TGEV. The helper virus, with an original respiratory tropism, was also found in the enteric tract, probably because pseudorecombinant viruses carrying the spike proteins from the respiratory strain and the enteric virus in their envelopes were formed. These results demonstrated that a change in the tropism and virulence of TGEV can be engineered by sequence changes in the S gene.","Sánchez, C M; Izeta, A; Sánchez-Morgado, J M; Alonso, S; Sola, I; Balasch, M; Plana-Durán, J; Enjuanes, L",Journal of virology,506,5

METHODS We reviewed consecutive patients with acute intracranial large artery occlusion who underwent endovascular treatment and examined their workups for embolic sources. Patient demographics, laboratory findings, hyperdense artery sign, and angiographic occlusion type (truncal-type or branching-site occlusion) were compared between embolic sources (+) and (-) groups. These variables were also compared between stentriever failure and success groups. Details of endovascular procedures were also compared according to occlusion type. RESULTS A total of 259 patients (mean age 70.3 years; M:F = 132:127) were finally included. Of these patients, 216 (83.4%) were assigned to the embolic sources (+) group after thorough evaluation. Young age, no coronary artery disease, and truncal-type occlusion (odds ratio [OR] 9.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.74-22.0) were independently associated with the embolic source (-) group. Of the overall group, 224 patients (86.5%) underwent stentriever-based endovascular treatment. Hypertension, diabetes, high C-reactive protein level, and truncal-type occlusion (OR 32.2; 95% CI 7.78-133.0) were independent predictors of stentriever failure. Truncal-type occlusion was associated with more reocclusion (77.3% vs 5.0%), resulting in recanalization failure by the stentriever (81.8% vs 20.3%), a longer puncture-to-recanalization time (118.0 vs 49.5 minutes), and more rescue treatment for final successful recanalization (78.9% vs 7.0%). CONCLUSIONS Angiographic occlusion type is an independent predictor of stentriever refractoriness and of the underlying stroke mechanism.","Baek, Jang-Hyun; Kim, Byung Moon; Kim, Dong Joon; Heo, Ji Hoe; Nam, Hyo Suk; Song, Dongbeom; Bang, Oh Young",Neurology,506,20

Viral infections often lead to bacterial superinfections. In vitro and animal models for influenza, as well as molecular microbiology study of viruses and bacteria, provide an understanding of the mechanisms that explain how respiratory viruses and bacteria combine to cause disease. This article focuses on viral and bacterial combinations, particularly synergism between influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae. RESULTS Potential mechanisms for synergism between viruses and bacteria include: virus destruction of respiratory epithelium may increase bacterial adhesion; virus-induced immunosuppression may cause bacterial superinfections; and inflammatory response to viral infection may up-regulate expression of molecules that bacteria utilize as receptors. Influenza and parainfluenza viruses possess neuraminidase (NA) activity, which appears to increase bacterial adherence after viral preincubation. Experimental studies demonstrate that viral NA exposes pneumococcal receptors on host cells by removing terminal sialic acids. Other studies show that inhibition of viral NA activity reduces adherence and invasion of S. pneumoniae, independently of effects on viral replication. Clinical studies reveal that influenza vaccination reduces the incidence of secondary bacterial respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS Detection of viral factors (e.g. high NA activity) that increase the likely potential of epidemic/pandemic influenza strains for causing morbidity and mortality from secondary bacterial infections provides new possibilities for intervention. Additional study is needed to identify the mechanisms for the development of bacterial complications after infections with respiratory syncytial virus and other important respiratory viruses that lack NA activity. Prevention of bacterial superinfection is likely to depend on effective antiviral measures.","Peltola, Ville T; McCullers, Jonathan A",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,506,17

The specificities of these MAbs to either the dimeric (140-kDa) or the monomeric (65-kDa) form of the HE glycoprotein were determined by Western immunoblotting experiments with purified virus and immunoprecipitation tests with [35S]methionine-labelled infected cell extracts. Four of these anti-HE MAbs inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the virus and three weakly neutralized its infectivity in vitro. In addition, competition binding assays allowed for the definition of two independent antigenic domains (domains A and D) and two overlapping antigenic domains (domains B and C) for the HE glycoprotein of the WD-associated strain; epitopes located within antigenic domain A were not associated with hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and virus neutralization activities.

To understand the mechanism of synthesis of these mRNAs, we studied how the synthesis of each mRNA was affected by UV irradiation at different time points after infection. When MHV-infected cells were UV irradiated at a late time in infection (5 h postinfection), the syntheses of the various mRNAs were inhibited to different extents in proportion to the sizes of the mRNAs. Analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics revealed that the UV target size of each mRNA was equivalent to its own physical size. In contrast, when cells were irradiated at 2.5 or 3 h postinfection, there appeared to be two different kinetics of inhibition of mRNA synthesis: the synthesis of every mRNA was inhibited to the same extent by a small UV dose, but the remaining mRNA synthesis was inhibited by additional UV doses at different rates for different mRNAs in proportion to RNA size. The analysis of the UV inactivation kinetics indicated that the UV target sizes for the majority of mRNAs were equivalent to that of the genomic-size RNA early in the infection. These results suggest that MHV mRNA synthesis requires the presence of a genomic-length RNA template at least early in the infection. In contrast, later in the infection, the sizes of the templates used for mRNA synthesis were equivalent to the physical sizes of each mRNA. The possibility that the genomic-length RNA required early in the infection was used only for the synthesis of a polymerase rather than as a template for mRNA synthesis was ruled out by examining the UV sensitivity of a defective interfering (DI) RNA. We found that the UV target size for the DI RNA early in infection was much smaller than that for mRNAs 6 and 7, which are approximately equal to or smaller in size than the DI RNA. This result indicates that even though DI RNA and viral mRNAs are synthesized by the same polymerase, mRNAs are synthesized from a larger (genomic-length) template. We conclude that a genomic-length RNA template is required for MHV subgenomic mRNA synthesis at least early in infection. Several transcription models are proposed.","Yokomori, K; Banner, L R; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,506,28

However, there is an important hesitance towards the vaccine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the vaccination hesitance and main concerns towards the vaccine among surgeons. METHODS An anonymous survey of 16 questions was sent to 138 Belgian surgeons before the start of vaccination in Belgium. The questions were divided into sections, evaluating demographics, COVID-19 test status and symptoms, the surgeon's opinion on the COVID-19 vaccination and their main concerns. RESULTS Ninety-three out of 138 surgeons (67.4%) completed the survey: two-third of them were residents. Sixty-nine surgeons (74.2%) do want to get vaccinated. Forty-two surgeons (45.2%) feel like they do not have enough information about the vaccine. Residents feel significantly more underinformed than consultants (52.3% and 29.0%, respectively). Surgeons who feel to be well-informed are more willing to get vaccinated (92.2%) compared to those who feel to have a lack of information (52.4%). The main concerns among surgeons include effectiveness (26.9%), safety and side effects (19.4%) and organisation and vaccination strategy (12.9%). Twenty-five surgeons (26.9%) have no concerns at all. CONCLUSION Most surgeons (74.2%) are ready for their COVID-19 vaccine. However, some of the surgeons are still doubtful about the vaccine. A lack of information plays a major role in their scepticism. A strong communication strategy is necessary to educate, reassure and motivate surgeons to get vaccinated.","Farid, Yasser; Vissers, Gino; Ortiz, Soccoro; Tondu, Thierry; Thiessen, Filip; Coppieters, Yves; Wauthy, Pierre",Acta chirurgica Belgica,506,16

Results: the World Health Organization has pointed out that the path to reduce the speed of circulation of the virus, control and decrease in the number of cases and deaths resulting from this pandemic can only be accomplished with mass adoption of fundamental measures that include hand hygiene, alcohol gel use, cough etiquette, cleaning surfaces, avoiding agglomerations and social distancing. The epidemiological curve of the disease clearly shows the devastating proportions in Italy, Spain and the United States, surpassing China in death records, due to the delay in adopting the aforementioned measures. In Brazil, the rapid progression in relation to the world and Latin America points to an important increase in the number of cases. Conclusion: this is possibly the most serious pandemic in recent human history, and its course can be influenced by the rigor in adopting individual and collective behavioral measures.","Oliveira, Adriana Cristina de; Lucas, Thabata Coaglio; Iquiapaza, Robert Aldo",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,506,24

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram data and primary survey data.","Suzumura, Toyotaro; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Napagao, Sergio Alvarez; Li, Irene; Maruyama, Hiroshi; Kanezashi, Hiroki; P'erez-Arnal, Raquel; Miyoshi, Kunihiko; Ishii, Euma; Suzuki, Keita; Shiba, Sayaka; Kurokawa, Mariko; Kanzawa, Yuta; Nakagawa, Naomi; Hanai, Masatoshi; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao",,506,16

A consequence, perhaps, of death becoming increasingly overmedicalised, nearly one in two UK nationals die institutional deaths. In this article we, two architectural scholars engaged in teaching, research and practice and a nurse and healthcare scholar with a focus on end-of-life care and peoples' experiences, wish to draw attention to a controversy resulting from a paucity in current literature on the terms of reference of the dying 'patient' as we navigate the future implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. This contributes to a relative lack of touchstones for architects to refer to when designing person-centred palliative care environments. Unlike common building types, architects are extremely unlikely to have lived experience of palliative care environments as patients; and therefore, require the help of healthcare professionals to imagine and empathise with the requirements of a person dying away from home. This paper includes a review of ageing and dying literature to understand, and distil from an architectural perspective, who, design professionals, are designing for and to remember the nuanced characteristics of those we hold a duty of care toward. We ask readers to heed the importance of accurate terms of reference, especially when commissioning and/or designing environments of palliative care.

LDCT images inevitably suffer from the degradation problem caused by complex noises. It was reported that, compared with commercial iterative reconstruction methods, deep learning (DL)-based LDCT denoising methods using convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved competitive performance. Most existing DL-based methods focus on the local information extracted by CNN, while ignoring both explicit non-local and context information (which are leveraged by radiologists). To address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning model named radiologist-inspired deep denoising network (RIDnet) to imitate the workflow of a radiologist reading LDCT images. Concretely, the proposed model explicitly integrates all the local, non-local and context information rather than local information only. Our radiologist-inspired model is potentially favoured by radiologists as a familiar workflow. A double-blind reader study on a public clinical dataset shows that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed model achieves the most impressive performance in terms of the structural fidelity, the noise suppression and the overall score. As a physicians-inspired model, RIDnet gives a new research roadmap that takes into account the behavior of physicians when designing decision support tools for assisting clinical diagnosis.

The Delta Valuation Model is a method for using changes in capitalization rates, lease rates, and vacancy rates to provide a measurable and supportable indication of the quantity of change in market conditions, the so-called time adjustment. It makes explicit what is implicit in the standard valuation formula V = I ÷ R and quantifies the effect of changes over time of I (net operating income) and R (overall capitalization rate). The Delta Valuation Model is a useful tool for quantifying changing market conditions in the absence of adequate local-market sales data. When local-market sales data do exist, they can also serve as a test of reasonableness. Such data provide a way to separate and account for the influence of macroeconomic forces and microeconomic (or local) sources. In declining markets, these data provide insight into economic obsolescence. This paper also discusses the limitations of the approach.

In this final study report, we evaluate an a priori hypothesis that greater benefit of bamlanivimab would be identified in those without detectable endogenous neutralizing antibody levels at study entry, especially if viral levels were high. METHODSHospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomized to receive bamlanivimab (7000mg) or placebo and followed for 90 days for sustained recovery (home for 14 consecutive days); recovery rate ratios (RRRs) are cited. RESULTSAmong 314 participants (163 on bamlanivimab and 151 on placebo), the median time to sustained recovery was 19 days and RRR=0.99 (95% CI: 0.79-1.22; p=0.89).

There has also been an exceedingly fast accumulation of new information on this novel virus. As the traditional peer-review process takes time, there is currently a significant gap between the ability to generate new data and the ability to critically evaluate it. This problem of an excess of mixed-quality data, or infodemic, is echoing throughout the scientific community. APPROACH: The authors aimed to help their colleagues at the Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, manage the COVID-19 infodemic with a methodologic solution: establishing an in-house mechanism for continuous literature review and knowledge distribution (March-April 2020). Their methodology included the following building blocks: a dedicated literature review team, artificial intelligence-based research algorithms, brief written updates in a graphical format, large-scale webinars and online meetings, and a feedback loop. OUTCOMES: During the first month (April 2020), the project produced 21 graphical updates. After consideration of feedback from colleagues and final editing, 13 graphical updates were uploaded to the center's website; of these, 31% addressed the clinical presentation of the disease and 38% referred to specific treatments. This methodology as well as the graphical updates it generated were adopted by the Israeli Ministry of Health and distributed in a hospital preparation kit. NEXT STEPS: The authors believe they have established a novel methodology that can assist in the battle against COVID-19 by making high-quality scientific data more accessible to clinicians. In the future, they expect this methodology to create a favorable uniform standard for evidence-guided health care during infodemics. Further evolution of the methodology may include evaluation of its long-term sustainability and impact on the day-to-day clinical practice and self-confidence of clinicians who treat COVID-19 patients.","Gruber, Amit; Ghiringhelli, Matteo; Edri, Oded; Abboud, Yousef; Shiti, Assad; Shaheen, Naim; Ballan, Nimer; Neuberger, Ami; Caspi, Oren",Acad. med,506,24

For the first time, we reconstruct the epidemic trajectory across the country and assess the level of under-reporting in infections and deaths using province-level age-stratified weekly all-cause mortality data. Our estimates suggest that as of 2021-09-17, only 48% (95% confidence interval 43-55%) of COVID-19 deaths in Iran have been reported. We find that in the most affected provinces such as Qazvin, Qom, and East Azerbaijan approximately 0.4% of the population have died of COVID-19 so far. We also find significant heterogeneity in the estimated attack rates across the country with 11 provinces reaching close to or higher than 100% attack rates. Despite a relatively young age structure in Iran, our analysis reveals that the infection fatality rate gradually increased over time in several provinces and reached levels that are comparable some of the high-income countries with a larger percentage of older adults, suggesting that limited access to medical services, coupled with undercounting of COVID-19-related deaths, can have a significant impact on COVID-19 fatalities. These results also show that despite several waves of infection and high attack rates in many provinces with largely unmitigated epidemics, herd immunity through natural infection has not been achieved.","Ghafari, Mahan; Karlinsky, Ariel; Watson, Oliver J; Ferretti, Luca; Katzourakis, Aris",,506,2

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, retrospective, and observational study. All cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-qPCR of patients seen at the hospital (emergency room, first-aid room, and ICU) were analyzed. The severity of the cases was classified according to the Chinese Consensus. RESULTS: Among the 115 children included, a predominance of boys (57%) was verified, and the median age was two years. A total of 22 children were hospitalized, 12 in the ICU. Of the total, 26% had comorbidities with a predominance of asthma (13%). Fever, cough, and nasal discharge were the most frequent symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 58% of children and gastrointestinal symptoms, by 34%. Three children were asymptomatic, 81 (70%) had upper airway symptoms, 15 (13%) had mild pneumonia, and 16 (14%) had severe pneumonia. Hospitalized children were younger than non-hospitalized children (7 months vs. 36 months).

Mitigating the enormous risk of COVID-19 to nursing home residents requires adequate data. The widely used Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset contains 2 derived statistics: Total Resident Confirmed COVID-19 Cases per 1000 Residents and Total Resident COVID-19 Deaths per 1000 Residents. These metrics provide a misleading picture, as facilities report cumulative counts of cases and deaths over different time periods but use a point-in-time measure as proxy for number of residents (number of occupied beds in a week), resulting in inflated statistics. We propose an alternative statistic to better illustrate the burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths across nursing facilities. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the CMS Nursing Home Compare and COVID-19 Nursing Home Datasets, we examined facilities with star ratings and COVID-19 data passing quality assurance checks for each reporting period from May 31 to August 16, 2020 (n = 11,115). METHODS: We derived an alternative measure of the number of COVID-19 cases per 1000 residents using the net change in weekly census. For each measure, we compared predicted number of cases/deaths by overall star rating using negative binomial regression with constant dispersion, controlling for county-level cases per capita and nursing home characteristics. RESULTS: The average number of cases per 1000 estimated residents using our method is lower compared with the metric using occupied beds as proxy for number of residents (44.8 compared with 66.6). We find similar results when examining number of COVID-19 deaths per 1000 residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Future research should estimate the number of residents served in nursing facilities when comparing COVID-19 cases/deaths in nursing facilities. Identifying appropriate metrics for facility-level comparisons is critical to protecting nursing home residents as the pandemic continues.","Miller, Katherine E M; Gorges, Rebecca J; Konetzka, R Tamara; Van Houtven, Courtney H",J Am Med Dir Assoc,506,16

Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed. This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk. Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration. To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L). For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D3 doses might be useful. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.","Grant, William B; Lahore, Henry; McDonnell, Sharon L; Baggerly, Carole A; French, Christine B; Aliano, Jennifer L; Bhattoa, Harjit P",Nutrients,506,20

While Facebook is one of the popular social media used by governments, there is only a scant of research on this platform. This paper aims to understand how government social media should be used and how its engagement changes in prodromal, acute and chronic stages of the pandemic. We collected 1664 posts and 10,805 comments from the Facebook pages of the Macao government from 1 January to 31 October 2020. Using word frequency and content analysis, the results suggest that the engagement was relatively low at the beginning and then surged in the acute stage, with a decreasing trend in the chronic stage. Information about public health measures maintained their engagement in all stages, whereas the engagement of other information was dropping over time. Government social media can be used for increasing vigilance and awareness in the prodromal stage; disseminating information and increasing transparency in the acute stage; and focusing on mental health support and recovery policies in the chronic stage. Additionally, it can be a tool for controlling rumors, providing regular updates and fostering community cohesion in public health crises.","Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao; Cai, Qixin; Jiang, Wenjing; Chan, Kin Sun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),506,16

If allowed to increase at the current rate, AMR could kill an estimated 10 million people per year and cost society approximately 100-200 trillion USD globally by 2050. The slow development of novel antimicrobials further exacerbates the problem. Most human antibiotic use occurs in homes and workplaces, where antibiotic-resistant infections may contribute to diminished performance and loss of work productivity. Employers in the private sector have the ability to reach large populations of employees and their families, raise awareness about AMR, and promote antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) among their workforce. The authors describe 4 steps a company can take to help advance AMS: (1) sign the AMR Pledge, (2) perform a gap analysis, (3) implement and/or modify standard practices, and (4) measure and report outcomes. Real-world examples are provided, including barriers faced, in order to successfully implement initiatives to promote better AMS. Behavioral methods to influence change in the workplace are also presented.

In such instances, the role of psychiatrists and other mental health providers as a source of psychological support to the public and frontline workers is indispensable and valuable. This study aims to assess the prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms, and their correlation, during the COVID-19 pandemic among psychiatry residents in Saudi Arabia. A total of 121 out of 150 psychiatry residents in Saudi Arabia completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Patient's Health Questionnaire for the assessment of burnout and depressive symptoms. Burnout symptoms were found in 27.3%, and another 27.3% reported having depression symptoms. In addition, 16.5% reported having both burnout and depressive symptoms, with a significant relationship between them. Participants in the first 2 years of training and having a history of receiving mental health treatment in the past 2 years were at higher risk. The need is urgent to increase investment in mental health services and to construct a plan to reduce this risk of burnout and depression among psychiatrists by developing preventative strategies to prevent burnout and promote wellness is more important than ever.","Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A; Assiri, Hatem; Alharbi, Hatim Yousef; Nasser, Abdullah; Alkhamees, Mohammad A",Hum Resour Health,506,26

Improper treatment of this waste poses serious risks of disease transmission to waste pickers, waste workers, health workers, patients, and the community in general through exposure to infectious agents. Poor management of the waste emits harmful and deleterious contaminants into society. However, contamination of highly contagious agents such as the COVID-19 virus has created enormous instability in healthcare waste handling and subsequent recycling because of the volume of the waste generated and its contagious nature. Several countries have adopted safety measures to combat this contamination and manage healthcare waste; however, these measures are insufficient and vary depending on the context of the country. In addition, the WHO has set out guidelines for management of healthcare waste. These guidelines are helping to manage the highly contagious healthcare waste resulting from the current pandemic. Proper healthcare waste management may add value by reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus and increasing the recyclability of materials instead of sending them to landfill. Disinfecting and sorting out healthcare waste facilitates sustainable management and allows their utilization for valuable purposes. This review discusses the different healthcare solid waste management strategies practiced in different countries, the challenges faced during this management, and the possible solutions for overcoming these challenges. It also provides useful insights into healthcare solid waste management scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic and a possible way forward.","Das, Atanu Kumar; Islam, Md Nazrul; Billah, Md Morsaline; Sarker, Asim",Sci Total Environ,506,1

Understanding trends and demands of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the infected and COVID-free populations are needed in long-term planning. We detail IR procedure trends in the first 27 weeks of the pandemic and compare with the pre-pandemic era. METHODS: In this IRB approved retrospective electronic case review, all IR patients in our institution from 1 January to 9 July 2020, the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) outbreak were included. IR procedures were classified using Interventional Radiology-Procedure Acuity Scale (IR-PAS) and category of IR procedures. Along with descriptive frequencies, the Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test of independence were performed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, 3655 IR procedures were performed compared to 3851 procedures pre-pandemic. No statistically significant difference in weekly IR caseloads across IR-PAS tiers between both periods (p = .088) and category of procedure (p = .054) were noted. General intervention procedures remained the largest proportion and musculoskeletal procedures the minority, in both periods. More general intervention radiology and oncology procedures were performed during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the SARS-CoV outbreak. Thirty-four (0.93%) IR procedures were performed on 30 COVID-19 patients. There was no IR procedure-related COVID-19 cross-transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Demand for IR procedures among COVID-free patients remains high, and IR procedures involving COVID-19 represents a fraction of the IR caseload. A sustainable model in providing timely IR services to COVID-free patients needs to be considered.","How, Guo Yuan; Pua, Uei",Insights Imaging,506,20

Although no perfect methodologies currently exist for the high-throughput, unbiased isolation of pure plasma exosomes2,3, investigation of exosome-enriched plasma fractions of extracellular vesicles can confer a glimpse into the endocytic pathway on a systems level. Here we conduct high-coverage lipidomics with an emphasis on sterols and oxysterols, and proteomic analyses of exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs hereafter) from patients at different temporal stages of COVID-19, including the presymptomatic, hyperinflammatory, resolution and convalescent phases. Our study highlights dysregulated raft lipid metabolism that underlies changes in EV lipid membrane anisotropy that alter the exosomal localization of presenilin-1 (PS-1) in the hyperinflammatory phase. We also show in vitro that EVs from different temporal phases trigger distinct metabolic and transcriptional responses in recipient cells, including in alveolar epithelial cells, which denote the primary site of infection, and liver hepatocytes, which represent a distal secondary site. In comparison to the hyperinflammatory phase, EVs from the resolution phase induce opposing effects on eukaryotic translation and Notch signalling.

Given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage, we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based testing capacity over the next few months. The objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up COVID-19 testing in India in the public sector. Methods: Potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts (9, 16 and 24 h). Additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qRT-PCR machines, leveraging spare capacity on available qRT-PCR machines not drafted into COVID-19 testing, to in-laboratory process optimization efforts. Results: Moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day. The capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qRT-PCR and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based machines available with the Multidisciplinary Research Units (MRUs), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP). Using combination/multiplex kits, and provision of automated RNA extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times. Interpretation & conclusions: Adopting these interventions could help increase public sector's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day. It is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce, procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts.","Gupta, Nivedita; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Rade, Kiran; Murhekar, Manoj; Gangakhedkar, Raman R; Nagar, Anu",Indian J Med Res,506,21

This paper examines the role of globalization on the pace of adoption of international travel-related non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) during the coronavirus pandemic. This study aims to offer advice on how to improve the global planning, preparation, and coordination of actions and policy responses during future infectious disease outbreaks with empirical evidence. METHODS AND DATA: We analyzed data on international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 of 185 countries from January to October 2020. We applied time-to-event analysis to examine the relationship between globalization and the timing of travel restrictions implementation. RESULTS: The results of our survival analysis suggest that, in general, more globalized countries, accounting for the country-specific timing of the virus outbreak and other factors, are more likely to adopt international travel restrictions policies. However, countries with high government effectiveness and globalization were more cautious in implementing travel restrictions, particularly if through formal political and trade policy integration. This finding is supported by a placebo analysis of domestic NPIs, where such a relationship is absent. Additionally, we find that globalized countries with high state capacity are more likely to have higher numbers of confirmed cases by the time a first restriction policy measure was taken. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the dynamic relationship between globalization and protectionism when governments respond to significant global events such as a public health crisis. We suggest that the observed caution of policy implementation by countries with high government efficiency and globalization is a by-product of commitment to existing trade agreements, a greater desire to 'learn from others' and also perhaps of 'confidence' in a government's ability to deal with a pandemic through its health system and state capacity. Our results suggest further research is warranted to explore whether global infectious disease forecasting could be improved by including the globalization index and in particular, the de jure economic and political, and de facto social dimensions of globalization, while accounting for the mediating role of government effectiveness. By acting as proxies for a countries' likelihood and speed of implementation for international travel restriction policies, such measures may predict the likely time delays in disease emergence and transmission across national borders.","Bickley, Steve J; Chan, Ho Fai; Skali, Ahmed; Stadelmann, David; Torgler, Benno",Global Health,506,16

Yet, description of acute invasive fungal sinusitis with its management in those patients is still scarce. This study aims to describe this recently increasing clinical entity in relation to COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective study. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study included patients diagnosed with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis after a recent COVID-19 infection. Antifungal agents given included amphotericin B, voriconazole, and/or posaconazole. Surgical treatment was restricted to patients with PCR negative results for COVID-19. Endoscopic, open, and combined approaches were utilized to eradicate infection. Follow-up for survived patients was maintained regularly for the first postoperative month. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients with a mean age of 52.92 ± 11.30 years old were included. Most common associated disease was diabetes mellitus (27.8%). Mycological analysis revealed infection with Mucor and Aspergillus species in 77.8% and 30.6% of patients, respectively. Sino-nasal, orbital, cerebral, and palatine involvement was found in 100%, 80.6%, 27.8%, and 33.3% of patients, respectively. The most common reported symptoms and signs are facial pain (75%), facial numbness (66.7%), ophthalmoplegia, and visual loss (63.9%). All patients were treated simultaneously by surgical debridement with antifungal medications except for two patients with PCR-positive swab for COVID-19. These two patients received antifungal therapy alone. Overall survival rate was 63.89% (23/36). CONCLUSION: Clinical suspicion of acute invasive fungal sinusitis among COVID-19 patients and early management with antifungal therapy and surgical debridement is essential for better outcomes and higher survival.

However, after a few weeks, relapse occurred, as indicated by symptoms of acute meningoencephalitis. Results of COVID-19 RT-PCR testing from her cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspiration specimens became positive again, but COVID-19 serum antibodies were negative. We therefore note that symptoms with neurologic involvement can be one of COVID-19's first presentations, or they can appear at relapse.

Variation in the TMPRSS2 gene may account for the difference in population disease susceptibility. The haplotype-based genetic sharing and structure of TMPRSS2 among global populations have not been studied so far. Therefore, in the present work, we used this approach with a focus on South Asia to study the haplotypes and their sharing among various populations worldwide. We have used next-generation sequencing data of 393 individuals and analysed the TMPRSS2 gene. Our analysis of genetic relatedness for this gene showed a closer affinity of South Asians with the West Eurasian populations therefore, host disease susceptibility and severity particularly in the context of TMPRSS2 will be more akin to West Eurasian instead of East Eurasian. This is in contrast to our prior study on ACE2 gene which shows South Asian haplotypes have a strong affinity towards West Eurasians. Thus ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have an antagonistic genetic relatedness among South Asians. We have also tested the SNPs frequencies of this gene among various Indian state populations with respect to the case fatality rate. Interestingly, we found a significant positive association between the rs2070788 SNP (G Allele) and the case fatality rate in India. It has been shown that the GG genotype of rs2070788 allele tends to have a higher expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung compared to the AG and AA genotypes, thus it might play a vital part in determining differential disease vulnerability. We trust that this information will be useful in underscoring the role of the TMPRSS2 variant in COVID-19 susceptibility and using it as a biomarker may help to predict populations at risk.","PANDEY, RUDRA KUMAR; Srivastava, Anshika; Singh, Prajjval Pratap; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer",,506,20

Molecular dynamics simulations also lead to the evaluation of conformational energies, average H-bonding distance, RMSD plots etc. Large RMSD fluctuations for the first 2 ns seem to provide the conformational and rotational changes associated with the drug molecule when it comes into the vicinity on the protease matrix. Snapshots of structural changes with respect to time vividly indicates that drug molecule has a profound impact on the binding sites as well as overall geometry of the protease moiety.

Identifying hospital-level factors that contribute to variations in care can provide opportunities to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate variation in post-cardiac arrest care within a large EMS system and explore the contribution of hospital-level factors. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis from a regional cardiac system serving over 10 million persons. Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are transported to 36 cardiac arrest centers with 24/7 emergent coronary angiography (CAG) capabilities and targeted temperature management (TTM) policies based on regional guidelines. We included adult patients &#8805;18 years with non-traumatic OHCA from 2016-2018. Patients with a Do-Not-Resuscitate order and those who died in the emergency department (ED) were excluded. For the TTM analysis, we also excluded patients who were alert in the ED. The primary outcome was receiving CAG or TTM after cardiac arrest. The secondary outcome was neurologic recovery (dichotomized to define a ""good"" outcome as cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2). We used generalized estimating equations including patient-level factors (age, sex, witnessed arrest, initial rhythm) and hospital-level factors (academic status, hospital size based on licensed beds, annual OHCA patient volume) to estimate the odds ratios associated with these variables. RESULTS: There were 7831 patients with OHCA during the study period; 4694 were analyzed for CAG and 3903 for TTM. The median and range for treatment with CAG and TTM after OHCA was 23% (12-49%) and 58% (17-92%) respectively. Hospital size was associated with increased likelihood of CAG, adjusted odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.05-2.86, p = 0.03. Academic status approached significance in its association with TTM, adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 0.98-2.91, p = 0.06. Overall, 28% of patients survived with good neurologic outcome, ranging from 17 to 43% across hospitals. CONCLUSION: Within this regional cardiac system, there was significant variation in use of CAG and TTM after OHCA, which was not fully explained by patient-level factors. Hospital size was associated with increased CAG.","Bosson, Nichole; Tolles, Juliana; Shavelle, David; Niemann, James T; Thomas, Joseph L; French, William J; Gausche-Hill, Marianne",Prehosp Emerg Care,506,20

Optimal conditions for solubilisation of dietary fibre were first determined at atmospheric pressure as 2% (w/v) of substrate concentration and 20 Endo-Glucanase Units of cellulase. Monitoring of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides released from apple by-product was carried out by means of a newly validated HPLC method with refractive index detector. A synergistic effect was observed when the combined HHP plus cellulase treatment was used. Thus, the application of 200 MPa at 50 °C for 15 min enabled a significant increase in the release of water-soluble polysaccharides (1.8-fold) and oligosaccharides (3.8-fold), as well as a considerable decrease in the time required (up to 120-fold), compared to control at 0.1 MPa. Therefore, this technology could be a promising alternative approach to transform an industrial by-product into a novel rich-in-oligosaccharide food ingredient and a step forward into shaping the world of prebiotics.","De la Peña-Armada, Rocío; Villanueva-Suárez, María José; Rupérez, Pilar; Mateos-Aparicio, Inmaculada",,506,32

A notable feature of our spatio-temporal model is that it considers the (a) temporal auto- and pairwise correlation of the two local time series (confirmed cases and death of the COVID-19), (b) dynamics between locations (propagation between counties), and (c) covariates such as local within-community mobility and social demographic factors. The within-community mobility and demographic factors, such as total population and the proportion of the elderly, are included as important predictors since they are hypothesized to be important in determining the dynamics of COVID-19. To reduce the model's high-dimensionality, we impose sparsity structures as constraints and emphasize the impact of the top ten metropolitan areas in the nation, which we refer (and treat within our models) as hubs in spreading the disease. Our retrospective out-of-sample county-level predictions were able to forecast the subsequently observed COVID-19 activity accurately. The proposed multi-variate predictive models were designed to be highly interpretable, with clear identification and quantification of the most important factors that determine the dynamics of COVID-19.

METHODS: All employees were invited to participate in a questionnaire and serological survey to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as part of a facility-wide quality improvement and infection prevention initiative regardless of clinical or nonclinical duties. The initiative was conducted from June 8 to July 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 2,900 employees, 51% participated in the study, revealing a positive SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 4.9% (72 of 1,476; 95% CI, 3.8%-6.1%). There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of antibody based on gender, age, frontline worker status, job title, performance of aerosol-generating procedures, or exposure to known patients with coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the hospital.

It is highly possible that people get infected with the disease by breathing and contact with items contaminated by the aerosolized virus. However, the aerosolized virus transmission and trajectories in various meteorological environments remain unclear. This paper has investigated the movement of aerosolized viruses from a high concentration source across a dense urban area. The case study looks at the highly air polluted areas of London: University College Hospital (UCH) and King's Cross and St Pancras International Station (KCSPI). We explored the spread and decay of COVID-19 released from the hospital and railway stations with the prescribed meteorological conditions. The study has three key findings: the primary result is that the concentration of viruses decreases rapidly by a factor of 2-3 near the sources although the virus may travel from meters up to hundreds of meters from the source location for certain meteorological conditions. The secondary finding shows viruses released into the atmosphere from entry and exit points at KCSPI remain trapped within a small radial distance of &lt; 50 m. This strengthens the case for the use of face coverings to reduce the infection rate. The final finding shows that there are different levels of risk at various door locations for UCH;depending on which door is used there can be a higher concentration of COVID-19. Although our results are based on London, since the fundamental knowledge processes are the same, our study can be further extended to other locations (especially the highly air polluted areas) in the world. © 2021 Author(s).","Zheng, J.; Wu, X.; Fang, F.; Li, J.; Wang, Z.; Xiao, H.; Zhu, J.; Pain, C.; Linden, P.; Xiang, B.",Physics of Fluids,506,20

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described. METHODS: Adult inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) with COVID-19 who underwent multiple (&#8805;5 times) nucleic acid tests with nasal and pharyngeal swabs were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including general patients (n = 70), severe patients (n = 195), and critical patients (n = 43). Laboratory data, demographic data, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The fitted polynomial curve was used to explore the association between serial viral loads and illness severity. RESULTS: Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment. Critical patients had the highest viral loads, in contrast to the general patients showing the lowest viral loads. The viral loads were higher in sputum compared with nasal and pharyngeal swab (P = .026). The positive rate of respiratory tract samples was significantly higher than that of gastrointestinal tract samples (P < .001).

Unlike many other EaaS tools that focus primarily on fixed sample A/B testing, Comparison Lift deploys a custom bandit-based experimentation algorithm. The advantages of the bandit-based approach are two-fold. First, it aligns the randomization induced in the test with the advertiser's goals from testing. Second, by adapting experimental design to information acquired during the test, it reduces substantially the cost of experimentation to the advertiser. Since launch in May 2019, Comparison Lift has been utilized in over 1,500 experiments. We estimate that utilization of the product has helped increase click-through rates of participating advertising campaigns by 46% on average. We estimate that the adaptive design in the product has generated 27% more clicks on average during testing compared to a fixed sample A/B design. Both suggest significant value generation and cost savings to advertisers from the product.","Geng, Tong; Lin, Xiliang; Nair, Harikesh S.; Hao, Jun; Xiang, Bin; Fan, Shurui",,506,20

ACE2 has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Thus, interferon-induced variability in ACE2 expression levels could be important for susceptibility to COVID-19 or its outcomes. Here, we report the discovery of a novel, transcriptionally independent truncated isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In The Cancer Genome Atlas, the expression of dACE2 was enriched in squamous tumors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 amino-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, an inflammatory tumor microenvironment or viral co-infections is unlikely to increase the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.","Onabajo, Olusegun O; Banday, A Rouf; Stanifer, Megan L; Yan, Wusheng; Obajemu, Adeola; Santer, Deanna M; Florez-Vargas, Oscar; Piontkivska, Helen; Vargas, Joselin M; Ring, Timothy J; Kee, Carmon; Doldan, Patricio; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Mendoza, Juan L; Boulant, Steeve; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila",Nat Genet,506,20

This may be due to respiratory infections, chronic granulomatous diseases, medications, and connective tissue disorders. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with permanent pulmonary architectural distortion and irreversible lung dysfunction. Available clinical, radiographic, and autopsy data has indicated that pulmonary fibrosis is central to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and MERS pathology, and current evidence suggests that pulmonary fibrosis could also complicate infection by SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this review is to explore the current literature on the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 infection. We evaluate the evidence in support of the putative risk factors for the development of lung fibrosis in the disease and propose risk mitigation strategies. We conclude that, from the available literature, the predictors of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 infection are advanced age, illness severity, length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation, smoking and chronic alcoholism. With no proven effective targeted therapy against pulmonary fibrosis, risk reduction measures should be directed at limiting the severity of the disease and protecting the lungs from other incidental injuries.","Ojo, Ademola S; Balogun, Simon A; Williams, Oyeronke T; Ojo, Olusegun S",Pulm Med,506,22

Home quarantine, online classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered increased mental health problems of medical students. Although there has been an increasing literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic still need to be expanded. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims at assessing depression of medical students taking online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigating the role of coping styles as a mediator between resilience and depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students with stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province in China was completed between March 20th, 2020 and April 10th, 2020. The participants responded to a self-administered smartphone-based questionnaire which included Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Ego-Resilience scale (ER-89). Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. Regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in their training), how well they adapted to online classes, their levels of resilience, and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P<.05). Resilience and positive coping style were negatively related to depression and negative coping style was positively related to depression (P<.01). SEM showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles(P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: It was found in the present study the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during COVID-19, which was of significant implications for further study. Future studies and interventions are supposed to be aimed at improving resilience and promoting positive coping style.","Zhao, Lina; Sznajder, Kristin; Cheng, Dan; Wang, Shimeng; Cui, Can; Yang, Xiaoshi",J. med. internet res,506,26

For the fulfillment of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the promotion of preventive care medicine through HAI management is a crucial issue. This study explores the perspectives of Saudi tertiary healthcare workers (HCWs) on HAIs and infection control measures. METHODS: Quantitative data were assessed to determine HCWs' knowledge of HAI and their attitudes towards and practice of infection control measures. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 40 doctors and nurses. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Further, routine sterile procedures in the wards and intensive care units were video recorded, and the footage was discussed by the infection control team and the personnel involved in the videos. This discussion was videographed and transcribed. Both interview data and reflective discussion of the video were analysed using thematic analysis. The quantitative data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Kruskal-Wallis test revealed no difference in mean knowledge, attitude, or practice scores between nurses/ doctors or the genders. There was a significant difference in knowledge score and practice scores between the Intensive care unit & the Paediatric ward /infection control department with the maximum scores in knowledge and practice among participants from the intensive care unit. Logistic regression analysis for dependent variables (knowledge and attitude) and independent variables like age, gender, designation, and departments was not significant. The qualitative data yielded four themes: knowledge of HAI and infection control, infection control measures in practice, a shortfall in infection control measures and HAI, and required implementation. Video-reflexive ethnography (VRE) revealed lapses in handwashing practice and proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially surgical masks. CONCLUSION: Early introduction of training programmes in medical and nursing schools and video demonstrations of appropriate infection control practices during sterile procedures would be highly beneficial to HCWs. A possible reason for the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in this part of Saudi Arabia could be a lapse in PPE usage. Intensive training programs for all the HCWs, strict vigilant protocols, and a willingness to change behaviour and practice, will significantly benefit the spread of outbreaks.","Paul, Esther; Alzaydani Asiri, Ibrahim A; Al-Hakami, Ahmed; Chandramoorthy, Harish C; Alshehri, Sarah; Beynon, C M; Alkahtani, Abdullah M; Asiri, Ali H",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,506,20

This study aimed to assess lifestyle changes affecting weight, sleep, mental health, physical activity, and dietary habits prospectively from before COVID-19 to during lockdown. METHODS: A total of 297 Saudi women, aged 19-30 years (mean age, 20.7 ± 1.4 years), were interviewed at two time points, before and during the quarantine. The data collected included anthropometrics, sociodemographic data, clinical history, food frequency questionnaire responses, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores, Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) responses, and Perceived Stress Scale measures. In addition, during quarantine, COVID-19 and nutrition-related information and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores were collected. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the indicators of weight gain and loss from before COVID-19 (baseline) until during lockdown. RESULTS: Although approximately half of the participants did not report a weight change, 30% revealed weight loss and 18%, weight gain. The variables associated with increased weight gain were self-quarantine since COVID-19 started (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 1.57-17.01, p = 0.007), age (OR: 1.53, 1.03-2.28, p = 0.04), and stress at baseline and during lockdown (OR: 1.15, 1.03-1.29, p = 0.01; OR: 1.10, 1.01-1.19, p = 0.03, respectively). The variables associated with a reduced risk of weight gain were the GPAQ score during lockdown (OR: 0.16, 0.04-0.66, p = 0.01), coffee consumption (OR: 0.36, 0.19-0.67, p = 0.01), and total sleep time (OR: 0.70, 0.51-0.97, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: While most young Saudi women experienced no weight change during the COVID-19 lockdown, one-third lost weight and a significant proportion gained weight. Factors associated with weight, such as stress, sleep hours, physical activity, and coffee consumption, highlight the need to carefully consider those at risk during future circumstances that may require lockdowns. These factors could also aid in implementing policies for future lockdowns and support those most at risk of gaining weight.","Al-Musharaf, Sara; Aljuraiban, Ghadeer; Bogis, Rania; Alnafisah, Ruyuf; Aldhwayan, Madhawi; Tahrani, Abd",PLoS One,506,20

In response, governments have made available temporary financial support to enterprises and workers affected. This paper evaluates a group currently excluded from this support, namely enterprises and workers in the undeclared economy, and a possible government policy response. To identify those involved, a 2019 Eurobarometer survey of undeclared work in Europe is reported. This reveals that one in every 132 European citizens relies wholly on undeclared earnings and the sectors and population groups involved. Given their reduced revenues and inability to access the temporary financial support, a voluntary disclosure initiative is recommended which brings undeclared enterprises and workers into the declared economy and onto the radar of state authorities by offering access to this temporary financial support if they disclose their previous undeclared work.","Williams, Colin C.; Kayaoglu, Aysegul",South East Euro.

We explore the importance of historical events shaping current vaccination practices. Combining historical records with survey datasets, we examine the Indian government's forced sterilization policy implemented in 1976-77 and find that greater exposure to forced sterilization has had a large negative effect on the current vaccination completion rate. We explore the mechanism for this practice and find that institutional delivery and antenatal care are low in states where policy exposure was high. Finally, we examine the consequence of lower vaccination, suggesting that child mortality is currently high in states with greater sterilization exposure. Together, the evidence suggests that government policies implemented in the past could have persistent impacts on adverse demand for health-seeking behavior, even if the burden is exceedingly high.","Sur, Pramod Kumar",,506,20

It is much less invasive with short hospital stays and presents similar results compared with SAVR. Different ""minimalist approach strategies"" were proposed in order to obtain this performance. In these settings, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) became less relevant for the TAVR procedure. The present review provides an update regarding the safety of TAVR without intraprocedural TEE. RECENT FINDINGS: Transthoracic echocardiography and fluoroscopy are the primary imaging tools during TAVR. Several studies proved that TAVR under local anesthesia without TEE is as safe as that performed under TEE guidance. However, not all patients have a proper window for TTE, and particular cases with complex anatomy can benefit from TEE support during the intervention. Intraprocedural TEE no longer plays a crucial role in the TAVR procedure, but in some instances, it remains of great help to detect and avoid complications.","Gheorghe, Livia; Brouwer, Jorn; Gutierrez, Alejandro; Rensing, Benno J W M; Rana, Bushra S; Ten Berg, Jurrien M; Eefting, Frank D; Timmers, Leo; Swaans, Martin J",Curr Cardiol Rep,506,16

As the pandemic spread, creating undue pressure on health care workers (HCWs), there was an urgent need for the development of appropriate interventions to protect their mental health. This study aims to study the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of anaesthesiologists in India and factors that influence their coping behaviour.MethodThe study was designed as a semi-structured, descriptive, cross-sectional, online open survey and conducted on Google forms between 21st May and 20th June 2020, among practicing anaesthesiologists across India. The participants were recruited by sending messages to their emails and through social media platforms. It created a small number of international respondents, who were also included (India = 301, rest = 23). The self-designed questionnaire had 30 questions in the form of multiple choices, checkboxes, linear scales and short comments. Informed consent was recorded at the outset. Details such as demographic characteristics, place and nature of work, pandemic related changes in duration or pattern of work, psychological symptoms during and after working hours, fears about quarantine, were collected in the survey. Statistical Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics for Mac Version 21.0 IBM Corp., USA)ResultAmong the 324 participating anaesthesiologists, a prevalence rate of 64.8% for stress, 51.2% for anxiety and 65.7% for depression was noted, which was double the rate from pre-pandemic studies. Those between the ages of 30 and 50 (p = 0.010 OR:2.191) and working in government run (p = 0.045 OR:2.564) COVID-19 hospitals in India (p = 0.002 OR:2.018), were particularly stressed (33.3%) and anxious (38%) than the rest. Increased workload, contracting the virus and becoming an infectious source to their family (88.6%) were their prime concern. Formulating standard operating procedures (SOP) (66.7%) and procuring personal protective equipment (PPE) (56.2%) were some of the challenges faced at work.

Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of international travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research to 13 November 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID-19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel (31 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low-certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID-19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low-certainty evidence that cross-border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID-19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure-based screening or test-based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure-based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low-certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test-based screening, one modelling study provided very low-certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low-certainty evidence). Quarantine (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low-certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low-certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure-based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel-related control measures from a societal perspective.","Burns, Jacob; Movsisyan, Ani; Stratil, Jan M; Biallas, Renke Lars; Coenen, Michaela; Emmert-Fees, Karl Mf; Geffert, Karin; Hoffmann, Sabine; Horstick, Olaf; Laxy, Michael; Klinger, Carmen; Kratzer, Suzie; Litwin, Tim; Norris, Susan; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M; von Philipsborn, Peter; Sell, Kerstin; Stadelmaier, Julia; Verboom, Ben; Voss, Stephan; Wabnitz, Katharina; Rehfuess, Eva",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,506,20

Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low-certainty evidence that cross-border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID-19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure-based screening or test-based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure-based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low-certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test-based screening, one modelling study provided very low-certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low-certainty evidence). Quarantine (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low-certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low-certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure-based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel-related control measures from a societal perspective.","Burns, Jacob; Movsisyan, Ani; Stratil, Jan M; Biallas, Renke Lars; Coenen, Michaela; Emmert-Fees, Karl Mf; Geffert, Karin; Hoffmann, Sabine; Horstick, Olaf; Laxy, Michael; Klinger, Carmen; Kratzer, Suzie; Litwin, Tim; Norris, Susan; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M; von Philipsborn, Peter; Sell, Kerstin; Stadelmaier, Julia; Verboom, Ben; Voss, Stephan; Wabnitz, Katharina; Rehfuess, Eva",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,506,20

SARS-CoV-2 is the causative virus and the infection as well as its symptoms are distributed across the multi-organ perimeters. Interactions between the host and virus governs the induction of 'cytokine storm' resulting various immunopathological consequences leading to death. Till now it has caused tens of millions of casualties and yet no credible cure has emerged to vision. This article presents a comprehensive overview on the two most promising remedial approaches that are being attempted for the management, treatment, and plausible cure of nCOVID-19. In this context, chemotherapeutic approach primarily aims to interrupt the interactions between the host and the virus causing inhibition of its entry into the host cell and/or its proliferation and suppressing the inflammatory milieu in the infected patients. On the other side, immunotherapeutic approaches aim to modulate the host immunity by fine tuning the inflammatory signaling cascades to achieve phylaxis from the virus and restoring immune-homeostasis. Considering most of the path-breaking findings, combinatorial therapy involving of chemotherapeutics as well as vaccine could usher to be a hope for all of us to eradicate the crisis.","Choudhury, Abhigyan; Mukherjee, Gargi; Mukherjee, Suprabhat",Hum. immunol,506,29

Though no specific drug has been developed so far, emerging agents have been confirmed effective or potentially beneficial to restrain it. Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) is a commonly used Chinese medical preparation to treat viral influenza, including in the fight against SARS in 2002–2003 in China. Recent data also showed that LHQW played a vigorous role in COVID-19 treatment. Purpose: This review will elucidate the pre-clinical and clinical evidence of LHQW in lung protection and antiviral activities, and provide timely data delivery for the exploration of effective treatment strategies in the therapy of COVID-19. Study design and method: The research data were obtained from the academic databases (up to August 8, 2020) including Pubmed, CNKI and Web of Science, on ethnobotany and ethno medicines. The search keywords for screening the literature information were “virus”, “COVID-19”, or “SARS-CoV-2”, and “Lianhua Qingwen”. The documents were filtered and summarized for final evaluation. Results: The collected evidence demonstrated that LHQW exhibited benefits against COVID-19. Impressively, LHQW in conjunction with conventional treatment could significantly improve COVID-19 patients as a synergetic strategy. The mechanisms were mainly involved the antiviral activity, and regulation of inflammation response as well as immune function. Conclusion: Although the data were far from adequate, the latest advances had shown the benefits of LHQW in COVID-19, especially in combination with other antiviral drugs. This review provides comprehensive evidence of LHQW as a complementary strategy for treating COVID-19. Nevertheless, imperious researches should be conducted to clarify the unconfirmed effects, regulatory mechanisms and adverse reactions of LHQW in treating COVID-19 by means of well designed randomized controlled trials.","Li, Liu-Cheng; Zhang, Zhi-Hui; Zhou, Wen-Cheng; Chen, Jie; Jin, Hua-Qian; Fang, Hong-Mei; Chen, Qin; Jin, Ye-Cheng; Qu, Jiao; Kan, Lian-Di",Biomed.

The subject is extremely visual and has therefore previously been a target for the development of technology enhanced learning initiatives over the last ten years. Today's students have come to expect the integration of technology in the classroom and remotely. They adjust quickly to the innovative use of new applications and software and have begun to integrate it within their own workflow for note taking and study aids. Given the intense drive towards blended deliveries of anatomy as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is easy to picture how the benefits of working in partnership with students (in order to achieve many of these aims) would be possible, particularly in difficult subjects like neuroanatomy. In doing so, it provides anatomists with new opportunities to engage students in a way that aligns well with best practice frameworks for engaging students through partnership. The current United Kingdom guidelines set out by Advance HE (a professional membership scheme for promoting excellence in higher education) strongly encourages the higher education community to seek out appropriate academic contexts where a balance of power can be struck between staff and student to create a community of practice. If such an approach can be fully embraced by anatomists, a strong argument can be made for seizing the opportunity to optimize the benefits of student partnership work in this discipline.","Border, Scott; Woodward, Charlotte; Kurn, Octavia; Birchall, Cara; Laurayne, Hailey; Anbu, Deepika; Taylor, Charlie; Hall, Samuel",Anat. sci. educ,506,23

These reports primarily relate to urban areas with widespread community transmission. The impact of COVID-19 on non-urban areas with minimal community transmission is less well understood. Methods: Using a prospectively maintained pre-hospital quality improvement database, we reviewed our hospital EMS transports with a diagnosis of stroke from January to April 2019 (baseline) and January to April 2020 (pandemic). We compared the volume of patients, transport/presentation times, severity of presenting symptoms, and final diagnosis. Results: In January, February, March, and April 2019 10, 11, 17 and 19 patients, respectively were transported in comparison to 19, 14, 10 and 8 during the same months in 2020. From January through April 2019 there was a 53% increase in transports, compared to a 42% decrease during the same months in 2020. The slopes of these trend lines are significantly different (3.30;95%CI 0.48 - 6.12 versus -3.70;95%CI -5.76 - -1.64, P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, symptom severity, or stroke discharge diagnoses between the two time periods. However, the median interval from LKW to time of EMS dispatch was significantly longer in January to April 2020 (12 + 273 min) compared to the same time period of January through April in 2019 (7 + 115 min). Conclusion: Our data indicate not only a decrease in patient transport volumes but more alarmingly, significantly longer intervals to EMS activation for suspected stroke care. These results suggest that even in a non-urban location without widespread community transmission patientswere delaying or avoiding care for severe illness such as stroke.(Figure Presented).","Velasco, C.; Richardson, A.

To provide continuity of care and to assist patients reluctant or unable to leave their homes, video consultations were rapidly implemented across routine and emergency ophthalmology services. OBJECTIVE: To describe the deployment and scaling to a large volume of teleophthalmology using a video consultation platform 'Attend Anywhere' in Moorfields Eye Hospital's accident and emergency (A&E) department (London, UK). METHOD: Patient satisfaction, waiting time, consultation duration, outcome and management were audited following the launch of the new virtual A&E service. RESULTS: In the 12 days following the service launch, 331 patients were seen by video consultation. 78.6% of patients (n=260) were determined not to need hospital A&E review and were managed with advice (n=126), remote prescription (n=57), general practitioner referral (n=27), direct referral to hospital subspecialty services (n=26) or diversion to a local eye unit (n=24). Mean patient satisfaction was 4.9 of 5.0 (n=62). The mean consultation duration was 12 min (range 5-31 min) and the wait time was 6 min (range 0-37 min). CONCLUSION: Video consultations showed greater than expected usefulness in the remote management of eye disease and supported a substantial reduction in the number of people visiting the hospital.","Kilduff, Caroline Ls; Thomas, Alice Ap; Dugdill, Juliet; Casswell, Edward J; Dabrowski, Marcin; Lovegrove, Claire; Sim, Dawn A; Hay, Gordon R; Thomas, Peter Bm",,506,29

We investigated whether bacterial respiratory infections and viral load were associated with poor clinical outcome and host immune tone. We obtained bacterial and fungal culture data from 589 critically ill subjects with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. On a subset of the subjects that underwent bronchoscopy, we also quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, analyzed the microbiome of the lower airways by metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses and profiled the host immune response. We found that isolation of a hospital-acquired respiratory pathogen was not associated with fatal outcome. However, poor clinical outcome was associated with enrichment of the lower airway microbiota with an oral commensal ( Mycoplasma salivarium ), while high SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, poor anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, together with a unique host transcriptome profile of the lower airways were most predictive of mortality. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that 1) the extent of viral infectivity drives mortality in severe COVID-19, and therefore 2) clinical management strategies targeting viral replication and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 should be prioritized.","Sulaiman, I.; Chung, M.; Angel, L.; Koralov, S.; Wu, B.; Yeung, S.; Krolikowski, K.; Li, Y.; Duerr, R.; Schluger, R.; Thannickal, S.; Koide, A.; Rafeq, S.; Barnett, C.; Postelnicu, R.; Wang, C.; Banakis, S.; Perez-Perez, L.; Jour, G.; Shen, G.; Meyn, P.; Carpenito, J.; Liu, X.; Ji, K.; Collazo, D.; Labarbiera, A.; Amoroso, N.; Brosnahan, S.; Mukherjee, V.; Kaufman, D.; Bakker, J.; Lubinsky, A.; Pradhan, D.; Sterman, D.; Heguy, A.; Uyeki, T.; Clemente, J.; de Wit, E.; Schmidt, A.

The dual epidemics will result in considerable morbidity and mortality; therefore, influenza vaccination may be essential. Recent studies found increased risk of coronavirus in individuals receiving influenza vaccination. AIMS: Our aim is to analyse the association between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 3520 HCWs at a large hospital in Northern Italy. For each participant, we collected data on flu immunization status for the last five flu seasons. Logistic regression was used to test associations between seasonal flu vaccination status and a positive serology tests for COVID-19. RESULTS: During the last five flu seasons, 2492 vaccinations were administered. Serology tests were negative for 3196 (91%) HCWs and residents and only 21 (1%) people had an equivocal test (12.0-15.0 AU/mL). Only 128 (4%) people received a diagnosis of COVID-19, with a positive swab test. No flu vaccinations for the last five flu seasons were specifically associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 or with positive results of serology tests. CONCLUSIONS: Flu vaccinations did not appear to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Influenza vaccination should continue to be recommended for HCWs and for individuals at increased risk for severe illness from respiratory infection.","Belingheri, M; Paladino, M E; Latocca, R; De Vito, G; Riva, M A",Occup. med,506,20

Le HCSP a émis en juin 2020 des recommandations restreignant les indications de prescription d’ATB qui ont été diffusées dans notre hôpital entre les 2 vagues. L’objectif de cette étude était de comparer la proportion de patients admis recevant une ATB au cours des 2 premières vagues et d’évaluer la conformité de l’ATB. Matériels et méthodes Analyse des dossiers des patients ayant une PCR+en 1ère vague (V1 du 16/03 au 30/04/2020) et 2e vague (V2 du 19/10/2020 au 10/01/2021). Les données suivantes ont été relevées: présentation clinique, signes de gravité, anomalies TDM, documentation microbiologique, dosage de la procalcitonine (PCT), antibiothérapie (molécule, durée réelle). Une analyse des dossiers a ensuite été réalisée pour définir la conformité de la prescription d’ATB (indication, spectre et durée théorique). Résultats Parmi les 879 patients PCR+ 546 d’entre eux n’ont pas été inclus (hospitalisés&lt;48h =410, asymptomatiques =71, autres infections =65). Les populations des 2 vagues (V1, n=232, V2=n=101) sont comparables en âge (moyennes V1 64 ans, V2 67 ans;p=0.08), sexe (hommes V1 66 %, V2 59 %;p=0,99) et % de patients admis en réanimation (V1 n=52, 22,4 %;V2 n=22, 21,7 %;p=0,9). Pendant la V1, 100 % des patients (n=232) ont reçu des ATB contre 44,5 % (n=45) en V2 (p&lt;0,001). Les C3G ont été les plus prescrites: 91,4 % (n=212) des prescriptions d’ATB en V1 et 64,4 % (n=29) en V2, associées aux macrolides dans 69,3 % (n=161) et 41,4 % (n=42). 28 % des prescriptions (n=65) ont été évaluées comme conformes en V1 contre 68,9 % (n=31) en V2 (p&lt;0,001). Les principaux motifs de non-conformité étaient: spectre trop large (V1 n=94, 40 %, V2 n=6, 6 %), durée trop longue (V1 n =86, 37 %;V2 n=12, 12 %), absence d’indication (V1 n=42, 18 %;V2 n=1, 1 %). En V1, la durée moyenne réelle d’ATB était plus longue que la durée moyenne théorique (6,1 vs 2,5 j, p&lt;0,001). En V2 aucune différence n’a été observée (durée moyenne réelle 2,5 j, durée moyenne théorique 2,1 j;p=0,16)). Les hémocultures (V1 n=217, 94 %;V2 n=75, 74 %) et antigénuries (V1 n=181, 78 %;V2 n=46, 45,5 %) ont été plus souvent réalisées en V1 (p&lt;0,001). Peu d’infections étaient microbiologiquement documentées (V1 n=6;2,5 %;V2 n=4;4 %, p=0,35).

Conclusion Une évolution nette des pratiques d’ATB est observée au cours des 2 vagues avec une réduction des prescriptions et une amélioration de la qualité de la prescription. La documentation microbiologique étant rare, l’actualisation du protocole de prise en charge a permis de réduire une exposition inutile des patients aux ATB. L’utilisation de la PCT s’est avérée peu utile pour améliorer les pratiques.","Deschamps, M.; Colombier, M.; Lesprit, P.; Zuber, B.; Devaquet, J.",Infectious Diseases Now,506,22

Mixed-reality (MR) technology is the latest iteration of telemedicine innovation; it is a logical next step in the move toward the provision of digitally supported clinical care and medical education. This technology has the potential to revolutionize care both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This pilot project sought to deploy the HoloLens2 MR device to support the delivery of remote care in COVID-19 hospital environments. METHODS: A prospective, observational, nested cohort evaluation of the HoloLens2 was undertaken across three distinct clinical clusters in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Data pertaining to staff exposure to high-risk COVID-19 environments and personal protective equipment (PPE) use by clinical staff (N=28) were collected, and assessments of acceptability and feasibility were conducted. RESULTS: The deployment of the HoloLens2 led to a 51.5% reduction in time exposed to harm for staff looking after COVID-19 patients (3.32 vs 1.63 hours/day/staff member; P=.002), and an 83.1% reduction in the amount of PPE used (178 vs 30 items/round/day; P=.02). This represents 222.98 hours of reduced staff exposure to COVID-19, and 3100 fewer PPE items used each week across the three clusters evaluated. The majority of staff using the device agreed it was easy to set up and comfortable to wear, improved the quality of care and decision making, and led to better teamwork and communication. In total, 89.3% (25/28) of users felt that their clinical team was safer when using the HoloLens2. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies have a role in minimizing exposure to nosocomial infection, optimizing the use of PPE, and enhancing aspects of care. Deploying such technologies at pace requires context-specific information security, infection control, user experience, and workflow integration to be addressed at the outset and led by clinical end-users. The deployment of new telemedicine technology must be supported with objective evidence for its safety and effectiveness to ensure maximum impact.","Martin, Guy; Koizia, Louis; Kooner, Angad; Cafferkey, John; Ross, Clare; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Sivananthan, Arun; Tanna, Anisha; Pratt, Philip; Kinross, James",J Med Internet Res,506,16

However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. METHODS: Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. RESULTS: We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. CONCLUSION: Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting. Thus, our study supports the positive potential of distance learning for teaching anatomy during and after COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes the need for a synchronous learning environment with partially personnel-intensive small group settings to overcome passivity and inequality aspects, and to foster active learning elements.","Darici, D; Reissner, C; Brockhaus, J; Missler, M",Ann Anat,506,16

A cohort of 3,656 patients were evaluated (Feb-Apr 2020) and patients' sociodemographic characteristics, and social development index (SDI) were used as determinant factors of diagnosis delays and mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, time-dependent Cox regression models, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. The median time from symptoms onset to diagnosis was eight days (interquartile range [IQR] 7.23-8.99 days). Half of the patients recovered during the evaluated period, and 8.3% died. Mortality rates were higher in men. Delays in diagnosis were associated with male gender (p = 0.015) and patients living in low SDI areas (p &lt; 0.001). The age groups statistically associated with death were: 70-79 years, 80-89 years, and 90-99 years. Delays to diagnosis greater than eight days were also risk factors for death.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2), gamma-interferon-inducible lysosome/endosome-localized thiolreductase (GILT), and lymphocyte antigen 6 family member E (LY6E), the three cellular proteins identified to function in interference with virus entry, were expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-O43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFN-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) restriction of human coronavirus (CoV) entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a mechanism distinct from other factors that modulate CoV entry.IMPORTANCE Virus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control of host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon-inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH, and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as a host factor that facilitates the entry of several human-pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.","Zhao, Xuesen; Zheng, Shuangli; Chen, Danying; Zheng, Mei; Li, Xinglin; Li, Guoli; Lin, Hanxin; Chang, Jinhong; Zeng, Hui; Guo, Ju-Tao",J. virol,506,16

Up till now, there are a lot of controversial data on its pathogenesis, possible complications, prognostic factors, and available preventive and/or therapeutic options. A series of fast growing research studies are being conducted aiming at studying prognostic criteria that may predict the disease severity and possible outcomes and hence plan of management either home or hospital management. Patients and methods Our cohort study included 73 COVID-19-confirmed positive cases by nasopharyngeal swab/reverse transcriptase PCR to evaluate correlation between serum ferritin levels (baseline and follow-up samples at day 7), as well as C-reactive protein levels and severity of clinical presentation of COVID-19-infected patients. Results Our results have demonstrated a statistically significant difference between mild (n=40) and moderate cases (n=33) regarding baseline ferritin level (P=0.00);however;no significant difference was detected among ferritin changes during the course of the disease (P=0.744), and also, no statistically significant difference in ferritin changes was found among mild and moderate severity groups (P=0.942). Finally, the only significant predictors of clinical severity were baseline ferritin and C-reactive protein levels according to multivariate analysis model (P=0.014 and =0.000, respectively). Conclusions The current study added further evidence to suggest baseline serum ferritin as an index of severity in COVID-19 and could have a prognostic effect;however, we cannot rely on follow-up serum ferritin during treatment and the course of the disease to predict outcome of the disease, and it may be misleading.","Mousa, M.

One of the key factors for the success of university education is undoubtedly the teacher's performance. Now, with the implementation of a virtual educational model, it is necessary to evaluate the models implemented. The research proposed is the validity of an evaluation model about teacher performance, for which the first step was the development of an instrument with 5 factors and 15 politomic items of graduated answers in the Likert scale, the selected factors respond to a theoretical construct related to the evaluation and teacher performance and a decisive question about the satisfaction of the service, adapted from the Net Promoter Score (NPS). For the model creation, we started with an exploratory analysis, which included a factorial analysis, secondly, we performed a confirmatory analysis with the PLS-SEM methodology which is a second generation multivariate method called Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares. The sample consists of 358 cases in university students of the social sciences area.

As we still have few therapies and nil vaccines yet available, the void of a clear framework for research and practice is increasingly clear. We describe a framework that has been used to prioritise therapeutic research in previous pandemics which could be used to progress clinical pharmacology and therapeutics research in COVID-19. This is particularly relevant as discussion has already moved on from antiviral therapeutics, to delineating the treatment of the host from treatment and elimination of the infective agent. Focussing on the host brings together three concepts; host treatment, the damage response framework and therapeutic repurposing. The integration of these three areas play to the traditional strength of pharmaceuticals in providing a period of stabilization to permit time for the development of novel anti-viral drugs and vaccines. In integrating approaches to repurposing, host treatment and damage response we identified three key properties that a potentially effective repurposed drug must possess by way of a framework. There must be homology i.e. the same or similar relation, with the pathogenesis of the disease, ideally targeted to the conserved pathophysiological outcomes of the viral attack, have a defined locus within the spectrum from prevention to severe disease and draw upon the historical dose and safety experience of the repurposed drug. To illustrate, we have mapped therapeutics that impact upon a key dysregulated pathway in COVID-19 - the renin angiotensin system- using this approach. Collectively this type of analysis reveals the importance of existing data (repurposed information and administrative observational) and the importance of the details of the known pathophysiological response to viruses in approaches to treating the host.","Martin, Jennifer; Head, Richard",,506,26

Although 70% of patients with localized OSA are cured with multiagent chemotherapy and surgical resection, the prognosis for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease is guarded. The small number of patients diagnosed annually contributes to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis, and challenges in performing appropriately powered clinical trials and detecting correlative biomarkers of response. While mouse models of OSA are becoming increasingly sophisticated, they generally fail to accurately recapitulate tumor heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment (TME), systemic immune dysfunction, and the clinical features of tumor recurrence, metastases, and chemoresistance, which influence outcome. Pet dogs spontaneously develop OSA with an incidence that is 30-50 times higher than humans. Canine OSA parallels the human disease in its clinical presentation, biological behavior, genetic complexity, and therapeutic management. However, despite therapy, most dogs die from metastatic disease within 1 year of diagnosis. Since OSA occurs in immune-competent dogs, immune factors that sculpt tumor immunogenicity and influence responses to immune modulation are in effect. In both species, immune modulation has shown beneficial effects on patient outcome and work is now underway to identify the most effective immunotherapies, combination of immunotherapies, and correlative biomarkers that will further improve clinical response. In this chapter, the immune landscape of canine OSA and the immunotherapeutic strategies used to modulate antitumor immunity in dogs with the disease will be reviewed. From this immunological viewpoint, the value of employing dogs with spontaneous OSA to accelerate and inform the translation of immunotherapies into the human clinic will be underscored.","Mason, Nicola J",Adv Exp Med Biol,506,20

Methods Primary and secondary schools reporting an outbreak (≥2 laboratory-confirmed cases within 14 days) to Public Health England (PHE) between 31 August and 18 October 2020 were contacted in November 2020 to complete an online questionnaire. Interpretation There were 969 school outbreaks reported to PHE, comprising 2% (n = 450) of primary schools and 10% (n = 519) of secondary schools in England. Of the 369 geographically-representative schools contacted, 179 completed the questionnaire (100 primary schools, 79 secondary schools) and 2,314 cases were reported. Outbreaks were larger and across more year groups in secondary schools than in primary schools. Teaching staff were more likely to be the index case in primary (48/100, 48%) than secondary (25/79, 32%) school outbreaks (P = 0.027). When an outbreak occurred, attack rates were higher in staff (881/17,362;5.07;95%CI, 4.75–5.41) than students, especially primary school teaching staff (378/3852;9.81%;95%CI, 8.90–10.82%) compared to secondary school teaching staff (284/7146;3.97%;95%CI, 3.79–5.69%). Secondary school students (1105/91,919;1.20%;95%CI, 1.13–1.28%) had higher attack rates than primary school students (328/39,027;0.84%;95%CI, 0.75–0.94%). Conclusions A higher proportion of secondary schools than primary schools reported a COVID-19 outbreak and experienced larger outbreaks across multiple school year groups. The higher attack rate among teaching staff during an outbreak, especially in primary schools, suggests that additional protective measures may be needed.

Data on the clinical course and signs and symptoms of the infection were collected from 779 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and analysed in relation to previous tonsillectomy, together with demographic and anamnestic data. Results: Patients with previous tonsillectomy showed a greater risk of fever, temperature higher than 39°C, chills and malaise. No significant differences in hospital admissions were found. Conclusions: A previous history of tonsillectomy, as a surrogate indicator of immunological dysfunction of the pharyngeal associated lymphoid tissue, could predict a more intense systemic manifestation of COVID-19. These results could provide a simple clinical marker to discriminate suspected carriers and to delineate more precise prognostic models.","Capriotti, Vincenzo; Mattioli, Francesco; Guida, Francesco; Marcuzzo, Alberto Vito; Lo Manto, Alfredo; Martone, Andrea; Molinari, Giulia; Fabbris, Cristoforo; Menegaldo, Anna; Calvanese, Leonardo; Latini, Gino; Cingolani, Cristina; Gradoni, Paolo; Boscolo Nata, Francesca; De Sisti, Clelia; Selle, Vittorio; Leone, Giordano; Indelicato, Pietro; Pilolli, Francesco; Mevio, Niccolò; Roncoroni, Luca; Papi, Simona; Meschiari, Marianna; Tominz, Riccardo; D039,; Ascanio, Luca; Dragonetti, Alberto; Torelli, Lucio; Trenti, Loris; Spinato, Giacomo; Boscolo-Rizzo, Paolo; Bussi, Mario; Cossarizza, Andrea; Presutti, Livio; Tirelli, Giancarlo",Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,506,20

In this study, we have found that commercial kits often adopt DNAs instead of RNAs as the positive controls, which can't report the kit problems in reverse transcription, thereby increasing risk of the false negative results when testing patient samples. To face the challenge, we have proposed and developed the chemically modified RNAs, such as phosphoroselenaote and phosphorothioate RNAs (Se-RNA and S-RNA), as the controls. We have found that while demonstrating the high thermostability, biostability, chemostability and exclusivity (or specificity), both Se-RNA and S-RNA can be fine templates for reverse transcription, indicating their potentials as both positive and negative controls for RT-PCR kits.","Luo, Guangcheng; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Shun; Hu, Bei; Hu, Lillian; Huang, Zhen",Talanta,506,24

We studied humoral and B cell responses of 35 HC, 44 DP and 40 KTR. Markedly impaired anti-BNT162b2 responses were identified among KTR and DP compared to HC. In DP, the response was delayed (3-4 weeks after boost) and reduced with anti-S1 IgG and IgA positivity in 70.5% and 68.2%, respectively. In contrast, KTR did not develop IgG responses except one patient who had a prior unrecognized infection and developed anti-S1 IgG.

The frequency and absolute number of antigen-specific circulating plasmablasts in the cohort correlated with the Ig response, a characteristic not reported for other vaccinations. In conclusion, these data indicated that immunosuppression resulted in impaired protective immunity after mRNA vaccination, including Ig induction with corresponding generation of plasmablasts and memory B cells.

The dates of the surge were determined using a fitting of the two last months of reported daily new cases in 18 European countries with latitude ranging from 39° to 62°. The study proves no correlation between the country surge date and the 2 weeks preceding temperature or humidity but shows an impressive linear correlation with latitude. The country surge date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below &#8776; 34% of that of 0° latitude. Introducing reported seasonal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration variation into the reported link between acute respiratory tract infection risk and 25(OH)D concentration quantitatively explains the surge dynamics. Several studies have already substantiated a 25(OH)D concentration impact on COVID-19 severity. However, by comparing different patient populations, discriminating whether a low 25(OH)D concentration is a real factor underlying COVID-19 severity or only a marker of another weakness that is the primary severity factor can be challenging. The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation and has the benefit of being triggered only by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. decreases in the sun UV daily dose. The results indicate that a low 25(OH)D concentration is a contributing factor to COVID-19 severity, which, combined with previous studies, provides a convincing set of evidence.","Walrand, Stephan",Sci Rep,506,15

It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing, with the timing of distancing measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19. We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and five other jurisdictions, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimated the impact that physical distancing (social distancing) has had on the contact rate and examined the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We found that, as of April 11 2020, distancing had a strong impact in BC, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers; individuals practising physical distancing experienced approximately 0.22 (0.11-0.34 90% CI [credible interval]) of their normal contact rate. The threshold above which prevalence was expected to grow was 0.55. We define the ""contact ratio"" to be the ratio of the estimated contact rate to the threshold rate at which cases are expected to grow; we estimated this contact ratio to be 0.40 (0.19-0.60) in BC. We developed an R package 'covidseir' to make our model available, and used it to quantify the impact of distancing in five additional jurisdictions. As of May 7, 2020, we estimated that New Zealand was well below its threshold value (contact ratio of 0.22 [0.11-0.34]), New York (0.60 [0.43-0.74]), Washington (0.84 [0.79-0.90]) and Florida (0.86 [0.76-0.96]) were progressively closer to theirs yet still below, but California (1.15 [1.07-1.23]) was above its threshold overall, with cases still rising. Accordingly, we found that BC, New Zealand, and New York may have had more room to relax distancing measures than the other jurisdictions, though this would need to be done cautiously and with total case volumes in mind. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures-if sufficiently strong and robustly followed-could control COVID-19 transmission. This approach provides a useful tool for jurisdictions to monitor and assess current levels of distancing relative to their threshold, which will continue to be essential through subsequent waves of this pandemic.","Anderson, Sean C; Edwards, Andrew M; Yerlanov, Madi; Mulberry, Nicola; Stockdale, Jessica E; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A; Falcao, Rebeca C; Otterstatter, Michael C; Irvine, Michael A; Janjua, Naveed Z; Coombs, Daniel; Colijn, Caroline",PLoS Comput Biol,506,0

Forecasting emerging outbreaks pose a particular challenge because many existing forecasting techniques learn from historical seasons trends. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM-based cells are a logical choice of model due to their ability to learn temporal dynamics. In this paper, we adapt the state and county level influenza model, TDEFSI-LONLY, proposed in Wang et a. [l2020] to national and county level COVID-19 data. We show that this model poorly forecasts the current pandemic. We analyze the two week ahead forecasting capabilities of the TDEFSI-LONLY model with combinations of regularization techniques. Effective training of the TDEFSI-LONLY model requires data augmentation, to overcome this challenge we utilize an SEIR model and present an inter-county mixing extension to this model to simulate sufficient training data. Further, we propose an alternate forecast model, {\it County Level Epidemiological Inference Recurrent Network} (\alg{}) that trains an LSTM backbone on national confirmed cases to learn a low dimensional time pattern and utilizes a time distributed dense layer to learn individual county confirmed case changes each day for a two weeks forecast. We show that the best, worst, and median state forecasts made using CLEIR-Net model are respectively New York, South Carolina, and Montana.","Doe, Stewart W; Seekins, Tyler Russell; Fitzpatrick, David; Blanchard, Dawsin; Sekeh, Salimeh Yasaei",,506,1

The enforcement of COVID-19 prevention protocols, particularly social distancing, has been widely reported in Ghana's agricultural markets whereas casual observations and media reports on fish landing sites suggest no such enforcements are in place. This study aimed to provide sound scientific evidence as a basis for informed policy direction and intervention for the artisanal fishing sector in these challenging times. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle in assessing the risk of artisanal fishers to the pandemic using physical distancing as a proxy. From analysis of cumulative distribution function (G-function) of the nearest-neighbour distances, this study underscored crowding at all surveyed fish landing beaches, and identified potential ""hotspots"" for disease transmission. Aerial measurements taken at times of peak landing beach activity indicated that the highest proportion of people, representing 56%, 48%, 39% and 78% in Elmina, Winneba, Apam and Mumford respectively, were located at distances of less than one metre from their nearest neighbour. Risk of crowding was independent of the population at the landing beaches, suggesting that all categories of fish landing sites along the coast would require equal urgency and measured attention towards preventing and mitigating the spread of the disease.","Okyere, Isaac; Chuku, Ernest O; Ekumah, Bernard; Angnuureng, Donatus B; Boakye-Appiah, Justice K; Mills, David J; Babanawo, Raymond; Asare, Noble K; Aheto, Denis W; Crawford, Brian",Sci Rep,506,4

We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, {and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented,} the more lives can be saved. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.","Aronna, M.

These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: We evaluated a previously published risk model (Novant model) to identify patients at risk for healthcare facility-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HCFO-CDI) at 2 hospitals within a large health system and compared its predictive value to that of a new model developed based on local findings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study including adult patients admitted from July 1, 2016, to July 1, 2018. Patients with HCFO-CDI who received systemic antibiotics were included as cases and were matched 1 to 1 with controls (who received systemic antibiotics without developing HCFO-CDI). We extracted chart data on patient risk factors for CDI, including those identified in prior studies and those included in the Novant model. We applied the Novant model to our patient population to assess the model's utility and generated a local model using logistic regression-based prediction scores. A receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) score was determined for each model. RESULTS: We included 362 patients, with 161 controls and 161 cases. The Novant model had a ROC-AUC of 0.62 in our population. Our local model using risk factors identifiable at hospital admission included hospitalization within 90 days of admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-6.04), hematologic malignancy (adjusted OR, 12.87; 95% CI, 3.70-44.80), and solid tumor malignancy (adjusted OR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.27-17.80) as HCFO-CDI predictors and had a ROC-AUC score of 0.74. CONCLUSION: The Novant model evaluating risk factors identifiable at admission poorly predicted HCFO-CDI in our population, while our local model was a fair predictor. These findings highlight the need for institutions to review local risk factors to adjust modeling for their patient population.","Tilton, Carrie S; Sexton, Marybeth; Johnson, Steven W; Gu, Chunhui; Chen, Zhengjia; Robichaux, Chad; Metzger, Nicole L",Am. j. health system pharm,506,21

The Madrid Stroke multidisciplinary group presents a series of recommendations to achieve these goals. METHODS: We conducted a non-systematic literature search using the keywords ""stroke"" and ""COVID-19"" or ""coronavirus"" or ""SARS-CoV-2."" Our literature review also included other relevant studies known to the authors. Based on this literature review, a series of consensus recommendations were established by the Madrid Stroke multidisciplinary group and its neurology committee. RESULTS: These recommendations address 5 main objectives: 1) coordination of action protocols to ensure access to hospital care for stroke patients; 2) recognition of potentially COVID-19-positive stroke patients; 3) organisation of patient management to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare professionals; 4) avoidance of unnecessary neuroimaging studies and other procedures that may increase the risk of infection; and 5) safe, early discharge and follow-up to ensure bed availability. This management protocol has been called CORONA (Coordinate, Recognise, Organise, Neuroimaging, At home). CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations presented here may assist in the organisation of acute stroke care and the optimisation of healthcare resources, while ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals.","Rodríguez-Pardo, J; Fuentes, B; Alonso de Leciñana, M; Campollo, J; Calleja Castaño, P; Carneado Ruiz, J; Egido Herrero, J; García Leal, R; Gil Núñez, A; Gómez Cerezo, J F; Martín Martínez, A; Masjuán Vallejo, J; Palomino Aguado, B; Riera López, N; Simón de Las Heras, R; Vivancos Mora, J; Díez Tejedor, E",Neurologia,506,3

The clinical data in other centers is limited. This study aims to explore the feasible parameters which could be used in clinical practice to predict the prognosis in hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: In this case-control study, patients with severe COVID-19 in this newly established isolation center on admission between 27 January 2020 to 19 March 2020 were divided to discharge group and death event group. Clinical information was collected and analyzed for the following objectives: 1. Comparisons of basic characteristics between two groups; 2. Risk factors for death on admission using logistic regression; 3. Dynamic changes of radiographic and laboratory parameters between two groups in the course. Results: 124 patients with severe COVID-19 on admission were included and divided into discharge group (n=35) and death event group (n=89). Sex, SpO2, breath rate, diastolic pressure, neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer were significantly correlated with death events identified using bivariate logistic regression. Further multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant model fitting with C-index of 0.845 (p<0.001), in which SpO2&#8804;89%, lymphocyte&#8804;0.64×109/L, CRP>77.35mg/L, PCT>0.20µg/L, and LDH>481U/L were the independent risk factors with the ORs of 2.959, 4.015, 2.852, 3.554, and 3.185, respectively (p<0.04). In the course, persistently lower lymphocyte with higher levels of CRP, PCT, IL-6, neutrophil, LDH, D-dimer, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and increased CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio and were observed in death events group, while these parameters stayed stable or improved in discharge group. Conclusions: On admission, the levels of SpO2, lymphocyte, CRP, PCT, and LDH could predict the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Systematic inflammation with induced cardiac dysfunction was likely a primary reason for death events in severe COVID-19 except for acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Pan, Feng; Yang, Lian; Li, Yuncheng; Liang, Bo; Li, Lin; Ye, Tianhe; Li, Lingli; Liu, Dehan; Gui, Shan; Hu, Yu; Zheng, Chuansheng",Int J Med Sci,506,20

Deletion of 3a in SARS-CoV-1 reduces viral titer and morbidity in mice, suggesting it could be an effective target for vaccines or therapeutics. Here, we present structures of SARS-CoV-2 3a determined by cryo-EM to 2.1-Å resolution. 3a adopts a new fold with a polar cavity that opens to the cytosol and membrane through separate water- and lipid-filled openings. Hydrophilic grooves along outer helices could form ion-conduction paths. Using electrophysiology and fluorescent ion imaging of 3a-reconstituted liposomes, we observe Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channel activity, identify mutations that alter ion permeability and discover polycationic inhibitors of 3a activity. 3a-like proteins are found across coronavirus lineages that infect bats and humans, suggesting that 3a-targeted approaches could treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases.","Kern, David M; Sorum, Ben; Mali, Sonali S; Hoel, Christopher M; Sridharan, Savitha; Remis, Jonathan P; Toso, Daniel B; Kotecha, Abhay; Bautista, Diana M; Brohawn, Stephen G",Nat Struct Mol Biol,506,0

Nowadays, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the most widespread infectious agents. In the current study, we performed a survey on the attitude and behavior of Polish healthcare workers (HCW), which comprise physicians (MD) and administrative healthcare assistants (HA) towards the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. Our study involved 2300 subjects (42.17% female; 10.96% MD; 5.87% HA). The evaluation was conducted using a Google Forms survey based on original questions and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items questionnaire. HCW significantly more often demonstrated their willingness to get vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the control group (82.95% vs. 54.31%, respectively). The main concern, as regards all groups, was the development of long-term side effects after getting COVID-19 vaccine. The study revealed that depression significantly affects the willingness to get vaccinated. The readiness was significantly strengthened by positive medical history of recommended vaccinations, fear of catching COVID-19, as well as fear of passing on the disease to the relatives. Overall, the percentage of HCW, who want to be vaccinated against COVID-19 remains unsatisfactory. Further works exploring this subject are needed to take a step closer to achieving the herd immunity in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szmyd, Bartosz; Karuga, Filip Franciszek; Bartoszek, Adrian; Staniecka, Katarzyna; Siwecka, Natalia; Bartoszek, Agnieszka; Blaszczyk, Maciej; Radek, Maciej",,506,24

However, in the presence of occlusions and pose variations, different channels respond differently, and further that the response intensity of a channel differ across spatial locations. Also, modern facial expression recognition(FER) architectures rely on external sources like landmark detectors for defining attention. Failure of landmark detector will have a cascading effect on FER. Additionally, there is no emphasis laid on the relevance of features that are input to compute complementary context information. Leveraging on the aforementioned observations, an end-to-end architecture for FER is proposed in this work that obtains both local and global attention per channel per spatial location through a novel spatio-channel attention net (SCAN), without seeking any information from the landmark detectors. SCAN is complemented by a complementary context information (CCI) branch. Further, using efficient channel attention (ECA), the relevance of features input to CCI is also attended to. The representation learnt by the proposed architecture is robust to occlusions and pose variations. Robustness and superior performance of the proposed model is demonstrated on both in-lab and in-the-wild datasets (AffectNet, FERPlus, RAF-DB, FED-RO, SFEW, CK+, Oulu-CASIA and JAFFE) along with a couple of constructed face mask datasets resembling masked faces in COVID-19 scenario.

Objective: This paper assesses (i) how different farming systems were exposed to the crisis, (ii) which resilience capacities were revealed and (iii) how resilience was enabled or constrained by the farming systems' social and institutional environment. Methods: The 11 farming systems included have been analysed since 2017. This allows a comparison of pre-Covid-19 findings and the Covid-19 crisis. Pre-Covid findings are from the SURE-Farm systematic sustainability and resilience assessment. For Covid-19 a special data collection was carried out during the early stage of lockdowns. Results and conclusions: Our case studies found limited impact of Covid-19 on the production and delivery of food and other agricultural products. This was due to either little exposure or the agile activation of robustness capacities of the farming systems in combination with an enabling institutional environment. Revealed capacities were mainly based on already existing connectedness among farmers and more broadly in value chains. Across cases, the experience of the crisis triggered reflexivity about the operation of the farming systems. Recurring topics were the need for shorter chains, more fairness towards farmers, and less dependence on migrant workers. However, actors in the farming systems and the enabling environment generally focused on the immediate issues and gave little real consideration to long-term implications and challenges. Hence, adaptive or transformative capacities were much less on display than coping capacities. The comparison with pre-Covid findings mostly showed similarities. If challenges, such as shortage of labour, already loomed before, they persisted during the crisis. Furthermore, the eminent role of resilience attributes was confirmed. In cases with high connectedness and diversity we found that these system characteristics contributed significantly to dealing with the crisis. Also the focus on coping capacities was already visible before the crisis. We are not sure yet whether the focus on short-term robustness just reflects the higher visibility and urgency of shocks compared to slow processes that undermine or threaten important system functions, or whether they betray an imbalance in resilience capacities at the expense of adaptability and transformability. Significance: Our analysis indicates that if transformations are required, e.g. to respond to concerns about transnational value chains and future pandemics from zoonosis, the transformative capacity of many farming systems needs to be actively enhanced through an enabling environment. © 2021 The Authors","Meuwissen, M.

A polybasic motif detected at the cleavage site of the S protein has been shown to broaden the cell tropism and transmissibility of the virus. Here we examine the properties of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations at the S protein cleavage site that undergo inefficient proteolytic cleavage. Virus variants with S gene mutations generated smaller plaques and exhibited a more limited range of cell tropism compared to the wild-type strain. These alterations were shown to result from their inability to utilize the entry pathway involving direct fusion mediated by the host type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. Notably, viruses with S gene mutations emerged rapidly and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in TMPRSS2-deficient cells including Vero cells. Our study demonstrated that the S protein polybasic cleavage motif is a critical factor underlying SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell tropism. As such, researchers should be alert to the possibility of de novo S gene mutations emerging in tissue-culture propagated virus strains.","Sasaki, Michihito; Uemura, Kentaro; Sato, Akihiko; Toba, Shinsuke; Sanaki, Takao; Maenaka, Katsumi; Hall, William W; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi",PLoS Pathog,506,23

We sought to compare physician visit rates for postpartum mental illness in Ontario, Canada, during the pandemic with rates expected based on prepandemic patterns. METHODS: In this population-based, repeated cross-sectional study using linked health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, we used negative binomial regression to model expected visit rates per 1000 postpartum people for March-November 2020 based on prepandemic data (January 2016-February 2020). We compared observed visit rates to expected visit rates for each month of the pandemic period, generating absolute rate differences, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was a visit to a primary care physician or a psychiatrist for any mental disorder. We stratified analyses by maternal sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In March 2020, the visit rate was 43.5/1000, with a rate difference of 3.11/1000 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13) compared with the expected rate. In April, the rate difference (10.9/1000, 95% CI 9.14-12.6) and IRR (1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36) were higher; this level was generally sustained through November 2020. From April-November, we observed elevated visit rates across provider types and for diagnoses of anxiety, depressive and alcohol or substance use disorders. Observed increases from expected visit rates were greater for people 0-90 days postpartum compared with 91-365 days postpartum; increases were small among people living in low-income neighbourhoods. Public health units in the northern areas of the province did not see sustained elevations in visit rates after July; southern health units had elevated rates through to November.

We report regional Stroke Team acute activations and reperfusion treatments during COVID-19 mitigation activities. METHODS: Using case log data prospectively collected by a Stroke Team exclusively serving &#8776;2 million inhabitants and 30 healthcare facilities, we retrospectively reviewed volumes of consultations and reperfusion treatments for acute ischemic stroke. We compared volumes before and after announcements of COVID-19 mitigation measures and the prior calendar year.

This hypothesis was built based on the etiopathogenesis of enamel defects and the relationship with the symptom's characteristic of COVID-19. Pregnancy is a critical period for the child's development; exposure to pathological agents can cause systemic imbalances and risks of adverse perinatal and prenatal outcomes. The main clinical symptoms of this disease and its association with that dental outcome were considered. Fever, breathing, cardiovascular disorders, and diarrhea were related as potential etiological factors of ameloblast metabolism imbalance, which can interfere qualitatively and quantitatively in the development, maturation and mineralization of the tooth enamel. Molecular disorders derived from COVID-19, as well as their clinical symptoms, can be considered potential risk factors for the development of enamel defects. Individuals with enamel defects experienced high stress levels during pregnancy or early childhood. The approach adopted may help build new research to ensure understanding of the etiology of the development of dental enamel defects and its relationship with COVID-19. However, longitudinal studies need to be conducted to confirm the association between COVID-19 and adverse events during pregnancy.","Santos Junior, Valdeci Elias dos; Silva, João Victor Farias da; Lima, Fernando José Camello de; Borges, Cristine D.

Patients with cardiovascular diseases are more likely to have severe illness due to COVID-19 and are at increased risk for complications and mortality. We performed a narrative literature review to assess the burden of COVID-19 and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Myocardial injury has been reported in 20%-30% of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and is associated with a worse prognosis and high mortality (~50%-60%). Proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury include inflammation within the myocardium (due to direct viral infection or cytokine storm), endotheliitis, coronary vasculitis, myocarditis, demand ischemia, plaque destabilization and right ventricular failure. The right ventricle is particularly vulnerable to injury and failure in COVID-19-infected patients, given the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary microthrombi or pulmonary embolism. Echocardiography is an effective and accessible tool to evaluate left and right ventricular functions and risk stratify patients with COVID-19 infection.

Here, we performed a comparative genomics study of RNA sensor genes in three species of pangolins. DDX58/RIG-I, a sensor of cytoplasmic viral RNA and toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, and 8, which bind RNA in endosomes, are conserved in pangolins. By contrast, IFIH1 a sensor of intracellular double-stranded RNA, has been inactivated by mutations in pangolins. Likewise, Z-DNA-binding protein (ZBP1), which senses both Z-DNA and Z-RNA, has been lost during the evolution of pangolins. These results suggest that the innate immune response to viruses differs significantly between pangolins and other mammals, including humans. We put forward the hypothesis that loss of IFIH1 and ZBP1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation-induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of viral infections in pangolins.","Fischer, Heinz; Tschachler, Erwin; Eckhart, Leopold",Front Immunol,506,16

This has been shown to be a major factor in countries that have been successful in containing COVID-19 transmission. Early detection of cases is important, and the use of geospatial technology can support to detect and easily identify potential hotspots that will require timely response. The use of spatial analysis with geographic information systems (GIS) had proved to be effective in providing timely and effective solutions in supporting epidemic response and pandemics over the years. It has developed and evolved rapidly with a complete technological tool for representing data, model construction, visualization and platform construction among others. Methods: we conducted a geospatial analysis to develop a web mapping application using ArcMap and ArcGIS online to guide and support active case search of potential COVID-19 cases, within 500m radius of COVID-19 confirmed cases to improve detection and testing of suspected cases. Results: the web mapping application tool guides the active case search teams in the field, with clear boundaries on the houses to be visited within 500-meter radius of confirmed positive cases, to conduct active case search of all cases of severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI), acute respiratory illnesses (ARI), pneumonia etc, to detect and test for COVID-19 towards containing the pandemic. Conclusion: the use of GIS and spatial statistical tools have become an important and valuable tool in decision-making and, more importantly, guiding health care professional and other stakeholders in the response being carried out in a more coherent and easy manner. It has proven to be effective in supporting the active case search process to rapidly detect, test and isolate cases during the process, towards containing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bello, Isah Mohammed; Moyo, Thandekile Ntombikayise; Munyanyi, Manes; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Isibor, Irene; Sunganai, Lincoln Charimari; Umar, Abubakar Sadiq; Krishnan, Ravi Shankar Santhana Gopala; Touray, Kebba; Rupfutse, Maxwell; Manangazira, Portia; Ntale, Alex Gasasira; Fussum, Daniel; Mkanda, Pascal",Pan Afr Med J,506,29

An exploratory review of the official publication of state governments and the Federal District to find out the strategies for the execution of the National School Feeding Program, after school closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Information on the form of execution and the public served by the action were reviewed in a descriptive manner. Results Out of the 27 federative units, 55% distributed food kits, 26% supplied food cards/vouchers and 19% provided food kits and food cards/vouchers. As to the scope, 37% maintained general service, 30% attended schoolchildren from families registered in the Brazilian cash transfer program (Bolsa Família) and 26% attended schoolchildren from families registered in the Underprivileged Families Registry. Conclusion The National School Feeding Program was weak in terms of assuring the Human Right to Adequate Food and Food and Nutrition Security. The slowness of the federal administration and the gaps in the regulations issued may explain the changes in the reported strategies, which, in their majority, violate the principle of universality.","CORRÊA, Elizabeth Nappi; NEVES, Janaina das; SOUZA, Lidiamara Dornelles de; LORINTINO, Camila da Silva; PORRUA, Priscila; VASCONCELOS, rancisco de Assis Guedes de",Rev.

As a result, one often resorts to subjective quality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating image enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually pre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three sources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of the selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential overfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential cherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world image enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards debiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of adaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting sample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the enhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual inspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the enhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using three popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing, super-resolution, and low-light enhancement.","Peibei, Cao; Zhangyang, Wang; Kede, Ma",,506,13

However, the additional clinical value of MIA in Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients in a high-resource setting is unknown. The objective was to assess if and how MIA changed clinical COD and contributing diagnoses in deceased COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective observational cohort from April to May 2020 in a 981-bed teaching hospital in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium was established. Patients who died with either PCR-confirmed or radiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection were consecutively included. MIA consisted of whole-body CT and CT-guided Tru-Cut® biopsies. Diagnostic modalities were clinical chart review, radiology, microbiology, and histopathology which were assessed by two independent experts per modality. MIA COD and contributing diagnoses were established during a multi-disciplinary meeting. Clinical COD (CCOD) and contributing diagnosis were abstracted from the discharge letter. The main outcomes were alterations in CCOD and contributing diagnoses after MIA, and the contribution of each diagnostic modality. We included 18 patients, of which 7 after intensive care unit hospitalization. MIA led to an alteration in 15/18 (83%) patients. The CCOD was altered in 5/18 (28%) patients. MIA found a new COD (1/5), a more specific COD (1/5), a less certain COD (1/5), or a contributing diagnosis to be the COD (2/5). Contributing diagnoses were altered in 14/18 (78%) patients: 9 new diagnoses, 5 diagnoses dismissed, 3 made more specific, and 2 made less certain. Overall, histopathology contributed in 14/15 (93%) patients with alterations, radiology and microbiology each in 6/15 (40%), and clinical review in 3/15 (20%). Histopathology was deemed the most important modality in 10 patients, radiology in two patients, and microbiology in one patient. CONCLUSION: MIA, especially histological examination, can add valuable new clinical information regarding the cause of death in COVID-19 patients, even in a high-resource setting with wide access to premortem diagnostic modalities. MIA may provide important clinical insights and should be applied in the current ongoing pandemic.

Participants completed an anamnestic questionnaire, the Assessment Teaching Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory in both phases of research;an ad hoc questionnaire (to measure teaching practices) and the Teacher Sense of Self Efficacy Scale were added in the second phase. Data confirm that general level of burnout increased and personal accomplishment was reduced during the pandemic;elevated personal accomplishment appears to be a predictor of emotional, socio-relational, and didactic competences before and during the pandemic.

Six/fifty patients (12%) died: 5/6 due to severe respiratory failure within a framework of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 1 suffered an acute myocardial infarction, and 1 died of massive pulmonary thromboembolism. There were no adverse treatment events or infectious complications. Compared to the CONTROL group they showed a lower mortality rate (12% versus 43%), for the same number of complications and days of hospitalization.Anti-IL6 drugs seem to be effective in the treatment of medium to severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonia reducing the risk of mortality due to multi-organ failure, acting at the systemic level and reducing inflammation levels and therefore microvascular complications. However, it is essential to identify the best time for treatment, which, if delayed, is rendered useless as well as counterproductive.

RESULTS: The CycleGAN-based synthetic images reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis. Using the synthetic throat images, the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis. ResNet50 with GAN-based augmentation showed the best ROC-AUC of 0.988 for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset. In the 4-fold cross-validation using the ResNet50, the highest detection accuracy and ROC-AUC achieved were 95.3% and 0.992, respectively. CONCLUSION: The deep learning model for smartphone-based pharyngitis screening allows fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis. In the recent pandemic of COVID-19, this framework will help patients with upper respiratory symptoms to improve convenience in diagnosis and reduce transmission.","Yoo, Tae Keun; Choi, Joon Yul; Jang, Younil; Oh, Ein; Ryu, Ik Hee",Comput Biol Med,506,20

In humans, the nuclear pore complex is one of the largest multiprotein assemblies in the cell, with a molecular mass of â¼110 MDa and consisting of 8 to 64 copies of about 34 different nuclear pore proteins, termed nucleoporins, for a total of 1000 subunits per pore. Trafficking events across the nuclear pore are mediated by nuclear transport receptors and are highly regulated. The nuclear pore complex is also used by several RNA viruses and almost all DNA viruses to access the host cell nucleoplasm for replication. Viruses hijack the nuclear pore complex, and nuclear transport receptors, to access the nucleoplasm where they replicate. In addition, the nuclear pore complex is used by the cell innate immune system, a network of signal transduction pathways that coordinates the first response to foreign invaders, including viruses and other pathogens. Several branches of this response depend on dynamic signaling events that involve the nuclear translocation of downstream signal transducers. Mounting evidence has shown that these signaling cascades, especially those steps that involve nucleocytoplasmic trafficking events, are targeted by viruses so that they can evade the innate immune system. This review summarizes how nuclear pore proteins and nuclear transport receptors contribute to the innate immune response and highlights how viruses manipulate this cellular machinery to favor infection. A comprehensive understanding of nuclear pore proteins in antiviral innate immunity will likely contribute to the development of new antiviral therapeutic strategies.","Shen, Qingtang; Wang, Yifan E; Palazzo, Alexander F",J Biol Chem,506,2

AIM: We aimed to examine the effects of social distancing, loneliness, difficulties in emotion regulation, and self-regulation on participants self-reported coping using sex during lockdown in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Participants had to be residents of the United Kingdom, aged between 18-60 years, fluent in English, and had to have an Internet connection. They were instructed not to participate if they had consumed alcohol in the previous 24 hours. A total of 789 participants aged 18-59 years completed an online survey. Participants provided self-report measures of social distancing, loneliness, and difficulties in emotion regulation. A Go/No-Go task was used to assess self-regulation. OUTCOMES: Participants self-reported their use of sex to cope over a 14-day period during lockdown, as well as retrospectively for a 14-day period immediately preceding lockdown. Coping using sex items included consensual and non-consensual themes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no increase in coping using sex during lockdown compared with before lockdown. Findings showed that 30% of participants reported increased coping using sex during lockdown compared with before, 29% reported decreased coping using sex, and 41% reported no change. All regression models included age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis of psychiatric condition, level of education, being at high-risk for difficulties relating to COVID-19, living alone, and diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 as covariates. Being younger, being male, and greater emotion dysregulation were associated with higher coping using sex total and consent subscale scores during lockdown. Being younger, being male, not living alone, and less adherence to social distancing advice were associated with coping using sex with a theme of rape/violence during lockdown. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: A proportion of participants used sex to cope more often during lockdown compared with before. Less adherence to social distancing advice and emotion dysregulation were associated with using sex to cope during lockdown. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths of this study were the large sample size and inclusion of key sociodemographic characteristics as covariates. The main limitations were the cross-sectional design and a sample that was mostly white, educated, and female. CONCLUSION: Participants who had difficulty regulating emotions were more likely to use sex to cope. It is important that support is available for people who have problems regulating their emotions during the pandemic and that they have access to appropriate help and advice.

The current study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 complicated by hypertension. In this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 110 discharged patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 25 to February 20, 2020. All study cases were grouped according to whether they had a history of hypertension. Then, a subgroup analysis for all hypertensive patients was carried out based on whether to take ACEI or ARB drugs. The mean age of 110 patients was 57.7 years (range, 25-86 years), of which 60 (54.5%) were male patients. The main underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)]. Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96 × 109/L vs 1.26 × 109/L), and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)]. Patients treated with ACEI or ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5 years vs 69.2 years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 (23.8%)]. In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission. The elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Taking ACEI or ARB drugs may not change the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","Zhou, Xian; Zhu, Jingkang; Xu, Tao",Clin Exp Hypertens,506,26

Scholars predict that the pandemic will continue into the coming winter and will become a seasonal epidemic in the following year. Therefore, the identification of effective control measures becomes extremely important. Although many reports have been published since the COVID-19 outbreak, no studies have identified the relative effectiveness of a combination of control measures implemented in Wuhan and other areas in China. To this end, a retrospective analysis by the collection and modeling of an unprecedented number of epidemiology records in China of the early stage of the outbreaks can be valuable.In this study, we developed a new dynamic model to describe the spread of COVID-19 and to quantify the effectiveness of control measures. The transmission rate, daily close contacts, and the average time from onset to isolation were identified as crucial factors in viral spreading. Moreover, the capacity of a local health-care system is identified as a threshold to control an outbreak in its early stage. We took these factors as controlling parameters in our model. The parameters are estimated based on epidemiological reports from national and local Center for Disease Control (CDCs).A retrospective simulation showed the effectiveness of combinations of 4 major control measures implemented in Wuhan: hospital isolation, social distancing, self-protection by wearing masks, and extensive medical testing. Further analysis indicated critical intervention conditions and times required to control an outbreak in the early stage. Our simulations showed that South Korea has kept the spread of COVID-19 at a low level through extensive medical testing. Furthermore, a predictive simulation for Italy indicated that Italy would contain the outbreak in late May under strict social distancing.In our general analysis, no single measure could contain a COVID-19 outbreak once a health-care system is overloaded. Extensive medical testing could keep viral spreading at a low level. Wearing masks functions as favorably as social distancing but with much lower socioeconomic costs.","Yang, Shuhang; Liu, Yu; Chen, Ke; Li, Tong; Huang, Yi; Chen, Xiaolei; Qi, Pengfang; Xu, Yazhi; Yu, Feifei; Yang, Yuling; Chen, Youhua",Medicine (Baltimore),506,20

In addition, we wanted to identify gaps in the terminologies and potential new nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions for future development related to nurse roles in family care during a pandemic. METHODS: Using a consensus process, seven nurse experts created the linkages focused on families during the COVID-19 pandemic using the following steps: (1) creating an initial list of potential nursing diagnoses, (2) selecting and categorizing outcomes that aligned with all components of each nursing diagnosis selected, and (3) identifying relevant nursing interventions. FINDINGS: We identified a total of seven NANDA-I nursing diagnoses as the basis for the linkage work. These are distributed in three NANDA-I Domains and based in the psychosocial dimension of the Nursing Care in Response to Pandemics model. Eighty-nine different NOC outcomes were identified to guide care based on the nursing diagnoses, and 54 different NIC interventions were suggested as possible interventions. Fifteen new proposed concepts were identified for future development across the three classifications. CONCLUSIONS: The linkages of nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions provide a guide to enhance nursing practice and care documentation that could quantify the impact of nursing care to patient outcomes for families at risk for or infected by COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: NANDA-I, NOC, and NIC linkages identified in this paper provide resources to support clinical decisions and guide critical thinking for nurses encountering care needs of families with COVID-19. Documentation of these linkages provides data that can create new knowledge to enhance the care of families impacted by COVID-19.","Wagner, Cheryl Marie; Swanson, Elizabeth A; Moorhead, Sue; Mantovani, Vanessa Monteiro; Dunn-Lopez, Karen; Macieira, Tamara G R; Abe, Noriko; Breitenstein, Susie",International journal of nursing knowledge (Online),506,1

To slow the spread of the virus, governments have implemented the practice of physical distancing (""social distancing""), which includes isolation within the home with limited time spent outdoors. During this extraordinary time, nature around the home may play a key role in mitigating against adverse mental health outcomes due to the pandemic and the measures taken to address it. To assess whether this is the case, we conducted an online questionnaire survey (n = 3,000) in Tokyo, Japan, to quantify the association between five mental health outcomes (depression, life satisfaction, subjective happiness, self-esteem, and loneliness) and two measures of nature experiences (frequency of greenspace use and green view through windows from home). Accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, we found that the frequency of greenspace use and the existence of green window views from within the home was associated with increased levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness and decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Our findings suggest that a regular dose of nature can contribute to the improvement of a wide range of mental health outcomes. With the recent escalation in the prevalence of mental health disorders, and the possible negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health, our findings have major implications for policy, suggesting that urban nature has great potential to be used as a ""nature-based solution"" for improved public health.","Soga, Masashi; Evans, Maldwyn J; Tsuchiya, Kazuaki; Fukano, Yuya",Ecol Appl,506,17

RESULTS: Among 10,238 respondents, 68 % were physicians, 25 % nursing-related providers, and 6% physician assistants; 28 % reported never prescribing or not prescribing in the 12 months prior to the survey. Among the 72 % of clinicians who reported past 12-month buprenorphine prescribing (i.e. active practitioners during the pandemic) 30 % reported their practice setting closed to in-person visits during COVID-19; 33 % reported remote prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination. The strongest predictors of remote buprenorphine prescribing to new patients were prescribing buprenorphine to larger numbers of patients in an average month in the past year and closure of the practice setting during the pandemic; previous experience with remote prescribing to established patients prior to COVID-19 also was a significant predictor.

RESULTS: Among 10,238 respondents, 68 % were physicians, 25 % nursing-related providers, and 6% physician assistants; 28 % reported never prescribing or not prescribing in the 12 months prior to the survey. Among the 72 % of clinicians who reported past 12-month buprenorphine prescribing (i.e. active practitioners during the pandemic) 30 % reported their practice setting closed to in-person visits during COVID-19; 33 % reported remote prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination. The strongest predictors of remote buprenorphine prescribing to new patients were prescribing buprenorphine to larger numbers of patients in an average month in the past year and closure of the practice setting during the pandemic; previous experience with remote prescribing to established patients prior to COVID-19 also was a significant predictor. Among clinicians prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination, 5.5 % reported difficulties with buprenorphine induction, most commonly withdrawal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth practices and prescribing to new patients without an in-person examination were adopted by DATA-waivered clinicians during the first six months of COVID-19. Permanent adoption of these authorities may enable expanded access to buprenorphine treatment.","Jones, Christopher M; Diallo, Mamadou M; Vythilingam, Meena; Schier, Joshua G; Eisenstat, Matthew; Compton, Wilson M",Drug Alcohol Depend,506,21

Our geometrical approach proceeds from an analysis of the crystal structure reported for each protein. We quantify, residue-by-residue and region-by-region, the spatial and angular changes in the structure as the protein denatures, and quantify differences that result from the seven residues that differ in the two proteins. Using two independent analyses, one based on spatial metrics and the second on angular metrics, we establish the order of unfolding of the five helices in cyt c-b562 and the four helices in the apo protein. For the two helices nearest the N-terminal end of both proteins, the ones in the apo protein unfold first. For the two helices nearest the C-terminal end, the interior helix of the apo protein unfolds first, whereas the terminal helix of the holo protein unfolds first. Excluded-volume effects (repulsive interactions) are minimized in turning regions; the overall range in &#916; values is &#916; = 36.3 Å3 for cyt c-b562 and &#916; = 36.6 Å3 for the apo protein, whereas the span for all 20 amino acids is &#916; = 167.7 Å3. As our work indicates that the interior helix of cytochrome c-b562 is the first to fold, we suggest that this helix protects the heme from misligation, consistent with ultrafast folding over a minimally frustrated funneled landscape.","Kozak, John J; Gray, Harry B; Garza-López, Roberto A",J Inorg Biochem,506,23

In developing countries, adequate health facilities and staff numbers are a concern. Ghana recorded its first 2 cases of COVID-19 on 12 March 2020. On 30 March 2020, a partial lockdown for 14 days was imposed and later extended along with other measures. By the end of the initial lockdown, 19 April 2020, an estimated 86,000 people had been traced and 68,591 tests performed. Of the 68,591 tests, there were 1,042 (1.5%) positive cases, 9 deaths, and 99 recoveries, with Ghana ranked number one among African countries in administering tests per million people. Ghana's effective track and trace system, as well as lockdown and other measures, have helped limit mortality with only 85 recorded deaths by 23 June 2020. Scientists from three facilities of the University of Ghana have also successfully sequenced the genomes of COVID-19 from 15 confirmed cases, and the Food and Drugs Authority in Ghana have also helped address shortages by fast-tracking certification of hand sanitizers and local production of 3.6 million standardized personal protective equipment. There has also been the development of prototypes of locally-manufactured mechanical ventilators to meet local need at intensive care units. Most people have also resorted to changing diets and the use of supplements to boost their immune system.

Contamination of foods by bacterial pathogens (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella typhimurium) results in human infection. A typical example is the current issue with Coronavirus, which has the potential for foodborne transmission and ruling out such concerns is often difficult. Although, the possible dissemination of such viruses via the food chain has been raised. Standard bacterial detection methods require several hours or even days to obtain the results, and the delay may result in food poisoning to eventuate. Conventional biochemical and microbiological tests are expensive, complex, time-consuming and not always reliable. Therefore, there are urgent demands to develop simple, cheap, quick, sensitive, specific and reliable tests for the detection of these pathogens in foods. Recent advances in smart materials, nanomaterials and biomolecular modeling have been a quantum leap in the development of biosensors in overcoming the limitations of a conventional standard laboratory assay. This research aimed to critically review bacteriophage-based biosensors, used for the detection of foodborne pathogens, as well as their trends, outcomes and challenges are discussed. The future perspective in the use of simple and cheap biosensors is in the development of lab-on-chips, and its availability in every household to test the quality of their food.","Aliakbar Ahovan, Zahra; Hashemi, Ali; De Plano, Laura Maria; Gholipourmalekabadi, Mazaher; Seifalian, Alexander",,506,16

The level of ozone gas concentration in the air, confined within an indoor space during an ozone-based disinfection process, is analysed. The purpose of this work is to investigate how ozone is distributed in time within an enclosed space. Design/methodology/approach: A computational methodology for predicting the space- and time-dependent ozone concentration within the room across the consecutive steps of the disinfection process (generation, dwelling and destruction modes) is proposed. The emission and removal of ozone from the air volume are possible by means of a generator located in the middle of the room. This model also accounts for ozone reactions and decay kinetics, and gravity effect on the air. Finding: This work is validated against experimental measurements at different locations in the room during the disinfection cycle. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data. This comparison proves that the presented methodology is able to provide accurate predictions of the time evolution of ozone concentration at different locations of the enclosed space. Originality/value: This study introduces a novel computational methodology describing solute transport by turbulent flow for predicting the level of ozone concentration within a closed room during a COVID-19 disinfection process. A parametric study is carried out to evaluate the impact of system settings on the time variation of ozone concentration within the space considered. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Tamaddon Jahromi, H.; Rolland, S.; Jones, J.; Coccarelli, A.; Sazonov, I.; Kershaw, C.; Tizaoui, C.; Holliman, P.; Worsley, D.; Thomas, H.; Nithiarasu, P.",International Journal of Numerical Methods for Heat and Fluid Flow,506,6

Também permanece desconhecido quando essas alterações acontecem, se acontecem desde a maturação oocitária e o papel que as células do cumulus possuem neste mecanismo. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi estudar e comparar o metabolismo lipídico e homeostase celular, além dos perfis de miRNAs, durante a maturação oocitária e o desenvolvimento embrionário inicial in vivo e in vitro em bovinos. Para isso, o trabalho foi dividido em 4 estudos. No Estudo 1, intitulado A maturação in vitro gera complexos cumulus-oócitos metabolicamente desregulados e estressados em bovinos foram analisadas as células do cumulus e oócitos de complexos cumulus-oócitos (COCs) imaturos e maturados in vivo e in vitro. Foram realizadas análises de quantificação de lipídeos, espécies reativas de oxigênio (EROs), glutationa reduzida (GSH), razão ATP/ADP assim como expressão de mRNAs e miRNAs relacionados com as vias de metabolismo e homeostase celular. A partir dos dados obtidos neste estudo, concluímos que a maturação in vitro (MIV) provoca aumento de lipídeos no COC, diminuição de GSH e da atividade mitocondrial nos oócitos, acompanhado por uma desregulação massiva das vias relacionadas a metabolismo e homeostase nas células do cumulus da MIV. No Estudo 2, intitulado A proteína ligadora de ácidos graxos 3 (Fatty Acid Binding Protein 3 - FABP3) e as projeções transzonais estão envolvidas no acúmulo lipídico durante a maturação in vitro em oócitos bovinos foi constatado aumento do conteúdo lipídico e da expressão da FABP3 nas células do cumulus da MIV, quando comparado ao sistema in vivo. Ainda, imunolocalizamos a FABP3 dentro das projeções transzonais (TZPs) e verificamos um aumento concomitante da FABP3 e dos lipídeos oocitários nas primeiras 9 horas da MIV. Mediante a remoção das TZPs às 9 horas da MIV e consequente diminuição lipídica observada no oócito, concluímos que existe um possível transporte de ácidos graxos a partir das células do cumulus até o oócito mediante FABP3 e TZPs. No Estudo 3, intitulado Alterações no metabolismo lipídico e homeostase celular entre embriões bovinos produzidos in vivo e in vitro, verificamos que, mesmo utilizando um cultivo in vitro com baixa tensão de oxigênio e sem soro, os blastocistos da PIVE possuem maiores níveis de lipídeos e EROs que aqueles produzidos in vivo. Além disso, constatamos que essas alterações nos lipídeos durante a PIVE não estão acompanhadas de alterações de expressão, porém, existe um aumento na expressão de genes relacionados com estresse. No último estudo, O sistema in vitro altera o perfil de miRNAs durante a maturação oocitária e desenvolvimento embrionário inicial em bovino, constatamos as diferenças no perfil de miRNAs e nas vias reguladas por estes nas células do cumulus e oócitos maturados in vivo e in vitro e em blastocistos produzidos in vivo e in vitro. Verificamos uma maior regulação por miRNAs durante a maturação nas células do cumulus comparado ao oócito. Além do mais, tanto no COC quanto nos blastocistos, os miRNAs mostraram regular vias importantes do metabolismo, comunicação celular e vias de sinalização importantes para a maturação e desenvolvimento embrionário inicial. Conjuntamente, este trabalho permitiu elucidar as diferenças que a PIVE provoca no metabolismo e homeostase celular e na expressão de miRNAs.","BARRONDO, MAITE DEL COLLADO",,506,20

This article formulates a robust nonlinear mixed-effects model based in the class of scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions for modeling COVID-19 deaths, which allows the analysts to model such data in the presence of the above described features simultaneously. An efficient EM-type algorithm is proposed to carry out maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. The bootstrap method is used to determine inherent characteristics of the nonlinear individual profiles such as confidence interval of the predicted deaths and fitted curves. The target is to model COVID-19 deaths curves from some Latin American countries since this region is the new epicenter of the disease. Moreover, since a mixed-effect framework borrows information from the population-average effects, in our analysis we include some countries from Europe and North America that are in a more advanced stage of their COVID-19 deaths curve.","Schumacher, Fernanda L.; Ferreira, Clecio S.; Prates, Marcos O.; Lachos, Alberto; Lachos, Victor H.",,506,16

AIMS: To characterise a motor-free cognitive profile of adolescents with CP using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth edition (WISC-V) and explore the influence of clinical factors on cognitive abilities. METHODS AND PROCEDURE: The WISC-V was used to assess cognitive abilities in 70 adolescents (M = 14 years 6 months, SD = 10 months). Sixty-six adolescents (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Level I, n = 26 ; II, n = 23; III, n = 15; IV, n = 1; V, n = 1) obtained either a Motor-free IQ or index score using the motor-free method. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: MFIQ and index scores fell below the normative data and rates of borderline and impaired cognitive abilities were significantly higher in the CP group. Scores showed an uneven cognitive profile with a relative strength in verbal abilities. Severity of motor impairment and small for gestational age (SGA) were associated with lower IQ scores. A history of seizures was related to lower verbal abilities. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Cognitive abilities of adolescents with CP are significantly below expectation compared to normative data. Severity of motor impairment, SGA, and seizures need to be recognised by health professionals as risk factors for cognitive impairment. A substantial proportion of adolescents showed borderline cognitive abilities, constituting a group with CP which are relatively neglected in the literature.","Coceski, Monika; Hocking, Darren R; Abu-Rayya, Hisham M; Sherwell, Sarah; Reid, Susan M; Reddihough, Dinah S; Wrennall, Jacquie; Stargatt, Robyn",Res Dev Disabil,506,1

This view changed since the beginning of this century, with the 2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic and the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreak, two zoonotic infections that resulted in mortality rates of approximately 10% and 35%, respectively. Despite the importance of these pathogens, no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of human coronavirus infections became available. However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus, was found to inhibit the replication of a wide range of human and animal coronaviruses in vitro and in preclinical studies. It is therefore not surprising that when the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in China, causing global health concern due to the virus strong human-to-human transmission ability, remdesivir was one of the first clinical candidates that received attention. After in vitro studies had shown its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, and a first patient was successfully treated with the drug in the USA, a number of trials on remdesivir were initiated. Several had encouraging results, particularly the ACTT-1 double blind, randomized, and placebo controlled trial that has shown shortening of the time to recovery in hospitalized patients treated with remdesivir. The results of other trials were instead negative. Here, we provide an overview of remdesivir discovery, molecular mechanism of action, and initial and current clinical studies on its efficacy.","Santoro, M Gabriella; Carafoli, Ernesto",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,506,1

METHODS: We did a cross-sectional online survey from March 2 to 2 April 2020 and a total of 19,379 healthcare workers from 25 provinces participated. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively. RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD was 15.5%, 12.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Frontline workers had higher prevalence estimates than non-frontline workers (depression: 18.2% vs. 13.9%; anxiety: 14.7% vs. 11.6%; PTSD: 6.1% vs. 4.6%). Subgroups who were nurses, were married or had dependent children reported higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Despite of the large variations, the prevalence of mental disorders was lowest in East China, followed by Middle China, and highest in West China. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers faced enormous stress not only from the direct risk presented by the COVID-19 outbreak, but also from the profound changes in their professional practice. Prevalence of adverse psychological outcomes has a significant association with geographically distribution of health resources and regional economic level. Sufficient medical resource may be a protective factor to mental health condition of healthcare personnel when such a public health emergency happened.","Yang, Xiaoguang; Chen, Danni; Chen, Yuntao; Wang, Nan; Lyv, Chao; Li, Yao; Jie, Junqin; Zhou, Taiqi; Li, Yongbin; Zhou, Ping",Int. j. health plann. manage,506,29

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are vulnerable due to their role in the management of COVID-19 infected patients. As of June 2020, a total of 847 HCWs in Oman had reportedly contracted COVID-19, with an incidence rate of 1.47%. This study therefore aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Muscat Governorate, Oman, as well as to evaluate adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection among HCWs working under the Directorate General of Health Services of Muscat Governorate, Ministry of Health, between February and June 2020. Data regarding the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, risk factors, pre-existing medical conditions, and adherence to IPC measures were collected using a self-administered questionnaire distributed via a web-based mobile application. RESULTS: A total of 126 HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 infection participated in the study. Of these, 72.2% were female, 53.2% worked in primary care facilities, and 61.1% were medical doctors or nurses. Only 18.1% were over 45 years of age and 30.2% had pre-existing medical conditions. While 29.4% had never received IPC training, the majority followed recommended hand hygiene practice (96.8%) and social distancing protocols (93.7%) and wore protective facemasks for routine patient care (96.9%). CONCLUSION: While the majority of HCWs followed crucial IPC measures, one-third had never received specific IPC training or faced restrictions on PPE use. HCWs, including those in housekeeping and administrative functions are recommended to undergo rigorous IPC training. In addition, high-risk HCWs could be assigned duties away from active COVID 19 cases. It is recommended to restructure health facilities for better adherence to IPC standards.","Al Abri, Zahir Ghassan Hilal; Al Zeedi, Manar Al Sanaa Ali; Al Lawati, Anwar Ahmed",J Prim Care Community Health,506,16

In this paper, the novel methodology of finite mixture Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) approach with Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced. The applicability of this methodology is comprehensively evaluated for the forecasting of energy related time series including wind speed, wind power generation, and electricity price. Its forecasting performances are evaluated by various criteria, and also compared with those of the conventional AutoRegressive Moving-Average (ARMA) model and the less conventional ARMA-GARCH model. It is found that the proposed mixture GARCH model outperforms the other two models in terms of volatility modeling for all the energy related time series considered. This is proven to be statistically significant because the p-values of likelihood ratio test are less than 0.0001. On the other hand, in terms of estimations of mean wind speed, mean wind power output, and mean electricity price, no significant improvement from the proposed model is obtained. The results indicate that the proposed finite mixture GARCH model is a viable approach for mitigating the associated risk in energy related predictions thanks to the reduced errors on volatility modeling.","Zhang, Yang Peng Yidong Qu Xiuli Shi Jing Ergin Erdem",Energies,506,10

Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.","Wang, Y-X; Ma, J-R; Wang, S-Q; Zeng, Y-Q; Zhou, C-Y; Ru, Y-H; Zhang, L; Lu, Z-G; Wu, M-H; Li, H",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,506,20

The aim of this report is to describe the results of treating COVID-19 positive patients with nitazoxanide in three clinical settings: pregnancy/puerperium, hospitalized patients in an Internal Medicine Service and in an ambulatory setting. METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective follow-up and report of COVID-19 cases in three different situations, pregnant women, hospitalized patients receiving medical attention in an Internal Medicine Service and ambulatory patients residing in Toluca City, and Mexico City. RESULTS: The experience with a first group of 20 women, pregnant (17) or in immediate puerperium (3) was successful in 18 cases with two unfortunate deaths. The five cases treated in an Internal Medicine service showed a positive outcome with two patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. Of the remaining 16 patients treated in an ambulatory setting, all got cured. Nitazoxanide seems to be useful against SARS-CoV-2, not only in an early intervention but also in critical condition as well as in pregnancy without undesired effects for the babies. As an adjunctive therapy budesonide was used that seems to contribute to the clinical improvement.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of quarantine on the self-perceived preparedness of dental graduates and to explore the efficacy of online education from students' perspectives. METHODS: The questionnaire distributed to dental students comprised of two main sections. The first part covered the online education experience, and the second part measured the level of self-perceived preparedness for a range of cognitive, communication and professional skills. RESULTS: The survey yielded a response rate of 72%. The majority of students (77%) agreed that they missed educational experiences as a result of the lockdown. More than half of them felt less motivated to follow-up with distant e-learning and believed that online assessment is not a good method for evaluation. A high percentage of the students (66%) thought that online group discussions had a positive value while 67% preferred online lectures compared to theatre lectures. Majority of students particularly 5th year (78.7%) (p < 0.001) stated that the quarantine increased their collaboration with their colleagues. According to 87% of students, the experience most negatively affected was their clinical training. In general, students showed satisfactory self-perceived preparedness related to a range of attributes and professional skills.

SARS-Cov2 has infected over four million people and caused over 290,000 deaths worldwide. Although most cases are mild, a subset of patients develop a severe and atypical presentation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is characterised by a cytokine release storm (CRS). Paradoxically, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and immune regulators has been associated with worsening of ARDS. We hypothesize that the intrinsic circadian clock of the lung and the immune system may regulate individual components of CRS, and thus, chronotherapy may be used to effectively manage ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

We aimed to assess the safety of the vaccine among healthcare workers.Methods: A self-administered online survey on monitoring adverse reactions post vaccination was conducted among the staff who worked at and were vaccinated in a tertiary hospital in Taizhou, China, from February 24 to 7 March 2021. A total of 1526 subjects responded to the questionnaire when they received an e-mail or an e-poster on WeChat.Results: The incidences of overall adverse reactions after the first and second injections were 15.6% (238/1526) and 14.6% (204/1397), respectively. The most common adverse reaction was localized pain at the injection site, with an incidence of 9.6% and 10.7% after each dose, accounting for 61.8% and 73.0% of adverse reactions, respectively. Fatigue, muscle pain, and headache were the most common systemic adverse reactions.Conclusions: These findings implied that the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine has an acceptable safety profile among healthcare workers due to the low incidence of self-reported adverse reactions.

METHODS: Scoping review based on literaature searches in national and international health science databases (Pubmed/Medline, Biblioteca virtual en salud (BVS), Scielo, COCHRANE and CUIDEN) and websites, and additionally by a ""snowball"" system. MeSH terms were used: ""COVID-19"", ""Pregnancy"", ""Delivery, Obstetric"" ""Pregnant Women"" and ""Maternal"". As limits in the search Spanish and English languages were selected. No limits were established in relation to the year of publication or type of article. RESULTS: A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations.

These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contact tracing. METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies variants, and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints. RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and a combination of mutations that appear in only a small number of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of 100 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients and determined their general prevalence when compared to over 70,000 other strains. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.","Lau, Billy T; Pavlichin, Dmitri; Hooker, Anna C; Almeda, Alison; Shin, Giwon; Chen, Jiamin; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, Chun Hong; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Lee, Ho Joon; Ji, Hanlee P",Genome Med,506,22

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests fomites may not be the main route through which the novel coronavirus spreads. Supporting the same view, the latest the World Health Organization report recommends wearing masks for every individual in public, highlighting the transmission through the air. In the current study AERMOD, one of the most validated and tested models suggested by the USEPA, is used to model SARS-CoV-2-laden PM10 in a hypothetical outdoor environment. Multiple scenarios including particle size, wind speed, source height variations as well as and combined scenarios were modeled to estimated how exposure risk changes with the above-mentioned variables. The results reveal that wind speed majorly narrows infectious plume rather than transferring the peak concentration. The particle size variation indicated that small particles, i.e.,0.01 - 2.5 µm, could reach more than 9 m away from the source in concentration range of 10 - 20 (µg/m 3). On the other hand, source height contributes to peak plume shift rather than dispersing the infected particles. This idea was further studies by using combined scenarios which indicated height difference can impact peak plume displacement rather than wind speed. In the worst-case scenario, the results indicate that the virus-laden particles can travel outdoors more than 8 m away from an infected source. The video output of the model results clearly shows the dynamic of viral peak shifts in several scenarios. The results also indicate that in specific conditions the airborne SARS-CoV-2 can be transported to 9 m away from the source. These findings can be useful for individuals as well as decision-makers to mitigated exposure risk in real-world conditions.

The aim of the current study was to report a snapshot of the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its correlated factors on medical staff in Guangdong, China. METHODS: On the 2nd and 3rd February 2020, soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed medical staff at four hospitals in Guangdong, China, to collect demographic characteristics, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores. RESULTS: Complete responses were received from 1045 medical staff. Respondents were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to their working environment of contacting with potential or confirmed COVID-19 cases. The proportion of staff with anxiety (55.4% v. 43.0%, p < 0.001) or depression (43.6% v. 36.8%, p = 0.028) was significantly higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group.

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in 319 individuals aged &#8805; 60 years that completed a validated field instrument to assess their social risk before the introduction of this novel pandemic. Multivariate models were fitted to assess the independent association between SDH-and each of their components-and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, after adjusting for relevant covariates. According to the Gijon scale, 102 (32%) individuals had a high social risk (&#8805; 10 points). A total of 141 (44%) individuals were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2. A fully-adjusted logistic regression model showed an independent) association between social risk and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.27; p = 0.008). For every unit of the total SDH score, the odds of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity increased 15% (95% CI 3.7-27%). In addition, multivariate models showed that the individual component of SDH more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was housing, which suggested that lack of basic home facilities may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Several suspected mechanisms could explain the association between vascular thrombosis in the convalescent period (endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, systemic inflammatory response and vasculopathy). Additional studies on ""long COVID"" are essential for identifying endotheliopathy and thrombotic sequalae.","Wong, S. W.; Fan, B. E.; Huang, W.; Chia, Y.

The notices are classified into 3 levels based on the risk posed by the outbreak and what precautions should be in place to prevent spreading. What objectively observed criteria of these COVID-19 situations are required for classification and visualization? This study aimed to visualize the epidemic outbreak and the provisional case fatality rate (CFR) using the Rasch model and Bayes's theorem and developed an algorithm that classifies countries/regions into categories that are then shown on Google Maps. METHODS: We downloaded daily COVID-19 outbreak numbers for countries/regions from the GitHub website, which contains information on confirmed cases in more than 30 Chinese locations and other countries/regions. The Rasch model was used to estimate the epidemic outbreak for each country/region using data from recent days. All responses were transformed by using the logarithm function. The Bayes's base CFRs were computed for each region. The geographic risk of transmission of the COVID-19 epidemic was thus determined using both magnitudes (i.e., Rasch scores and CFRs) for each country. RESULTS: The top 7 countries were Iran, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Spain, China (Hubei), and France, with values of {4.53, 3.47, 3.18, 1.65, 1.34 1.13, 1.06} and {13.69%, 0.91%, 47.71%, 0.23%, 24.44%, 3.56%, and 16.22%} for the outbreak magnitudes and CFRs, respectively. The results were consistent with the US CDC travel advisories of warning level 3 in China, Iran, and most European countries and of level 2 in South Korea on March 16, 2020. CONCLUSION: We created an online algorithm that used the CFRs to display the geographic risks to understand COVID-19 transmission. The app was developed to display which countries had higher travel risks and aid with the understanding of the outbreak situation.","Jen, Tung-Hui; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Lin, Jui-Chung John; Kuo, Shu-Chun; Chou, Willy",Medicine (Baltimore),506,20

Besides the stress and isolation that many students experience simply due to the physical distancing requirements imposed by the crisis, students new to learning in an online environment may feel further isolated and disengaged from the course content. Consequently, we explored the use of an existing online social networking tool, Instagram, to enhance students' engagement with online course material. In this study, students enrolled in both undergraduate and graduate online science courses were invited to participate. Course instructors posted materials related to the topics covered in the course weekly sessions, including links to news reports, cartoons, and short quizzes. At the conclusion of each course, a questionnaire focusing on the students' experience was distributed to all participants. Results from the survey showed that the weekly Instagram posts allowed students to feel more engaged with the course content and connected with the course instructors and classmates. However, some students reported that the posts were not helpful or that they did not feel comfortable using social networking tools for education purposes due to privacy concerns.

Recent research has shown that people's brain activity becomes synchronized with others' (inter-brain synchrony) during social engagement. However, little is known as to whether inter-brain synchrony relates to collective behavior within teams. Here, we merge the nascent field of group neuroscience with the extant literature of team dynamics and collective performance. We recruited 174 participants in groups of 4 and randomly assigned them to complete a series of problem-solving tasks either independently or as a team, while simultaneously recording each person's brain activity using an EEG hyperscanning setup. This design allowed us to examine the relationship between group identification and inter-brain synchrony in explaining collective performance. As expected, teammates identified more strongly with one another, cooperated more on an economic game, and outperformed the average individual on most problem-solving tasks. Crucially, inter-brain synchrony, but not self-reported group identification, predicted collective performance among teams. These results suggest that inter-brain synchrony can be informative in understanding collective performance among teams where self-report measures may fail to capture behavior.","Reinero, Diego A; Dikker, Suzanne; Van Bavel, Jay J",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,506,1

We aim at ACE2 and Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase as potential drug candidate in COVID 19 management in the present work. For drug designing, various computational simulation strategies have been employed like Swiss-Model, Hawk Dock, HDOCK, py Dock, and PockDrug for homology modeling, binding energies of the molecule with a target, simulate the conformation and binding poses, statistics of protein lock with target key and drug ability, respectively. The current in-silico screening depicts that the spike protein receptor is complementary to the target when bound to each other and forms a stable complex. The MMGBSA free energy binding property of receptor and ligand is critical. The intermolecular Statistics with the target Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase complex are plausible. We have also observed a high-affinity pocket binding site with the target. Therefore, the favorable intermolecular interactions and Physico-chemical properties emanate as a drug candidate treating COVID-19. This study has approached computational tools to analyze the conformation, binding affinity, and drug ability of receptor-ligand. Thus, the spike receptor with its ACE2 receptor with Nsp10/Nsp16 MTase complex would be a potent drug against SARS CoV-2 and can cure the infection as per consensus scoring.","Siddiqa, M A; Rao, D S; Suvarna, G; Chennamachetty, V K; Verma, M K; Rao, M V R",Int J Pept Res Ther,506,16

Unfortunately, the number of effective and accessible medicines for the prevention and treatment of these infections is limited. Therefore, in recent years, efforts have been intensified to develop new antiviral medicines or vaccines. In this review article, the structure and activity of the most promising antiviral cyanobacterial products are presented. The antiviral cyanometabolites are mainly active against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other enveloped viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), Ebola or the influenza viruses. The majority of the metabolites are classified as lectins, monomeric or dimeric proteins with unique amino acid sequences. They all show activity at the nanomolar range but differ in carbohydrate specificity and recognize a different epitope on high mannose oligosaccharides. The cyanobacterial lectins include cyanovirin-N (CV-N), scytovirin (SVN), microvirin (MVN), Microcystisviridis lectin (MVL), and Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA). Cyanobacterial polysaccharides, peptides, and other metabolites also have potential to be used as antiviral drugs. The sulfated polysaccharide, calcium spirulan (CA-SP), inhibited infection by enveloped viruses, stimulated the immune system's response, and showed antitumor activity. Microginins, the linear peptides, inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), therefore, their use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with injury of the ACE2 expressing organs is considered. In addition, many cyanobacterial extracts were revealed to have antiviral activities, but the active agents have not been identified. This fact provides a good basis for further studies on the therapeutic potential of these microorganisms.","Mazur-Marzec, Hanna; Ceglowska, Marta; Konkel, Robert; Pyrc, Krzysztof",Biomolecules,506,16

Young adults have proven to be a critical factor for COVID-19 transmission and are an important target of the efforts to contain the pandemic. Scalable digital public health technologies could be deployed to reduce COVID-19 transmission, but their use depends on the willingness of young adults to participate in surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the attitudes of young adults regarding COVID-19 digital surveillance, including which aspects they would accept and which they would not, as well as to determine factors that may be associated with their willingness to participate in digital surveillance. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous online survey of young adults aged 18-24 years throughout the United States in June 2020. The questionnaire contained predominantly closed-ended response options with one open-ended question. Descriptive statistics were applied to the data. RESULTS: Of 513 young adult respondents, 383 (74.7%) agreed that COVID-19 represents a public health crisis. However, only 231 (45.1%) agreed to actively share their COVID-19 status or symptoms for monitoring and only 171 (33.4%) reported a willingness to allow access to their cell phone for passive location tracking or contact tracing. CONCLUSIONS: Despite largely agreeing that COVID-19 represents a serious public health risk, the majority of young adults sampled were reluctant to participate in digital monitoring to manage the pandemic. This was true for both commonly used methods of public health surveillance (such as contact tracing) and novel methods designed to facilitate a return to normal (such as frequent symptom checking through digital apps). This is a potential obstacle to ongoing containment measures (many of which rely on widespread surveillance) and may reflect a need for greater education on the benefits of public health digital surveillance for young adults.","Maytin, Lauren; Maytin, Jason; Agarwal, Priya; Krenitsky, Anna; Krenitsky, JoAnn; Epstein, Robert S",JMIR Form Res,506,20

This study quantifies night-to-night variability of BAI and establishes probability thresholds for inferring underlying brain pathology based on a patient's BAI. METHODS: 86 patients with multiple nights of consecutive EEG recordings were selected from Epilepsy Monitoring Unit patients whose EEGs reported as within normal limits. While EEGs with epileptiform activity were excluded, the majority of patients included in the study had a diagnosis of chronic epilepsy. BAI was calculated for each 12-hour segment of patient data using a previously established algorithm, and the night-to-night variability in BAI was measured. RESULTS: The within-patient night-to-night standard deviation in BAI was 7.5 years. Estimates of BAI derived by averaging over 2, 3, and 4 nights had standard deviations of 4.7, 3.7, and 3.0 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Averaging BAI over n nights reduces night-to-night variability of BAI by a factor of n, rendering BAI a more suitable biomarker of brain health at the individual level. A brain age risk lookup table of results provides thresholds above which a patient has a high probability of excess BAI. SIGNIFICANCE: With increasing ease of EEG acquisition, including wearable technology, BAI has the potential to track brain health and detect deviations from normal physiologic function. The measure of night-to-night variability and how this is reduced by averaging across multiple nights provides a basis for using BAI in patients' homes to identify patients who should undergo further investigation or monitoring.","Hogan, Jacob; Sun, Haoqi; Paixao, Luis; Westmeijer, Mike; Sikka, Pooja; Jin, Jing; Tesh, Ryan; Cardoso, Madalena; Cash, Sydney S; Akeju, Oluwaseun; Thomas, Robert; Westover, M Brandon",Clin Neurophysiol,506,20

However, en masse mitigation has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. In this paper we demonstrate how individualized policies based on disease status can reduce transmission risk while minimizing impacts on economic outcomes. We design feedback control policies informed by optimal control solutions to modulate interaction rates of individuals based on the epidemic state. We identify personalized interaction rates such that recovered/immune individuals elevate their interactions and susceptible individuals remain at home before returning to pre-lockdown levels. As we show, feedback control policies can yield similar population-wide infection rates to total shutdown but with significantly lower economic costs and with greater robustness to uncertainty compared to optimal control policies. Our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","Li, Guanlin; Shivam, Shashwat; Hochberg, Michael E; Wardi, Yorai; Weitz, Joshua S",iScience,506,16

These include elective surgical services due to the synergetic resources required to provide both perioperative surgical care whilst also treating acute COVID-19 patients and also the poor outcomes associated with surgical patients who develop COVID-19 in the perioperative period. This article discusses the important principles and concepts for providing important surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the model of the RMCancerSurgHub which is providing surgical cancer services for a population of approximately 2 million people across London during the pandemic. The model focusses on creating local and regional hub centres which provide urgent treatment for surgical patients in an environment that is relatively protected from the burden of COVID-19 illness. The model extensively utilises the extended multidisciplinary team to allow for a flexible approach with core services delivered in 'clean' sites which can adapt to viral surges. A key requirement is that of a clinical prioritisation process which allows for equity in access within and between specialties ensuring that patients are treated on the basis of greatest need, while at the same time protecting those whose conditions can safely wait from exposure to the virus. Importantly, this model has the ability to scale-up activity and lead units and networks into the recovery phase. The model discussed is also broadly applicable to providing surgical services during any viral pandemic.","Kasivisvanathan, Ramanathan; Tilney, Henry S; Jhanji, Shaman; O039,; Mahony, Michelle; Gruber, Pascale; Nicol, David; Morgan, Dominic; Kipps, Emma; Rasheed, Shahnawaz",Int. j. health plann. manage,506,10

Nowadays, there is uncertainty regarding the timing of tracheostomy, the prognosis of these patients and the safety of healthcare workers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tracheostomy placement in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study on 23 COVID 19 patients, to analyse the timing of tracheostomy, the risk factors associated with in-hospital death and the infection of the involved health care workers. Early tracheostomy was defined as &#8804; 10 days and late ones > 10 days. RESULTS: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU that underwent tracheostomy was 18%. The overall mortality of patients admitted to ICU was 53%. The univariate analysis revealed that early tracheostomy, SOFA score > 6, and D-dimer level > 4 were significantly associated with a greater risk of death. At the multivariate analysis SOFA score > 6 and D-dimer level > 4 resulted as significant factors for a higher risk of death. No health care workers associated with tracheostomy are confirmed to be infected by SARS-CoV2. CONCLUSION: We suggest to wait at least 14 days to perform tracheostomy. In patients with SOFA score > 6 and D dimer > 4, tracheostomy should not be performed or should be postponed. Optimized procedures and enhanced personal protective equipment can make the tracheostomy safe and beneficial in COVID-19 patients.","Volo, T; Stritoni, P; Battel, I; Zennaro, B; Lazzari, F; Bellin, M; Michieletto, L; Spinato, G; Busatto, C; Politi, D; Spinato, R",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,506,16

Hepatic abnormalities significantly increase during COVID-19 and a more severe infection occurs in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, among which the most frequent is metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). It has been described that MAFLD patients had a higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19, higher abnormal liver tests and longer viral shedding time. The presence of fibrosis in MAFLD patients is another risk factor for severity of COVID-19. Due to the overgrowing prevalence of MAFLD, it could be speculated that a large proportion of the population might be at risk of severe COVID-19 and the identification of these patients possibly by using liver enzymes as risk predictors may be crucial for an early diagnosis and for the management of the infection.","Dongiovanni, Paola; Meroni, Marica; Longo, Miriam; Fracanzani, Anna Ludovica",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,506,26

Analysis of bacterial abundance correlation networks confirmed disruption of the bacterial community at 10-13 dpi. Some alterations in microbiota persisted after the resolution of the infection until day 26. Some changes in the relative bacterial taxon abundance associated with infectious parameters. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Acinetobacter (Proteobacteria) and some genera of the Ruminococcaceae family (Firmicutes) was positively correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. Targeted quantitative metabolomics indicated a drop in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and changes in several bile acids and tryptophan metabolites in infected animals. The relative abundance of several taxa known to be SCFA producers (mostly from the Ruminococcaceae family) was negatively correlated with systemic inflammatory markers while the opposite correlation was seen with several members of the genus Streptococcus. Collectively, SARS-CoV-2 infection in a nonhuman primate is associated with changes in the gut microbiota's composition and functional activity.","Sokol, Harry; Contreras, Vanessa; Maisonnasse, Pauline; Desmons, Aurore; Delache, Benoit; Sencio, Valentin; Machelart, Arnaud; Brisebarre, Angela; Humbert, Lydie; Deryuter, Lucie; Gauliard, Emilie; Heumel, Severine; Rainteau, Dominique; Dereuddre-Bosquet, Nathalie; Menu, Elisabeth; Ho Tsong Fang, Raphael; Lamaziere, Antonin; Brot, Loic; Wahl, Celine; Oeuvray, Cyriane; Rolhion, Nathalie; Van Der Werf, Sylvie; Ferreira, Stéphanie; Le Grand, Roger; Trottein, François",Gut Microbes,506,29

We seek to examine the impact of clinical variables such as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) on mortality and need for intubation, as well as demographic variables such as age, sex, and race on persons with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. METHODS: Analyses were conducted on 4413 patients with an International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test to compare subgroup analyses. RESULTS: In this multivariate analysis, male gender, older age, and hyperglycemia at admission were associated with increased mortality and intubation, but this was not seen for race, ethnicity, insurance type, or HbA1c. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, having comorbid conditions such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic levels at admission have a greater impact on health outcomes than HbA1c. Older men and those with comorbid disease are also at greater risk for mortality.

The present study intends to clarify the effect of these restrictions on emergency medical service (EMS) operations. Materials and methods: Retrospective chart review of EMS operation protocols over the first 6 months of 2020 (nâ¯= 6668 rescue missions) in four rescue stations in eastern Lower Saxony (Germany). Description and statistical comparison of operations 6 weeks before the restrictions with an equally long period after the order of the restrictions (""lockdown""). Results: During the 6 weeks after the lockdown the frequency of rescue operations decreased by 17.7%. In particular, there was a 40.6% (nâ¯= 91) decrease of emergency cases with respiratory diseases, mainly due to a decline of pneumonia and exacerbated chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At the same time, patients' mean age increased with fewer patients under 65 years. There were no changes in the frequency of psychiatric disorders, deceased or injured patients, or refusal of treatment and transport. A total of 67 patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV­2 infection (1.0%) were observed during this period. Discussion: EMS experienced a reduction of operations as a result of contact restrictions, although not as pronounced as was recently described for emergency rooms. This supports the hypothesis that the reduction is particularly evident in less severe cases and in younger patients. The reduction in pneumonia and COPD cases is striking. On the one hand, this could indicate that contact restrictions reduce the incidence of other respiratory infections and their impact on chronic respiratory disorders, but it could also mean that patients try to avoid hospital treatment.","Müller, Frank; Hummers, Eva; Jablonka, Alexandra; Schmidt, Tobias; Noack, Eva Maria",Notf Rett Med,506,33

Compared with the development of new drugs, drug repurposing can significantly reduce the cost, time, and safety risks. Given the fact that coronavirus harnesses spike protein to invade host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), hence we see if any previous anti-virtual compounds can block spike-ACE2 interaction and inhibit the virus entry. The results of molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that remdesivir exhibits better than expected anti-viral invasion potential against COVID-19 among the three types of compounds including remdesivir, tenofovir and lopinavir. In addition, a positive correlation between the surface area occupied by remdesivir and anti-viral invasion potential was also found. As such, the structure of remdesivir was modified by linking an N-benzyl substituted diamidine derivative to its hydroxyl group through an ester bond.

The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on a convenience sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1-3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed mental health-related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 Mental Distress Scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with significance set at P <0.05. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; mean age 24.78 ± 6.33 years). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments, and Hubei residence. The type of orthodontic appliance was associated with the anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concerns of prolonged treatment duration. The frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, time since last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","Xiong, Xin; Wu, Yange; Fang, Xinyi; Sun, Wei; Ding, Qin; Yi, Yating; Huang, Yanmei; Gong, Jinglei; Liu, Jin; Wang, Jun",Am. j. orthod. dentofacial orthop,506,25

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV2 IgG in older patients (aged &#8805;80 years) diagnosed with solid or hematological malignancies, one month after administering the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened 74 older patients with cancer, 45 of them accepted to receive the vaccination and collected serum samples from 36 patients; a group of medical doctors and nurses from our hospital was used as a control in a 1:2 ratio. RESULTS: The median age was 82 years (range 80-89). Median serum IgG were 2396,10 AU/ml (range 0-32,763,00) in patients with cancer and 8737,49 AU/ml (398.90-976,280,00) in the control group, p < 0.0001.

One assumption is that when unemployment is high people are more likely to work while being sick (discipline hypothesis). Against this background, we investigate the association between regional unemployment and sickness presenteeism. Second, we study interactions with factors of occupational disadvantage. METHODS: We combined survey data of 20 974 employees collected 2015 in 232 regions from 35 European countries with data on regional unemployment rates obtained from Eurostat. Presenteeism was assessed by the fraction of days worked while ill among all days with illness (presenteeism propensity). To investigate if unemployment was related to presenteeism, we estimated multi-level models (individuals nested in regions) that were adjusted for socio-demographic and occupational covariates to account for compositional differences of the regions. RESULTS: The mean presenteeism propensity was 34.8 (SD 40.4), indicating that workers chose presenteeism in 1 out of 3 days with sickness. We found that a change in unemployment by +10 percentage points was associated with a change in presenteeism by +5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2 to 8.6). This relationship was more pronounced among workers with low salary, low skill-level, and industrial and healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: Our results support the assumption that high unemployment elevates presenteeism, and that people in disadvantaged occupations are particularly affected. Policies managing presenteeism should consider the labour market context, particularly during the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reuter, Marvin; Dragano, Nico; Wahrendorf, Morten",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),506,24

The worldwide concern about the safety of patients and professionals in these institutions is relevant. In Brasil, a large part of post-acute care and chronic patients is performed at home through Home Care (HC). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 in Home Care patients and the clinical outcomes of these patients; it also aims to assess the impact of the epidemic on the number of patients, new admissions, and hospitalizations. METHODS: A descriptive study of the COVID-19 cases that affected the population in care by Home Doctor (a private company of Home Care), between the months of March 2020 and May 2020 and analysis of the total number of patients, the hospitalization and death rate in the period compared to the pre-epidemic period. RESULTS: There were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 21 of which were male, mean age 73 years. All patients had multiple comorbidities, the most prevalent were: Systemic Arterial Hypertension (54%) and Stroke (35%). The incidence of COVID-19 was 1% in the studied population. There were 10 hospitalizations with 5 hospital deaths and one case of home death (lethality 19%). Safe care was maintained, with a low death rate (0.6%) and hospitalization (6.1%). CONCLUSION: Home Care is able to maintain safe care during the pandemic due to COVID-19, with a low incidence of COVID-19, low hospitalization rate, and low mortality when compared to nursing homes institutions.","Gaspar, Heloisa Amaral; Oliveira, Cláudio Flauzino de; Jacober, Fabiana Camolesi; Deus, Eduardo Roberto de; Canuto, Flavia",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),506,20

Mathematical modelling can help predict how missed/delayed MDA will affect short-term epidemiological trends and elimination prospects by 2030. METHODS: Two onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities and age profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-y (2020) interruption or a 2-y (2020-2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. RESULTS: Programmes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19's impact on MDA. Programmes that had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high-transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-y interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) and adults (ONCHOSIM). CONCLUSIONS: Programmes with shorter (annual MDA) treatment histories should be prioritised for remedial biannual MDA. Increases in microfilarial load could have short- and long-term morbidity and mortality repercussions. These results can guide decision-making to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on onchocerciasis elimination.","Hamley, Jonathan I D; Blok, David J; Walker, Martin; Milton, Philip; Hopkins, Adrian D; Hamill, Louise C; Downs, Philip; de Vlas, Sake J; Stolk, Wilma A; Basáñez, Maria-Gloria",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,506,2

We conducted a qualitative study utilising Reddit discussion forum posts. We conducted three separate thematic analyses from 130 posts in subreddit forums aimed for people identifying with anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We identified a number of similar discussion forum themes (e.g., COVID-19 intensifying symptoms and a lack of social support), as well as themes that were unique to each forum type (e.g., hyperawareness and positive experiences during the pandemic).

The present paper summarizes findings from France's 2020 Report Card on physical activity for children and youth, comparing its results to its 2 previous editions (2016 and 2018). METHODS: France's 2020 Report Card follows the standardized methodology established by the Active Healthy Kids Global Matrix, grading 10 common physical activity indicators using the best available evidence. The grades were informed by national surveys, peer-reviewed literature, government and nongovernment reports, and online information. RESULTS: The expert panel awarded the following grades: Overall Physical Activity: D; Organized Sport Participation and Physical Activity: C-; Active Play: INC; Active Transportation: C-; Sedentary Behaviors: D-; Family and Peers: D-; Physical Fitness: D; School: B-; Community and the Built Environment: F; Government: C. CONCLUSIONS: This 2020 edition of France's Report Card again highlights the alarming levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviors among French children and adolescents, calling for the development of effective national action. It also draws attention to the particular deleterious effects of the COVID-19 confinement on youth's movement behaviors, which significantly worsened the situation.","Fillon, Alicia; Genin, Pauline; Larras, Benjamin; Vanhelst, Jeremy; Luiggi, Maxime; Aubert, Salome; Verdot, Charlotte; Rey, Olivier; Lhuisset, Lena; Bois, Julien; Fearnbach, Nicole; Duclos, Martine; Thivel, David",J Phys Act Health,506,26

Findings from a survey of 511 Chinese respondents suggest that, overall, individuals would perceive themselves to be less vulnerable than close others and distant others to the impact of COVID-19 digital disinformation. The highest self-other perceptual discrepancy is found when individuals receive disinformation on mobile social networking apps. Also, individuals who practice more active fact-checking perceive themselves to be less susceptible. The perception of disinformation effects on self as well as the self-other perceptual discrepancy is both positively related to emotional responses (anxiety, fear, and worry) to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study contributes to existing research by linking exposure to disinformation in different digital channels, the TPEs, and emotional outcomes in the context of a public health crisis. It also highlights the importance of educating and enabling fact-checking behaviors on digital media, which could help to reduce negative emotional impact of the disinformation.","Liu, Piper Liping; Huang, Lei Vincent",Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,506,2

It is not the first time, nor will it be last, that our increasingly globalized world has been significantly affected by the emergence of a new disease. In much of the Northern Hemisphere, the academic year begins in September, and for many countries, September 2020 marked the return to full schooling after some period of enforced closure due to COVID-19. In this paper, we focus on the airborne spread of disease and investigate the likelihood of transmission in school environments. It is crucial to understand the risk airborne infection from COVID-19 might pose to pupils, teachers, and their wider social groups. We use monitored CO2 data from 45 classrooms in 11 different schools from within the UK to estimate the likelihood of infection occurring within classrooms regularly attended by the same staff and pupils. We determine estimates of the number of secondary infections arising via the airborne route over pre/asymptomatic periods on a rolling basis. Results show that, assuming relatively quiet desk-based work, the number of secondary infections is likely to remain reassuringly below unity; however, it can vary widely between classrooms of the same school even when the same ventilation system is present. Crucially, the data highlight significant variation with the seasons with January being nearly twice as risky as July. We show that such seasonal variations in risk due to changes in ventilation rates are robust and our results hold for wide variations in disease parameterizations, suggesting our results may be applied to a number of different airborne diseases.","Vouriot, Carolanne V M; Burridge, Henry C; Noakes, Catherine J; Linden, Paul F",Indoor air,506,26

In a response to these developments, we examine the current and past limitations of the ways in which bioethicists have considered race and, more generally, discourses of marginalization. We argue that the foundational principle of justice necessitates that bioethics, as an institution, maintain an active voice against systemic injustice. To carry out this charge, bioethics as a field should promote alternative narratives-""counter storytelling""-to the mainstream voices that have traditionally been heard and accepted, largely without opposition. Additionally, we engage with both Post-Colonial and Critical Race Theory, which we believe are important tools for bioethics in pursuit of equity. Ultimately, we advocate for a proactive form of bioethics that actively resists and denounces injustice and which considers a much wider variety of voices about justice than bioethics has historically considered.","Mithani, Zamina; Cooper, Jane; Boyd, J Wesley",Am J Bioeth,506,17

So, rapid detection of all respiratory pathogens can facilitate prompt treatment and prevent the deterioration of respiratory disease. Previously published primers and probes of the TaqMan array card (TAC) for respiratory pathogens are not sensitive to Chinese clinical specimens. This study aimed to develop and improve the TAC assay to detect 28 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in a Chinese population. METHODS: To improve the sensitivity, we redesigned the primers and probes, and labeled the probes with minor groove binders. The amplification efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of the primers and probes were determined using target-gene containing standard plasmids. The detection performance of the TAC was evaluated on 754 clinical specimens and the results were compared with those from conventional methods. RESULTS: The performance of the TAC assay was evaluated using 754 clinical throat swab samples and the results were compared with those from gold-standard methods. The sensitivity and specificity were 95.4 and 96.6%, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the TAC was 10 to 100 copies/µL. CONCLUSIONS: TAC is an efficient, accurate, and high-throughput approach to detecting multiple respiratory pathogens simultaneously and is a promising tool for the identification of pathogen outbreaks.","Liu, Keke; Jing, Hongbo; Chen, Ying; Zheng, Xin; Jiang, Hua; Kong, Decong; Zheng, Yvling; Chen, Shuiping; Liu, Peng; Jiang, Yongqiang",BMC Infect Dis,506,19

To evaluate the ramification of infectious disease outbreaks on major traumatic injuries, we compared changes in the incidence of major trauma cases during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) period with COVID-19 in 2020. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the trauma registry of a major, tertiary-care teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Patients presenting with major traumatic injuries during the first six months of 2001-03 and 2018-20 were retrieved for analysis. Patient characteristics, injury mechanism, admitting service, and emergency department (ED)/hospital lengths of stay (LOS) were recorded. Raw and adjusted survival rates (using the modified Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS)) were recorded. RESULTS: The number of trauma cases fell dramatically during 2003 and 2020 compared with previous years. In both 2003 and 2020, the number of trauma registry patients fell by 49% in April (compared to the preceding reference years of 2001/02 and 2018/19, respectively). Patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were also different during the outbreak years. Comparing 2003 to 2020 relative to their respective reference baselines, the percentages of injuries that happened at home, patients without co-morbidities, and patients' mean age all increased in 2003 but decreased in 2020. Work-place injuries drastically dropped in 2003, but not in 2020. Average ED LOS dropped in 2003 by 36.4 min (95% CI 12.5, 60.3) but declined by only 14.5 min (95% CI -2.9, 32.1) in 2020. Both observed and expected 30-day mortality declined in 2020 vs. 2003 (observed 4.5% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.001, OR 0.352, 95% CI 0.187, 0.661) (expected 4.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.002, OR 0.358, 95% CI 0.188, 0.684). CONCLUSION: Major trauma cases dropped by half during both the peak of the 2003 SARS and 2020 COVID-19 pandemics in Hong Kong, suggesting a trend for future pandemic planning. If similar findings are seen at other trauma centers, proactive personnel and resource allocations away from trauma towards medical emergency systems may be more appropriate for future pandemics.","Walline, Joseph Harold; Hung, Kevin Kei Ching; Yeung, Janice Hiu Hung; Song, Priscilla P; Cheung, Nai-Kwong; Graham, Colin A",Am J Emerg Med,506,15

We investigate perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania during the lockdown and the state of alert (April and July 2020) using survey data. Building on measures tested in previous research, we identify the public's vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. We test whether individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations. We find an indirect relationship between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn are associated with reduced compliance with official guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences. The findings highlight potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic, especially in the young democracies of Eastern Europe.

Among all the infected countries around the globe as of now (June 15, 2020), the total reported confirmed positive cases are 7,805,148 with the death of 431,192. At present, no specialized treatments evolved to cure COVID-19. Treatment is symptomatic. Though huge effects are being made to produce potential therapies to scuffle this COVID-19, no drug has been discovered so far. OBJECTIVE: Natural products playing a significant role in disease control since ancient days. These products are serving as templates for designing new anti-microbial agents with a different mechanism of action and also open a door for investigation of effective anti-viral drugs to combat COVID-19. By focusing on this, the authors have narrated the basic structure, infection, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 virus in humans and also reported various natural products or plantbased extracts/bioactive compounds tested against coronaviruses like SARS and MERS as these viruses are structurally similar to SARS-CoV2 and can be used in designing novel drug against this virus. CONCLUSIONS: The natural products are shown activity against SARS, MERS, and other viruses reviewed in this review article might be having anti-viral activities against the SARS-CoV2 virus and can be used directly for further preclinical studies. It is, therefore, all efforts whatever available should be assembled to overcome this austere problem and save many people's lives all over the world.","Pamuru, Ramachandra Reddy; Ponneri, Naveen; Damu, Amooru G; Vadde, Ramakrishna",Curr. pharm. des,506,20

During the first spread, most governments have implemented quarantine and strict social distancing procedures. Similar measures during recent pandemics resulted in an increase in post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. The development of novel interventions to mitigate the mental health burden are of utmost importance. OBJECTIVE: In this rapid review, we aimed to provide a systematic overview of the literature with regard to associations between physical activity (PA) and depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA SOURCE: We searched major databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and preprint servers (MedRxiv, SportRxiv, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar), for relevant papers up to 25/07/2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included observational studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. To qualify for inclusion in the review, studies must have tested the association of PA with depression or anxiety, using linear or logistic regressions. Depression and anxiety must have been assessed using validated rating scales. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Effect sizes were represented by fully adjusted standardized betas and odds ratios (OR) alongside 95% confidence intervals (CI). In case standardized effects could not be obtained, unstandardized effects were presented and indicated. RESULTS: We identified a total of 21 observational studies (4 longitudinal, 1 cross-sectional with retrospective analysis, and 16 cross-sectional), including information of 42,293 (age 6-70 years, median female = 68%) participants from five continents. The early evidence suggests that people who performed PA on a regular basis with higher volume and frequency and kept the PA routines stable, showed less symptoms of depression and anxiety. For instance, those reporting a higher total time spent in moderate to vigorous PA had 12-32% lower chances of presenting depressive symptoms and 15-34% of presenting anxiety. CONCLUSION: Performing PA during Covid-19 is associated with less depression and anxiety. To maintain PA routines during Covid-19, specific volitional and motivational skills might be paramount to overcome Covid-19 specific barriers. Particularly, web-based technologies could be an accessible way to increase motivation and volition for PA and maintain daily PA routines.","Wolf, Sebastian; Seiffer, Britta; Zeibig, Johanna-Marie; Welkerling, Jana; Brokmeier, Luisa; Atrott, Beatrice; Ehring, Thomas; Schuch, Felipe Barreto",Sports Med,506,8

Most COVID-19 infections are associated with lower respiratory abnormalities but it has been increasingly associated with extra-pulmonary manifestations. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rarely diagnosed but severe disease associated with COVID-19 infection. We describe the diagnostic process behind diagnosing GBS in an elderly male who developed acute-onset quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a military ICU. A 69-year-old male was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was subsequently intubated and treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir with improvement. On hospital day 32, the patient was extubated. Three days later, he developed acute, symmetric limb quadriparesis and respiratory muscle failure requiring reintubation. Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed a cytoalbuminologic dissociation, and electromyography/nerve conduction study showed slowed nerve conduction velocity. These findings are consistent with GBS. Blood cultures, serum polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical symptoms were not suggestive of other common pathogens causing his GBS. The patient's acute GBS in the setting of recent severe COVID-19 infection strongly suggests association between the two entities, as supported by a growing body of case literature. The patient was subjected to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and was discharged with greatly improved strength in the upper and lower extremities. Our goal in describing this case is to highlight the need for providers to consider, accurately diagnose, and treat GBS as a consequence of severe COVID-19 infection.","Yiu, Alvin C; Hussain, Ali; Okonkwo, Uzoagu A; Villacorta-Lyew, Rachel; McMahon, Michael J; Blattner, Matthew",Mil. med,506,1

The number of deaths is increasing with variable distribution in the world. Despite its increasing fatality, the clinical characteristics of the deceased patients are not yet fully known. Analyzing the clinical characteristics of deceased patients will help to improve the outcome of infected patients. Hence, this study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of patients who died due to COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Methods: Hospital based multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted using chart review of deceased patients. Since the number of COVID-19 related deaths was limited, all consecutive COVID-19 related hospital deaths were analyzed. The data was entered into and analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Descriptive statistics was used to explain the data collected from the survey. Result: A total of 92 deceased patient charts were analyzed. Of these patients, 65(71%) were males. Age ranged from 17 to 92 years (mean age being 59 years). On arrival vital signs, 60.5% of them had hypoxia, 49% had tachycardia and only 32% of patients had fever. Three fourth of the patients 64/85 had at least one comorbidity. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was the commonest comorbidity accounting for 445.9%, followed by hypertension, 23/85(27%), and HIV/ AIDS, 15/85 (17.5%). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that COVID-19 deceased patients presented with respiratory failure and hypoxia. However, less than a third of these patients had fever. In addition, the presence of comorbid illnesses and non-COVID-19 diseases like AIDS defining illness in significant amount needs further study to identify their level of contribution to the increasing burden of COVID-19 deaths in Ethiopia.","Sultan, Menbeu; Kene, Desalegn; Waganew, Woldesenbet; Worku, Aschalew; Azazh, Aklilu; Girma, Beza; Seman, Yakob; Tessema, Natinael; Yifru, Sisay; Teklu, Sisay; Argaw, Rahel; Tefera, Muluwork; Walelegn, Miraf; Redae, Berhane",Ethiop J Health Sci,506,16

We assessed these risks in patients with MS (PwMS). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the overall risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severe disease course, and potential population-level predictors of COVID-19 infection in PwMS, and to provide a context using a cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, the association of different MS DMTs with the incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 was evaluated. Safety data from the Biogen Global Safety Database are also presented on reported cases of COVID-19 in patients treated with Biogen MS therapies. METHODS: The IBM® Explorys electronic health record database of > 72,000,000 patients from US healthcare networks identified patients with MS or SLE, with and without polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 cumulative incidence, hospitalization, and deaths among DMT classes were compared using logistic regression (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and race/ethnicity). As a secondary data source to assess safety data, COVID-19 reports for Biogen MS therapies were extracted and described from Biogen's Global Safety Database. RESULTS: 30,478 PwMS with an open DMT prescription were identified within Explorys; 344 were COVID-19 positive. The most significant risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were comorbidity score &#8805; 1, body mass index &#8805; 30, and Black/African ancestry. Similar risk factors were also identified for patients with SLE. Patients with MS were less likely to develop COVID-19 when treated with interferons (0.61%) and glatiramer acetate (0.51%), vs all other MS DMTs (both p < 0.001); anti-CD20 therapy was associated with the highest risk (3.45%; p < 0.0001). In the Biogen Global Safety Database, we identified 1217 patients who were COVID-19 positive treated with intramuscular interferon beta-1a, peginterferon beta-1a, natalizumab, dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, or fampridine. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, obesity, and Black/African ancestry, but not age, were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PwMS. Interferons and glatiramer acetate were associated with a reduced COVID-19 risk, whereas anti-CD20 therapies were associated with an increased risk, within the treated MS cohort. COVID-19 safety reports for patients receiving Biogen MS therapies were consistent with the Explorys database and MS literature, illustrating the replicability and power of this approach.","Reder, Anthony T; Centonze, Diego; Naylor, Maria L; Nagpal, Anjali; Rajbhandari, Rajani; Altincatal, Arman; Kim, Michelle; Berdofe, Aaron; Radhakrishnan, Maha; Jung, Eunice; Sandrock, Alfred W; Smirnakis, Karen; Popescu, Catrinel; de Moor, Carl",CNS Drugs,506,16

Community-wide genetic diversity of Metarhizium species among 480 soil isolates from 14 states of western USA was investigated to assess the contributions of clonality and recombination in determining each species' population structure. Seven species, varying >100-fold in relative abundance, were identified by phylogenetic analysis of 5' EF1-&#945; (5TEF), including M. robertsii (n=372), M. guizhouense (n=37), M. brunneum (n=37), M. lepidiotae (n=14), M. pemphigi (n=11), M. anisopliae (n=7) and M. pingshaense (n=2). Analyses of composite multilocus genotypes integrating 5TEF sequences, multilocus microsatellites and mating type idiomorphs conducted on a subset of 239 isolates revealed that all species populations display pronounced clonal structure. Following clone-correction procedures to remove redundant clonal genotypes and collapse clonal lineages, each species' population sample was determined to be composed of a dozen or fewer genetically unique individuals. Thus, the Metarhizium community inhabiting western USA is conservatively estimated to comprise as few as 34 distinct genetic individuals, with a single, geographically ubiquitous clonal lineage of M. robertsii constituting 45% of total isolates. M. robertsii was the only population determined to be in linkage equilibrium. However, the high proportion of private alleles differentiating most M. robertsii clonal lineages argues against contemporary panmixia, thus the recombination signal detected may be historical. Nevertheless, within M. robertsii, M. brunneum and M. guizhouense there are closely related genotypes of opposite mating type, which suggests that if recombination is contemporary, it likely occurs between closely related individuals. The restricted number of genetic individuals observed throughout western North American Metarhizium species may signify these represent peripheral populations descended from limited numbers of founders among whom there has been little recombination relative to the extent of clone expansion and within-clone genetic divergence.","Rehner, Stephen A",J Invertebr Pathol,506,20

METHODS: Observational population-based study with longitudinal follow-up in patients with COPD identified in a primary care electronic medical records database in Catalonia, covering 80% of the general population. The aims were to characterize COPD patients who initiated TT and to describe treatment pathways before and after TT initiation. Time to and probability of step down or complete discontinuation of TT was described using restricted mean survival time and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: A total of 34,018 COPD patients initiated TT during the study period. Of them, 23,867 (70.1%) were GOLD A/B. 18,453 (54.2%) were non-exacerbators, 9931 (29.2%) infrequent exacerbators, 5634 (16.5%) frequent exacerbators and 1923 (5.6%) had asthma-COPD overlap. Drugs most frequently used prior to initiation of TT were long-acting antimuscarinics (22.5%) and combination of long-acting beta2 agonists/inhaled corticosteroids (15.2%). A total of 11,666 (34.3%) stepped down and 1091 (3.2%) discontinued TT during follow-up. Step down following TT was more likely in patients with severe COPD, especially during the first year; however, discontinuation was more common among patients with mild COPD. CONCLUSION: Most patients initiating treatment with TT were non exacerbators and continued on the same treatment over time regardless severity of disease. Stepping down was more frequent in severe patients, while discontinuation was more common among mild patients. Overall, it appears that TT is extensively used in primary care for treatment of patients with COPD.","Monteagudo, Mònica; Nuñez, Alexa; Solntseva, Iryna; Dhalwani, Nafeesa; Booth, Alison; Barrecheguren, Miriam; Lambrelli, Dimitra; Miravitlles, Marc",Arch. bronconeumol.

These vaccines have been demonstrated to confer significant protection, but there have been reports of temporal decay in antibody titer. Furthermore, several variants have been identified with variable degrees of antibody resistance. These two factors suggest that a booster vaccination may be worthy of consideration. While such a booster dose has been studied as a series of three homologous vaccines in healthy individuals, to our knowledge, information on a heterologous regimen remains unreported, despite the practical benefits of such a scheme. Here, in this observational study, we investigated the serological profile of four healthy individuals who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, followed by a third booster dose with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. We found that while all individuals had spike-binding antibodies at each of the timepoints tested, there was an appreciable drop in titer by four months following the second vaccination. The third vaccine dose robustly increased titers beyond that of two vaccinations, and these elicited antibodies had neutralizing capability against all SARS-CoV-2 strains tested in both a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudovirus assay and an authentic SARS-CoV-2 assay, except for one individual against B.1.351 in the latter assay. Thus, a third COVID-19 vaccine dose in healthy individuals promoted not just neutralizing antibody potency, but also induced breadth against dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants. SignificanceCOVID-19 vaccines confer protection from symptomatic disease, but the elicited antibody titer has been found to decrease with time. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 variants with relative resistance against antibody neutralization have been identified. To overcome such issues, a third vaccine dose applied as a booster vaccine may be necessary. We studied four healthy individuals who received a heterologous booster dose as a third vaccine. All of these individuals had heightened neutralizing antibody titer following the booster vaccination, and could neutralize nearly all variants tested. Thus, a heterologous third COVID-19 vaccine dose may be a mechanism to both heighten and broaden antibody titers, and could be an additional strategy for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Iketani, Sho; Liu, Lihong; Nair, Manoj S; Mohri, Hiroshi; Wang, Maple; Huang, Yaoxing; Ho, David D",,506,10

A statistical method was applied to the data from 20 February 2021 through 23 February 2021 to minimize bias in the crude CFR, accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death. The resulting overall delay-adjusted CFR was 1.97% (95% credible interval: 1.94-2.00%). The delay-adjusted CFR was highest among adults aged &#8805;80 years and 70-79 years (22.88% and 7.09%, respectively).

One such avenue is accurate predictions about the remaining useful life (RUL) of components used in oil and gas plants. A tribosystem is comprised of the surfaces in relative motion and the lubricant between them. Lubricant oils play a significant role in keeping any tribosystem such as bearings and gears working smoothly over the lifetime of the oil and gas plant. The lubricant oil needs replenishment from time to time to avoid component breakdown due to the increased presence of wear debris and friction between the sliding surfaces of bearings and gears. Traditionally, this oil change is carried out at pre-determined times. This paper explored the possibilities of employing machine learning to predict early failure behavior in sensor-instrumented tribosystems. Specifically, deep learning and tribological data obtained from sensors deployed on the components can provide more accurate predictions about the RUL of the tribosystem. This automated maintenance can improve the overall efficiency of the component. The present study aimed to develop a deep learning-based digital twin for accurately predicting the RUL of a tribosystem comprised of a ball bearing-like test apparatus, a four-ball tester, and lubricant oil. A commercial lubricant used in the offshore oil and gas components was tested for its extreme pressure performance, and its welding load was measured using a four-ball tester. Three accelerated deterioration tests was carried out on the four-ball tester at a load below the welding load. Based on the wear scar measurements obtained from the experimental tests, the RUL data were used to train a multivariate convolutional neural network (CNN). The training accuracy of the model was above 99%, and the testing accuracy was above 95%. This work involved the model-free learning prediction of the remaining useful lifetime of ball bearing-type contacts as a function of key sensor input data (i.e., load, friction, temperature). This model can be deployed for in-field tribological machine elements to trigger automated maintenance without explicitly measuring the wear phenomenon. © 2021 by the authors.

Observed differences in the peakedness of epidemics are consistent with a meta-population model of COVID-19 that explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies. We paired our estimates with globally comprehensive data on human mobility and predict that crowded cities worldwide could experience more prolonged epidemics.","Rader, Benjamin; Scarpino, Samuel V; Nande, Anjalika; Hill, Alison L; Adlam, Ben; Reiner, Robert C; Pigott, David M; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Zarebski, Alexander E; Shrestha, Munik; Brownstein, John S; Castro, Marcia C; Dye, Christopher; Tian, Huaiyu; Pybus, Oliver G; Kraemer, Moritz U G",Nat Med,506,16

Globally, the cumulative number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases is increasing daily. Thus the potential for ocular transmission and manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 requires more investigation. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases for ocular transmission and manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Pooled cross-sectional studies were used for conducting a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the respiratory system and ocular manifestations (associated symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive tears using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was found to be 7.5%. However, the highest prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 was 32%. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can evidently infect the eye, as revealed in the conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The available data reflect the influence of the ocular structure on SARS-CoV-2. The analysis showed that ocular manifestation is an indication for SARS-CoV-2, particularly conjunctivitis. Moreover, there is no evidence that the ocular structure can be an additional path of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, however, it warrants further investigation.","Almazroa, Ahmed; Alamri, Suhailah; Alabdulkader, Balsam; Alkozi, Hanan; Khan, Altaf; Alghamdi, Walead",International health (Online),506,16

The aim of this registry-based observational study was to report the characteristics and clinical outcomes of liver transplant (LT) recipients included in the French nationwide Registry of Solid Organ Transplant Recipients with Covid-19. METHODS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in patients who had a positive PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 or in presence of typical lung lesions on imaging or specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, management of immunosuppression, treatment for Covid-19, and clinical outcomes (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death) were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 67 were admitted to hospital and 37 were managed at home (including all 13 children). Hospitalized patients had a median age of 65.2 years (IQR: 58.1â¯-â¯73.2 years) and two thirds were men. Most common comorbidities included overweight (67.3%), hypertension (61.2%), diabetes (50.7%), cardiovascular disease (20.9%) and respiratory disease (16.4%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified after a median of 92.8 months (IQR: 40.1â¯-â¯194.7 months) from LT. During hospitalization, antimetabolites, mTOR inhibitor, and CNIs were withdrawn in 41.9%, 30.0% and 12.5% of patients, respectively. The composite endpoint of severe Covid-19 within 30 days after diagnosis was reached by 33.0% of the adult patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 20.0%, and 28.1% for hospitalized patients. Multivariate analysis identified that age was independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: In our large nationwide study, Covid-19 in LT recipients was associated with a high mortality rate.","Dumortier, Jérôme; Duvoux, Christophe; Roux, Olivier; Altieri, Mario; Barraud, Hélène; Besch, Camille; Caillard, Sophie; Coilly, Audrey; Conti, Filomena; Dharancy, Sébastien; Durand, François; Francoz, Claire; Garaix, Florentine; Houssel-Debry, Pauline; Kounis, Ilias; Lassailly, Guillaume; Laverdure, Noémie; Leroy, Vincent; Mallet, Maxime; Mazzola, Alessandra; Meunier, Lucy; Radenne, Sylvie; Richardet, Jean-Philippe; Vanlemmens, Claire; Hazzan, Marc; Saliba, Faouzi",Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol,506,1

OBJECTIVE: We compared daily large-scale RT-PCR test results to monitor recent reports of anosmia through a web-based app to assess the dynamics of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions among individuals with COVID-19 in France. METHODS: Between March 21 and November 18, 2020, users of the maladiecoronavirus.fr self-triage app were asked questions about COVID-19 symptoms. Data on daily hospitalizations, large-scale positive results on RT-PCR tests, emergency department visits, and ICU admission of individuals with COVID-19 were compared to data on daily reports of anosmia on the app. RESULTS: As of November 18, 2020, recent anosmia was reported 575,214 times from among approximately 13,000,000 responses. Daily anosmia reports during peak engagement with the app on September 16, 2020, were spatially correlated with the peak in daily COVID-19-related hospitalizations in November 2020 (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [&#961;]=0.77; P<.001). This peak in daily anosmia reports was observed primarily among young adults (age range 18-40 years), being observed 49 days before the peak of hospitalizations that corresponded to the first wave of infections among the young population, followed by a peak in hospitalizations among older individuals (aged &#8805;50 years) in November 2020. The reduction in the daily reports of anosmia associated with the peaks in the number of cases preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by 10 and 9 days during the first and the second waves of infection, respectively, although the reduction in the positivity rates on RT-PCR tests preceded the reduction in daily hospitalizations by only 2 days during the second wave of infections. CONCLUSIONS: Data on daily reports of anosmia collected through a nationwide, web-based self-assessment app can be a relevant tool to anticipate surges in outbreaks, hospitalizations, and ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The current testing relies on reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), which is routinely performed in well-equipped laboratories by trained professionals at specific locations. However, during busy periods, high numbers of samples queued for testing can delay the test results, impacting efforts to reduce the infection risk. Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we report a novel bat-origin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans. METHODS: We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Hubei province, China. Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed. RESULTS: Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown ß-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor. CONCLUSION: A novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.","Ren, Li-Li; Wang, Ye-Ming; Wu, Zhi-Qiang; Xiang, Zi-Chun; Guo, Li; Xu, Teng; Jiang, Yong-Zhong; Xiong, Yan; Li, Yong-Jun; Li, Xing-Wang; Li, Hui; Fan, Guo-Hui; Gu, Xiao-Ying; Xiao, Yan; Gao, Hong; Xu, Jiu-Yang; Yang, Fan; Wang, Xin-Ming; Wu, Chao; Chen, Lan; Liu, Yi-Wei; Liu, Bo; Yang, Jian; Wang, Xiao-Rui; Dong, Jie; Li, Li; Huang, Chao-Lin; Zhao, Jian-Ping; Hu, Yi; Cheng, Zhen-Shun; Liu, Lin-Lin; Qian, Zhao-Hui; Qin, Chuan; Jin, Qi; Cao, Bin; Wang, Jian-Wei",Chin Med J (Engl),506,21

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has re-emphasised the need to avoid vitamin D deficiency to help maintain immune function(2) and the urgent need for food-based strategies to help address this(3). The aims of the current study were to 1) determine any changes to vitamin D intake and status over a 9-year period, and 2) apply dietary modelling to predict the impact of vitamin D bio-enrichment of pork and pork products on population intakes in the UK. Data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) Rolling Programme Year 1-9 (2008/09-2016/17) were analysed using SPSS to determine nationally representative mean vitamin D intakes and 25(OH)D concentrations [a robust biomarker of vitamin D status]. Subgroup analysis investigating variance in sex, age and season was conducted. Informed by previous studies(4), four theoretical dietary modelling scenarios of vitamin D pork bio-enrichment were analysed (vitamin D content + 50/100/150/200% vs standard). Vitamin D intake in the UK population has not changed significantly from 2008 to 2017 yet, over the same period significant gender difference (M 2.66 ± 1.99μg/d and F 2.30 ± 1.66μg/d, p &lt; 0.05) and seasonal variation in the mean 25(OH)D concentrations were evident. In 2016/17, across all age groups, 13.2% were considered insufficient (25(OH)D &lt;25nmol/L). Across the whole group, theoretical modelling demonstrated an increase of 4.9, 10.1, 15.0 and 19.8% in daily vitamin D intake when vitamin D concentrations in bio-enriched pork were elevated by 50, 100, 150 and 200%, respectively. Based on the 200% modelling scenario, a greater relative change was observed in males (22.6%) compared to females (17.8%), and although older adults (65+ years) had significantly greater vitamin D intakes compared to other age categories (3.28 ± 2.27μg/day), this age group observed the smallest relative increase from the dietary modelling scenarios (14.3%). The greatest relative change was observed amongst 11-18-year olds, where 200% vitamin D bio- enrichment of pork and pork products would result in a 25.2% increase in mean daily vitamin D intakes. Vitamin D intakes have remained stable in the UK across almost a decade, and current results confirm that strategies are required to help the population achieve the RNI for vitamin D. These findings align with Irish data and provides incentive to pursue bio-enrichment practices. Specifically, bio-enrichment of pork meat provides a proof of concept, demonstrating that animal-based strategies may offer an important contribution to help to improve the vitamin D intakes of the UK population, particularly adolescents.","Neill, H.

Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously and remotely, outside of hospital facilities, recognising early clinical deterioration. We aim to determine the feasibility & acceptability of remote monitoring systems for quarantined individuals in a hotel suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: A pilot, proof-of-concept, feasibility trial was conducted in engineered hotels near London airports (May-June 2020). Individuals arriving to London with mild suspected COVID-19 symptoms requiring quarantine, as recommended by Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with COVID-19 symptoms unable to isolate at home were eligible. The SensiumVitals&#8482; patch, measuring temperature, heart & respiratory rates, was applied on arrival for the duration of their stay. Alerts were generated when pre-established thresholds were breeched; trained nursing staff could consequently intervene. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals (M = 7, F = 7) were recruited; the mean age was 34.9 (SD 11) years. Mean length of stay was 3 (SD 1.8) days. In total, 10 vital alerts were generated across 4 participants, resulting in telephone contact, reassurance, or adjustment of the sensor. No individuals required hospitalisation or virtual general practitioner review. DISCUSSION: This proof-of-concept trial demonstrated the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Benefits included reduced viral exposure to healthcare staff, with recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring systems can be applied to hotels to deliver healthcare safely in individuals suspected of COVID-19. Further work is required to evaluate this model on a larger scale.

The impact that the current pandemic has had on the food industry points to the need for a proactive rather than reactive approach towards preventing future AV outbreaks. Such a proactive approach should be based on empirical assessments of current AV food safety practices and the development of more robust practices tailored to the culture and needs of the food industry. Moreover, a proactive approach is necessary in order to better prepare the food industry for future AV outbreaks, protect the health of workers, reduce disparities in AV occupational health risks, and enhance the safety of the food supply chain. The aim of this review is to make the case for a new food safety research paradigm that incorporates the intensive study of airborne viruses under conditions that simulate food industry work environments.","Zimmerman, Tahl; Siddiqui, Shahida Anusha; Bischoff, Werner; Ibrahim, Salam A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),506,16

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an association therapy of hydroxychloroquine (HY) plus ritonavir/darunavir (RD) or azithromycin (AZ) on QTc intervals. METHODS: At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic patients admitted to our hospital were treated with the empiric association of HY/RD; one week later the therapeutic protocol was modified with the combination of HY/AZ. Patients underwent an ECG at baseline, then 3 and 7 days after starting therapy. We prospectively enrolled 113 patients (61 in the HY/RD group-52 in the HY/AZ group). RESULTS: A significant increase in median QTc was reported after seven days of therapy in both groups: from 438 to 452 ms in HY/RD patients; from 433 to 440 ms in HY/AZ patients (p = 0.001 for both). 23 patients (21.2%) had a QTc > 500 ms at 7 days. The risk of developing a QTc > 500 ms was greater in patients with prolonged baseline QTc values (&#8805; 440 ms for female and &#8805; 460 ms for male patients) (OR 7.10 (95% IC 1.88-26.81); p = 0.004) and in patients with an increase in the QTc > 40 ms 3 days after onset of treatment (OR 30.15 (95% IC 6.96-130.55); p = 0.001). One patient per group suffered a malignant ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine with both ritonavir/darunavir or azithromycin therapy significantly increased the QTc-interval at 7 days. The risk of developing malignant arrhythmias remained relatively low when these drugs were administered for a limited period of time.","Moschini, Luigi; Loffi, Marco; Regazzoni, Valentina; Di Tano, Giuseppe; Gherbesi, Elisa; Danzi, Gian Battista",Heart vessels,506,21

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study from a tertiary care teaching hospital in eastern India. Results: Of 137 samples tested positive for respiratory viruses, 13 were due to HCoV (7 boys, median age: 2 years). Cough was the most common symptom, followed by breathing difficulty and fever. An underlying comorbid condition present in 38.4%. Co-infection with other viruses was seen in 69% of cases. Chest radiograph was abnormal in 69.3% of children. Antibiotics were administered in 53.8%. The median length of hospitalization was 5 d, irrespective of underlying disease. There was no mortality. Conclusions: HCoV is an uncommon but increasingly recognized cause of ALRI in hospitalized children. No severe illness was found in children with underlying comorbidities. This study underscores the importance of HCoV in causation of childhood ALRI, necessitating a surveillance system in India.","Das, R.

We demonstrate that antibody responses are higher in two-dose heterologous vaccination regimens than single-dose regimens. Neutralising titres after heterologous prime-boost were at least comparable or higher than the titres measured after homologous prime boost vaccination with viral vectors. Importantly, the cellular immune response after a heterologous regimen is dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1+ CD4 T cells, which is superior to the response induced in homologous vaccination regimens in mice. These results underpin the need for clinical trials to investigate the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens with alternate vaccine technologies.","Spencer, Alexandra J; McKay, Paul F; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Ulaszewska, Marta; Bissett, Cameron D; Hu, Kai; Samnuan, Karnyart; Blakney, Anna K; Wright, Daniel; Sharpe, Hannah R; Gilbride, Ciaran; Truby, Adam; Allen, Elizabeth R; Gilbert, Sarah C; Shattock, Robin J; Lambe, Teresa",Nat Commun,506,1

We aim to propose a learning novelty detection algorithm that decides whether a new curve is outside this class or not. In opposite to the majority of the literature, two sources of a curve variability are present, namely, the one inherent to curves from the proper class and observations errors'. Therefore, firstly a decision function is trained on historical data, and then, descriptors of each curve to be classified are learned from noisy observations.When the intrinsic variability is Gaussian, a decision threshold can be established from T 2 Hotelling distribution and tuned to more general cases. Expansion coefficients in a selected orthogonal series are taken as descriptors and an algorithm for their learning is proposed that follows nonparametric curve fitting approaches. Its fast version is derived for descriptors that are based on the cosine series. Additionally, the asymptotic normality of learned descriptors and the bound for the probability of their large deviations are proved. The influence of this bound on the decision threshold is also discussed.The proposed approach covers curves described as functional data projected onto a finite-dimensional subspace of a Hilbert space as well a shape sensitive description of curves, known as square-root velocity (SRV). It was tested both on synthetic data and on real-life observations of the COVID-19 growth curves. © 2021 Wojciech Rafajłowicz, published by Sciendo 2021.","Rafajłowicz, W.",Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing Research,506,33

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data obtained from the review of medical charts of all consecutive patients treated with CERAB technique for AIOD between January 2016 and December 2019 in San Giovanni-Addolorata Hospital (Rome, Italy). Clinical examination, duplex ultrasound with ankle-brachial index measurement and contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography were performed preoperatively. A clinical and ultrasound follow-up was carried out at one month and then half yearly after the intervention to evaluate patients' clinical status, limb salvage, target lesion revascularization rate, primary and secondary patency rate. RESULTS: During the study period, 24 patients (14 men, 58.3%; 10 women, 41.7%; median age 59 years, range 37-79 years) underwent CERAB for AIOD (TASC II C 29.2%, TASC II D 70.8%). Indications for treatment were: intermittent claudication in 18 patients (75%) and critical limb ischemia in 6 (25%). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Perioperative minor complications occurred in three cases (12.5%). One patient reported an intraoperative iliac rupture requiring adjunctive covered stenting. Median hospital length of stay was two days (range 1-9). No patient died perioperatively nor at the last follow-up. At a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-48 months), mean ankle-brachial index increased significantly (from 0.62 ± 0.15 before the procedure to 0.84 ± 0.18) (P < 0.001) and target lesion revascularization rate was 12.5%. At two years, the limb salvage rate was 100%, and primary and secondary patency rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CERAB technique demonstrated to be effective at the mid-term follow-up with low rate of complications and short length of stay. Long-term results and more robust data are needed to affirm this technique as the first-line treatment for extensive AIOD. However, it could become the preferred option especially in fragile patients and during contemporary COVID-19 pandemic due to the current limitations in vascular and critical care bed capacity.","Borghese, Ottavia; Ferrer, Ciro; Coscarella, Carlo; Spataro, Claudio; Diotallevi, Nicolò; Giudice, Rocco",Vascular,506,12

Upon stimulation, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) act as sensors to activate innate immune responses, containing NF-&#954;B signaling, IFN response, and inflammasome activation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and other nucleic acid sensors are involved in innate immune responses. The activation of innate immune responses can facilitate the host to eliminate pathogens and maintain tissue homeostasis. However, the activity of innate immune responses needs to be tightly controlled to ensure the optimal intensity and duration of activation under various contexts. Uncontrolled innate immune responses can lead to various disorders associated with aberrant inflammatory response, including pulmonary diseases such as COPD, asthma, and COVID-19. In this chapter, we will have a broad overview of how innate immune responses function and the regulation and activation of innate immune response at molecular levels as well as their contribution to various pulmonary diseases. A better understanding of such association between innate immune responses and pulmonary diseases may provide potential therapeutic strategies.","Liu, Tao; Liu, Siqi; Zhou, Xiaobo",Adv Exp Med Biol,506,16

A consensus meeting was held with leading eye-care experts on 2nd May 2020 to prepare a roadmap for PEC in the days to come. Guidelines are needed for PEC activities like vision testing, refraction, optical dispensing, counseling, etc., Some of the activities at vision centers (VCs) may be postponed or modified in light of the current pandemic situation. PEC workers need to strictly follow social distancing norms (minimum 3 feet) for minimizing risk of exposure and need access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), like gloves, masks and shields while examining beneficiaries. For optometrists, sterilization of instruments and encouraging the people to remain silent during the examination is recommended. Because conjunctivitis may be an early sign which can present at VCs, extra precautions in the form of PPE has to be ensured while examining such patients. This is also an opportunity to start running telemedicine clinics for all emergent cases that cannot be managed at the primary level. The guidelines also need to be updated based on the context of the working environment and changes in government directives from time to time.","Vashist, Praveen; Senjam, Suraj S; Gupta, Vivek; Manna, Souvik; Agrawal, Surbhi; Gupta, Noopur; Sharma, Namrata; Sinha, Rajesh; Saxena, Rohit; Sachdev, Mahipal S",Indian J Ophthalmol,506,22

Here we develop a fractal model capable of describe this dynamics, in term of daily new cases, and provide quantitative criteria for some predictions. We propose a fractal dynamical model using conformed derivative and fractal time scale. A Burr-XII shaped solution of the fractal-like equation is obtained. The model is tested using data from several countries, showing that a single function is able to describe very different shapes of the outbreak. The diverse behavior of the outbreak on those countries is presented and discussed. Moreover, a criterion to determine the existence of the pandemic peak and a expression to find the time to reach herd immunity are also obtained.","Sotolongo-Costa, Oscar; Weberszpil, Jos'e; Sotolongo-Grau, Oscar",,506,24

In his influential book published in 1971, Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children, Wender3 reviewed historical accounts of the 1918 pandemic and suggested that viral infection had selective brain effects on catecholamine nuclei, and behavioral sequelae in some children emerged and overlapped with symptoms that now define attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavioral sequelae emerged in some adults that overlapped with symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Based on this and several excitotoxic models of behavioral disorders (ie, Volpe, Altman, Amsel, Benveniste, and Lou) related to arterial architecture and patterns of blood flow to the brain, previously our group4 proposed etiologic subtypes of ADHD based on a dopamine-deficit hypothesis and assumption that dopamine neurons might be particularly sensitive to a variety of environmental insults. We speculate that residual effects of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may selectively affect brain regions underlying attention and motivation deficits associated with ADHD, as documented by positron emission tomography imaging studies of adults (see Volkow et al.5), which could increase risk for an infection-triggered etiologic subtype of ADHD.","Swanson, James M; Volkow, Nora D",J.

There is still no specific medicine for COVID-19, which leaves a critical gap for the identification of new drug candidates for the disease. Recent studies have reported that the small-molecule enoxacin exerts an antiviral activity by enhancing the RNAi pathway. The aim of this study is to analyze if enoxacin can exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. We exploit multiple computational tools and databases to examine (i) whether the RNAi mechanism, as the target pathway of enoxacin, could act on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and (ii) microRNAs induced by enoxacin might directly silence viral components as well as the host cell proteins mediating the viral entry and replication. We find that the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 might be a suitable substrate for DICER activity. We also highlight several enoxacin-enhanced microRNAs which could target SARS-CoV-2 components, pro-inflammatory cytokines, host cell components facilitating viral replication, and transcription factors enriched in lung stem cells, thereby promoting their differentiation and lung regeneration. Finally, our analyses identify several enoxacin-targeted regulatory modules that were critically associated with exacerbation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our analysis suggests that enoxacin could be a promising candidate for COVID-19 treatment through enhancing the RNAi pathway.","Ahmadi, Amirhossein; Moradi, Sharif",Sci Rep,506,16

Electronic learning (e-learning) became the core method of teaching the curriculum during the pandemic. After 8 weeks of only online learning, a survey was conducted to investigate perception of this type of learning among medical students.A survey was conducted by distributing an online questionnaire to Polish medical students. Data gathered from the survey were analyzed with routine statistical software.Eight hundred four students answered the questionnaire. According to respondents' answers, the main advantages of online learning were the ability to stay at home (69%), continuous access to online materials (69%), learning at your own pace (64%), and comfortable surroundings (54%). The majority of respondents chose lack of interactions with patients (70%) and technical problems with IT equipment (54%) as the main disadvantages. There was no statistical difference between face-to-face and online learning in terms of opinions on the ability of the learning method to increase knowledge (Pâ=â.46). E-learning was considered less effective than face-to-face learning in terms of increasing skills (Pâ<â.001) and social competences (Pâ<â.001). Students assessed that they were less active during online classes compared to traditional classes (Pâ<â.001). E-learning was rated as enjoyable by 73% of respondents.E-learning is a powerful tool for teaching medical students. However, successful implementation of online learning into the curriculum requires a well thought-out strategy and a more active approach.","Baczek, Michal; Zaganczyk-Baczek, Michalina; Szpringer, Monika; Jaroszynski, Andrzej; Wozakowska-Kaplon, Beata",Medicine (Baltimore),506,22

All steps of electrode modifications were characterized using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic methods. GF-CTP-ATP-Au electrode was then modified with a capture DNA probe (C-ssDNA) and optimized with a target DNA probe in terms of hybridization time and temperature between 30 and 180 min and 20-50 °C, respectively. Finally, the analytic performance of the developed ssDNA biosensor was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The calibration of the sensor was obtained between 0.1 pM and 10 nM analyte working range. The limit of detection was calculated using signal to noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) as 13 fM. Moreover, interference results for two noncomplementary DNA probes were also tested to demonstrate non-specific ssDNA interactions. An electrochemical label-free DNA impedimetric sensor was successfully developed using a novel GF-CTP-ATP-Au electrode.

We provide a biochemical hypothesis for the connection between low COVID-19 incidence, mortality rates, and high visceral adiposity in Southeast Asian populations. The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a gateway into the human body. Although the highest expression levels of ACE2 are found in people's visceral adipose tissue in Southeast Asia, this does not necessarily make them vulnerable to COVID-19. Hypothetically, high levels of visceral adiposity cause systemic inflammation, thus decreasing the ACE2 amount on the surface of both visceral adipocytes and alveolar epithelial type 2 cells in the lungs. Extra weight gained during the pandemic is expected to increase visceral adipose tissue in Southeast Asians, further decreasing the ACE2 pool. In contrast, weight gain can increase local inflammation in fat depots in Western people, leading to worse COVID-related outcomes. Because of the biological mechanisms associated with fat accumulation, inflammation, and their differential expression in Southeast Asian and Western populations, the second wave of the pandemic may be more severe in Western countries, while Southeast Asians may benefit from their higher visceral fat depots.","Krams, Indrikis A; Jõers, Priit; Luoto, Severi; Trakimas, Giedrius; Lietuvietis, Vilnis; Krams, Ronalds; Kaminska, Irena; Rantala, Markus J; Krama, Tatjana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),506,16

This study evaluated olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in mild COVID-19 patients using validated assessment methods. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted for mild COVID-19 patients who were isolated at the Gyeonggi International Living and Treatment Support Center (LTSC), Korea. Olfactory function was assessed using the Korean version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT). Gustatory function was assessed using an 11-point Likert scale and 6-n-propylthiouracil, phenylthiocarbamide, and control strips. All patients underwent nasal and oral cavity endoscopic examination. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients at the LTSC, 15 patients (24.2%) complained of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction on admission. Four of 10 patients who underwent functional evaluation did not have general symptoms and 2 were asymptomatic. The mean short version of QOD-negative statements and QOD-visual analogue scale scores were 13 ± 6 and 4.7 ± 3.6, respectively. The mean CC-SIT score was 8 ± 2. No patients showed anatomical abnormalities associated with olfactory dysfunction on endoscopic examination. The mean Likert scale score for function was 8 ± 2, and there were no abnormal lesions in the oral cavity of any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was 24.2% in mild COVID-19 patients. All patients had hyposmia due to sensorineural olfactory dysfunction, which was confirmed using validated olfactory and gustatory evaluation methods and endoscopic examination. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may be characteristic indicators of mild COVID-19.","Seo, Min Young; Seok, Hyeri; Hwang, Sun Jin; Choi, Hee Kyoung; Jeon, Ji Hoon; Sohn, Jang Wook; Park, Dae Won; Lee, Seung Hoon; Choi, Won Suk",J Korean Med Sci,506,1

METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study using national Veterans Affairs data. Among non-deceased individuals on January 1, 2020 who received VA care in 2019, we matched RA to non-RA patients (1:1) on age, sex, and VA site. COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 (hospitalization or death) were obtained from a national VA COVID-19 surveillance database through December 10, 2020. We used multivariable Cox models to compare the risk of COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization or death after adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, health behaviors, and county level COVID-19 incidence rates. RESULTS: RA and non-RA patients (n=33,886 each) were male predominant (84.5%) and had a mean age of 67.8 years. During follow-up, there were 1,503 COVID-19 diagnoses, 388 severe COVID-19 cases, and 228 non-COVID-19 related deaths. After multivariable adjustment, RA was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.25 [95% confidence interval 1.13, 1.39]) and COVID-19 hospitalization or death (HR 1.35 [1.10, 1.66]). DMARDs and prednisone, but not RA autoantibody seropositivity, as well as black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and several chronic conditions were associated with COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization or death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RA are at higher risk for COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization or death than non-RA. With a COVID-19 risk that approaches other recognized chronic conditions, these findings suggest RA patients should be prioritized for COVID-19 prevention and management.","England, Bryant R; Roul, Punyasha; Yang, Yangyuna; Kalil, Andre C; Michaud, Kaleb; Thiele, Geoffrey M; Sauer, Brian C; Baker, Joshua F; Mikuls, Ted R",Arthritis rheumatol.

Telemedicine enables provision of care when in-person visits are not possible. Sheba Medical Center made a rapid transition of outpatient clinics to video consultations (VC) during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel. Reported are results of a survey of patient and clinician user experience with VC. METHODS: Satisfaction surveys were sent by text messages to patients, clinicians who practice VC (users) and clinicians who do not practice VC (non-users). Questions referred to general satisfaction, ease of use, technical issues and medical and communication quality. Questions and scales were based on Sheba's clinics patient experience surveys, outpatient clinics. RESULTS: More than 1200 clinicians (physicians, psychologists, nurses, social workers, dietitians, speech therapists, genetic consultants and others) provided VC during the study period. Five hundred forty patients, 162 clinicians who were users and 50 clinicians who were non-users completed the survey. High level of satisfaction was reported by 89.8% of patients and 37.7% of clinician users. Technical problems were experienced by 21% of patients and 80% of clinician users. Almost 70% of patients but only 23.5% of clinicians found the platform very simple to use. Over 90% of patients were very satisfied with clinician's courtesy, expressed a high sense of trust, thought that clinician's explanations and recommendations were clear and estimated that the clinician understood their problems and 86.5% of them would recommend VC to family and friends.Eighty seven percent of clinician users recognize the benefit of VC for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic but only 68% supported continuation of the service after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our study reports on high levels of patient satisfaction from outpatient clinics VC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower levels of clinician satisfaction can mostly be attributed to technical and administrative challenges related to the newly implemented telemedicine platform. Our findings support the continued future use of VC as a means of providing patient centered care. Future steps need to be taken to continuously improve the clinical and administrative application of telemedicine services.","Barkai, Galia; Gadot, Moran; Amir, Hadar; Menashe, Michal; Shvimer-Rothschild, Lilach; Zimlichman, Eyal",Int. j. qual. health care,506,9

There is now an urgent need for sociologists to engage theoretically and empirically on the social impact of issues related to Covid-19. As we have moved further into 2020, governments around the world have imposed different types of restrictions on social life, in order to quell the spread of Covid-19 and ‘flatten the curve’. These have included imposing various degrees of social isolation and restrictions on things like social gatherings, travel, sport and leisure activities, and going to work/school/university. This commentary explores the ways in which different branches of social theory can shed light on the implications of Covid-19 restrictions for social life ‘as we know it’. The broad fields of social theory in the commentary cover concepts such as risk, trust, fear, uncertainty and happiness. The process of developing the social theory driven research agenda contained within this commentary took a rather unusual route – it started by re-reading Jean-Paul Sartre’s ideas on existentialism, which led to me painting a visual sociology of Covid-19 (an image of my painting is provided), and ultimately to this piece.","Ward, Paul R",J.

In this study, we examined immune cell subsets in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. In hospitalized patients, many adaptive and innate immune cells were decreased in frequency compared to healthy and convalescent individuals, with the exception of B lymphocytes which increased. Our findings show increased frequencies of T-cell activation markers (CD69, Ox40, HLA-DR and CD154) in hospitalized patients, with other T-cell activation/exhaustion markers (CD25, PD-L1 and TIGIT) remaining elevated in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals. B cells had a similar pattern of activation/exhaustion, with increased frequency of CD69 and CD95 during hospitalization, followed by an increase in PD1 frequencies in non-hospitalized individuals. Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in non-hospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T-cell activation/exhaustion in non-hospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age.

MaaS can be defined as the integration of various transport modes into a single service, accessible on demand, via a seamless digital planning and payment application. Recent studies have shown the potential reduction in the size of automobile fleets, with corresponding predicted improvements in congestion and environmental impact, that might be realized by the advent of automated vehicles as part of future MaaS systems. However, the limiting assumptions made by these studies point to the difficult challenge of predicting how the complex interactions of user demographics and mode choice, vehicle automation, and governance models will impact sustainable mobility. The work documented in this paper focused on identifying available methodologies for assessing the sustainability impact of potential MaaS implementations from a whole system (STEEP—social, technical, economic, environmental, and political) perspective. In this research, a review was conducted of current simulation tools and models, relative to their ability to support transportation planners, to assess the MaaS concept, holistically, at a city level. The results presented include: a summary of the literature review, a weighted ranking of relevant transportation simulation tools per the assessment criteria, and identification of key gaps in the current state of the art. The gaps include capturing the interaction of demographic changes, mode choice, induced demand, and land use in a single framework that can rapidly explore the impact of alternative MaaS scenarios, on sustainable mobility, for a given city region.

Especially in the context of COVID pandemic where people stays home, such systems are very relevant today. Elections can happen for different reasons, involving choosing leaders, finishing political problems, choosing a substantial government, etc. [2]. The phenomenal using of Information Technology in the process of election is quickly earning momentum. This growth in voting systems indicated to as e-voting comes with more benefits than the voting system based on paper. While there are many efforts in different parts of world regarding implementations and trials for electronic voting, there are not many researches regarding this in Asia Minor, especially Iraq. It can be noted that Iraq has several regions with difficult access and where sometime it is difficult to collect votes in the traditional way because of access reasons and post-war conditions. We want to fill this gap through the research presented in this paper. In this paper we describe an application for m-voting targeting the specific conditions of Iraq in the COVID situation. In the current society, the application of which we are talking about, can also be seen as a significant help for a numerous amount of countries during the pandemic of COVID-19. The application is based on Mobile technology. We choose mobile technology motivated by the fact that although people do not have computers, almost everyone has a mobile phone in Iraq. Moreover, the usefulness of mobiles can represent a proper way for people with disabilities to execute their legal right to vote for the future of their country.","Al-Habeeb, N. A.

Its residue is a serious problem in crop rotations. In this study, Oryza sativa L. seedlings was used as a model plant to explore its biochemical response to abiotic stress caused by QNC and nZVI coexposure, as well as the interactions between QNC and nZVI treatments. Exposure to 5 and 10 mg/L QNC reduced the fresh biomass by 26.6% and 33.9%, respectively, compared to the control. The presence of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the QNC toxicity, but the nZVI toxicity was aggravated by the coexist of QNC. Root length was enhanced upon exposure to low or medium doses of both QNC and nZVI, whereas root length was inhibited under high-dose coexposure. Both nZVI and QNC, either alone or in combination, significantly inhibited the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, and the inhibition rate increased with elevated nZVI and QNC concentration. It was indicated that nZVI or QNC can affect the plant photosynthesis, and there was a significant interaction between the two treatments. Effects of QNC on the antioxidant response of Oryza sativa L. differed in the shoots and roots; generally, the introduction of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the oxidative stress (POD in shoots, SOD and MDA in roots) induced by QNC. However, 750 mg/kg nZVI seriously damaged Oryza sativa L. seedlings, which likely resulted from active iron deficiency. QNC could be removed from the culture solution by nZVI; as a result, nZVI suppressed QNC uptake by 20%-30%.","Zhang, Ruyang; Bai, Xiaohan; Shao, Jihai; Chen, Anwei; Wu, Haiyong; Luo, Si",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,506,23

Yet the exact link between climate and COVID-19 is still not well-explored. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hot geographical region weather [like United Arab Emirates (UAE)] on COVID-19 clinical profile and outcomes. Temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, precipitation, and other weather-related variables were studied concerning COVID-19 patients outcomes and laboratory results. Methodology: A total of 434 COVID-19 positive patients admitted between January and June 2020, were recruited from Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE. Temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, and precipitation rate were retrieved from history+ for the day when COVID-19 patients presented to the hospital. These weather parameters were correlated with COVID-19 clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: Our results showed that patients needed admission in days with higher temperatures, higher solar radiation, and less humidity were associated with higher deaths. This association can be linked to the association of these weather parameters with age at diagnosis; higher C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, white cell count (WCC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and lower lymphocyte count, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin (Hb), Na, and albumin, all of which are considered poor prognostic factors for COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study highlighted the importance of weather-related variables on the dynamics of mortality and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The hot weather might makes some people, especially those with comorbidities or older ages, develop aggressive inflammation that ends up with complications and mortality.","Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen; Hachim, Ibrahim Y; Naeem, Kashif; Hannawi, Haifa; Al Salmi, Issa; Hannawi, Suad",Front Public Health,506,32

METHODS: In the current retrospective single-center study, we collected data of 311 consecutive severe patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 3rd to Feb 20th, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and medication characteristics were compared and analyzed between patients with or without probiotics. RESULTS: In total, 93 of the 123 patients (75.61%) who were treated with probiotics survived to hospital discharge with the median inpatient day of 32 days and mean virus clearance time of 23 days, which were significantly longer than those of patients without probiotics. There were no bias in laboratory parameters, except for IL-6 and ESR, which were significantly higher in patients treated probiotics. We tracked the dynamic changes of 8 selected laboratory parameters (IL-6, CRP, total T lymphocytes, NK cells, B lymphocyte, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio) and found that probiotics could not reduce the increased IL-6 levels but possessed the ability to moderate the immunity and decreased the incidence of secondary infection in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics could be an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients to reduce the secondary infection and moderated the immunity.","Li, Qiang; Cheng, Fang; Xu, Qiling; Su, Yuyong; Cai, Xuefeng; Zeng, Fang; Zhang, Yu",Int Immunopharmacol,506,16

At least 1 year may take for an approved vaccine to be in place, and meanwhile millions more could be infected, some with fatal outcome. Over thousand clinical trials with COVID-19 patients are already listed in ClinicalTrials.com, some of them for assessing the utility of therapeutics approved for other conditions. However, clinical trials take many months, and are typically done with small cohorts. A much faster and by far more efficient method for rapidly identifying approved therapeutics that can be repurposed for treating COVID-19 patients is data mining their past and current electronic health and prescription records for identifying drugs that may protect infected individuals from severe COVID-19 symptoms. Examples are discussed for applying health and prescription records for assessing the potential repurposing (repositioning) of angiotensin receptor blockers, estradiol, or antiandrogens for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and fatalities. Data mining of prescription records of COVID-19 patients will not cancel the need for conducting controlled clinical trials, but could substantially assist in trial design, drug choice, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and prioritization.

Tumor necrosis was prominent and the Ki67 proliferative index was 60%. One year after the diagnosis, the patient experienced recurrence with a left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, which was surgically removed, followed by standard cisplatin-etoposide chemotherapy. Neoplastic cells showed combined loss of expression of MLH1 and PMS2 in both primary tumor and lymph node metastasis. Microsatellite instability (MSI) test using a mononucleotide repeats pentaplex PCR (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-22, and NR-24) revealed minimal mononucleotide shifts showing deletion of less than 3 bp at NR-21, BAT-26, NR-24, and NR-22 loci. MLH1 methylation analysis revealed absence of the gene promoter methylation. BRAF and KRAS mutations were not detected.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the widely used antiparasitic drug ivermectin on outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, patients with COVID-19 admitted to 2 referral tertiary hospitals in Mazandaran, Iran, were randomly divided into 2 groups: intervention and control. In addition to standard treatment for COVID-19, the intervention group received a single weight-based dose (0.2 mg/kg) of ivermectin; the control group received the standard of care. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data from participants were recorded at baseline. Patients were assessed daily for symptoms and disease progression. The primary clinical outcome measures were the durations of hospital stay, fever, dyspnea, and cough; and overall clinical improvement. FINDINGS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled (mean [SD] ages: ivermectin, 47.63 [22.20] years; control, 45.18 [23.11] years; P = 0.65). Eighteen patients (51.4%) in the ivermectin group and 18 (52.9%) in control group were male (P = 0.90). The mean durations of dyspnea were 2.6 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group and 3.8 (0.4) days in the control group (P = 0.048). Also, persistent cough lasted for 3.1 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group compared to 4.8 (0.4) days in control group (PP = 0.019). The mean durations of hospital stay were 7.1 (0.5) days versus 8.4 (0.6) days in the ivermectin and control groups, respectively (P = 0.016). Also, the frequency of lymphopenia decreased to 14.3% in the ivermectin group and did not change in the control group (P = 0.007). IMPLICATIONS: A single dose of ivermectin was well-tolerated in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, and important clinical features of COVID-19 were improved with ivermectin use, including dyspnea, cough, and lymphopenia. Further studies with larger sample sizes, different drug dosages, dosing intervals and durations, especially in different stages of the disease, may be useful in understanding the potential clinical benefits ivermectin.

The disease was first detected in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, in December 2019 and has since spread globally, especially to Europe and North America, resulting in the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic disaster of 2019-2020. Although most cases have mild symptoms, there is some progression to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure and death. More than 4.6 million cases have been registered across 216 countries and territories as of 19 April 2020, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. Risk to communities with continued widespread disease transmission depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people;the severity of resulting illness;and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccines or medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions were the most important response strategy based on community interventions such as person-to-person distancing, mask-wearing, isolation and good personal hygiene (hand-washing)-all of which have been demonstrated can reduce the impact of this seemingly unstoppable globally spreading natural disaster. This paper presents the results of quantitative research regarding the level of citizen preparedness for disasters caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Serbia. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was requested and then collected online among 975 respondents during disaster in April 2020. The questionnaire examined citizens' basic socio-economic and demographic characteristics, their knowledge, preparedness, risk perception and preventive measures taken individually and as a community to prevent the death and widespread transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Serbia. Based on the findings that there are major differences in the public's perception of risks posed by communicable disease threats such as presented by COVID-19, emergency management agencies should use these differences to develop targeted strategies to enhance community and national preparedness by promoting behavioral change and improving risk management decision-making.","Cvetkovic, V.

In this paper, a detailed characterisation of mild-to-moderate ear, nose nd throat (ENT) symptoms is presented with the aim of recognising the disease early to help reduce further spread and progression. Methods: A total of 230 cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 134 negative controls were recruited for a case-control analysis. Symptoms were analysed using the Acute Respiratory Tract Infections Questionnaire, while other symptoms were investigated by ad hoc questions. Results: Among the study samples (n = 364), 149 were males and 215 were females with age ranging from 20 to 89 years (mean 52.3). Four main groups of symptoms were obtained: influenza-like symptoms, ENT-symptoms, breathing issues and asthenia-related symptoms, representing 72%, 69%, 64% and 53% of overall referred clinical manifestations, respectively. ENT symptoms, breathing issues and influenza-like symptoms were associated with positivity to SARS-CoV-2, whereas asthenia-related symptoms did not show a significant association with SARS-CoV-2 infection after controlling for other symptoms, comorbidities and demographic characteristics. Conclusions: ENT symptoms are equally represented with influenza-like ones as presenting symptoms of COVID-19.

We studied 37 asymptomatic individuals in the Wanzhou District who were diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections but without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 d and during hospitalization. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated Wanzhou People's Hospital for centralized isolation in accordance with policy1. The median duration of viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was 19 d (interquartile range (IQR), 15-26 d). The asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than the symptomatic group (log-rank P = 0.028). The virus-specific IgG levels in the asymptomatic group (median S/CO, 3.4; IQR, 1.6-10.7) were significantly lower (P = 0.005) relative to the symptomatic group (median S/CO, 20.5; IQR, 5.8-38.2) in the acute phase. Of asymptomatic individuals, 93.3% (28/30) and 81.1% (30/37) had reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels, respectively, during the early convalescent phase, as compared to 96.8% (30/31) and 62.2% (23/37) of symptomatic patients. Forty percent of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative and 12.9% of the symptomatic group became negative for IgG in the early convalescent phase. In addition, asymptomatic individuals exhibited lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that asymptomatic individuals had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The reduction in IgG and neutralizing antibody levels in the early convalescent phase might have implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys.","Long, Quan-Xin; Tang, Xiao-Jun; Shi, Qiu-Lin; Li, Qin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Yuan, Jun; Hu, Jie-Li; Xu, Wei; Zhang, Yong; Lv, Fa-Jin; Su, Kun; Zhang, Fan; Gong, Jiang; Wu, Bo; Liu, Xia-Mao; Li, Jin-Jing; Qiu, Jing-Fu; Chen, Juan; Huang, Ai-Long",Nat Med,506,32

This article details the theory behind this phenomenon by analyzing the stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model in the cumulative cases domain. We prove that the Markov chain associated with this model reduces, in the ICC plane, to a pure birth chain for the cumulative number of cases, whose limit leads to an independent increments Gaussian process that fluctuates about a deterministic ICC curve. We calculate the associated variance and quantify the additional variability due to estimating incidence over a finite period of time.

It is thought that endocytosis of ACE2 results in a decrease in membrane bound ACE2 expression, and disruption of the local tissue renin angiotensin system protection. In this study, we hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with shedding of ACE2 leading to increased plasma ACE2 activity. Design and method: Australians aged &gt;18 years (n=66) who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive result by PCR testing) and uninfected controls (n=70) were recruited. Serial samples were available in 23 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. Plasma ACE2 activity was measured using a fluorescent substrate-based assay and levels were compared using the Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test. Serial ACE2 activity were analysed using the Friedman test for repeated measures. Post-hoc analysis was performed with a Bonferroni correction. Two-tailed P-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. Results: Controls and SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients were matched for age (mean±SD, 54±11 vs. 53±14 years, p=0.47) and gender (53% vs. 59% male, p=0.49). There were no significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in the proportion of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or use of anti hypertensive, lipid lowering, and anti-platelet medications between the controls and SARSCoV-2 patients. Plasma ACE2 activity at median 35 days post-infection [interquartile range 30-38 days] was 97-fold higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients compared to controls (5.8 [2-11.3] vs. 0.06 [0.02-2.2] pmol/min/ml, p&lt;0.0001). Plasma ACE2 activity was significantly different across disease severity (p=0.033), with severe COVID-19 associated with higher ACE2 activity compared to mild disease (11.2 [8.3-23.2] vs. 5.4 [1.8-9.0] pmol/min/ml, p=0.027). Men recovered from SARS-CoV-2 had higher ACE2 levels compared to women (9.2 [5.8-15.3] vs. 2.1 [0.2-5.1] pmol/min/ml, p&lt;0.0001). In 23 patients who had serial blood samples at 63 [56-65] and 114 [111-125] days post infection, median ACE2 activity remained persistently elevated with no differences between time-points (p&gt;0.05). Conclusions: Plasma ACE2 activity is elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and remains elevated post-infection. Our findings indicate the need for ongoing investigation to determine if ACE2 levels identify people at risk of prolonged illness following COVID-19.","Patel, S.; Juno, J.; Lee, W.

The aims of the study were to examine the associations between all-cause mortality and PM in the pandemic period and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019). METHODS: We collected daily data regarding all-cause mortality (stratified by age and gender), and PM concentrations for 107 Italian provinces from 1 January 2015 to 31 May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. RESULTS: Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in pandemic period. Each 10 µg/m3 increase in PM was associated with much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during the pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 (increased mortality rate: 7.24% (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45% (95%CI: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10; 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10). The counts and fractions of deaths attributable to PM were higher in 2020 for PM2.5 (attributable death counts: 20,062 versus 3927 per year in 2015-2019; attributable fractions: 10.2% versus 2.4%), PM10 (15,112 versus 3999; 7.7% versus 2.5%), and PM2.5-10 (7193 versus 2303; 3.7% versus 1.4%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic increased the vulnerability and excess cases of all-cause mortality associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 in Italy, despite a decline in air pollution level.","Ye, Tingting; Xu, Rongbin; Yu, Wenhua; Chen, Zhaoyue; Guo, Yuming; Li, Shanshan",,506,25

MATERIALS AND METHODS: FokI genotyping and bacterial quantification were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Periodontitis severity was determined using mean clinical attachment level (CAL). Regression analyses examined the associations between the FokI polymorphism (rs2228570) and bacterial proportions or periodontitis severity. Effect modification by smoking or drinking was assessed. RESULTS: The study population comprised 1,460 individuals, aged 39-66 years. After multivariable adjustment, the FokI risk genotypes (CC+CT) were associated with elevated Porphyromonas gingivalis proportions (regression coefficient (ß) =0.294±0.139; p=0.034) and increased mean CAL (ß=0.130±0.048; p=0.007). The effect of the FokI polymorphism on P. gingivalis proportions was greater in smokers (ß=0.897±0.328; p=0.006) compared to non-smokers (ß=0.164±0.153; p=0.282) and in drinkers (ß=0.668±0.242; p=0.006) compared to non-drinkers (ß=0.114±0.169; p=0.500). The genotype*smoking interaction for P. gingivalis proportions was significant (p=0.043), whereas the genotype*drinking interaction was not (p=0.061). Similar results were found for the effect of the genotype*smoking/drinking interaction on mean CAL. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the interplay between the host genotype and smoking is important in determining the subgingival microbial composition and periodontitis severity.","Torrungruang, Kitti; Chantarangsu, Soranun; Sura, Thanyachai; Thienpramuk, Lalitsara",J. clin. periodontol,506,25

Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 seems to predominantly affect the respiratory system leading to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is now evident that it may also affect the cardiovascular system in multiple ways. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The current paper is a review of the most recent literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated main cardiovascular clinical manifestations. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Cardiovascular disease represents a prevalent underlying comorbidity associated with increased mortality rates among COVID-19 affected individuals. In addition, various cardiovascular manifestations have been linked to the viral insult, including among others acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis, acute heart failure, cardiac injury, arrhythmias and acute pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are required in order to establish the complicated association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effects on the cardiovascular system. Our knowledge regarding diagnostic approaches, therapeutic management and preventive measures is constantly enriched throughout an abundance of ongoing research in the respective fields.","Chatzis, Dimitrios G; Magounaki, Kalliopi T; Pantazopoulos, Ioannis N; Johnson, Elizabeth O; Tsioufis, Konstantinos P",Minerva cardioangiol,506,10

Increasingly, tall buildings (TB) are common features of the urban landscape, yet their impact on urban air flow and dispersion is not well understood, and their effects are not appropriately captured in parameterisation schemes. Here, hardware models of areas within two global mega-cities (London and Beijing) are used to analyse the impact of TB on flow and transport in isolated and cluster settings. Results show that TB generate strong updrafts and downdrafts that affect street-level flow fields. Velocity differences do not decay monotonically with distance from the TB, especially in the near-wake region where the flow is characterised by recirculating winds and jets. Lateral distance from an isolated TB centreline is crucial, and flow is still strongly impacted at longitudinal distances of several TB heights. Evaluation of a wake-flow scheme (ADMS-Build) in the isolated TB case indicates important characteristics are not captured. There is better agreement for a slender, shorter TB than a taller non-cuboidal TB. Better prediction of flow occurs horizontally further away and vertically further from the surface. TB clusters modify the shape of pollutant plumes. Strong updrafts generated by the overlapping wakes of TB clusters lift pollutants out of the canopy, causing a much deeper tracer plume in the lee of the cluster, and an elevated plume centreline with maximum concentrations around the TB mean height. Enhanced vertical spread of the pollutants in the near-wake of the cluster results in overall lower maximum concentrations, but higher concentrations above the mean TB height. These results have important implications for interpreting observations in areas with TB. Using real world ceilometer observations in two mega-cities (Beijing and Paris), we assess the diurnal seasonal variability of the urban boundary layer and evaluate a mixed layer height (MLH) empirical model with parameters derived from a third mega-city (London). The MLH model works well in central Beijing but less well in suburban Paris. The variability of the physical meteorology across different vertical scales discussed in this paper provides additional context for interpreting air quality observations.","Hertwig, Denise; Grimmond, Sue; Kotthaus, Simone; Vanderwel, Christina; Gough, Hannah; Haeffelin, Martial; Robins, Alan",Faraday Discuss,506,19

Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its k nearest neighboring cells across a range of k values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these subpopulations yields biological insights that would otherwise be undetected using conventional computational approaches.","Zhao, Jun; Jaffe, Ariel; Li, Henry; Lindenbaum, Ofir; Sefik, Esen; Jackson, Ruaidhrí; Cheng, Xiuyuan; Flavell, Richard A; Kluger, Yuval",Proc.

The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the impact of natural and man-made disasters on contraception in OECD member countries. METHODS: Manual searches and systematic searches in six electronic databases were conducted with no language restrictions. All articles were screened by at least two researchers. The data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: 108 articles were included. Most focussed on the Zika virus outbreak (n = 50) and the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 28). Four key themes were identified: importance of contraception during disasters, impact of disasters on contraceptive behaviour, barriers to contraception during disasters and ways of improving use of contraception during disasters. Despite efforts to increase access to contraception including by transforming ways of delivery, barriers to use meant that unmet need persisted. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent adverse health outcomes and reduce health costs as a result of failure to have access to contraception during disasters, there is a need to intensify efforts to remove barriers to use. This should include increasing access and information on methods of contraception and their side effects (e.g., menstrual suppression) and making contraception freely available.","Freed, Benjamin; Hillman, Sarah; Shantikumar, Saran; Bick, Debra; Dale, Jeremy; Gauly, Julia",Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,506,10

High lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations are a strong risk factor for IHD and possibly for thromboembolic events. We therefore evaluated whether SARS-CoV-2 infections modify the risk of high Lp(a) concentrations for IHD or thromboembolic events during the first 8.5 months follow-up of the pandemic. METHOD: Cohort study using data from the UK Biobank during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Baseline Lp(a) was compared between SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the population controls. UK Biobank received ethical approval from the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 11/NW/0382). All participants gave written informed consent before enrolment in the study, which was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had Lp(a) concentrations similar to the population controls. The risk for IHD increased with higher Lp(a) concentrations in both, the population controls (n = 435,104) and SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 6,937). The causality of the findings was supported by a genetic risk score for Lp(a). A SARS-CoV-2 infection modified the association with a steeper increase in risk for infected patients (interaction P-value = 0.03). Although SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had a 5-times higher frequency of thromboembolic events compared to the population controls (1.53% vs. 0.31%), the risk was not influenced by Lp(a). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infections enforce the association between high Lp(a) and IHD but the risk for thromboembolic events is not influenced by Lp(a). This article is protected by copyright.

Although numerous studies have already been published on this topic, there has not been compelling evidence critically assessing the impact of COVID-19 by and on climate change. The present study fills this gap by taking a more holistic approach to elaborate factors, e.g., natural and anthropogenic factors, ocean submesoscales, radiative forces, and greenhouse gas/CO2 emissions, that may affect climate change in a more prevalent and pronounced manner. Based on the statistical data collected from the NASA Earth Observatory, the European Space Agency, and the Global Carbon Project, the findings of this study reveal that the climate/environment has improved during COVID-19, including better environmental quality and water quality with low carbon emissions and sound pollution. In the lockdown during the epidemic, the emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) significantly decreased because of the lower usage of transportation, decreased electricity demand, and halted industrial activities. The policy implications of this study suggested that keeping the climate healthy even in the post-COVID-19 era is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by investing in clean and green projects, ensuring green energy evolution, dealing with a large volume of medical waste, building health-ensuring and livable societies, and halting the funding of pollution. For governmental and regulatory bodies, these factors will provide a strong foundation to build safer, healthier, and environmentally friendly societies for generations to come.","Usman, Muhammad; Husnain, Mudassir; Riaz, Aimon; Riaz, Areej; Ali, Yameen",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

A better understanding of the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms mediating oxytocin's anorexigenic effects may guide more effective obesity pharmacotherapy development. The present study examined the effects of central (lateral intracerebroventricular [ICV]) administration of oxytocin in rats on motivated responding for palatable food. Various conditioning procedures were employed to measure distinct appetitive behavioral domains, including food seeking in the absence of consumption (conditioned place preference expression), impulsive responding for food (differential reinforcement of low rates of responding), effort-based appetitive decision making (high-effort palatable vs. low-effort bland food), and sucrose reward value encoding following a motivational shift (incentive learning). Results reveal that ICV oxytocin potently reduces food-seeking behavior, impulsivity, and effort-based palatable food choice, yet does not influence encoding of sucrose reward value in the incentive learning task. To investigate a potential neurobiological mechanism mediating these behavioral outcomes, we utilized in vivo fiber photometry in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons to examine oxytocin's effect on phasic dopamine neuron responses to sucrose-predictive Pavlovian cues. Results reveal that ICV oxytocin significantly reduced food cue-evoked dopamine neuron activity. Collectively, these data reveal that central oxytocin signaling inhibits various obesity-relevant conditioned appetitive behaviors, potentially via reductions in food cue-driven phasic dopamine neural responses in the VTA.","Liu, Clarissa M; Hsu, Ted M; Suarez, Andrea N; Subramanian, Keshav S; Fatemi, Ryan A; Cortella, Alyssa M; Noble, Emily E; Roitman, Mitchell F; Kanoski, Scott E",Horm Behav,506,18

Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals' response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.","Pereira, Rafael H M; Braga, Carlos Kauê Vieira; Servo, Luciana Mendes; Serra, Bernardo; Amaral, Pedro; Gouveia, Nelson; Paez, Antonio",Soc Sci Med,506,12

To estimate the impact on melanoma progression of the reduction in the dermatologic services during the COVID-19 lockdown, a retrospective observational cohort study was conducted, designed to compare the clinical/histologic characteristics of the primary melanomas removed in the first two months after the end of the lockdown (May-July 2020) in twelve Italian centers characterized by different COVID-19 case frequencies. The control group was represented by the melanomas removed in the same period of the previous three years. Overall, 1,124 melanomas were considered: 237 as part of the study group and 887 from the control group (average 295), with a 20% reduction. Breslow thickness – as well as high-risk histotypes and melanomas with vertical growth – increased for all melanomas. Ulcerated and high mitotic index melanomas increased, particularly in northern Italy. In Italy, the lockdown led to a significant worsening of melanoma severity, determining a staging jump, with a consequent worsening of the outcomes.","Gualdi, Giulio Porreca Annamaria Amoruso Giuseppe Fabrizio Atzori Laura Calzavara-Pinton Piergiacomo De Tursi Michele Buduo Andrea Di Marino Pietro Di Fabroncini Gabriella Fantini Fabrizio Fargnoli Maria Concetta Giannotta Gaetano Lacarruba Francesco Lotesoriere Andrea Merli Martina Micali Giuseppe Paradisi Andrea Puviani Mario Quaglino Pietro Rongioletti Franco Rubatto Marco Sbano Paolo Scalvenzi Massimiliano Soglia Simone Sollima Laura Villani Alessia Nicola Marta Di Amerio Paolo",Clinics in Dermatology,506,18

METHODS: Patients were monitored through by 2 rounds of interviews. Clinical characteristics of patients with no symptoms (group 0) and of those reporting â©¾1 (group A), â©¾3 (group B), or â©¾5 symptoms (group C) were analyzed. Patients with â©¾1 symptom at both interviews were defined as group A2. RESULTS: Five hundred patients with HNC were analyzed. A higher frequency of patients with the following characteristics was observed in group A vs group 0: active treatment (40% vs 24%, p = 0.0002), gastrostomy (6% vs 2%, p = 0.027), recent active treatment (48% vs 29%, p < 0.0001), and higher number of concomitant medications (p = 0.01). A lower median age was observed in group B vs group no-B (patients with fewer than three symptoms) (59 vs 63.55 years, p = 0.016) and in group A2 vs group no-A2 (patients without at least one symptom at both interviews) (56 vs 63 years, p = 0.021); patients in group B received more recent active treatment than those in group no-B and in group A2 vs those in group no-A2 (p = 0.024 and 0.043, respectively); patients in group B had a lower body mass index than those in group no-B (22.4 vs 23.93 kg/m2, p = 0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: This work is based on patient-reported symptoms and signs independently of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing.

In the recent RECOVERY trial, evaluating the effect of dexamethasone, a reduced 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation was shown. Their results have led to considering amendments in guidelines or actually already recommending corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids still remain uncertain, and reliable data to further shed light on the benefit and harm are needed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search of RCTS and observational studies on adult patients was performed across Medline/PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from December 1, 2019, until October 1, 2020, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Primary outcomes were short-term mortality and viral clearance (based on RT-PCR in respiratory specimens). Secondary outcomes were: need for mechanical ventilation, need for other oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay and secondary infections. RESULTS: Forty-four studies were included, covering 20.197 patients. In twenty-two studies, the effect of corticosteroid use on mortality was quantified. The overall pooled estimate (observational studies and RCTs) showed a significant reduced mortality in the corticosteroid group (OR 0.72 (95%CI 0.57-0.87). Furthermore, viral clearance time ranged from 10 to 29 days in the corticosteroid group and from 8 to 24 days in the standard of care group. Fourteen studies reported a positive effect of corticosteroids on need for and duration of mechanical ventilation. A trend toward more infections and antibiotic use was present. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings from both observational studies and RCTs confirm a beneficial effect of corticosteroids on short-term mortality and a reduction in need for mechanical ventilation. And although data in the studies were too sparse to draw any firm conclusions, there might be a signal of delayed viral clearance and an increase in secondary infections.","van Paassen, Judith; Vos, Jeroen S; Hoekstra, Eva M; Neumann, Katinka M I; Boot, Pauline C; Arbous, Sesmu M",Crit Care,506,2

For example, the piezoelectricity induced modulation in cellular functionality assists in the repair and regeneration of bone tissue. Against this backdrop, we review here the origin of dielectric and electrical responses (piezo-, pyro- and ferro-electricity) of natural bone along with their consequences in regulating the bone metabolic activities. The concept of piezoelectricity induced osteogenesis has driven the development of piezoimplants for bone regeneration applications. A number of recent studies have been critically analyzed to demonstrate as to how the surface charge polarization or electric field stimulation together with functional properties of piezoelectric biomaterials can synergistically modulate cell functionality, in vitro or tissue regeneration, in vivo. The examples are drawn from a range of piezoelectric bioceramics, (e.g. barium titanate, magnesium silicate etc.) and biopolymers (e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), collagen, etc). The challenging problem of processing the compositionally tailored bioceramics is emphasized in particular reference to (Na, K)NbO3, an implantable biomaterial with the most attractive combination of piezoresponsive properties. Taken together, this review comprehensively emphasizes the appealing relevance of piezo-bioceramics and piezo-biopolymers as next-generation orthopedic biomaterials.","Khare, Deepak; Basu, Bikramjit; Dubey, Ashutosh Kumar",Biomaterials,506,20

The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of calcification deposition on the wall shear stress (WSS) and stresses within the plaques using 3D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models. Six patients with calcified carotid atherosclerosis underwent multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were divided into three groups according to the calcification volume. To evaluate the role of the calcification deposition on the stresses, the calcification content was replaced by lipids and arterial tissue, respectively. By comparing the results from the simulation with calcification, and when changing it to lipids there was a significant increment in the stresses at the fibrous cap (p = 0.004). Instead, by changing it to arterial tissue, there was no significant difference (p = 0.07). The calcification shapes that presented the highest stresses were thin concave arc-shaped (AS1) and thin convex arc-shaped (AS3), with mean stress values of 107 ± 54.2 and 99.6 ± 23.4 kPa, respectively. It was also observed that, the calcification shape has more influence on the level of stress than its distance to the lumen. Higher WSS values were associated with the presence of calcification. Calcification shape plays an important role in producing high stresses in the plaque. This work further clarifies the impact of calcification on plaque vulnerability.","Benitez, Jessica; Fontanarosa, Davide; Wang, Jiaqiu; Paritala, Phani Kumari; McGahan, Tim; Lloyd, Thomas; Li, Zhiyong",Ann. biomed. eng,506,16

The study examines whether this had an effect on the life satisfaction and subjective well-being among adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHOD: An online survey among students in lower secondary schools in Oslo (N = 8 116, 46 % response rate) was conducted during the period with closed schools and strict infection control measures. The results were compared to equivalent surveys conducted in Oslo in 2018 (N = 13 790, 83 % response rate) and several other counties in 2020 before the COVID-19 restrictions were introduced (N = 19 799, 49 % response rate). Identical measurements were used for life satisfaction, subjective well-being and background factors. We used logistic regression analysis and corrected for sociodemographic differences. RESULTS: Among boys, the proportion reporting high life satisfaction (a score of 6 or higher on a scale from 0 to 10) declined markedly, from 88 % in 2018 and 92 % in 2020 before the COVID-19 restrictions to 71 % during the period of restrictions (p < 0.001). The equivalent figures for girls were 78 %, 81 % and 62 % (p < 0.001). The social inequality in life satisfaction was smaller during the restrictions than in other periods. Concerns about illness and infection were associated with lower life satisfaction. INTERPRETATION: The reduction in life satisfaction and subjective well-being can most likely be explained by the heavy restrictions placed on activities that promote well-being and by concerns about infection. The results also indicate that resourceful adolescents experienced an especially strong reduction in their life satisfaction.","Soest, Tilmann von; Bakken, Anders; Pedersen, Willy; Sletten, Mira A",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,506,24

Rotaviruses cause diarrheal disease in many mammals and birds, and their segmented genomes allow them to reassort and increase their genetic diversity. Eighteen out of 2,142 bat fecal samples (0.8%) collected from Europe, Central America, and Africa were PCR-positive for RVA, and 11 of those were fully characterized using viral metagenomics. Upon contrasting their genomes with publicly available data, at least 7 distinct bat RVA genotype constellations (GCs) were identified, which included evidence of reassortments and 6 novel genotypes. Some of these constellations are spread across the world, whereas others appear to be geographically restricted. Our analyses also suggest that several unusual human and equine RVA strains might be of bat RVA origin, based on their phylogenetic clustering, despite various levels of nucleotide sequence identities between them. Although SA11 is one of the most widely used reference strains for RVA research and forms the backbone of a reverse genetics system, its origin remained enigmatic. Remarkably, the majority of the genotypes of SA11-like strains were shared with Gabonese bat RVAs, suggesting a potential common origin. Overall, our findings suggest an underexplored genetic diversity of RVAs in bats, which is likely only the tip of the iceberg. Increasing contact between humans and bat wildlife will further increase the zoonosis risk, which warrants closer attention to these viruses.IMPORTANCE The increased research on bat coronaviruses after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) allowed the very rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2. This is an excellent example of the importance of knowing viruses harbored by wildlife in general, and bats in particular, for global preparedness against emerging viral pathogens. The current effort to characterize bat rotavirus strains from 3 continents sheds light on the vast genetic diversity of rotaviruses and also hints at a bat origin for several atypical rotaviruses in humans and animals, implying that zoonoses of bat rotaviruses might occur more frequently than currently realized.","Simsek, Ceren; Corman, Victor Max; Everling, Hermann Ulrich; Lukashev, Alexander N; Rasche, Andrea; Maganga, Gael Darren; Binger, Tabea; Jansen, Daan; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Seebens-Hoyer, Antje; Yordanov, Stoian; Sylverken, Augustina; Oppong, Samuel; Sarkodie, Yaw Adu; Vallo, Peter; Leroy, Eric M; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Van Ranst, Marc; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix; Matthijnssens, Jelle",mBio (Online),506,6

Food insecurity, which entails having limited or uncertain access to a sufficient quantity of nutritious food, is a key pandemic-related consequence. We examined how people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have been affected by the pandemic, particularly Black participants and participants residing in food deserts. METHODS: Using survey data from a longitudinal cohort study of predominantly Black low-income adults aged &#8805;18 residing in urban food deserts in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we examined changes in food insecurity and SNAP participation before COVID-19 (2018) and early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). We modeled changes in food insecurity from 2018 to 2020 via covariate-adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: Food insecurity increased significantly among participants enrolled in SNAP and surveyed in both 2018 and 2020 (from 25.9% in 2018 to 46.9% in 2020; P < .001). Compared with cohort participants not enrolled in SNAP at both points, cohort participants enrolled in SNAP in 2018 and 2020 had the highest rates of using a food bank in 2020 (44.4%) and being newly food insecure in 2020 (28.9%) (ie, they were food insecure in 2020 but not in 2018).

AIMS: We sought to measure the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volumes for mechanical thrombectomy (MT), stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) hospitalizations over a 3-month period at the height of the pandemic (March 1 to May 31, 2020) compared with two control 3-month periods (immediately preceding and one year prior). METHODS: Retrospective, observational, international study, across 6 continents, 40 countries, and 187 comprehensive stroke centers. The diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes and/or classifications in stroke databases at participating centers. RESULTS: The hospitalization volumes for any stroke, ICH, and MT were 26,699, 4,002, and 5,191 in the 3 months immediately before versus 21,576, 3,540, and 4,533 during the first 3 pandemic months, representing declines of 19.2% (95%CI,-19.7 to -18.7), 11.5% (95%CI,-12.6 to -10.6), and 12.7% (95%CI,-13.6 to -11.8), respectively. The decreases were noted across centers with high, mid, and low COVID-19 hospitalization burden, and also across high, mid, and low volume stroke/MT centers. High-volume COVID-19 centers (-20.5%) had greater declines in MT volumes than mid- (-10.1%) and low-volume (-8.7%) centers (p<0.0001).

Lack of a powerful animal model for human ischemic stroke could be a major reason for the failure to develop successful neuroprotective drugs for ischemic stroke. This review recapitulates the available cerebral ischemia animal models, provides an anatomical comparison of the circle of Willis of each species, and describes the functional assessment tests used in these ischemic stroke models. The distinct differences between human ischemic stroke and experimental stroke in available animal models is explored. Innovative animal models more closely resembling human strokes, better techniques in functional outcome assessment and better experimental designs generating clearer and stronger evidence may help realise the development of truly neuroprotective drugs that will benefit human ischemic stroke patients. This may involve use of newer molecules or revisiting earlier studies with new experimental designs. Translation of any resultant successes may then be tested in human clinical trials with greater confidence and optimism.","Narayan, Sunil K; Grace Cherian, Simy; Babu Phaniti, Prakash; Babu Chidambaram, Saravana; Rachel Vasanthi, A Hannah; Arumugam, Murugesan",Animal Model Exp Med,506,16

Predictors for severe COVID-19 infection have not been well defined. Determination of risk factors for severe infection would enable identifying patients who may benefit from aggressive supportive care and early intervention. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: Of 197 hospitalized patients, the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 60.6 (16.2) years, 103 (52.3%) were male and 156 (82.1%) were black. Severe COVID-19 infection was noted in 74 (37.6%) patients, requiring intubation. Patients aged above 60 were significantly more likely to have severe infection. Patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease and had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to patients with non-severe infection. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for severe infection included pre-existing renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% CI 2.5-22.0), oxygen requirement at hospitalization (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.7), acute renal injury (OR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6) and initial CRP (OR,1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.01). Race, age and socioeconomic status were not identified as independent predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Acute or pre-existing renal disease, supplemental oxygen at the time of hospitalization and initial CRP were independent predictors for the development of severe COVID-19 infections.

Japanese children and adolescents have had their schools closed, government-mandated activity restrictions imposed, and interactions outside the home reduced. These restrictions can have a considerable psychological impact on children and adolescents. This review aims to describe the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity and psychological status of this population. The review was conducted by searching PubMed for information on the impact of COVID-19-related activity restrictions on children and adolescents. The search identified 11 articles, three of which contained data on anxiety and psychological problems due to physical inactivity. Next, a PubMed search was conducted about physical activity and psychological status in children and adolescents under psychological stress. The search identified 368 articles, 28 of which were included in the review. For children, data that revealed a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and sedentary time leading to mood disorders were included. For adolescents, there were nine studies that reported a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and four studies that reported no correlation between physical activity and psychological health. Of the studies that reported a correlation, seven reported that physical activity improves psychological health. The impact of psychologically stressful situations such as COVID-19 on children and adolescents has been experienced worldwide. Physical activity has been correlated with psychological health, and it may improve psychological status; physical activity should be recommended to better support the psychological health of children and adolescents under the influence of COVID-19.","Okuyama, Junko; Seto, Shuji; Fukuda, Yu; Funakoshi, Shunichi; Amae, Shintaro; Onobe, Jun; Izumi, Shinichi; Ito, Kiyoshi; Imamura, Fumihiko",Tohoku J Exp Med,506,7

In this system, MSCs are seeded on the exterior of a hollow-fiber filter, sequestering them behind a hemocompatible semipermeable membrane with defined pore-size and permeability to allow for a molecularly defined cross talk between the therapeutic cells and the whole blood environment, including blood cells and signaling molecules. The potential for these bioreactor MSCs to induce clots in coagulable plasma was compared against directly injected ""free"" MSCs, a model of systemic administration. Our results showed that restricting MSCs exposure to plasma via a bioreactor extends the time necessary for clot formation to occur when compared with ""free"" MSCs. Measurement of cell surface data indicates the presence of known clot inducing factors, namely tissue factor and phosphatidylserine. Results also showed that recovering cells and flushing the bioreactor prior to use further prolonged clot formation time. Furthermore, application of this technology in two in vivo models did not require additional heparin in fully anticoagulated experimental animals to maintain target activated clotting time levels relative to heparin anticoagulated controls. Taken together the clinical use of bioreactor housed MSCs could offer a novel method to control systemic MSC exposure and prolong clot formation time.","O039,; Rourke, Brian; Nguyen, Sunny; Tilles, Arno W; Bynum, James A; Cap, Andrew P; Parekkadan, Biju; Barcia, Rita N",Stem cells transl. med.

We developed an 11-item Coronavirus Pandemic Anxiety Scale (CPAS-11) to measure symptoms of anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic to help identify individuals who might need mental health services. In developing the scale items, we considered previous research and theory on anxiety symptoms and symptoms reported by clinically referred cases in the Philippines. The scale was validated in a Filipino sample (N = 925). Exploratory factor analysis indicated two factors corresponding to somatic and non-somatic symptoms; confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit for the two-factor model. CPAS-11 showed good internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and screening accuracy. A cutoff score of 15 showed adequate sensitivity and specificity to distinguish GAD-7 screened participants. The results support the viability of CPAS-11 as a screening tool to identify individuals experiencing COVID-19-related anxiety.","Bernardo, Allan B I; Mendoza, Norman B; Simon, Patricia D; Cunanan, Angela Lorraine P; Dizon, John Ian Wilzon T; Tarroja, Maria Caridad H; Ma Balajadia-Alcala, Araceli; Saplala, Jesus Enrique G",Curr Psychol,506,1

The goal of this project was to identify and evaluate processes that address these barriers while maintaining clinical and research staff safety. Methods: We reviewed Federal Drug Administration (FDA), World Health Organization (WHO), and VA Office of Research and Development (ORD) guidance about informed consent during the COVID-19 pandemic, and identified and pilot-tested several mechanisms for obtaining regulatory-compliant consent during our COVID-19 therapeutics clinical trial. Results: Several processes were identified. These included a standard face-to-face consent with a plan for maintaining a paper copy of the signed consent form, a phone or video chat consent process that included taking a picture of the signed consent form or a screen shot of the signed document during a video chat, integration of the consent forms into software embedded within the electronic health record, and secure software programs with electronic signature. These processes are FDA-compliant but time-intensive, often requiring four or more hours of coordination between the clinical team, research staff, patients, and legally authorized representatives. Conclusions: Future studies could evaluate how to improve efficiency, and whether some elements of the consenting process, such as the requirement for documented written signed consent, rather than a witnessed oral consent, is an acceptable standard for research participants with communicable diseases.","Woods, Patricia; Flynn, Maura; Monach, Paul; Schiller, Sara; Holmberg, Erika; Leatherman, Sarah; Ferguson, Ryan; Branch-Elliman, Westyn",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,506,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 who had been discharged or expired were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into corticosteroid group and non-corticosteroid group according to the systemic corticosteroid use or not. Clinical data were collected, and hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, time of viral clearance, time of mechanical ventilation, and duration from illness onset to symptom resolution were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 72 inpatients who were diagnosed with severe and critical COVID-19 were enrolled, in which 47 patients were divided into corticosteroid group and 25 were involved as the non-corticosteroid group. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the two groups. Four (5.6%) patients died during hospitalization, and 68 (94.4%) were discharged. Among survivors, the mean duration time from admission to discharge was 19.5d (SD 7.05 d). The mean time of viral clearance among survivors was 17.5d (SD 7.67 d), with a maximum of 37 d, and a minimum of 5 d. Hospital mortality (4.3% vs. 8.0%), length of hospital stay (18.7d vs. 21.0d), and time of viral clearance (16.1d vs. 19.4d) had no significant difference between two groups (p>0.05). The duration of symptoms suffering was shorter in the corticosteroid group than non-corticosteroid group, with statistically significant difference (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 cannot reduce the hospital mortality, and is not associated with delayed viral clearance, but it could relieve the inflammatory storm and improve clinical symptoms in brief. Patients with severe COVID-19 could benefit from low-dose corticosteroid treatment.","Ma, Q; Qi, D; Deng, X-Y; Yuan, G-D; Tian, W-G; Cui, Y; Yan, X-F; Wang, D-X",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,506,33

A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1, designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. We first considered historical data for Australia before it eliminated COVID-19 (equivalent to an outbreak generating 74 new cases/day) and one flight per day to NZ with no interventions in place. This gave a median time to an outbreak of 0.2 years (95% range of simulation results: 3 days to 1.1 years) or a mean of 110 flights per outbreak. However, the combined use of a pre-flight PCR test of saliva, three subsequent PCR tests (on days 1, 3 and 12 in NZ), and various other interventions (mask use and contact tracing) reduced this risk to one outbreak after a median of 1.5 years (20 days to 8.1 years). A pre-flight test plus 14 days quarantine was an even more effective strategy (4.9 years; 2,594 flights). For a much lower prevalence (representing only two new community cases per week in the whole of Australia), the annual risk of an outbreak with no interventions was 1.2% and had a median time to an outbreak of 56 years. In contrast the risks associated with travellers from Japan and the United States was very much higher and would need quarantine or other restrictions. Collectively, these results suggest that multi-layered interventions can markedly reduce the risk of importing the pandemic virus via air travel into a COVID-19-free nation. For some low-risk source countries, there is the potential to replace 14-day quarantine with alternative interventions. However, all approaches require public and policy deliberation about acceptable risks, and continuous careful management and evaluation.","Wilson, Nick; Baker, Michael G; Blakely, Tony; Eichner, Martin",Sci Rep,506,20

A more robust primate conservation genomics will allow for genetically informed population management.

Although NM has been reported to reduce the risk of bleeding during blood purification, its effect on survival outcomes of patients who received blood purification treatments is unclear. We hypothesized that administration of NM during blood purification can reduce mortality in patients with sepsis. A post hoc analysis was conducted on a nationwide retrospective registry that included data from 3195 sepsis patients registered at 42 intensive care units throughout Japan. We evaluated the effect of NM on hospital mortality and bleeding complications using propensity score matching in 1216 sepsis patients who underwent blood purification in the intensive care unit (ICU). Two-hundred-and-sixty-eight pairs of propensity score-matched patients who received NM and conventional therapy were compared. Hospital and ICU mortality rates in the NM group were significantly lower than those in the conventional therapy group. However, rates of bleeding complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. These data suggest that administration of NM improved the survival outcomes of sepsis patients who underwent blood purification in the ICU.","Kamijo, Hiroshi; Mochizuki, Katsunori; Nakamura, Yuta; Mori, Kotaro; Ichikawa, Michitaro; Nitta, Kenichi; Imamura, Hiroshi",,506,16

Protocols for the management of poisoning recommend diazepam, although there are uncertainties in its pharmacology and efficacy in this context. The aim was to assess the effects of diazepam in experimental models of chloroquine cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vitro experiments involved cardiac tissues isolated from rats and incubated with chloroquine alone or in combination with diazepam. In vivo models of toxicity involved chloroquine administered intravenously to pentobarbitone‐anaesthetised rats and rabbits. Randomised, controlled treatment studies in rats assessed diazepam, clonazepam and Ro5‐4864 administered: (i) prior, (ii) during and (iii) after chloroquine and the effects of diazepam: (iv) at high dose, (v) in urethane‐anaesthetised rats and (vi) co‐administered with adrenaline. KEY RESULTS: Chloroquine decreased the developed tension of left atria, prolonged the effective refractory period of atria, ventricular tissue and right papillary muscles, and caused dose‐dependent impairment of haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters. Cardiac arrhythmias indicated impairment of atrioventricular conduction. Studies (i), (ii) and (v) showed no differences between treatments and control. Diazepam increased heart rate in study (iv) and as with clonazepam also prolonged the QTc interval in study (iii). Combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in study (vi) improved cardiac contractility but caused hypokalaemia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Neither diazepam nor other ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites protect against or attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity. However, diazepam may augment the effects of positive inotropes in reducing chloroquine cardiotoxicity. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed issue on The Pharmacology of COVID‐19.

The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being “immune” to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has focused the efforts of scientists on repurposing existing Food and Drug Administration–approved drugs that inhibit viral entry, endocytosis, genome assembly, translation, and replication. Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies. As discussed in this review, till effective vaccines and treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale of pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing, and implement them.","Hosoki, Koa; Chakraborty, Abhijit; Sur, Sanjiv",J Allergy Clin Immunol,506,15

EM during the first 20 weeks of 2020 was estimated by comparing observed mortality rates with expected mortality rates during the five previous years (N=2,379,792). EM variation by socioeconomic status (tertiles of income, education, Swedish-born, gainful employment) and age distribution (share of 70+ year-old persons) was explored based on Demographic Statistics Area (DeSO) data. Findings: An EM was first detected during the week of March 23-29 2020. During the peaking week of the epidemic (6-12 April 2020), an EM of 160% was observed: 211% in 80+ year-old women; 179% in 80+ year-old men. During the same week, the highest EM was observed for DeSOs with lowest income (171%), lowest education (162%), lowest share of Swedish-born (178%), and lowest share of gainfully employed (174%). There was a 1.2 to 1.7-fold increase in EM between those areas with a higher vs. lower proportion of young people. Interpretation: Living in areas with lower socioeconomic status and younger populations is linked to COVID-19 EM. These conditions might have facilitated the viral spread.

The aim of our work was to understand current behaviours and attitudes towards public health measures as well as barriers individuals face in following public health measures. We also sought to identify attitudes persons have regarding a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons why they may not accept a vaccine. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in August 2020, in Alberta, Canada in persons 18 years and older. This survey evaluated current behaviours, barriers and attitudes towards public health measures and a COVID-19 vaccine. Cluster analysis was used to identify key patterns that summarize data variations among observations. RESULTS: Of the 60 total respondents, the majority of persons were always or often physically distancing (73%), masking (65%) and staying home while sick (67%). Bars/pubs/lounges or nightclubs were visited rarely or never by 63% of respondents. Persons identified staying home while sick to provide the highest benefit (83%) in reducing spread of COVID-19. There were a large proportion of persons who had not downloaded or used a contact tracing/exposure notification app (77%) and who would not receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available (20%) or were unsure (12%). Reporting health authorities as most trusted sources of health information was associated with greater percentage of potential uptake of vaccine but not related to contact tracing app download and use. Individuals with lower concern of getting and spreading COVID-19 showed the least uptake of public health measures except for avoiding public places such as bars. Lower concern regarding COVID-19 was also associated with more negative responses to taking a potential COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: These results suggest informational frames and themes focusing on individual risks, highlighting concern for COVID-19 and targeting improving trust for health authorities may be most effective in increasing public health measures. With the ultimate goal of preventing spread of COVID-19, understanding persons’ attitudes towards both public health measures and a COVID-19 vaccine remains critical to addressing barriers and implementing targeted interventions and messaging to improve uptake.

These infections compromise host defense mechanisms, and, when combined with other stressful events, allow opportunistic pathogens like Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus to create serious disease. Early recognition and treatment are tremendously important for a successful outcome in these cases. A polyvalent vaccine was given to 22 racing dogs three days after a competition, followed by two days of rest, and then the dogs were returned to regular training. Coughing was noticed among the dogs four days after immunisation. Three days after this outbreak one of the dogs was unusually silent and was found dead the next morning. Simultaneously two other dogs developed haemorrhagic expectorate, depression and dyspnea and were brought in to the veterinary hospital. Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus was isolated in pure culture from all three cases. They were treated and rehabilitated successfully, and won a sledge race three months later.

We aimed to explore the contribution of structural factors of nursing home facilities and the surrounding district to all-cause and Covid-19-related deaths during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated the risk factors of Covid-19 mortality at the facility level in nursing homes in Catalonia (North-East Spain). The investigated factors included characteristics of the residents (age, gender, comorbidities, and complexity and/or advanced disease), structural features of the nursing home (total number of residents, residents who return home during the pandemic, and capacity for pandemic response, based on an ad hoc score of availability of twelve essential items for implementing preventive measures), and sociodemographic profile of the catchment district (household income, population density, and population incidence of Covid-19). Study endpoints included all-cause death and Covid-19-related death (either PCR-confirmed or clinical suspicion). Findings The analysis included 167 nursing homes that provide long-term care to 8,716 residents. Between March 1 and June 1, 2020, 1,629 deaths were reported in these nursing homes; 1,089 (66,9%) of them were Covid-19-confirmed. The multivariable regression showed a higher risk of death associated with a higher percentage of complex patients (HR 1,09; 95%CI 1,05 to 1,12 per 10% increase) or those with advanced diseases (1,13; 1,07 to 1,19), lower capacity for implementing preventive measures (1,08; 1,05 to 1,10 per 1-point increase), and districts with a higher incidence of Covid-19 (2,98; 2,53 to 3,50 per 1000 cases/100,000 population increase). A higher population density of the catchment area was a protective factor (0,60; 0,50 to 0,72 per log10 people/Km2 increase). Interpretation Presence of residents with complex/advance disease, low capacity for pandemic response and location in areas with high incidence of Covid-19 are risk factors for Covid-19 mortality in nursing homes and may help policymakers to prioritize preventative interventions for pandemic containment.","Suner, C.; Ouchi, D.; Mas, M.

The wildlife rehabilitation centers (WRCs) play a relevant role in animal welfare; nevertheless, they also represent an imminent risk of pathogen transmission between humans‐to‐animals and between animals. Moreover, WRCs could spread pathogens into natural habitats through the reintroduction of infectious individuals. These biosafety concerns at WRCs may increase as the economic and social impact of the COVID‐19 extends. We explored the current situation of Latin American WRCs under the COVID‐19 pandemic to determine the feasibility of SARS‐CoV‐2 introduction, amplification, and spread within these institutions. We surveyed WRCs from eight Latin American countries. We found that pandemic is affecting these institutions in many aspects: workers with symptoms compatible with COVID‐19, reduced economic resources, and lack of information and support from governmental authorities. These have forced WRCs to reduce the workforce, veterinary visits, and animal food rations and to increase the number of animals released. This scenario generates a risky environment for the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2, especially for felids, mustelids, and non‐human primates. Therefore, it is imperative to respect quarantine periods, monitor incoming patients, increase biosecurity measures, develop and apply guidelines and recommendations for the protection of personnel and biosafety of enclosures and instruments.

Libya, the second largest African country, has been involved in a major conflict since 2011. This study analyzed the epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya, examined the impact of the armed conflict in Libya on the spread of the pandemic, and proposes strategies for dealing with the pandemic during this conflict. Methods: We collected the available information on all COVID-19 cases in the different regions of Libya, covering the period from March 25 to May 25, 2020. The cumulative number of cases and the daily new cases are presented in a way to illustrate the patterns and trends of COVID-19 and the effect of the ongoing armed conflict was assessed regionally. Results: A total of 698 cases of COVID-19 were reported in Libya during a period of three months. The number of cases varied from one region to another and was affected by the fighting. The largest number of cases was reported in the southern part of the country, which has been severely affected by the conflict in comparison to the eastern and western parts of the country. Conclusion: This study describes the epidemiological pattern of COVID-19 in Libya and how it has been affected by the ongoing armed conflict. This conflict seems to have hindered access to populations and thereby masked the true dimensions of the pandemic. Hence, efforts should be combined to combat these consequences.","Daw, M.

We hypothesized that the effectiveness of virtual and face-to-face modes as perceived by postgraduate students in terms of facilitating their overall learning may differ across the spectrum of leader-centered and participant-centered activities. To assess the same, we designed and administered a comprehensive, structured, and validated feedback questionnaire. Postgraduate students (n = 29) rated virtual sessions significantly more convenient, but less attentive and comprehensible, and reported better audiovisual experience during face-to-face sessions. Students rated flexibility to attend, self-paced learning, ability to revise, lookup for information in real time, and accessibility to distant expertise as important features of virtual sessions and instant feedback, eye-to-eye contact, and ability to interact in the group for face-to-face sessions. Virtual and face-to-face sessions were perceived as equally effective in facilitating their overall learning for the conduct of leader-centered seminars and symposia. However, face-to-face sessions were considered more effective for the conduct of participant-centered group discussions and journal clubs. During the pandemic, students perceive the synchronous virtual mode as an equally effective alternative for the conduct of leader-centered academic activities, but face-to-face teaching is still preferred for the conduct of participant-centered academic activities.","Chandran, Dinu S.; Kaur, Simran; Deepak, Kishore Kumar",Adv Physiol Educ,506,16

Current vaccination campaigns have limitations especially in developing countries, due to elevated costs, need of trained personnel for effective vaccine administration, and functional cold chain network to maintain vaccine viability. These problems have led to heightened interest in producing new antiviral strategies, such as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi methodology is capable of substantially decreasing viral replication at a cellular level, both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we utilize microRNA (miRNA)-expressing constructs (a type of RNA interference) in an attempt to target and knockdown five NDV structural RNAs for nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and large (L) protein genes. Immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1) that transiently expressed miRNA targeting NP mRNA, showed increased resistance to NDV-induced cytopathic effects, as determined by cell count, relative to the same cells expressing miRNA against alternative NDV proteins. Upon infection with NDV, DF-1 cells constitutively expressing the NP miRNA construct had improved cell survival up to 48 h post infection (h.p.i) and decreased viral yield up to 24 h.p.i. These results suggest that overexpression of the NP miRNA in cells and perhaps live animal may provide resistance to NDV.","Hutcheson, Jessica M.; Susta, Leonardo; Stice, Steven L.; Afonso, Claudio L.; West, Franklin D.",Biologicals,506,33

The evolutionary mechanisms that drove this rapid diversity are not well understood but neutral evolution should open the first insight. The neutral theory of evolution states that most mutations in the nucleic acid sequences are random and they can be fixed or disappear by purifying selection. Herein, we performed a neutrality test to better understand the selective pressures exerted over SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from homologue proteins of Betacoronavirus, as well as to the spikes from human clinical isolates of the virus. Specifically, Tyr and Asn have higher occurrence rates on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and in the overall sequence of spike proteins of Betacoronavirus, whereas His and Arg have lower occurrence rates. The in vivo evolutionary phenomenon of SARS-CoV-2 shows that Glu, Lys, Phe, and Val have the highest probability of occurrence in the emergent viral particles. Amino acids that have higher occurrence than the expected by the neutral control, are favorable and are fixed in the sequence while the ones that have lower occurrence than expected, influence the stability and/or functionality of the protein. Our results show that most unique mutations either for SARS-CoV-2 or its variants of health concern are under selective pressures, which could be related either to the evasion of the immune system, increasing the virus’ fitness or altering protein – protein interactions with host proteins. We explored the consequences of those selected mutations in the structure and protein – protein interaction with the receptor. Altogether all these forces have shaped the spike protein and the continually evolving variants.","López-Cortés, Georgina I.; Palacios-Pérez, Miryam; Zamudio, Gabriel S.; Veledíaz, Hannya F.; Ortega, Enrique; José, Marco V.",Sci Rep,506,22

Based on the dual-route race model [Pollatsek et al., 4] and the visual acuity principle [Bertram & Hyönä, 2], long lexicalized and novel compound words were predicted to be processed via the decomposition route and short lexicalized compound words via the holistic route. Gaze duration and selective regression-path duration demonstrated a constituent frequency effect of similar size for long lexicalized and novel compound words.

Identification of natural products with considerable inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial as a rapid and potent alternative with drug-likeness by comparison to de novo antiviral drug discovery approaches. Thereof, we carried out the structure-based screening of natural products from Echinacea-angustifolia, commonly used to prevent cold and other microbial respiratory infections, targeting SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Four natural products namely, Echinacoside, Quercetagetin 7-glucoside, Levan N, Inulin from chicory, and 1,3-Dicaffeoylquinic acid, revealed significant docking energy (>−10 kcal/mol) in the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) catalytic pocket via substantial intermolecular contacts formation against co-crystallized ligand (<−4 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the docked poses of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with selected natural products showed conformational stability through molecular dynamics. Exploring the end-point net binding energy exhibited substantial contribution of Coulomb and van der Waals interactions to the stability of respective docked conformations.

Most models assume the transmission rate of a contagion either does not vary over time or change in a fixed pre-determined adhoc ways. However, these rates do vary during an outbreak due to multitude of factors such as environmental conditions, social behaviors, and public-health interventions deployed to control the disease, which are in-part guided by changing size of an outbreak. We derive analytical estimates of time-dependent transmission rate for an epidemic in terms of either incidence or prevalence using a standard mathematical SIR-type epidemic model. We illustrate applicability of our method by applying data on various public health problems, including infectious diseases (Ebola, SARS, and Leishmaniasis) and social issues (obesity and alcohol drinking) to compute transmission rates over time. We show that time-dependent transmission rate estimates can have a large variation, depending on the type of available data and other epidemiological parameters. Time-dependent estimation of transmission rates captures the dynamics of the problem better and can be utilized to understand disease progression more accurately.","Mubayi, Anuj; Pandey, Abhishek; Brasic, Christine; Mubayi, Anamika; Ghosh, Parijat; Ghosh, Aditi",Trop Med Infect Dis,506,1

The logic is that face masks are low cost and might help prevent some transmission. However, from the start, the assumption that face masks are ""low cost"" was questioned. Early on, there were warnings of the opportunity cost of public use of medical masks given shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. This led to recommendations for cloth masks and other face coverings, with little evidence of their ability to prevent transmission. However, there may also be a high cost to these recommendations if people rely on face masks in place of other more effective ways to break transmission, such as staying home. We use SafeGraph smart device location data to show that the representative American in states that have face mask mandates spent 20-30 minutes less time at home, and increase visits to a number of commercial locations, following the mandate.

Our hemodialysis unit experienced a COVID-19 outbreak despite following symptom-based screening guidelines. We describe the course of the COVID-19 outbreak and the infection control measures taken for mitigation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 237 maintenance hemodialysis patients and 93 hemodialysis staff at a single hemodialysis centre in Toronto, Canada. EXPOSURE: Universal screening of patients and staff with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples from patients and staff using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) . ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Descriptive statistics were used for clinical characteristics and the primary outcome. RESULTS: Eleven (4.6%) of 237 hemodialysis patients and 11 of 93 (12%) staff members had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Among individuals testing positive, 12 of 22 (55%) were asymptomatic at time of testing, and 7 of 22 (32%) were asymptomatic for the duration of follow-up. One patient was hospitalized at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection and four additional patients with positive tests were subsequently hospitalized. Two patients (18%) required admission to the intensive care unit. After 30 days follow-up no patients had died or required mechanical ventilation. No hemodialysis staff required hospitalization. Universal droplet and contact precautions were implemented during the outbreak. Hemodialysis staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection were placed on home quarantine regardless of symptom status. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection including asymptomatic individuals were treated with droplet and contact precautions until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. Analysis of the outbreak identified two index cases with subsequent nosocomial transmission within the dialysis unit and in shared shuttle buses to the hemodialysis unit. LIMITATIONS: Single centre study. CONCLUSIONS: Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing and universal droplet and contact precautions in the setting of an outbreak appeared to be effective in preventing further transmission.","Yau, Kevin; Muller, Matthew P.; Lin, Molly; Siddiqui, Naureen; Neskovic, Sanja; Shokar, Gagan; Fattouh, Ramzi; Matukas, Larissa M.; Beaubien-Souligny, William; Thomas, Alison; Weinstein, Jordan J.; Zaltzman, Jeffrey; Wald, Ron",Am J Kidney Dis,506,16

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the types of discrimination and worries experienced by Asians and Asian Americans living in the United States during the pandemic, as well as factors that were associated with everyday discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination that the Asian community may face. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. A total of 235 people who identified themselves as Asian or Asian American and resided in the United States completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: Our study suggested that up to a third of Asians surveyed had experienced some type of discrimination. Pooling the responses “very often,” “often,” and “sometimes,” the percentages for each experienced discrimination type ranged between 14%-34%. In total, 49%-58% of respondents expressed concerns about discrimination in the future. The most frequently experienced discrimination types, as indicated by responses “very often” and “often,” were “people act as if they think you are dangerous” (25/235, 11%) and “being treated with less courtesy or respect” (24/235, 10%). About 14% (32/235) of individuals reported very often, often, or sometimes being threatened or harassed. In addition, social media use was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing discrimination (β=.18, P=.01) and having concerns about future episodes of discrimination the community may face (β=.20, P=.005). Use of print media was also positively associated with experiencing discrimination (β=.31, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided important empirical evidence regarding the various types of discrimination Asians residing in the United States experienced or worried about during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between media sources and the perception of racial biases in this group was also identified. We noted the role of social media in reinforcing the perception of discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination among Asians during this outbreak. Our results indicate several practical implications for public health agencies. To reduce discrimination against Asians during the pandemic, official sources and public health professionals should be cognizant of the possible impacts of stigmatizing cues in media reports on activating racial biases. Furthermore, Asians or Asian Americans could also be informed that using social media to obtain COVID-19 information is associated with an increase in concerns about future discrimination, and thus they may consider approaching this media source with caution.","Yu, Nan; Pan, Shuya; Yang, Chia-chen; Tsai, Jiun-Yi",J Med Internet Res,506,16

We analyzed deidentified Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking data from 1.15 to 1.4 million cell phones in Germany per day between March and November 2020 to identify encounters between individuals and statistically evaluate contact behavior. Using graph sampling theory, we estimated the contact index (CX), a metric for number and heterogeneity of contacts. We found that CX, and not the total number of contacts, is an accurate predictor for the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] derived from case numbers. A high correlation between CX and [Formula: see text] recorded more than 2 wk later allows assessment of social behavior well before changes in case numbers become detectable. By construction, the CX quantifies the role of superspreading and permits assigning risks to specific contact behavior.

Aggressive contact tracing and identification of suspects has helped to identify local community clusters, surveillance being the key to early intervention. Healthcare workers have contracted COVID-19 infection both at the workplace and community. We aimed to create a prototype staff surveillance system for the detection of acute respiratory infection (ARI) clusters amongst our healthcare workers (HCWs) and describe its effectiveness. METHODS/RESULTS: A prototypical surveillance system was built on existing electronic health record infrastructure. Over a 10-week period, we investigated 10 ARI clusters amongst 7 departments. One of the ARI clusters was later determined to be related to COVID-19 infection. We demonstrate the feasibility of syndromic surveillance to detect ARI clusters during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION: The use of syndromic surveillance to detect ARI clusters amongst HCWs in the COVID-19 pandemic may enable early case detection and prevent onward transmission. It could be an important tool in infection prevention within healthcare institutions.","Jean, Sim Xiang Ying; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Wee, Liang En; Aung, May Kyawt; Wei, Sylvia Seow Yi; Yang, Raymond Teo Chee; Qing, Goh Jia; Ting, Dennis Yeo Wu; Jyhhan, Kuo Benjamin; Lim, John Wah; Gan, Wee Hoe; Ling, Moi Lin; Venkatachalam, Indumathi",Am J Infect Control,506,10

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The thirty-four cases, 15 females and 19 males, with an age ranging from 7 to 88 years old, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were used for our study. All thin-section CT scans of the lungs were performed in all of patients. The clinical, laboratory and CT imaging were available to evaluate in all patients. RESULTS: The patients present with fever (85.29%, n = 29), cough (67.65%, n = 23), fatigue or myalgia (26.47%, n = 9), and pharyngalgia (8.82%, n = 3). The 4 patients (11.76%) with no symptoms were identified during screening for close contacts, who had typical CT findings. On initial CT scans, the bilateral lung involved was shown in 24 cases (70.59%), while 29 (82.35%) cases were distributed in peripheral. The pure ground glass opacity (GGO) was shown in 18 cases (52.94%), the GGO with consolidation was in 12 cases (35.29%), and full consolidation only in 3 cases.

With M(PID) = 8.6% and N(PID) = 50.2%, the 2003 SARS-CoV falls into group B, which consists of CoVs with intermediate levels of both fecal–oral and respiratory transmission potentials. Further validation of the model came with MERS-CoV (M(PID) = 9%, N(PID) = 44%) and SARS-CoV-2 (M(PID) = 5.5%, N(PID) = 48%) falling into the groups C and B, respectively. Group C contains CoVs with higher fecal–oral but lower respiratory transmission potentials. Unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 with M(PID) = 5.5% has one of the hardest outer shells among CoVs. Because the hard shell is able to resist the antimicrobial enzymes in body fluids, the infected person is able to shed large quantities of viral particles via saliva and mucus, which could account for the higher contagiousness of SARS-COV-2. Further searches have found that high rigidity of the outer shell is characteristic for the CoVs of burrowing animals, such as rabbits (M(PID) = 5.6%) and pangolins (M(PID) = 5–6%), which are in contact with the buried feces. A closer inspection of pangolin-CoVs from 2017 to 2019 reveals that pangolins provided a unique window of opportunity for the entry of an attenuated SARS-CoV-2 precursor into the human population in 2017 or earlier, with the subsequent slow and silent spread as a mild cold that followed by its mutations into the current more virulent form. Evidence of this lies in both the genetic proximity of the pangolin-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 (∼90%) and differences in N disorder. A 2017 pangolin-CoV strain shows evidence of higher levels of attenuation and higher fecal–oral transmission associated with lower human infectivity via having lower N(PID) (44.8%). Our shell disorder model predicts this to be a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain, as lower inner shell disorder is associated with the lesser virulence in a variety of viruses.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A.

While operational definitions and the actual planning of these cities can vary considerably (e.g., eco cities and low carbon cities), conceptually, at least, these terms overlap, particularly with regard to how they attempt to achieve both greener infrastructural design and healthier human lifestyles. This paper presents the findings of survey-based research carried out within Lingang New Town in Shanghai in 2019. In the cities of the Global North, the interplay between green infrastructural provision and public health has been of interest, especially in the context of social inequalities; however, there is little research from rapidly urbanizing countries where green urbanism is being increasingly promoted. Using this newly constructed example, we identified a clear positive correlation between moving to a green city and the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The structural equation modelling results suggest that behaviors around the use of green space as well as perceptions of different green space have notable impacts on residents’ physical health, measured by body mass index (BMI). The findings further illustrate systemic inequalities among private housing, rental housing and public housing typologies with regard to the distribution of health benefits.","Lu, Tingting; Lane, Matthew; der Horst, Dan Van; Liang, Xin; Wu, Jianing",Int J Environ Res Public Health,506,3

Method: 407 older adults, diagnosed either with MCI or AD dementia (ADD), were recruited from the Day Centers of the Greek Association of Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (GAADRD). Neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline (at the time of diagnosis) between May and July of 2018, as well as for two consecutive follow-up assessments, identical in period, in 2019 and 2020. The majority of participants had participated in non-pharmacological interventions during 2018 as well as 2019, whereas all of them continued their participation online in 2020. Results: Mixed measures analysis of variance showed that participants’ ‘deterioration difference—D’ by means of their performance difference in neuropsychological assessments between 2018–2019 (D1) and 2019–2020 (D2) did not change, except for the FUCAS, RAVLT, and phonemic fluency tests, since both groups resulted in a larger deterioration difference (D2) in these tests. Additionally, three path models examining the direct relationships between performance in tests measuring mood, as well as everyday functioning and cognitive measures, showed that participants’ worsened performance in the 2019 and 2020 assessments was strongly affected by NPI performance, in sharp contrast to the 2018 assessment. Discussion: During the lockdown period, MCI and ADD patients’ neuropsychological performance did not change, except from the tests measuring verbal memory, learning, and phonemic fluency, as well as everyday functioning. However, the natural progression of the MCI as well as ADD condition is the main reason for participants’ deterioration. Mood performance became increasingly closely related to cognition and everyday functioning. Hence, the role of quarantine and AD progression are discussed as potential factors associated with impairments.","Tsatali, Marianna; Moraitou, Despina; Poptsi, Eleni; Sia, Eleni; Agogiatou, Christina; Gialaouzidis, Moses; Tabakis, Irene-Maria; Avdikou, Konstantina; Bakoglidou, Evaggelia; Batsila, Georgia; Bekiaridis-Moschou, Dimitrios; Chatziroumpi, Ourania; Diamantidou, Alexandra; Gavra, Andromachi; Kouroundi, Eleni; Liapi, Despina; Markou, Nefeli; Ouzouni, Fani; Papasozomenou, Chrysa; Soumpourou, Aikaterini; Tsolaki, Magdalini",Brain Sci,506,16

Besides, clinical trials use as well patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess those adverse events, which are only accessible through patient self-reporting, such as fatigue, pain, and sleep disorders. Especially those issues that are not visible from the outside are often misinterpreted and underestimated by mere provider ratings. This trial aims at evaluating the impact of providing PRO data to providers on the accuracy of adverse event assessment in terms of inter-rater reliability of CTCAE ratings. METHODS: The trial uses a cross-sectional, unblinded, randomized controlled trial design with two trial arms and a single assessment time point. Eligible patients (aged 18 and above, any cancer diagnosis, currently under treatment, inpatient or day clinic setting, present symptom burden, no psychiatric or mental problems, written informed consent) complete an electronic version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and 16 additional questions taken from the EORTC Item Library. PRO data is immediately processed and made available to CTCAE rating providers for conducting their ratings during the medical encounter. Patients are randomly assigned 1:1 to the intervention group (providers see PRO results on the same screen as the CTCAE rating) and the control group (no access to PRO data during the CTCAE rating). A superiority analysis will compare the inter-rater reliability (using intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficients) between the control and the intervention groups for each adverse event evaluated. DISCUSSION: The presented trial will demonstrate potential benefits of using PRO measures to improve the reliability of CTCAE ratings in cancer trials and the identification of adverse events. The new insights gained may lead to a new strategy for evaluating adverse events in clinical trials by combining patient and provider ratings. This might also have implications for daily clinical practice and cancer registries. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04066868. Registered on August 26, 2019.

METHODS: Patients admitted to our department during the lockdown period (23 March- 4 May 2020) and during the respective previous year’s timeframe were recruited. Sex, age, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, final diagnosis, therapeutic management, duration of hospitalization, and outcome were evaluated. A direct comparison was performed to investigate the potential impact of the lockdown on the duration of hospitalization and the final outcome. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients were included to our analysis with 1:1 male:female ratio and mean age 70.86 years. Most of the cases experienced gastrointestinal tract bleeding, biliary stone disease manifestations, or gastrointestinal malignancy complications, and 85.1% were discharged.

The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the lockdown on the daily life habits of orthopaedic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Around 30 days after the start of the Italian lockdown, from April 17th to the end of the containment measures on May 18th, the Sapienza University of Rome carried out a 19-item survey on the effects the lockdown caused in patients suffering from an orthopaedic pathology (with regard to changes in lifestyle, pain, treatment) by stratifying the sample by age, sex, profession, pain location, pathogenesis and prior surgeries. RESULTS: A total of 292 subjects with orthopaedic pathologies took part in the survey. Taking into consideration the totality of the sample, physical activity was significantly reduced (p <0.001). The increase of a sedentary lifestyle was statistically significant (p <0.001), as well as an increase in pain (p <0.001) and the need to adjust the pharmacological treatment (p <0.001). The increase in pain was particularly significant in the 50–70 age group, among workers, and in polyarthralgic patients. About 55.48% stated that the lockdown period worsened their underlying pathological condition and 53.77% expressed the need to undergo a new clinical evaluation at the end of the lockdown. CONCLUSION: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and resulting sudden changes in lifestyle led to a change in patient perception of orthopedic pathology including a worsening of musculoskeletal pain requiring an adjustment or change in pharmacological and physical therapy.","Persiani, Pietro; De Meo, Daniele; Giannini, Elettra; Calogero, Valeria; Speziale Varsamis, Tommaso; Cavallo, Armando Ugo; Martini, Lorena; Cera, Gianluca; Coluzzi, Flaminia; Villani, Ciro",J Pain Res,506,30

Multiple contigs from influenza A virus and coronaviruses in bats shared high identity with those from humans, suggesting possible cross-species transmission, whereas a number of contigs, whose sequences were taxonomically classifiable within Alphapapillomavirus, Betaretrovirus, Alpharetrovirus, Varicellovirus, Cyprinivirus, Chlorovirus and Cucumovirus had low identity to viruses in existing databases, which indicated possible evolution of novel viral species. None of the established caliciviruses and picornaviruses were found in the 500 fecal specimens. Papillomaviruses with high amino acid identity were found in Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi, challenging the hypotheses regarding the strict host specificity and co-evolution of papillomaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four bat rotavirus A strains might be tentative G3 strains, according to the Rotavirus Classification Working Group classification.

Conventional chest-X ray (CXR) and ultrasound (US) are valuable instruments to assess the extent of lung involvement. We investigated the relationship between CXR scores on admission and the level of medical care required in patients with COVID-19. Further, we assessed the CXR-US correlation to explore the role of ultrasound in monitoring the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical features and CXR scores were obtained at admission and correlated with the level of intensity of care required [high- (HIMC) versus low-intensity medical care (LIMC)]. In a subgroup of patients, US findings were correlated with clinical and radiographic parameters. On hospital admission, CXR global score was higher in HIMCs compared to LIMC. Smoking history, pO(2) on admission, cardiovascular and oncologic diseases were independent predictors of HIMC. The US score was positively correlated with FiO(2) while the correlation with CXR global score only trended towards significance. Our study identifies clinical and radiographic features that strongly correlate with higher levels of medical care. The role of lung ultrasound in this setting remains undetermined and needs to be explored in larger prospective studies.","Cocconcelli, Elisabetta; Biondini, Davide; Giraudo, Chiara; Lococo, Sara; Bernardinello, Nicol; Fichera, Giulia; Barbiero, Giulio; Castelli, Gioele; Cavinato, Silvia; Ferrari, Anna; Saetta, Marina; Cattelan, Annamaria; Spagnolo, Paolo; Balestro, Elisabetta",J Clin Med,506,1

Here, we report a binder-free covalent coating of phase-selectively disordered TiO(2) on a hydroxylated silicon oxide (SiO(2)) substrate through rapid microwave treatment. We found that Ti-O-Si and Ti-O-Ti bonds were formed through a condensation reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the disordered TiO(2) and Si substrate, and the disordered TiO(2) nanoparticles themselves, respectively. This covalent coating approach can steadily hold the active photocatalytic materials on the substrates and provide long-term stability. The binder-free disordered TiO(2) coating film can have a thickness (above 38 μm) with high surface integrity with a strong adhesion force (15.2 N) against the SiO(2) substrate, which leads to the production of a rigid and stable TiO(2) film. This microwave treated TiO(2) coating film showed significant volatile organic compounds degradation abilities under visible light irradiation. The microwave coated selectively reduced TiO(2) realized around 75% acetaldehyde degradation within 12 hours and almost 90% toluene degradation after 9 hours, also retains stable photodegradation performance during the cycling test. Thus, the microwave coating approach allowed the preparation of the binder-free TiO(2) film as a scalable and cost-effective method to manufacture the TiO(2) film that shows an excellent coating quality and strengthens the application as a photocatalyst under severe conditions.","Luo, Yongguang; Wang, Lingling; Hwang, Yosep; Yu, Jianmin; Lee, Jinsun; Liu, Yang; Wang, Hongdan; Kim, Joosung; Song, Hyun Yong; Lee, Hyoyoung",Mater Chem Phys,506,32

METHODS: One hundred five patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled from 11 January to 9 February 2020. Sequential chest HRCT examinations were performed. Five stages were identified from the onset of initial symptoms: 0–3, 4–7, 8–14, 15–21, and >21 days (Stages A–E, respectively). A semi-quantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate the sum of lung abnormalities in each stage. RESULTS: In total, 393 CT scans were collected. The patients underwent 3.8 ± 1.5 CT examinations. Multiple lobes were involved in most cases. The proportion of consolidation and the total CT score gradually increased from Stage A to C and gradually decreased from Stage C to E. The total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stages B and D. The CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A to D.

Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature, including those that report findings on radiographs. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. Because a large portion of figures in COVID-19 articles are not CXR or CT, we designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved deep-learning (DL) performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza, another common infectious respiratory illness that may present similarly to COVID-19, and fine-tuned a baseline deep neural network to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We fine-tuned an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared 15 clinical symptoms and 20 clinical findings of COVID-19 versus those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. Our database is unique, as the figures are retrieved along with relevant text with fine-grained descriptions, and it can be extended easily in the future.

PHEV shares the same genomic organization, replication strategy, and expression of viral proteins as other nidoviruses. PHEV produces vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis, being the only known neurotropic coronavirus affecting pigs. First clinical outbreak was reported in 1957 in Ontario, Canada. Although pigs are the only species susceptible to natural PHEV infections, the virus displays neurotropism in mice and Wistar rats. Clinical disease, morbidity, and mortality is age-dependent and generally reported only in piglets under 4 weeks old. The primary site of replication of PHEV in pigs is the respiratory tract, and it can be further spread to the central nervous system through the peripheral nervous system via different pathways. The diagnosis of PHEV can be made using a combination of direct and indirect detection methods. The virus can be isolated from different tissues within the acute phase of the clinical signs using primary and secondary pig-derived cell lines. PHEV agglutinates the erythrocytes of mice, rats, chickens, and several other animals. PCR-based methods are useful to identify and subsequently isolate animals that are actively shedding the virus. The ability to detect antibodies allows producers to know the status of first-litter gilts and evaluate their risk of tier offspring to infection. PHEV is highly prevalent and circulates subclinically in most swine herds worldwide. PHEV-related disease is not clinically relevant in most of the swine-producing countries, most likely because of dams are immune to PHEV which may confer passive immunity to their offspring. However, PHEV should be considered a major source of economic loss because of the high mortality on farms with high gilt replacement rates, specific pathogen-free animals, and gnotobiotic swine herds. Thus, in the absence of current PHEV vaccines, promoting virus circulation on farms with early exposure to gilts and young sows could induce maternal immunity and prevent disease in piglets.","Mora-Díaz, Juan Carlos; Piñeyro, Pablo Enrique; Houston, Elizabeth; Zimmerman, Jeffrey; Giménez-Lirola, Luis Gabriel",Front Vet Sci,506,30

The high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 and the lack of an approved drug or vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 underscores the urgent need for developing effective antiviral therapies. Therapeutics that target essential viral proteins are effective at controlling virus replication and spread. Coronavirus Spike glycoproteins mediate viral entry and fusion with the host cell, and thus are essential for viral replication. To enter host cells, the Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus, SARS-CoV, bind the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through their receptor binding domains (RBDs). Here, we rationally designed a panel of ACE2-derived peptides based on the RBD-ACE2 binding interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Using SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-pseudotyped viruses, we found that a subset of peptides inhibits Spike-mediated infection with IC(50) values in the low millimolar range. We identified two peptides that bound Spike RBD in affinity precipitation assays and inhibited infection with genuine SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these peptides inhibited the replication of a common cold causing coronavirus, which also uses ACE2 as its entry receptor. Results from the infection experiments and modeling of the peptides with Spike RBD identified a 6-amino-acid (Glu37-Gln42) ACE2 motif that is important for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 with peptide-based inhibitors. These findings will allow for the successful development of engineered peptides and peptidomimetic-based compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.","Larue, Ross C.; Xing, Enming; Kenney, Adam D.; Zhang, Yuexiu; Tuazon, Jasmine A.; Li, Jianrong; Yount, Jacob S.; Li, Pui-Kai; Sharma, Amit",Bioconjug Chem,506,13

METHODS: Cross‐sectional study was conducted among 384 pregnant mothers at southwest Ethiopia from August 1, 2020, to August 15, 2020. Participants were included by consecutive sampling. Quality of life was assessed by short version of WHO quality of life. Social support and fear of COVID‐19 were evaluated by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and fear of COVID‐19 scale (FCoV‐19S), respectively. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 23.0. Frequency and percentage for categorical variables, and mean ± SD for continuous variables were calculated. Independent sample t test and ANOVA were employed to compare the groups of normally distributed variables. Multiple regressions were performed, and Pearson correlation (r) was used to explore the relationships. Statistical significance was declared at p < .05, and 95% CI was calculated. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 31.3 ± 7.7, and 40.4% of them were between the ages of 25–34. The mean scores of participants those living with <5 family members and those living with ≥5 family members were significantly different [t(382) = 3.09, p = .002].

On July 28, the correctional officer had multiple brief encounters with six incarcerated or detained persons (IDPs)* while their SARS-CoV-2 test results were pending. The six asymptomatic IDPs arrived from an out-of-state correctional facility on July 28 and were housed in a quarantine unit. In accordance with Vermont Department of Corrections (VDOC) policy for state prisons, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the six IDPs on their arrival date and tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory, using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On July 29, all six IDPs received positive test results. VDH and VDOC conducted a contact tracing investigation† and used video surveillance footage to determine that the correctional officer did not meet VDH's definition of close contact (i.e., being within 6 feet of infectious persons for ≥15 consecutive minutes)§,¶; therefore, he continued to work. At the end of his shift on August 4, he experienced loss of smell and taste, myalgia, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, headache, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal symptoms; beginning August 5, he stayed home from work. An August 5 nasopharyngeal specimen tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR at a commercial laboratory was reported as positive on August 11; the correctional officer identified two contacts outside of work, neither of whom developed COVID-19. On July 28, seven days preceding his illness onset, the correctional officer had multiple brief exposures to six IDPs who later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; available data suggests that at least one of the asymptomatic IDPs transmitted SARS-CoV-2 during these brief encounters.","Pringle, Julia C.; Leikauskas, Jillian; Ransom-Kelley, Sue; Webster, Benjamin; Santos, Samuel; Fox, Heidi; Marcoux, Shannon; Kelso, Patsy; Kwit, Natalie",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,506,1

The functional ambiguity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), mostly promoting tumor evolution, is a challenging hurdle. This is even more evident in the case of cancer stem cells (CSCs); as active participants in the specialized environment of the cancer stem cell niche, TAMs initiate a reciprocal conversation with CSCs. TAMs contribute to protect CSCs from the hostile environment (exogenous insults, toxic compounds, attacks from the immune cells), and produce several biologically active mediators that modulate crucial developmental pathways that sustain cancer cell stemness. In this review, we have focused our attention on the interaction between TAMs and CSCs; we describe how TAMs impact on CSC biology and, in turn, how CSCs exploit the tissue trophic activity of macrophages to survive and progress. Since CSCs are responsible for therapy resistance and tumor recurrence, they are important therapeutic targets. In view of the recent success in oncology obtained by stimulating the immune system, we discuss some macrophage-targeted therapeutic strategies that may also affect the CSCs and interrupt their malevolent alliance.","Allavena, Paola; Digifico, Elisabeth; Belgiovine, Cristina",Mol Med,506,23

By contrast, avian influenza viruses such as the H5N1 virus that recently emerged in Southeast Asia can cause severe disease when transferred from birds to previously healthy people (“avian influenza”). Most H5N1 patients present with fever, cough and shortness of breath that progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome. In seasonal influenza, viral replication remains confined to the respiratory tract, but limited studies indicate that H5N1 infections are characterized by systemic viral dissemination, high cytokine levels and multiorgan failure. Gastrointestinal infection and encephalitis also occur. The licensed anti-influenza drugs (the M2 ion channel blockers, amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir) are beneficial for uncomplicated seasonal influenza, but appropriate dosing regimens for severe seasonal or H5N1 viral infections have not been defined. Treatment options may be limited by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Ribavirin has also been used to a limited extent to treat influenza. This article reviews approaches to therapy, including licensed drugs and treatments under development, including high-dose oseltamivir; parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitors, peramivir and zanamivir; dimeric forms of zanamivir; the RNA polymerase inhibitor T-705; a ribavirin prodrug, viramidine; polyvalent and monoclonal antibodies; and combination therapies.","Beigel, John; Bray, Mike",Antiviral Research,506,3

In this setting, inpatient and outpatient services had to rethink and reorganize their activities to meet the needs of patients during the “lockdown”. The Italian Association of Myology developed a survey to estimate the impact of these changes on patients affected by neuromuscular disorders and on specialized neuromuscular centers during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We developed an electronic survey that was sent to neuromuscular centers affiliated with the Italian Association of Myology, assessing changes in pharmacological therapies provision, outpatient clinical and instrumental services, support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) and clinical trials. RESULTS: 40% of surveyed neuromuscular centers reported a reduction in outpatient visit and examinations (44.5% of centers in Northern regions; 25% of centers in Central regions; 50% of centers in Southern regions). Twenty-two% of centers postponed in-hospital administration of therapies for neuromuscular diseases (23.4% in Northern regions; 13.0% in Central regions; 20% in Southern regions). Diagnostic and support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) were suspended in 57% of centers (66/43/44% in Northern, Central and Southern centers respectively) Overall, the most affected services were rehabilitative services and on-site outpatient visits, which were suspended in 93% of centers. Strategies adopted by neuromuscular centers to overcome these changes included maintaining urgent on-site visits, addressing patients to available services and promoting remote contact and telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant disruption of clinical and support services for patients with neuromuscular diseases. Despite the efforts to provide telemedicine consults to patients, this option could be promoted and improved further. A close collaboration between the different neuromuscular centers and service providers as well as further implementation of telehealth platforms are necessary to ensure quality care to NMD patients in the near future and in case of recurrent pandemic waves.","Mauri, Eleonora; Abati, Elena; Musumeci, Olimpia; Rodolico, Carmelo; D’Angelo, Maria Grazia; Mirabella, Massimiliano; Lucchini, Matteo; Bello, Luca; Pegoraro, Elena; Maggi, Lorenzo; Manneschi, Letizia; Gemelli, Chiara; Grandis, Marina; Zuppa, Angela; Massucco, Sara; Benedetti, Luana; Caponnetto, Claudia; Schenone, Angelo; Prelle, Alessandro; Previtali, Stefano C.; Scarlato, Marina; D’Amico, Adele; Bertini, Enrico; Pennisi, Elena M.; De Giglio, Laura; Pane, Marika; Mercuri, Eugenio; Mongini, Tiziana; Ricci, Federica; Berardinelli, Angela; Astrea, Guja; Lenzi, Sara; Battini, Roberta; Ricci, Giulia; Torri, Francesca; Siciliano, Gabriele; Santorelli, Filippo M.; Ariatti, Alessandra; Filosto, Massimiliano; Passamano, Luigia; Politano, Luisa; Scutifero, Marianna; Tonin, Paola; Fossati, Barbara; Panicucci, Chiara; Bruno, Claudio; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Monforte, Mauro; Tasca, Giorgio; Ricci, Enzo; Petrucci, Antonio; Santoro, Lucio; Ruggiero, Lucia; Barp, Andrea; Albamonte, Emilio; Sansone, Valeria; Gagliardi, Delia; Costamagna, Gianluca; Govoni, Alessandra; Magri, Francesca; Brusa, Roberta; Velardo, Daniele; Meneri, Megi; Sciacco, Monica; Corti, Stefania; Bresolin, Nereo; Moroni, Isabella; Messina, Sonia; Di Muzio, Antonio; Nigro, Vincenzo; Liguori, Rocco; Antonini, Giovanni; Toscano, Antonio; Minetti, Carlo; Comi, Giacomo Pietro",Acta Myol,506,17

Although much has been learned about the novel coronavirus since its emergence, there are many open questions related to tracking its spread, describing symptomology, predicting the severity of infection, and forecasting healthcare utilization. Free-text clinical notes contain critical information for resolving these questions. Data-driven, automatic information extraction models are needed to use this text-encoded information in large-scale studies. This work presents a new clinical corpus, referred to as the COVID-19 Annotated Clinical Text (CACT) Corpus, which comprises 1,472 notes with detailed annotations characterizing COVID-19 diagnoses, testing, and clinical presentation. We introduce a span-based event extraction model that jointly extracts all annotated phenomena, achieving high performance in identifying COVID-19 and symptom events with associated assertion values (0.83-0.97 F1 for events and 0.73-0.79 F1 for assertions). Our span-based event extraction model outperforms an extractor built on MetaMapLite for the identification of symptoms with assertion values. In a secondary use application, we predicted COVID-19 test results using structured patient data (e.g. vital signs and laboratory results) and automatically extracted symptom information, to explore the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Automatically extracted symptoms improve COVID-19 prediction performance, beyond structured data alone.","Lybarger, Kevin; Ostendorf, Mari; Thompson, Matthew; Yetisgen, Meliha",J Biomed Inform,506,16

Outpatient fever clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003, were upgraded to serve for COVID-19 screening and prevention of disease transmission in large tertiary hospitals in China. FCs were hoped to relieve some of the healthcare burden from emergency departments (EDs). We aimed to evaluate the effect of upgrading the FC system on rates of nosocomial COVID-19 infection and ED patient attendance at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6365 patients were screened in the FC. METHODS: The FC of PUMCH was upgraded on 20 January 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between 12 December 2019 and 29 February 2020. The date when COVID-19 was declared an outbreak in Beijing was 20 January 2020. Two groups of data were collected and subsequently compared with each other: the first group of data was collected within 40 days before 20 January 2020; the second group of data was collected within 40 days after 20 January 2020. All necessary data, including patient baseline information, diagnosis, follow-up conditions and the transfer records between the FC and ED, were collected and analysed. RESULTS: 6365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2912 patients were screened before 21 January 2020, while 3453 were screened afterward. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of patients who were transferred from the FC to the ED decreased significantly (39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001), and patients generally spent more time in the FC (55 vs 203 min, p<0.001), compared with before the outbreak. For critically ill patients waiting for their screening results, the total length of stay in the FC was 22 min before the outbreak, compared with 442 min after the outbreak (p<0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critically ill patients in the FC was 9 out of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 out of 38 after the outbreak (p<0.05). Nineteen cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the FC during the period of this study. However, no other patients nor any healthcare providers were cross-infected. CONCLUSION: The workload of the FC increased significantly after the COVID-19 outbreak. New protocols regarding the use of FC likely helped prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital. The upgraded FC also reduced the burden on the ED.","Wang, Jiangshan; Zong, Liang; Zhang, Jinghong; Sun, Han; Harold Walline, Joseph; Sun, Pengxia; Xu, Shengyong; Li, Yan; Wang, Chunting; Liu, Jihai; Li, Fan; Xu, Jun; Li, Yi; Yu, Xuezhong; Zhu, Huadong",BMJ Open,506,27

Entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein, which is structurally categorized as a class I viral fusion protein, within the same group as influenza virus and HIV. However, S proteins have two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by a much wider range of proteases. The exact location of the CoV fusion peptide (FP) has been disputed. However, most evidence suggests that the domain immediately downstream of the S2′ cleavage site is the FP (amino acids 798–818 SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGFMKQY for SARS-CoV, FP1). In our previous electron spin resonance spectroscopic studies, the membrane-ordering effect of influenza virus, HIV, and Dengue virus FPs has been consistently observed. In this study, we used this effect as a criterion to identify and characterize the bona fide SARS-CoV FP. Our results indicate that both FP1 and the region immediately downstream (amino acids 816–835 KQYGECLGDINARDLICAQKF, FP2) induce significant membrane ordering. Furthermore, their effects are calcium dependent, which is consistent with in vivo data showing that calcium is required for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed a direct interaction between calcium cations and both FPs. This Ca2+-dependency membrane ordering was not observed with influenza FP, indicating that the CoV FP exhibits a mechanistically different behavior. Membrane-ordering effects are greater and penetrate deeper into membranes when FP1 and FP2 act in a concerted manner, suggesting that they form an extended fusion “platform.”","Lai, Alex L.; Millet, Jean K.; Daniel, Susan; Freed, Jack H.; Whittaker, Gary R.",Journal of Molecular Biology,506,1

Mental health can be affected by many factors, including fear of disease transmission, from response measures against the pandemic like social distancing, movement restriction, fear of being in quarantine, loneliness, depression due to isolation, fear of losing work and livelihood and avoiding health care due to fear of being infected. Telephonic befriending intervention by non-specialists will be used to provide social and emotional support to the youth from the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY), an initiative of the Government of India. This study aims to promote mental wellbeing and reduce depressive symptoms by assisting participants to mobilise social support from family, friends and significant others by using the telephonic befriending intervention. METHODS: In this article, we report the design and protocol of a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial. In total, 1440 participants aged 18–35 years who have recently completed their course out of the DDU-GKY initiative will be recruited in the study from 12 project-implementing agencies (PIAs) across six geographical zones of India. Participants from 6 of these agencies will be assigned to the telephonic befriending intervention arm, and the other six agency participants will be assigned to the general enquiry phone call arm (control). The primary outcomes of this study are mental wellbeing, depressive symptoms and perceived social support. Baseline assessments and follow-up assessments will be carried out 1 month following the intervention using WHO-5, PHQ and MSPSS-12 questionnaires. The befriending intervention will be provided by DDU-GKY staff, whom a virtual training programme will train. DISCUSSION: This trial will help assess whether participants who are offered emotional, social and practical support through befriending will experience lesser symptoms of depression and better mental health compared to participants who do not receive this intervention through mobilised social support from friends, family and others.

Methods: A retrospective study included 73 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and treated with ECMO in 21 intensive care units in Hubei, China. Data on demographic information, clinical features, laboratory tests, ECMO durations, complications, and living status were collected. Results: The 73 ECMO-treated patients had a median age of 62 (range 33–78) years and 42 (63.6%) were males. Before ECMO initiation, patients had severe respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation with a median PO(2)/FiO(2) of 71.9 [interquartile range (IQR), 58.6–87.0] mmHg and a median PCO(2) of 62 [IQR, 43–84] mmHg on arterial blood analyses. The median duration from symptom onset to invasive mechanical ventilation, and to ECMO initiation was19 [IQR, 15–25] days, and 23 [IQR, 19–31] days. Before and after ECMO initiation, the proportions of patients receiving prone position ventilation were 58.9 and 69.9%, respectively. The median duration of ECMO support was 18.5 [IQR 12–30] days.

This allows for insights into the likely challenges and support for loss and grief in facing unprecedented disruption and uncertainty. Ultimately, it explores avenues for the priorities to inform better bereavement support. Methods: By examining trusted media data and carefully selected academic literature, we analyse both individual and societal responses to loss and grief in the novel context of the first-wave of COVID-19 in the UK. The discussion relocates the ideas of good and bad deaths in the context of increased social constrains and inequalities. Further, two pairs of contrasting hypotheses are proposed to examine how the UK's first-wave outbreak has shaped policy and practical structures and how these have further impacted experiences of loss and grief both at an individual and collective level. Findings: The discussion captures a mixed picture of loss and grief in the UK, which highlights the importance of timely, holistic, and continuous support both in social policy and care provision. It is found that individuals and collectives express diverse needs in response to deaths and losses as a process of meaning-making. Further, the significance of socio-cultural environments also become evident. These findings highlight community support during the outbreak and further promote a grief literate culture as imperative to support individual and collective needs when confronted with loss and grief. Conclusion: This article provides a timely and comprehensive account of possible challenges and support both for individual and collective experiences of loss and grief at a time of unprecedented social restrictions and mass deaths in the UK. These understandings provide a base from which we advocate the priorities for future research into the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on grief and bereavement.","Fang, Chao; Comery, Alastair",Front Sociol,506,26

Contaminated human fingers can transfer the virus to inanimate objects, which may then spread the virus to susceptible persons. However, no information is available on the survival of NoVs on fomites, which may be of importance in the transmission of NoVs in institutional settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. METHODS: In the absence of any in vitro cultivation system for NoVs, feline calicivirus (FCV) was used as a surrogate. Several fomites such as computer mouse, keyboard keys, telephone wire, telephone receiver, telephone buttons, and brass disks representing faucets and door handle surfaces were artificially contaminated with known amounts of FCV. Samples were taken at regular time intervals, and virus was titrated in feline kidney cells to determine its survival on these surfaces. RESULTS: Survivability of FCV varied with fomite type. The virus survived for up to 3 days on telephone buttons and receivers, for 1 or 2 days on computer mouse, and for 8 to 12 hours on keyboard keys and brass. The time for 90% virus reduction was <4 hours on computer keys, mouse, brass, and telephone wire; 4 to 8 hours on telephone receiver; and 12 to 24 hours on telephone buttons. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that FCV (and perhaps NoV) can survive on fomites such as computers, telephones, and faucets and may be transmitted to humans using these contaminated materials. This may necessitate regular cleaning or disinfection of these items, especially in hospitals and nursing homes and after known outbreaks of NoVs.","Clay, Stefanie; Maherchandani, Sunil; Malik, Yashpal S.; Goyal, Sagar M.",Am J Infect Control,506,15

Case presentation We report an 86-year-old woman in Tripoli, Libya, with no recent travel history. She had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for which she reported noncompliance with treatment. On March 15, 2020, she was diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and her condition did not improve. On March 30, the patient presented to Tripoli University Hospital Emergency Department with a cough, temperature of 39°C, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, a pulse of 110 beats/min, and blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On April 1, 2020, the patient’s status deteriorated and she was diagnosed with acute kidney injury as a complication of sepsis, with a urea level of 240 mg/dL (reference range, 5–50 mg/dL) and creatinine level of 7.69 mg/dL (reference range, 0.4–1.3 mg/dL). The patient was referred for dialysis at Tripoli University Hospital on April 2. However, the patient died despite attempting resuscitation due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome following acute kidney injury. A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were collected, which were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time RT-PCR. Conclusions This case provides an insight into the importance of testing for SARS-CoV-2, in the context of an epidemic, all patient with atypical presentation particularly those with associated HIV infection.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Momen, Ahmed Abdulhakim; Ali Senussi Abdulhadi, Osama Mohamed; Msherghi, Ahmed",New Microbes New Infect,506,24

METHODS: We enrolled four patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit of “M. Bufalini” hospital, Cesena (Italy); after the positioning of an esophageal balloon, we measured mechanical power, respiratory system and transpulmonary parameters and arterial blood gases every 6 hours, just before decubitus change and 1 hour after prono-supination. RESULTS: Both respiratory system and transpulmonary compliance and driving pressure confirmed the pseudo-normal respiratory mechanics of early CoVID-19 pneumonia (respectively, C(RS) 40.8 ml/cmH(2)O and DP(RS) 9.7 cmH(2)O; C(L) 53.1 ml/cmH(2)O and DP(L) 7.9 cmH(2)O). Interestingly, prone positioning involved a worsening in respiratory mechanical properties throughout time (C(RS,SUP) 56.3 ml/cmH(2)O and C(RS,PR) 41.5 ml/cmH(2)O – P 0.37; C(L,SUP) 80.8 ml/cmH(2)O and C(L,PR) 53.2 ml/cmH(2)O – P 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the severe ARDS pattern, respiratory system and lung mechanical properties during CoVID-19 pneumonia are pseudo-normal and tend to worsen during pronation.

Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine-tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3' end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3' end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated. The genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the early identification of mutations in critical regions and to issue recommendations on specific diagnostic tests to ensure the coverage of locally-circulating genetic variants.","Alvarez-Diaz, D.

Guided by the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, it proposes a model for exploring the effects of external stimuli (perceived threat and perceived information overload) related to COVID-19 on consumers’ internal states (sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance) and their subsequent behavioral intentions to avoid health information and engage in preventive behaviors. With a survey sample (N = 721), we empirically examined the proposed model and tested the hypotheses. The results indicate that sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance, which were a result of perceived threat and perceived information overload, had heterogeneous effects on information avoidance. Anxiety and cognitive dissonance increased information avoidance intention, while sadness decreased information avoidance intention. Moreover, information avoidance predicted a reluctance on the part of consumers to engage in preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings not only contribute to the information behavior literature and extend the concept of information avoidance to a public health emergency context, but also yield practical insights for global pandemic control.","Song, Shijie; Yao, Xinlin; Wen, Nainan",Inf Process Manag,506,23

Two hundred units of alpha/beta interferon were administered intranasally to BALB/cByJ mice daily over a five day period. The mice were exposed intranasally to 103 median tissue culture infectious doses of MHV-JHM on the third day of interferon treatment. Two days after virus exposure, the proportion of mice with MHV in nasal turbinates was reduced from 10 of 10 in the untreated group to 7 of 10 in the interferon-treated group, and mean titers in virus-containing noses were lower in the interferon-treated group. Five days after virus exposure, the proportion of mice with infectious virus in the brain was significantly lower in the interferon-treated group (1 of 10 mice) than in the untreated group (10 of 10 mice). Systemic infection, as measured by presence and concentration of virus in the spleen, was not affected by intranasal interferon treatment. These results suggest that intranasally administered interferon protects against local extension of MHV-JHM from nose to brain, but not against dissemination of virus to other organs, such as the spleen.","Smith, Abigail L.; Barthold, Stephen W.; Beck, Deborah S.",Antiviral Research,506,5

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important second messenger acting via two intracellular signaling molecules: protein kinase A (PKA) and the guanidine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac. We sought to investigate effects of increased cAMP level on the disruption of model airway epithelial barrier caused by RSV infection and the molecular mechanisms underlying cAMP actions. Human bronchial epithelial cells were infected with RSV-A2 and treated with either cAMP releasing agent, forskolin, or cAMP analogs. Structure and functions of the Apical Junctional Complex (AJC) were evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and permeability to FITC-dextran, and determining localization of AJC proteins by confocal microscopy. Increased intracellular cAMP level significantly attenuated RSV-induced disassembly of AJC. These barrier-protective effects of cAMP were due to the activation of PKA signaling and did not involve Epac activity. Increased cAMP level reduced RSV-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, including apical accumulation of an essential actin-binding protein, cortactin, and inhibited expression of the RSV F protein. These barrier-protective and antiviral-function of cAMP signaling were evident even when cAMP level was increased after the onset of RSV infection. Taken together, our study demonstrates that cAMP/PKA signaling attenuated RSV-induced disruption of structure and functions of the model airway epithelial barrier by mechanisms involving the stabilization of epithelial junctions and inhibition of viral biogenesis. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms involved in RSV-induced epithelial dysfunction and viral pathogenesis will help to develop novel anti-viral therapeutic approaches.","Rezaee, Fariba; Harford, Terri J.; Linfield, Debra T.; Altawallbeh, Ghaith; Midura, Ronald J.; Ivanov, Andrei I.; Piedimonte, Giovanni",PLoS One,506,20

However, there is minimal research conducted on it, particularly in the context of leadership. The current study aims to fill this important gap by identifying critical factors that can enhance the psychological well-being of healthcare workers. We proposed that safety specific transformational leadership enhances psychological well-being among healthcare workers, and COVID-19 perceived risk mediates this relationship. Furthermore, the safety conscientiousness of healthcare workers was proposed to be a boundary condition that enhances the negative relationship between safety-specific transformational leadership and COVID-19 perceived risk. Data were collected from healthcare workers (N = 232) treating COVID-19 patients in the hospitals of Pakistan through well-established adopted questionnaires. The discriminant and convergent validity of the data was tested through confirmatory factor analysis by using AMOS statistical package. The mediation and moderation hypotheses were tested by using PROCESS Macro by Hayes. The results showed that safety specific transformational leadership enhances psychological well-being among healthcare workers, and COVID-19 perceived risk mediates this relationship. Moderation results also confirmed that safety conscientiousness moderates the relationship between safety specific transformational leadership and COVID-19 perceived risk.

The Carnivora, like mink, carry many zoonoses, yet how diversity in host immune genes across species affect pathogen carriage is poorly understood. Here, we describe a progressive evolutionary downregulation of pathogen-sensing inflammasome pathways in Carnivora. This includes the loss of nucleotide-oligomerization domain leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), acquisition of a unique caspase-1/-4 effector fusion protein that processes gasdermin D pore formation without inducing rapid lytic cell death, and the formation of a caspase-8 containing inflammasome that inefficiently processes interleukin-1β. Inflammasomes regulate gut immunity, but the carnivorous diet has antimicrobial properties that could compensate for the loss of these immune pathways. We speculate that the consequences of systemic inflammasome downregulation, however, can impair host sensing of specific pathogens such that they can reside undetected in the Carnivora.","Digby, Zsofi; Tourlomousis, Panagiotis; Rooney, James; Boyle, Joseph P.; Bibo-Verdugo, Betsaida; Pickering, Robert J.; Webster, Steven J.; Monie, Thomas P.; Hopkins, Lee J.; Kayagaki, Nobuhiko; Salvesen, Guy S.; Warming, Soren; Weinert, Lucy; Bryant, Clare E.",Cell Rep,506,22

It is now believed that an immune mechanism rather than direct viral neuroinvasion is responsible for neurological symptoms. For this reason, it is important to assess the presence of antibodies not only in the serum but also in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), especially in the case of neuro-COVID.

Despite treatment being in line with current guidelines, mortality remains high in those with septic shock. Intravenous immunoglobulins represent a promising therapy to modulate both the pro- and anti-inflammatory processes and can contribute to the elimination of pathogens. In this context, there is evidence of the benefits of immunoglobulin M (IgM)- and immunoglobulin A (IgA)-enriched immunoglobulin therapy for sepsis. This manuscript aims to summarize current relevant data to provide expert opinions on best practice for the use of an IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin) in adult patients with sepsis. MAIN TEXT: Sepsis patients with hyperinflammation and patients with immunosuppression may benefit most from treatment with IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulin (Pentaglobin). Patients with hyperinflammation present with phenotypes that manifest throughout the body, whilst the clinical characteristics of immunosuppression are less clear. Potential biomarkers for hyperinflammation include elevated procalcitonin, interleukin-6, endotoxin activity and C-reactive protein, although thresholds for these are not well-defined. Convenient biomarkers for identifying patients in a stage of immune-paralysis are still matter of debate, though human leukocyte antigen–antigen D related expression on monocytes, lymphocyte count and viral reactivation have been proposed. The timing of treatment is potentially more critical for treatment efficacy in patients with hyperinflammation compared with patients who are in an immunosuppressed stage. Due to the lack of evidence, definitive dosage recommendations for either population cannot be made, though we suggest that patients with hyperinflammation should receive an initial bolus at a rate of up to 0.6 mL (30 mg)/kg/h for 6 h followed by a continuous maintenance rate of 0.2 mL (10 mg)/kg/hour for ≥ 72 h (total dose ≥ 0.9 g/kg). For immunosuppressed patients, dosage is more conservative (0.2 mL [10 mg]/kg/h) for ≥ 72 h, without an initial bolus (total dose ≥ 0.72 g/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Two distinct populations that may benefit most from Pentaglobin therapy are described in this review. However, further clinical evidence is required to strengthen support for the recommendations given here regarding timing, duration and dosage of treatment.","Nierhaus, Axel; Berlot, Giorgio; Kindgen-Milles, Detlef; Müller, Eckhard; Girardis, Massimo",Ann Intensive Care,506,1

We sent an online survey to metabolism providers internationally to investigate triage differences of abnormal NBS results during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey compared personal practice for the periods of March–June 2019 and March–June 2020. Responses were received from 44 providers practicing in 8 countries. Nearly all (93%) practiced in areas of widespread SARS-COV-2 community transmission during spring 2020. There was a significant expansion of telemedicine use for NBS referrals at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (OR: 12, 95% CI: 3.66–39.3, p < 0.0001). Telehealth primarily replaced in-person ambulatory metabolism visits. The increased frequency of virtual care was similar across NBS analytes. Providers found telehealth for NBS referral equally efficacious to in-person care. Institutional patient surveys showed no difference in satisfaction with provider communication, provider empathy, or appointment logistics. Our survey was limited by unprecedented disruption in healthcare delivery, necessitating further validation of telegenetics for NBS in the post-pandemic era. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that telemedicine is potentially a viable and practical tool for triaging abnormal NBS results.","Gold, Jessica I.; Campbell, Ian M.; Ficicioglu, Can",Int J Neonatal Screen,506,30

The main outcome was death. Excess deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated. RESULT: There were 13,505 excess deaths. Mortality increased by 43% (SMR: 1.43). The mortality excess was higher among males than females (SMR: 1.51 and 1.38) and decreased with increasing age (SMRs in females: 1.61 in the 60–74 age group, 1.58 for 75–84, 1.41 for 85–94 and 1.31 for 95 or over; males: SMRs: 1.59 for 60–74, 1.69 for 75–84, 1.47 for 85–94 and 1.41 for 95 or over).

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study of children ≤22 years of age who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at a community-based specimen collection site in Washington, DC affiliated with a large children’s hospital between March 21 and May 16, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1445 patients tested at the specimen collection site for SARS-CoV-2 virus, 408 (28.2%) had a positive PCR test. The daily positivity rate increased over the study period, from 5.4% during the first week to a peak of 47.4%. (P-trend <0.001). Patients with fever (aOR: 1.7; 95% CI 1.3, 2.3) or cough (aOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1, 1.9) and those with known contact with someone with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (aOR: 1.6; 95% CI 1.0, 2.4.) were more likely have a positive test, but these features were not-highly discriminating. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of mildly symptomatic or well children and adolescents referred to a community drive-through/walk-up SARS-CoV-2 testing site because of risk of exposure or clinical illness, one in four patients had a positive test. Children and young adults represent a considerable burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Les patients souffrant d’un lupus systémique (LS) ont des facteurs de risque de développer des formes sévères de COVID-19 en raison des comorbidités fréquemment associées au LS (insuffisance rénale chronique, syndrome métabolique notamment) et des traitements corticoïdes et immunosuppresseurs. Jusqu’à présent, l’analyse des facteurs de risque de développer une COVID-19 sévère au cours du LS a été biaisée par le mode de recrutement des patients, puisque seuls les malades les plus symptomatiques ont été inclus dans les études. Nous avons réalisé une étude observationnelle de la COVID-19 chez les patients suivis pour un LS en incluant les malades asymptomatiques ou paucisymptomatiques dans le but d’analyser les facteurs associés à une forme grave de cette maladie. Matériels et méthodes Les cas étaient recrutés de 3 façons différentes : déclarations spontanées au niveau local et au niveau national par les malades ou les médecins concernés ; déclaration à la cohorte french RMD COVID-19 (étude ancillaire organisée sous l’égide de la filière FAI2R) et dépistage par sérologie SARS-CoV-2 des malades avec lupus vus en consultation. Pour être inclus, les patients devaient remplir les critères de classification de lupus systémique de 1997 de l’ACR et/ou les critères actualisés de 2019 de l’EULAR/ACR et devaient avoir une infection à SARS-CoV-2 prouvée biologiquement par RT-PCR naso-pharyngée ou par sérologie sanguine. Les malades asymptomatiques ou paucisymptomatiques étaient recrutés au cours des consultations de suivi habituelles du LS. Résultats 109 patients (dont 89 % de femmes) ont été inclus entre le 1er mars 2020 et le 31 décembre 2020. L’âge médian (Q1, Q3) des cas était de 40 ans (33-56). Le score médian de séquelle (SLICC damage index) était de 0 (0-2). Les principales comorbidités étaient le surpoids (22 %), l’obésité (25 %), l’hypertension artérielle (22 %) et une maladie rénale chronique (21 %). 7 % étaient fumeurs actifs. 42 % avaient un antécédent de néphropathie lupique. 87 % étaient traités par hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), 63 % par corticoïde à la posologie moyenne de 8mg/j (IC 95 % [6 ; 10]) et 34 % par immunosuppresseur. Au moment de l’infection, 26 % rapportaient des signes d’activité clinique du LS, 51 % avaient une élévation des anticorps anti ADN double brin et 19 % une baisse du C3. Lors de la survenue de la COVID-19, L’HCQ, le corticoïde et l’immunosuppresseur étaient maintenus respectivement dans 92 %, 93 % et 79 % des cas. 9 patients (8 %) ont eu une infection asymptomatique par le SARS-CoV-2. La COVID-19 s’est manifestée pour 40 patients (40 %) par une simple infection des voies aériennes supérieures, pour 31 (29 %) par une bronchite et pour 32 (30 %) par une pneumonie. 29 patients (26 %) ont été hospitalisés, 22 (21 %) ont nécessité une oxygénothérapie, 12 (12 %) ont été transférés en unité de soins intensifs (USI), 9 (8 %) ont développé un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë et 4 (4 %) sont décédés. En analyses multivariées par régression logistique, les deux seuls facteurs associés au recours à une oxygénothérapie étaient l’âge (p =0,047) et l’obésité (p =0,02). Le seul facteur associé à une admission en USI était l’âge (p= 0,01). Les corticoïdes, les immunosuppresseurs et l’antécédent de néphropathie lupique n’étaient pas indépendamment associés au risque de développer une forme nécessitant le recours à l’oxygénothérapie ou une hospitalisation en USI. Conclusion La consultation médicale de surveillance au cours du LS a permis d’inclure un grand nombre de malade paucisymptomatique ou asymptomatique habituellement non étudiés dans ce type de travail. Cette série fournit des éléments rassurants quant aux facteurs de risque propres au LS de développer une forme grave de COVID-19. Ces facteurs de risque ne semblent en effet pas différents de ceux de la population générale, à savoir l’âge et l’obésité. Une maladie rénale chronique, une néphropathie lupique, un traitement par corticoïde et immunosuppresseur ne sont pas, dans cette cohorte, des facteurs indépendamment associés à une forme sévère de la maladie.","Cariou, P.

As advancements in technology occur, more people these days are using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Due to the increase in social media's popularity, the types of behaviors are now easier to group and study as this is important to know the behavior of users via social networking in order to analyze similarities of certain behavior types and this can be used to predict what they post as well as what they comment, share, and like on social networking sites. However, very few review studies have undertaken grouping according to similarities and differences to predict the personality and behavior of individuals with the help of social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to collect data from previous researches and to analyze the methods they have used. This chapter reviewed 30 research studies on the topic of behavioral analysis using the social media from 2015 to 2017. This research is based on the method of previous publications and analyzed the results, limitations, and number of users to draw conclusions. Our results indicated that the percentage of completed research on the Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram show that 50% of the studies were done on Twitter, 27% on Facebook, and 23% on Instagram. Twitter seems to be more popular and recent than the other two spheres as there are more studies on it. Further, we extracted the studies based on the year and graphs in 2015 which indicated that more research has been done on Facebook to analyze the behavior of users and the trends are decreasing in the following year. However, more studies have been done on Twitter in 2016 than any other social media. The results also show the classifications based on different methods to analyze individual behavior. However, most of the studies have been done on Twitter, as it is more popular and newer than Facebook and Instagram particularly from 2015 to 2017, and more research needs to be done on other social media spheres in order to analyze the trending behaviors of users. This study should be useful to obtain knowledge about the methods used to analyze user behavior with description, limitations, and results. Although some researchers collect demographic information on users’ gender on Facebook, others on Twitter do not. This lack of demographic data, which is typically available in more traditional sources such as surveys, has created a new focus on developing methods to work out these traits as a means of expanding Big Data research.","Singh, Amandeep; Halgamuge, Malka N.; Moses, Beulah",Social Network Analytics,506,2

It allows developing indices and ranking alternatives, based on multiple combinations of normalization methods and aggregation functions. Given the steadily increasing importance of accounting for multiple preferences of the decision-makers and assessing the robustness of the decision recommendations, this tool is a timely instrument that can be used primarily by non-multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) experts to dynamically shape and evaluate their indices. The MCDA Index Tool allows the user to (i) input a dataset directly from spreadsheets with alternatives and indicators performance, (ii) build multiple indices by choosing several normalization methods and aggregation functions, and (iii) visualize and compare the indices’ scores and rankings to assess the robustness of the results. A novel perspective on uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of preference models offers operational solutions to assess the influence of different strategies to develop indices and visualize their results. A case study for the assessment of the energy security and sustainability implications of different global energy scenarios is used to illustrate the application of the MCDA Index Tool. Analysts have now access to an index development tool that supports constructive and dynamic evaluation of the stability of rankings driven by a single score while including multiple decision-makers’ and stakeholders’ preferences.

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs is invasive and is associated with exposure risk, high cost, and supply-chain constraints. Additionally, the RNA extraction in the analytical stage is the most significant rate-limiting step in the entire testing process. To alleviate these limitations, we developed a universal saliva processing protocol (SalivaSTAT) that would enable an extraction free RT-PCR test using any of the commercially available RT-PCR kits. Methods: We optimized saliva collection devices, heat-shock treatment and homogenization. The effect of homogenization on saliva samples for extraction-free RT-PCR assay was determined by evaluating samples with and without homogenization and preforming viscosity measurements. Saliva samples (872) previously tested using the FDA-EUA method were reevaluated with the optimized SalivaSTAT protocol using two widely available commercial RT-PCR kits. Further, a five-sample pooling strategy was evaluated as per FDA guidelines using the SalivaSTAT protocol. Results: The saliva collection (done without any media) performed comparable to the FDA-EUA method. The SalivaSTAT protocol was optimized by incubating saliva samples at 95C for 30-minutes and homogenization, followed by RT-PCR assay. The clinical sample evaluation of 630 saliva samples using the SalivaSTAT protocol with PerkinElmer (600-samples) and CDC (30-samples) RT-PCR assay achieved positive (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 95.8% and 100%, respectively. The LoD was established as ~20-60 copies/ml by absolute quantification. Further, a five-sample pooling evaluation using 250 saliva samples achieved a PPA and NPA of 92% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: We have optimized an extraction-free direct RT-PCR assay for saliva samples that demonstrated comparable performance to FDA-EUA assay (Extraction and RT-PCR). The SalivaSTAT protocol is a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method that can be adopted globally, and has the potential to meet testing needs and may play a significant role in management of the current pandemic.","Sahajpal, N.

Our hypothesis is that the virtual PFC increases diversity internationally and within the United States. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive comparison was performed between participants from the in-person PFC from the years 2017 to 2019 and virtual PFC in 2020. Frequency maps were generated to determine differences in participation of cultures, sexes, education, and specialties internationally and within the United States. Net Promoter Scores (NPSs) were used to assess participant satisfaction with the virtual course. RESULTS: The in-person PFC included 124 participants from the years 2017 to 2019, whereas the virtual PFC included 770 participants in the year 2020. Compared to the in-person course, the virtual course included more cultures (countries: 60 versus 11; states: 35 versus 22), women (countries: 38 versus 7; states: 23 versus 9), students/researchers (countries: 24 versus 0; states: 9 versus 0), residents (countries: 44 versus 5; states: 26 versus 15), fellows (countries: 21 versus 2; states: 21 versus 9), attendings (countries: 34 versus 8; states: 16 versus 11), plastic surgery (countries: 54 versus 9; states: 31 versus 18), orthopedic surgery (countries: 12 versus 5; states: 11 versus 9), and other specialties (countries: 19 versus 1; states: 8 versus 2).

Therefore, an integrated care approach is required to address weight-related issues and improve children’s health, societal participation and quality of life. Conducting a psychosocial and lifestyle assessment is an essential part of an integrated care approach. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences, needs and wishes of healthcare professionals with respect to carrying out a psychosocial and lifestyle assessment of childhood obesity. METHODS: Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with Dutch healthcare professionals, who are responsible for coordinating the support and care for children with obesity (coordinating professionals, ‘CPs’). The following topics were addressed in our interviews with these professionals: CPs’ experiences of both using childhood obesity assessment tools and their content, and CPs’ needs and wishes related to content, circumstances and required competences. The interviews comprised open-ended questions and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data was analysed using template analyses and complemented with open coding in MAXQDA. RESULTS: Most CPs experienced both developing a trusting relationship with the children and their parents, as well as establishing the right tone when engaging in weight-related conversations as important. CPs indicated that visual materials were helpful in such conversations. All CPs used a supporting assessment tool to conduct the psychosocial and lifestyle assessment but they also indicated that a more optimal tool was desirable. They recognized the need for specific attributes that helped them to carry out these assessments, namely: sufficient knowledge about the complexity of obesity; having an affinity with obesity-related issues; their experience as a CP; using conversational techniques, such as solution-focused counselling and motivational interviewing; peer-to-peer coaching; and finally, maintaining an open-minded, non-stigmatizing stance and harmonizing their attitude with that of the child and their parents. CONCLUSIONS: Alongside the need for a suitable tool for conducting a psychosocial and lifestyle assessment, CPs expressed the need for requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes. Further developing a supporting assessment tool is necessary in order to facilitate CPs and thereby improve the support and care for children with obesity and their families.

KAA-2 bound exclusively to high mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans such as complex type, hybrid type, or the pentasaccharide core of N-glycans. This lectin exhibited a preference for an exposed α1–3 Man on a D2 arm in a similar manner to Eucheuma serra agglutinin (ESA-2), which shows various biological activities, such as anti-HIV and anti-carcinogenic activity. We tested the anti-influenza virus activity of KAA-2 against various strains including the recent pandemic H1N1-2009 influenza virus. KAA-2 inhibited infection of various influenza strains with EC(50)s of low nanomolar levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-influenza antibody demonstrated that the antiviral activity of KAA-2 was exerted by interference with virus entry into host cells. This mechanism was further confirmed by the evidence of direct binding of KAA-2 to a viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA), using an ELISA assay. These results indicate that this lectin would be useful as a novel antiviral reagent for the prevention of infection.","Sato, Yuichiro; Morimoto, Kinjiro; Hirayama, Makoto; Hori, Kanji",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,506,11

Although the precise mechanism of modulation is still under investigation, several reports associate the interaction of TLR2 with components of the bacterial cell wall inducing a signaling cascade that culminates with the production of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators of immune responses, including those toward probiotics. In this study, we analyzed the miRNA expression profile in swine monocytes exposed to Bb12 by using an anti-TLR2 blocking strategy and Bb12 involvement in the regulation of the TLR2 pathway. As a result, the expression of 40 miRNAs was influenced by the treatments (p < 0.01), and 15 differentially expressed miRNAs with validated miRNA–mRNA interactions with around 26 proteins related to the TLR2 pathway were identified. The miRNAs upregulated in response to Bb12 included miR-15a-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-30d-5p, and the following showed downregulation: miR-181a-5p, miR-19b-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-23a-5p, and miR-221-3p. The expression of let-7c-5p, let-7f-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-155-5p was increased by Bb12 only when TLR2 was blocked. The identified miRNA common targets were downstream proteins from bacterial recognition via TLR2, such as MyD88, TRAF6, and MAPK members; transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1; and cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. TLR2 participation was abrogated by anti-TLR2 antibody and suggests that bacterial recognition is complemented by other receptors since there were still changes in the microtranscriptome.

METHOD: We conducted an observational study in Beijing Ditan Hospital, China. Specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and sputum from confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected for RT-PCR testing. Disease duration was calculated from the date of symptom onset to the date of specimens’ collection and divided into three groups: ≤14days, 14-21days, and >21days. We compared positive rates across three specimens collected in different disease duration. The kappa coefficient (KC) was used to evaluate consistency of RT-PCR results between different specimens. RESULTS: A total of 291 specimens were collected and tested from 43 confirmed patients. Among specimens collected in disease duration of ≤ 14days, the positive rate was highest in sputum (79.2%), and significantly higher than that in nasopharyngeal swabs (37.5%, p=0.003) and oropharyngeal swabs (20.8%, p&0.001). Similar findings were observed in disease duration of 14-21days and >21days. The consistency of testing results between nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs was low in disease duration of ≤14days and >21days. The consistency between the sputum and oropharyngeal swabs, and between the sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were very low across all three disease durations with statistical significance.

If sputum was not feasible, a nasopharyngeal swab could be recommended for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and early testing is needed.","Zhang, Haixia; Chen, Meiling; Zhang, Yanhua; Wen, Jing; Wang, Yajie; Wang, Liming; Guo, Jinjin; Liu, Chen; Li, Daijing; Wang, Ying; Bai, Jing; Gao, Guiju; Wang, Sa; Yang, Di; Yu, Fengting; Yan, Liting; Wan, Gang; Zhang, Fujie",Open Forum Infect Dis,506,16

METHODS: A rapid point-of-care test for specific IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 was offered to all workers (SD Biosensor STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Duo and STANDARD Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Combo). Testing was performed and a questionnaire was completed by 4592 workers on a voluntary basis from 21 May to 31 July 2020. We computed the apparent IgM, IgG, and combined IgM or IgG prevalence, along with the true prevalence and 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) using Bayesian inference. RESULTS: We found an apparent prevalence of 3.1% for IgM, 1.0% for IgG and 3.9% for either. The estimated true prevalence was 2.0% (95% CrI 0.1% to 4.3%) for IgM, 0.6% (95% CrI 0.0% to 1.3%) for IgG, and 2.5% (95% CrI 0.1% to 5.3%) for IgM or IgG. A SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis was reported by 21 (0.5%) workers; and of these, 90.5% had a reactive IgG result. Seroprevalence was higher among those reporting contacts with confirmed cases, having been quarantined, having a previous molecular negative test or having had symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence among workers from the three public higher education institutions of Porto after the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar to national estimates for the same age working population. However, the estimated true seroprevalence was approximately five times higher than the reported SARS-CoV-2 infection based on a molecular test.","Meireles, Paula; Amaro, Joana; Pinto da Costa, Joana; Lopes, Mariana Mendes; Varandas, Tatiana; Norton, Pedro; Guimarães, João Tiago; Severo, Milton; Barros, Henrique",Occup Environ Med,506,1

We investigated the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection among young adults seropositive for a previous infection. METHODS: This analysis was performed as part of the prospective COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines study (CHARM). CHARM included predominantly male US Marine recruits, aged 18–20 years, following a 2-week unsupervised quarantine at home. After the home quarantine period, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised 2-week quarantine facility (college campus or hotel), participants were enrolled and were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, defined as a dilution of 1:150 or more on receptor-binding domain and full-length spike protein ELISA. Participants also completed a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, risk factors, reporting of 14 specific COVID-19-related symptoms or any other unspecified symptom, and brief medical history. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by PCR at weeks 0, 1, and 2 of quarantine and participants completed a follow-up questionnaire, which included questions about the same COVID-19-related symptoms since the last study visit. Participants were excluded at this stage if they had a positive PCR test during quarantine. Participants who had three negative swab PCR results during quarantine and a baseline serum serology test at the beginning of the supervised quarantine that identified them as seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 then went on to basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot—Parris Island. Three PCR tests were done at weeks 2, 4, and 6 in both seropositive and seronegative groups, along with the follow-up symptom questionnaire and baseline neutralising antibody titres on all subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive uninfected participants (prospective study period). FINDINGS: Between May 11, 2020, and Nov 2, 2020, we enrolled 3249 participants, of whom 3168 (98%) continued into the 2-week quarantine period. 3076 (95%) participants, 2825 (92%) of whom were men, were then followed up during the prospective study period after quarantine for 6 weeks. Among 189 seropositive participants, 19 (10%) had at least one positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the 6-week follow-up (1·1 cases per person-year). In contrast, 1079 (48%) of 2247 seronegative participants tested positive (6·2 cases per person-year). The incidence rate ratio was 0·18 (95% CI 0·11–0·28; p<0·001). Among seropositive recruits, infection was more likely with lower baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres than in those with higher baseline full-length spike protein IgG titres (hazard ratio 0·45 [95% CI 0·32–0·65]; p<0·001). Infected seropositive participants had viral loads that were about 10-times lower than those of infected seronegative participants (ORF1ab gene cycle threshold difference 3·95 [95% CI 1·23–6·67]; p=0·004). Among seropositive participants, baseline neutralising titres were detected in 45 (83%) of 54 uninfected and in six (32%) of 19 infected participants during the 6 weeks of observation (ID50 difference p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Seropositive young adults had about one-fifth the risk of subsequent infection compared with seronegative individuals. Although antibodies induced by initial infection are largely protective, they do not guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation activity or immunity against subsequent infection. These findings might be relevant for optimisation of mass vaccination strategies.

Whether administering systematic anticoagulant therapy is beneficial remains unclear. We report our experience using systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin to treat severe COVID‐19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective historical control study of severe COVID‐19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation who received prophylactic‐dose anticoagulation (April 1–May 25) or therapeutic‐dose anticoagulation (May 26–August 31) in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary emergency critical care medical center in Japan. The primary endpoints were in‐hospital mortality and anticoagulation therapy‐related adverse events. The secondary endpoints included thromboembolic events, administration of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), ventilator‐free days (VFDs), ICU‐free days, and the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 29 and 33 patients were in the prophylactic‐dose and therapeutic‐dose groups, respectively. Background characteristics between the groups were not significantly different, although the therapeutic‐dose group had a significantly lower in‐hospital mortality rate [5 (17.2%) patients versus 0 (0.0%) patients; P = 0.033] and longer ICU‐free days (median [interquartile range]: 15 days [13–18] versus 5 days [0–13]; P = 0.008). Hemorrhagic‐events did not occur during the study period. Compared with the prophylactic‐dose group, the therapeutic‐dose group tended to have longer VFDs, was not treated with ECMO, and did not experience thromboembolic events and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome; however, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic‐dose anticoagulation may be beneficial for patients with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.","Takayama, Wataru; Endo, Akira; Otomo, Yasuhiro",Acute Med Surg,506,3

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). No qualitative assessment has yet described the physical and mental health conditions of frontline medical personnel in the COVID-19 outbreaks. Methods: Here, 251 frontline medical personnel involved in COVID-19 missions completed electronic questionnaires, consisting of 31 categorical variables related to their physical and mental health status, medical history and environmental conditions. We constructed a correlation amongst these variables through pairwise Kendall rank correlation coefficient test. Then, clusters of highly correlated variables were identified using the leading eigenvector. Finally, we used the network and clusters to clarify the correlations amongst variables. Results: This qualitative study identified the six clusters. Cluster 1 was characterized by skin allergy. Cluster 2 was predominantly associated with anxiety. Cluster 3 consisted mostly of respiratory symptoms. The participants in cluster 4 had medical history. Cluster 5 and cluster 6 were characterized by disinfection and demography, respectively. Finally, we revealed three major findings. First, more than 80% of medical personnel worry about COVID-19-related infection and experience newly appearing anxiety (56.2%), airway or heart symptoms (34.3%) and skin allergies (20.3%). Second, COVID-19-related worry significantly associates with all variables in the anxiety and respiratory symptom clusters. Third, new-onset skin allergies did not associate with either disinfection or anxiety, but did associate with a previous history of allergies. Conclusions: COVID-19-related worry leads to physical and mental health problems amongst medical personnel. Effective responses and interventions could relieve a series of new-onset physical and mental health problems.","Gao, Jing; Li, Jing; Han, Xia; Yuan, Yuan; Li, Chuan-Xing; Zhang, Dong-Quan",Int J Med Sci,506,16

Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential for monitoring and delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the pandemic’s consequences. People who do not know that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, risk infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that conduct throat swabs and communicate the results. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to reduce the communication burden for health care professionals. We developed a secure and easy-to-use tracking system to report COVID-19 test results online that is simple to understand for the tested subjects as soon as these results become available. Instead of personal calls, the system updates the status and the results of the tests automatically. This aims to reduce the delay when informing testees about their results and, consequently, to slow down the virus spread. METHODS: The application in this study draws on an existing tracking tool. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person and the testing units (eg, hospitals or the public health care system). The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. RESULTS: The test statuses and results are published on a secured webpage, enabling regular status checks by patients; status checks are performed without the use of smartphones, which has some importance, as smartphone usage diminishes with age. Stress tests and statistics show the performance of our software. CTest is currently running at two university hospitals in Germany—University Hospital Ulm and University Hospital Tübingen—with thousands of tests being performed each week. Results show a mean number of 10 (SD 2.8) views per testee. CONCLUSIONS: CTest runs independently of existing infrastructures, aims at straightforward integration, and aims for the safe transmission of information. The system is easy to use for testees. QR (Quick Response) code links allow for quick access to the test results. The mean number of views per entry indicates a reduced amount of time for both health care professionals and testees. The system is quite generic and can be extended and adapted to other communication tasks.","Völkel, Gunnar; Fürstberger, Axel; Schwab, Julian D; Werle, Silke D; Ikonomi, Nensi; Gscheidmeier, Thomas; Kraus, Johann M; Groß, Alexander; Holderried, Martin; Balig, Julien; Jobst, Franz; Kuhn, Peter; Kuhn, Klaus A; Kohlbacher, Oliver; Kaisers, Udo X; Seufferlein, Thomas; Kestler, Hans A",J Med Internet Res,506,26

Currently, the virus has infected more than 50 million people worldwide and more than half a million in Chile. For many coronaviruses, Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins are described as major antigenic molecules, inducing seroconversion and production of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we evaluated the presence in serum of IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using western blot, and developed an ELISA test for the qualitative characterization of COVID-19 patients. Patients with an active infection or who have recovered from COVID-19 showed specific immunoblotting patterns for the recombinants S protein and its domains S1 and S2, as well as for the N protein of SARS-CoV-2. Anti-N antibodies were more frequently detected than anti-S or anti-S1-RBD antibodies. People who were never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 did not show reactivity. Finally, indirect ELISA assays using N and S1-RBD proteins, alone or in combination, were established with variable sensitivity and specificity depending on the antigen bound to the solid phase. Overall, Spike showed higher specificity than the nucleocapsid, and comparable sensitivity for both antigens. Both approaches confirmed the seroconversion after infection and allowed us to implement the analysis of antibodies in blood for research purposes in a local facility.","Cereceda, K.; González-Stegmaier, R.; Briones, JL.; Selman, C.; Aguirre, A.; Valenzuela-Nieto, G.; Caglevic, C.; Gazitua, R.; Rojas-Fernandez, A.; Villarroel-Espíndola, F.",bioRxiv,506,20

We isolated B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein spike (S) from a COVID-19-infected subject twenty-one days after the onset of clinical disease. Forty-five S-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated. They had undergone minimal somatic mutation, with limited clonal expansion and three bound the receptor binding domain (RBD). Two antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2. The most potent antibody bound the RBD and prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Thus, most anti-S antibodies that were generated in this patient during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection were non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive and/or therapeutic potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design.","Seydoux, Emilie; Homad, Leah J.; MacCamy, Anna J.; Parks, K.

Additionally, these viruses have been serially passaged in cell culture, which may result in adaptations that affect virus–host interactions. We have isolated RSV from mucosal secretions of 12 patients in the winters 2016–2017 and 2017–2018, of which eight RSV-A subtypes and four RSV-B subtypes. Passage 3 of the isolates was assessed for viral replication kinetics and infectious virus production in HEp-2, A549 and BEAS-2B cells, thermal stability at 37 °C, 32 °C and 4 °C, syncytia formation, neutralization by palivizumab and mucin mRNA expression in infected A549 cells.

Hence, here we evaluated the efficacy of administration of a probiotic compound containing Bacillus mesentericus, Clostridium butyricum, and Enterococcus faecalis together with a commercial live-attenuated PED vaccine (Nisseiken PED Live Vaccine, Nisseiken, Tokyo, Japan) to improve the health and reproductive performance of PED-infected sows. Twenty pregnant sows in a PED-positive farm were equally divided into probiotics-administered (VP) and control (VC) sow groups. A commercial live-attenuated vaccine was injected as per the manufacturer’s instruction. The probiotic compound (15 g/day) was orally administered to VP from 6 weeks pre-parturition to 7 days post-parturition (ppd7). VP had a significantly higher body weight at ppd7 than VC (191 vs 186 kg; P < 0.05). At day 3 post-parturition (ppd3) (4.18 vs 3.63 kg/day) and ppd7 (5.14 vs 4.34 kg/day), milk produced by VP was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than that by VC. Total immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG concentrations at day 0 were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in whey of VP (1.9 and 6.6 g/dL, respectively) than in that of VC (1.7 and 6.1 g/dL, respectively). However, total IgG concentration in whey of VP and VC at ppd3 and ppd7 did not differ. Antibody titer was significantly higher at day 0 in serum of VP than it was that of VC (60 vs 37 in geometric mean; P < 0.05). Likewise, the antibody titer in whey of VP and VC was found to be similar at day 0 (416 vs 208 in geometric mean; P = 0.13). Consequently, VP had fewer days between weaning and return to estrus than did VC (7 vs 10 days; P < 0.05). Moreover, piglets of VP had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher litter weight at birth (9,252 g/litter) and a lower mortality (12%) during suckling than those of VC (8,686 g/litter and 28%, respectively). In summary, probiotic-supplemented, PED-vaccinated sows were healthier, transferred PED-specific antibodies via colostrum to piglets, had greater litter weight at birth, and reduced mortality during suckling.","Inatomi, Takio; Amatatsu, Masaaki; Romero-Pérez, Gustavo A.; Inoue, Ryo; Tsukahara, Takamitsu",Front Immunol,506,1

SARS-CoV-2 is shown to cause acute respiratory infections in humans. SARS-CoV-2 is a ribonucleic acid virus believed to have transmitted from a zoonotic host accompanied by human-to-human spread that has contributed to a recent pandemic. Clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 patients start with tiredness, sore throat, cough, running nose, and fever, and then progressing to trouble breathing and loss of taste; severe cases experience death due to organ failure. Also, a few affected individuals can also be asymptomatic. Elderly and individuals with chronic conditions viz. hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac complications are more vulnerable to viral infection and disease severity.

In this work, we aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of D. pigrum 040417 in human respiratory epithelial cells and the potential ability of this immunobiotic bacterium to increase the protection against Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The respiratory commensal bacterium D. pigrum 040417 differentially modulated the production of IFN-β, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL5 and CXCL10 in the culture supernatants of Calu-3 cells stimulated with poly(I:C) or challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The differential cytokine profile induced by the 040417 strain was associated with a significant reduction in viral replication and cellular damage after coronavirus infection. Of note, D. pigrum 030918 was not able to modify the resistance of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating a strain-specific immunomodulatory effect for respiratory commensal bacteria. The findings of this work improve our understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved in the modulation of respiratory immunity induced by respiratory commensal bacteria, by demonstrating their specific effect on respiratory epithelial cells. In addition, the results suggest that particular strains such as D. pigrum 040417 could be used as a promising alternative for combating SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the severity of COVID-19.","Islam, Md.

For capacity planning of healthcare providers and to optimize protection of healthcare workers (HCW) in SARS-CoV‑2 pandemics, it is essential to know the risk of infection and potential immunity status of staff dealing with COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined seropravalence of SARS-CoV‑2 IgM/IgG antibodies (AB) in HCW of a region with the highest rate of infection (1570/100,000) during COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, 4 months after its start. Employees of a nonmedical company (MU) served as control group. Demographic data, medical history and working situation were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1838 HCW and 986 MU volunteered to participate. Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV‑2 in HCW was 15.1% and 3.7% in MU. Among HCWs, nurses had a seropositivity of 20.0%, ICU personnel 20.3%, housekeepers 19.3%, physicians 12.0%, medical services (e.g., radiology, physiotherapy) 11.3%, administration 7.1% and technical services 6%. Symptoms typical for COVID-19 were not experienced by 10% of seropositive HCWs. CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV‑2 antibodies in HCW of a region heavily affected by COVID-19 is with 15.1% significantly higher than in a control group of nonmedical staff with 3.7%. Infection rate in HCW was higher in staff with close contact to infected patients. Seropositivity in ICU personnel is higher than in other clinical professions. The occupational risk for housekeepers seems to be underestimated.","Finkenzeller, T.; Faltlhauser, A.; Dietl, K.-H.; Paetzel, C.; Szczypien, N.; Klawonn, F.; Bodmann, K.‑F.; von Meyer, A.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,506,20

Results: A total of 31 older adults were included in the study, with a mean age of 84 ± 8.71 years old. The main findings obtained were that a greater number of steps and distance could be related to a lower probability of falling, of dependency in basic activities of daily living, or of mobility problems. Conclusions: The importance of focusing on daily steps, intrinsically related to the objective assessment of daily physical activity, is that it is a modifiable factor that impacts different aspects of health and quality of life.","Miranda-Duro, María del Carmen; Nieto-Riveiro, Laura; Concheiro-Moscoso, Patricia; Groba, Betania; Pousada, Thais; Canosa, Nereida; Pereira, Javier",Sensors (Basel),506,20

Recently, a C5a receptor antagonist was shown to suppress neuropathology in two murine models of AD, Tg2576 and 3xTg. Previously, a genetic deficiency of C1q in the Tg2576 mouse model showed an accumulation of fibrillar plaques similar to the complement sufficient Tg2576, but reactive glia were significantly decreased and neuronal integrity was improved suggesting detrimental consequences for complement activation in AD. The goal of this study was to define the role of the classical complement activation pathway in the progression of pathology in the 3xTg mouse that develops tangles in addition to fibrillar plaques (more closely reflecting human AD pathology) and to assess the influence of complement in a model of AD with a higher level of complement hemolytic activity. METHODS: 3xTg mice deficient in C1q (3xTgQ-/-) were generated, and both 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/- were backcrossed to the BUB mouse strain which has higher in vitro hemolytic complement activity. Mice were aged and perfused, and brain sections stained for pathological markers or analyzed for proinflammatory marker expression. RESULTS: 3xTgQ-/- mice showed similar amounts of fibrillar amyloid, reactive glia and hyperphosphorylated tau as the C1q-sufficient 3xTg at the ages analyzed. However, 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/- on the BUB background developed pathology earlier than on the original 3xTg background, although the presence of C1q had no effect on neuropathological and pro-inflammatory markers. In contrast to that seen in other transgenic models of AD, C1q, C4 and C3 immunoreactivity was undetectable on the plaques of 3xTg in any background, although C3 was associated with reactive astrocytes surrounding the plaques. Importantly, properdin a component of the alternative complement pathway was associated with plaques in all models. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previously investigated transgenic models of AD, development of neuropathology in 3xTg mice, which progresses much slower than other murine models, may not be influenced by fibrillar amyloid mediated activation of the classical complement pathway, suggesting that the alternative complement pathway activation or a C3-independent cleavage of C5 could account for the detrimental effects in these mice that are prevented by the C5a receptor antagonist. Furthermore, the paucity of complement activation may be a factor in the slower kinetics of progression of pathology in the 3xTg model of this disease.","Fonseca, Maria I; Chu, Shu-Hui; Berci, Alisia M; Benoit, Marie E; Peters, Douglas G; Kimura, Yuko; Tenner, Andrea J",J Neuroinflammation,506,24

We aimed to study whether combining vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis can improve early prognostication. Methods 1,258 adults with COVID-19 seen at three hospitals in New York in March and April 2020 were analyzed. ECGs at presentation to the emergency department were systematically read by electrophysiologists. The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation or death 48 hours from diagnosis. The prognostic value of ECG abnormalities was assessed in a model adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and vital signs. Results At 48 hours, 73 patients (6%) had died and 174 (14%) were alive but receiving mechanical ventilation with 277 (22%) patients dying by 30 days. Early development of respiratory failure was common, with 53% of all intubations occurring within 48 hours of presentation. In a multivariable logistic regression, atrial fibrillation/flutter (OR 2.5, 95% CI [1.1-6.2]), right ventricular strain (OR 2.7, 95% CI [1.3-6.1]), and ST segment abnormalities (OR 2.4, 95% CI [1.5-3.8]) were associated with death or mechanical ventilation at 48 hours. In 108 patients without these ECG abnormalities and with normal respiratory vitals (rate <20 and saturation >95%), only 5 (5%) died or required mechanical ventilation by 48 hours versus 68 of 216 patients (31%) having both ECG and respiratory vital sign abnormalities. Conclusions The combination of abnormal respiratory vital signs and ECG findings of atrial fibrillation/flutter, right ventricular strain, or ST segment abnormalities accurately prognosticates early deterioration in patients with COVID-19 and may assist with patient triage.","Elias, Pierre; Poterucha, Timothy J.; Jain, Sneha S.; Sayer, Gabriel; Raikhelkar, Jayant; Fried, Justin; Clerkin, Kevin; Griffin, Jan; DeFilippis, Ersilia M.; Gupta, Aakriti; Lawlor, Matthew; Madhavan, Mahesh; Rosenblum, Hannah; Roth, Zachary B.; Natarajan, Karthik; Hripcsak, George; Perotte, Adler; Wan, Elaine Y.; Saluja, Deepak; Dizon, Jose; Ehlert, Frederick; Morrow, John P.; Yarmohammadi, Hirad; Kumaraiah, Deepa; Redfors, Bjorn; Gavin, Nicholas; Kirtane, Ajay; Rabbani, Leroy; Burkhoff, Dan; Moses, Jeffrey; Schwartz, Allan; Leon, Martin; Uriel, Nir",Mayo Clin Proc,506,30

To examine the functional state of the Xenopus-expressed P proteins, the polypeptides were tested for their ability to form stable complexes with each other. As seen in virus-infected cells, all three P proteins associated into an immunoprecipitable complex, suggesting that the system has considerable promise for the reconstruction of an active influenza RNA polymerase. Examination of the ability of paired combinations of the P proteins to associate indicated that PB1 contained independent binding sites for PB2 and PA, and so probably formed the backbone of the complex. Sedimentation analysis of free and complexed P proteins indicated that PB1 and PB2 did not exist as free monomers, and that similarly, complexes of all three P proteins did not simply consist of one copy of each protein. The heterodisperse sedimentation rate seen for complexes of all three P proteins did not appear to result from their binding to RNA, suggesting the incorporation of additional polypeptides polymerase complex.","Digard, Paul; Blok, Vivian C.; Inglis, Stephen C.",Virology,506,27

METHODS: MS2 containing droplet nuclei were generated using a Collison nebulizer and loaded onto respirator coupons at a face velocity of 13.2 cm/seconds for 30 minutes. The coupons were incubated at 2 different temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions and analyzed for viable MS2 at different time intervals. RESULTS: Results showed that log(10) reduction of MS2 was not statistically significant (P > .05) between the control and antimicrobial respirator coupons, when stored at 22°C and 30% RH up to 20 hours.

At the time of writing, COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially interesting cycles seems beyond reach with such short series. We solve the problem of obtaining accurate estimates from short series by using recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods. We show that transformed daily COVID-19 cases for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly) and that shorter wavelength cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post-lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors. Unconstrained, new cases grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic declines. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or more daily falls. Spectral learning for epidemic time series contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process and can help evaluate interventions. Spectral fusion is a general technique that can fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates, which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.","Nason, Guy P.",Sci Rep,506,24

Various technologies, including laboratory assays and point-of-care self-tests, are available for antibody testing. The interpretation of seroprevalence studies requires comparative data on the performance of antibody tests. Methods In June 2020, current and former members of the UK Police forces and Fire service performed a self-test lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) and provided a saliva sample, nasopharyngeal swab, venous blood samples for Abbott ELISA and had a nurse performed LFIA. We present the prevalence of PCR positivity and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort following the first wave of infection in England; the acceptability and usability of self-test LFIAs (defined as use of the LFIA kit and provision of a valid result, respectively); and determine the sensitivity and specificity of LFIAs compared to laboratory ELISAs. Results In this cohort of non-healthcare key workers, 7.4% (396/5,348; 95% CI, 6.7-8.1) were antibody positive. Seroprevalence was 8.9% (6.9-11.4) in those under 40 years, 11.5% (8.8-15.0) in those of non-white British ethnicity and 7.8% (7.1-8.7) in those currently working. The self-test LFIA had an acceptability of 97.7% and a usability of 90.0%. There was substantial agreement between within-participant LFIA results (kappa 0.80; 0.77-0.83). The LFIAs (self-test and nurse-performed) had a similar performance: compared to ELISA, sensitivity was 82.1% (77.7-86.0) self-test and 76.4% (71.9-80.5) nurse-performed with specificity of 97.8% (97.3-98.2) and 98.5% (98.1-98.8) respectively. Conclusion A greater proportion of the non-healthcare key worker cohort showed evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 than the general population at 6.0% (5.8-6.1) following the first wave in England. The high acceptability and usability reported by participants and the similar performance of self-test and nurse-performed LFIAs indicate that the self-test LFIA is fit for purpose for home-testing in occupational and community prevalence studies.","Davies, B.; Araghi, M.; Moshe, M.; Gao, H.; Bennet, K.; Jenkins, J.; Atchison, C.; Darzi, A.; Ashby, D.; Riley, S.; Barclay, W.; Elliott, P.; Ward, H.; Cooke, G.",,506,1

Machine learning methods could be used to extract implicit knowledge from the logs. Industries and businesses use the knowledge to better understand the consumer behavior, and opportunities and threats correspondingly. The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has a great impact on the different aspects of our daily life, in particular, on our shopping behaviour. To predict electronic consumer behaviour could be of valuable help for managers in government, supply chain and retail industry. Although, before coronavirus pandemic we have experienced online shopping, during the disease the number of online shopping increased dramatically. Due to high speed transmission of COVID-19, we have to observe personal and social health issues such as social distancing and staying at home.

Transthoracic echocardiogram(TTE) revealed EF <10% and RV impairment which compare to prior which had normal ejection fraction. Labs showed elevated lactic acidosis of 10. Invasive hemodynamics assessment RA 21 mmHg, PA 32/23(mean 26 mmHg) and PCWP 18 mmHg. Calculated PAPi 0.76, CO 2.1 L/min and CI of 1.2 L/min/m^2. Decision was made to place right and left sided ventricular impellas for mechanical circulatory support. She was started on IVIG for COVID-19 myocarditis along with remdesivir and solumedrol. After two weeks of continuous temporary mechanical circulatory support(TMCS), patient hemodynamics improved and she was able to be weaned from her need for TMCS. Repeat echocardiogram demonstrated recovery and remodeling with an LVEF of 60% and no significant valvular disease. She was discharge home at day 23 with no neurological deficit. Summary The use of biventricular continuous microaxial flow devices during acute COVID-19 myocarditis is key to allow ventricular rest and optimal offloading without the increased risk of surgically placed TMCS such as Centrimag or VA or VV ECMO. With recent emergency use by the FDA, its wide adaptation remains sparse. Our case demonstrates a unique approach to management of COVID-19 myocarditis. It is the only reported case in the literature utilizing biventricular Impella devices for circulatory support without the concurrent use of ECMO. Due to the success in this patient, this promising approach warrants continued investigation in the management of COVID myocarditis and cardiogenic shock.","Ruiz, J.; Kandah, F.; Ganji, M.; Goswami, R.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,506,16

It is induced by sepsis, aspiration, and pneumonia, including that caused by SARS coronavirus and human influenza viruses. The main pathophysiological mechanism of ARDS is a systemic inflammatory response. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can limit cytokine production in the spleen and thereby dampen any systemic inflammation and inflammation-induced tissue damage in the lungs and other organs. However, the effects of increased parasympathetic outflow to the lungs when non-selective VNS is applied may result in bronchoconstriction, increased mucus secretion and enhance local pulmonary inflammatory activity; this may outweigh the beneficial systemic anti-inflammatory action of VNS. Organ/function-specific therapy can be achieved by imaging of localized fascicle activity within the vagus nerve and selective stimulation of identified organ-specific fascicles. This may be able to provide selective neuromodulation of different pathways within the vagus nerve and offer a novel means to improve outcome in ARDS. This has motivated this review in which we discuss the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects of VNS, progress in selective VNS techniques, and a possible application for ARDS.","Mastitskaya, Svetlana; Thompson, Nicole; Holder, David",Front Neurosci,506,1

Suboptimal injection technique, patient selection and product knowledge have touted a concerning increase in filler complications, with new challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic leading to new paradigms in the understanding, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of complications. The updated 10-point plan has been developed to curtail complications through consideration of causative factors, categorized as patient, product, and procedure-related. Patient-related factors include a preprocedural consultation with careful elucidation of skin conditions (acne, rosacea, dermatitis), systemic disease (allergies, autoimmune disease, underlying bacterial and viral disease (herpes simplex virus, COVID-19 infection), medications (antineoplastic drugs, recreational drugs) and previous cosmetic procedures (including fillers and energy-based devices). Patient assessment should include standardized photography and also evaluate the role of social media, ethnicity, gender, generational, and LGBTQ+ needs. Specified informed consent for both adverse events and their treatment is essential due to the increase in vascular complications, including the risk of blindness. Product-related factors include the powerful advantage of reversibility when using hyaluronic acid (HA) products. Product characteristics such as molecular weight and filler degradation should be understood. Product layering over late or minimally degradable fillers is still inadvisable due to the initial filler being teased into reactivity. Procedural factors such as consistent photographic documentation, procedural planning, aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT), knowledge of topographical anatomy and angiosomes, and technical dexterity including pinch anatomy and needle skills are of pivotal importance. The final section is dedicated to algorithms and checklists for managing and treating complications such as allergic hypersensitivity reactions, vascular events, infection, edema and late-onset adverse events (LOAEs). The updated 10-point plan is a methodical strategy aimed at further minimising the risk of dermal filler complications.","Heydenrych, Izolda; De Boulle, Koenraad; Kapoor, Krishan Mohan; Bertossi, Dario",Clin Cosmet Investig Dermatol,506,13

During the past year, the global community underwent a massive transformation, including the implementation of numerous nonpharmacological interventions; critical diversions or modifications across various spheres of our economic and public domains; and a transition from consumption-driven to conservation-based behaviors. Providing essential necessities such as food, water, health care, financial, and other services has become a formidable challenge, with significant threats to the existing supply chains and the shortage or reduction of workforce across many sectors of the global economy. Food and pharmaceutical supply chains constitute uniquely vulnerable and critically important areas that require high levels of safety and compliance. Many regional health-care systems faced at least one wave of overwhelming COVID-19 case surges, and still face the possibility of a new wave of infections on the horizon, potentially in combination with other endemic diseases such as influenza, dengue, tuberculosis, and malaria. In this context, the need for an effective and scientifically informed leadership to sustain and improve global capacity to ensure international health security is starkly apparent. Public health “blind spotting,” promulgation of pseudoscience, and academic dishonesty emerged as significant threats to population health and stability during the pandemic.

Antiviral drug development always remains a challenge to the scientists. Remdesivir has emerged as a promising molecule, based on results of clinical trials and observational studies and has receieved marketing approval for COVID-19 treatment under “emergency use authorization” in countries such as United States. Remdesivir is a newer antiviral drug that acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor targeting the viral genome replication process. Therapeutic efficacy was first demonstrated by suppressing viral replication in Ebola-infected rhesus monkeys. It is available for parenteral use with reasonable safety and tolerability profile. Multiple clinical trials are going on in many countries to evaluate its safety, efficacy and tolerability.

Viral genomes or early products of viral replication are sensed by a number of pattern recognition receptors, leading to the synthesis and production of type I interferons (IFNs) that, in turn, activate a cascade of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral functions. Among these, several members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family are antiviral executors. This article will focus, in particular, on TRIM22 as an example of a multitarget antiviral member of the TRIM family. The antiviral activities of TRIM22 against different DNA and RNA viruses, particularly human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV), will be discussed. TRIM22 restriction of virus replication can involve either direct interaction of TRIM22 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with viral proteins, or indirect protein–protein interactions resulting in control of viral gene transcription, but also epigenetic effects exerted at the chromatin level.","Pagani, Isabel; Poli, Guido; Vicenzi, Elisa",Cells,506,20

Methods: In this observational cohort study of female front-line workers with no history of COVID-19 infection, we amplified BNT162B2 mRNA in plasma and breast milk and assayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and anti-human syncytin-1 binding antibodies in plasma, at early (1-4 days) and late (4-7 weeks) time points following first-dose vaccination. Results: Fifteen consented participants (mean age 40.4 years, various ethnicities) who received at least one dose of BNT162B2, including five breast-feeding women and two women who were inadvertently vaccinated in early pregnancy, were recruited. BNT162B2 mRNA, detected by amplifying part of the spike-encoding region, was detected in plasma 1-4 days following the first dose (n=13), but not 4-5 weeks later (n=2), nor was the mRNA isolated from aqueous or lipid breast milk fractions collected 0-7 days post-vaccination (n=5). Vaccine recipients demonstrated strong SARS-CoV-2 neutralising activity by at least four weeks after the first dose (n=15), including the two pregnant women. None had placental anti-syncytin-1 binding antibodies at either time-point following vaccination. Conclusions: BNT162B2-vaccinated women did not transmit vaccine mRNA to breast milk, and did not produce a concurrent humoral response to syncytin-1, suggesting that cross-reactivity to syncytin-1 on the developing trophoblast, or other adverse effects in the breast-fed infant from vaccine mRNA ingestion, are unlikely.","Mattar, C.

These challenges often arise due to a lack of trust, poor collaboration and an inability to respond to disaster affected areas in a timely manner. Our study attempts to understand how these challenges are overcome by seeking answers to questions related to the topics of swift-trust, collaboration and agility in humanitarian supply chains. For instance, in our study we have attempted to examine how information sharing and supply chain visibility in humanitarian supply chains improve the swift-trust among the humanitarian actors engaged in disaster relief operations. Further, we attempt to understand how-swift trust, commitment and collaboration among the humanitarian actors improve the agility in humanitarian supply chains. In our study we provide both theoretical and data-driven answers to our stated research gaps. Our theoretical model is firmly grounded in organizational information process theory and relational view. We tested our research hypotheses using variance based structural equation modelling with survey data collected using a web based pre-tested instrument from 147 NGOs respondents drawn from the National Disaster Management Authority database. Our results help to advance the theoretical debates surrounding “swift-trust”, “collaboration” and “agility” in humanitarian settings. We further provide direction to managers engaged in disaster relief operations. The humanitarian actors engaged in disaster relief often fail to understand how to build swift-trust. Moreover, how swift-trust further affects commitment and collaboration which in turn further affect agility in humanitarian supply chains. Thus humanitarian organizations must understand how information sharing and supply chain visibility is key to swift-trust among humanitarian actors and agility in humanitarian supply chains.

If this problem can be successfully addressed, it could have a positive impact on various stakeholders. Through the lens of cognitive dissonance theory, this study investigates the role of health professional encouragement as well as patients’ security concerns in influencing continuous use intention and deep structure usage among users of a patient portal. The analysis of data collected from 177 patients at a major medical center in the Midwestern region of the United States shows that health professional encouragement helps increase the continuous use intention and deep structure usage of the patient portal, while security concerns impede them. Interestingly, health professional encouragement not only has a direct positive influence on continuous use intention and deep structure usage but also lowers the negative impact of security concerns on them. The research model explains a substantial variance in continuous use intention (i.e., 40%) and deep structure usage (i.e., 32%). The paper provides theoretical implications as well as practical implications to healthcare managers and providers to improve patient portal deep structure usage and sustained use for user retention.","Moqbel, Murad; Hewitt, Barbara; Nah, Fiona Fui-Hoon; McLean, Rosann M.",Inf Syst Front,506,24

The reasons for gender disparity in disease severity is unclear and can be due to host factors. To determine whether males have delayed viral clearance after infection, we evaluated the time to clearance in symptomatic patients tested by serial oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs followed by RT-PCR at a reference lab in Mumbai, India. A total of 68 subjects with median age of 37 years (3-75 range) were examined and included 48 (71%) males and 20 (29%) females. We observed that females were able to achieve viral clearance significantly earlier than males, with a median difference of 2 days in achieving a negative PCR result (P value = 0.038). Furthermore, examination of 3 families with both male and female patients followed serially, demonstrated that female members of the same household cleared the SARS-CoV2 infection earlier in each family. To determine reasons for delayed clearance in males, we examined the expression patterns of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in tissue specific repositories. We observed that the testes was one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression in 3 independent RNA expression databases (Human Protein Atlas, FAMTOM5 and GETx). ACE2 was also determined to be highly expressed in testicular cells at the protein levels. Interestingly, very little expression of ACE2 was seen in ovarian tissue. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first time that male subjects have delayed viral clearance of SARS-CoV2. High expression of ACE2 in testes raises the possibility that testicular viral reservoirs may play a role in viral persistence in males and should be further investigated.","Shastri, Aditi; Wheat, Justin; Agrawal, Sachee; Chaterjee, Nirjhar; Pradhan, Kith; Goldfinger, Mendel; Kornblum, Noah; Steidl, Ulrich; Verma, Amit; Shastri, Jayanthi",,506,13

Investing in characterising the SARS-CoV2 will help plan and improve the response to the pandemic. Furthermore, it will help identify the most efficient ways of managing the pandemic, avoiding public health policies and interventions that may be unduly restrictive of normal activity or unnecessarily costly. This paper describes the design and reports findings of a population based epidemiological study undertaken to characterise SARS-CoV2 in Qatar using limited resources in a timely manner. METHODS: Asymptomatic individuals ≥10 years registered with Qatar’s publicly funded primary health provider were eligible. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to identify the study sample. Participants were invited to an appointment where they completed a questionnaire and provided samples for polymerase chain reaction and Immunoglobulin M and G immunoassay tests. Data collected were analyzed to calculate point and period prevalence by sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of 18,918 individuals invited for the study, 2084 participated (response rate 10.8%). The overall point prevalence and period prevalence were estimated to be 1.6% (95% CI 1.1–2.2) and 14.6% (95% CI 13.1–16.2) respectively. Period prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was not considerably different across age groups (9.7–19.8%). It was higher in males compared to females (16.2 and 12.7% respectively). A significant variation was observed by nationality (7.1 to 22.2%) and municipalities (6.9–35.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides an example of a methodologically robust approach that can be undertaken in a timely manner with limited resources. It reports much-needed epidemiological data about the spread of SARS-CoV2. Given the low prevalence rates, majority of the population in Qatar remains susceptible. Enhanced surveillance must continue to be in place, particularly due to the large number of asymptomatic cases observed.

It is associated with different clinical manifestations and a high mortality rate. Predicting mortality and identifying outcome predictors are crucial for COVID patients who are critically ill. Multivariate and machine learning methods may be used for developing prediction models and reduce the complexity of clinical phenotypes. METHODS: Multivariate predictive analysis was applied to 108 out of 250 clinical features, comorbidities, and blood markers captured at the admission time from a hospitalized cohort of patients (N = 250) with COVID-19. Inspired modification of partial least square (SIMPLS)-based model was developed to predict hospital mortality. Prediction accuracy was randomly assigned to training and validation sets. Predictive partition analysis was performed to obtain cutting value for either continuous or categorical variables. Latent class analysis (LCA) was carried to cluster the patients with COVID-19 to identify low- and high-risk patients. Principal component analysis and LCA were used to find a subgroup of survivors that tends to die. RESULTS: SIMPLS-based model was able to predict hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 with moderate predictive power (Q(2) = 0.24) and high accuracy (AUC > 0.85) through separating non-survivors from survivors developed using training and validation sets. This model was obtained by the 18 clinical and comorbidities predictors and 3 blood biochemical markers. Coronary artery disease, diabetes, Altered Mental Status, age > 65, and dementia were the topmost differentiating mortality predictors. CRP, prothrombin, and lactate were the most differentiating biochemical markers in the mortality prediction model. Clustering analysis identified high- and low-risk patients among COVID-19 survivors.

Severe drug eruption may cause severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs), which are considered to be fatal and life-threatening, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Although cases are relatively rare, approximately 2% of hospitalized patients are affected by SCARs. There is an incidence of 2 to 7 cases/million per year of SJS/TEN and 1/1000 to 1/10,000 exposures to offending agents result in DRESS. However, the mortality rate of severe drug eruptions can reach up to 50%. SCARs represent a real medical emergency, and early identification and proper management are critical to survival. The common pathogenesis of severe drug eruptions includes genetic linkage with HLA- and non-HLA-genes, drug-specific T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, T cell receptor restriction, and cytotoxicity mechanisms. A multidisciplinary approach is required for acute management. Immediate withdrawal of potentially causative drugs and specific supportive treatment is of great importance. Immunoglobulins, systemic corticosteroids, and cyclosporine A are the most frequently used treatments for SCARs; additionally, new biologics and plasma exchange are reasonable strategies to reduce mortality.

There are no no pharmacological measures for the prevention or treatment of this infection and, so far, it has caused more than 4'880.000 confirmed cases and 322.000 deaths. The different strategies for the control of the disease that have been proposed involve the participation of different actors. Such participation, guided by legal guidelines based on public health measures, include containment, mitigation, physical isolation, and quarantine. As this is a population-based problem, information plays a primary role; however, the many new terms hat have arisen and their misuse confuse and, therefore, misinform thus limiting citizen participation. For this reason, we conducted a review of the terms used in epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19. We considered and differentiated the relevant terms to facilitate the understanding of pathogen's behavior and epidemic and pandemic cycles, as well as the criteria for public health decision-making for the general public.

The effectiveness of these enclosures remains uncertain. METHODS: We tested a commercially available passive protective enclosure representing the most common design and compared this with a modified enclosure that incorporated a vacuum system for active air filtration during simulated intubations and negative-pressure isolation. We evaluated the enclosures by using the same 3 tests air filtration experts use to certify class I biosafety cabinets: visual smoke pattern analysis using neutrally buoyant smoke, aerosol leak testing using a test aerosol that mimics the size of virus-containing particulates, and air velocity measurements. RESULTS: Qualitative evaluation revealed smoke escaping from all passive enclosure openings. Aerosol leak testing demonstrated elevated particle concentrations outside the enclosure during simulated intubations. In contrast, vacuum-filter-equipped enclosures fully contained the visible smoke and test aerosol to standards consistent with class I biosafety cabinet certification. CONCLUSION: Passive enclosures for intubation failed to contain aerosols, but the addition of a vacuum and active air filtration reduced aerosol spread during simulated intubation and patient isolation.","Turer, David M.; Good, Cameron H.; Schilling, Benjamin K.; Turer, Robert W.; Karlowsky, Nicholas R.; Dvoracek, Lucas A.; Ban, Heng; Chang, Jason S.; Rubin, J.

School-age children are more likely to experience unintentional injuries in the school, while they are playing and teachers are the primarily responsible body for keeping the welfare of the students. Knowing the knowledge, attitude, and practice of kindergarten and elementary school teachers towards first aid will be used as an input for policymakers to intervene and provide training. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors towards first aid among kindergarten and elementary school teachers in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia, 2021. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 01 to 20, 2021. A simple random sampling technique was employed to recruit 346 participants. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were entered in Epi-info version 7, analyzed using SPSS version 21, and presented by frequencies, percentages, tables, and graphs. Bivariable relationships between the independent and outcome variable were investigated using a binary logistic regression model and a multivariable analysis was run to control potential confounding factors. Variables with a p-value < 0.05 were considered as factors significantly associated and the strength of association was determined using an odds ratio with a 95% CI. RESULTS: Only 41.1% of the teachers had good knowledge of first aid. Nearly two-thirds (64.8%) of the teachers had a favorable attitude towards first aid. The majority (85.8%) of the teachers who faced a child in need of first aid in their school gave first aid. Factors like working experience [AOR: 2.45; 95% CI (1.26, 4.73)], school level [AOR: 4.72; 95% CI (1.96, 11.4)], school type [AOR: 4.23; 95% CI (2.07, 8.64)], and having information about first aid [AOR: 2.09; 95% CI (1.11, 3.92)] were significantly associated with knowledge. School-level [AOR = 5.4, 95% CI (2.18–11.67)], school type [AOR = 0.45, 95% CI (0.21–0.94)], and working experience [AOR = 0.33, 95% CI (0.13–0.86)] were the factors significantly associated with attitude. CONCLUSION: Less than half and nearly two-thirds of the teachers had good knowledge and a favorable attitude towards first aid. The majority of the teachers who encountered a child in need of first aid gave first aid. Having higher working experience, working in elementary and private schools, and having previous information increases the odds of having good knowledge. Teachers who work in elementary and private schools and have the lower working experience had higher odds of favorable attitude towards first aid. It is better to give attention to the training of staff on first aid specifically for teachers working in kindergarten and governmental schools and new employees and consider integrating first aid in teachers’ training curriculum.","Workneh, Belayneh Shetie; Mekonen, Enyew Getaneh; Ali, Mohammed Seid",BMC Emerg Med,506,18

Here, we report on crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody CV38–142 in complex with the receptor binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our structural findings provide mechanistic insights into how this antibody can accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38–142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies, in particular COVA1–16, to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

This study aimed to identify at Emergency Department (ED) admission the predictors of in-hospital mortality and suitable scores for death risk stratification among COVID-19 patients ≥ 80 years old. METHODS: : Single-centre prospective study conducted in the ED of an university hospital, referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We included 239 consecutive patients ≥ 80 years old with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The primary study endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed on significant variables at univariate analysis to identify independent risk factor for death. Overall performance in predicting mortality of WHO severity scale, APACHE II score, NEWS score, and CURB-65 was calculated. RESULTS: : Median age was 85 [82-89] and 112 were males (46.9%). Globally, 77 patients (32.2%) deceased. The presence of consolidations at chest x-ray and the hypoxemic respiratory failure were significant predictors of poor prognosis. Moreover, age ≥ 85 years, dependency in activities of daily living (ADL), and dementia were risk factors for death, even after adjusting for clinical covariates and disease severity. All the evaluated scores showed a fairly good predictive value in identifying patients who could experience a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: : Among patients ≥ 80 years old hospitalized with COVID-19, not only a worse clinical and radiological presentation of the disease, but also the increasing age, dementia, and impairment in ADL were strong risk factors for in-hospital death, regardless of disease severity.","Covino, Marcello; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Polla, Davide Antonio Della; Santoro, Michele; Burzo, Maria Livia; Torelli, Enrico; Simeoni, Benedetta; Russo, Andrea; Sandroni, Claudio; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,506,3

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has beneficial effects on cytoprotection and redox balance. But its interactive effects on age-related damage of mesenteric vessels and connective and adipose tissues (MA) during HFD which could be the base of the development of effective physiological-based therapeutic strategy are unknown. The aim of study was to investigate age- and HFD-induced mesenteric cellular changes and activities of enzymes in H(2)S synthesis and to test the effects of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) which is considered an H(2)S donor on them. Adult and aged male rats on a standard diet (SD) or 4-week HFD were exposed to acute water-immersion restraint stress (WIRS) for evaluation of mesenteric subcellular and cellular adaptive responses by electron microscopy. The effects of exogenous NaHS (5.6 mg/kg/day for 9 days) versus vehicle on mesentery changes were investigated. Serum glucose level, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and activities of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), thiosulfate-dithiol sulfurtransferase (TST), and sulfite oxidase (SO) were examined by spectrophotometry. In both adult and aged SD groups, treatment with NaHS protected mesenteric cells after WIRS. In both groups, the treatment with NaHS also protected MA mitochondria, microvascular endothelial and sub-endothelial structures, and fibroblasts versus the vehicle-treated group that had signs of damage. HFD increased MA injury and mitochondrial changes in both aged and adult rats. HFD-associated malfunction is characterized by low activities of CSE, CBS, TST, SO, and increased TBARS. Finally, we demonstrated that pretreatment with NaHS inhibited MA and mitochondria alterations in aged rats exposed to HFD and WIRS, lowered TBARS, and enhanced H(2)S enzyme activities in contrast to the vehicle-treated group. Mitochondrial integrity alterations, endothelial damage, and redox imbalance are key factors for rat mesenteric adipose tissue damage during advanced age. These alterations and MA hypertrophic changes retain the central for HFD-induced damage. Moreover, H(2)S signaling contributes to MA and mitochondria redox balance that is crucial for advanced age and HFD injury. The future study of H(2)S donors’ effects on mesenteric cells is fundamental to define novel therapeutic strategies against metabolic changes.","Revenko, Oleh; Pavlovskiy, Yaroslav; Savytska, Maryana; Yashchenko, Antonina; Kovalyshyn, Vasyl; Chelpanova, Ilona; Varyvoda, Olena; Zayachkivska, Oksana",Front Pharmacol,506,30

It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245. Findings:17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients.

A positive correlation has been observed between the spread of the virus and air pollution, one of the greatest challenges of our millennium. COVID-19 could have an air transmission and atmospheric particulate matter (PM) could create a suitable environment for transporting the virus at greater distances than those considered for close contact. Moreover, PM induces inflammation in lung cells and exposure to PM could increase the susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 patient symptoms. The new coronavirus has been shown to trigger an inflammatory storm that would be sustained in the case of pre-exposure to polluting agents. In this review, we highlight the potential role of PM in the spread of COVID-19, focusing on Italian cities whose PM daily concentrations were found to be higher than the annual average allowed during the months preceding the epidemic.

Whether the lung function characteristics are related to pneumothorax is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 343 patients who received CT-guided pulmonary PCNBs and underwent preoperative pulmonary function testing. Demographical, lesion-related, procedure-related features and histopathological diagnosis, as well as results of pulmonary function test were analyzed as risk factors of pneumothorax RESULTS: Variables associated with higher rate of pneumothorax were location of lesion, presence of emphysema, and dwell time. The proportion of middle lobe, lingular, or lower lobe lesions in pneumothorax group (30/50, 60.0%) is higher than non-pneumothorax group (113/293, 38.6%). The incidence of emphysema in pneumothorax group was significantly higher than that in non-pneumothorax group (34.0% vs. 7.5%). Obstructive pulmonary function abnormalities, not restrictive, mixed ventilation function abnormalities and small airway dysfunction, correlated with pneumothorax. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed lower location of lesion sampled and presence of emphysema were independent predictors of pneumothorax. Although dwell time, FEV(1)/FVC ratio, FEF(50%), FEF(75%) and FEF(25–75%) were significantly correlated with pneumothorax on univariate analysis, these were not confirmed to be independent predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obstructive pulmonary dysfunction have a higher risk of pneumothorax.

Methods: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine centre for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Results: Between March 10th and April 4th, 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8/13 (62%) vs. 17/17 (100%) P=0.02).

Method: We performed probability calculations to estimate COVID-19 infection status and likelihood of disease transmission among neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients and health care workers during anti-VEGF procedures, at various community prevalence levels of COVID-19. We then applied the expected burden of COVID-19 illness and death expressed through health-adjusted life-years (HALYs) lost. We compared these results to the expected disease burden of severe visual impairment if sight protecting anti-VEGF injections were not performed. Results: Our calculations estimate for a single treatment, where the background rate of COVID-19 in the community is 1000 active cases per million population, and full personal protective equipment (PPE) is available, that the benefits of treatment are greater than the expected harms to the patient and immediate health care team, provided the probability of severe visual impairment without treatment is >0.001%. Without effective PPE, and with a COVID-19 prevalence of 200,000 per million, an 8.5% chance of severe visual impairment could still justify monthly injections for six months. Conclusion: In most cases analysed, the reduced disease burden from avoiding visual impairment outweighs the expected HALYs lost from COVID-19 transmission. This finding is driven by the fact that HALYs lost when someone suffers severe visual impairment for 5 years are equivalent to nearly 400 moderate cases of infectious disease lasting 2 weeks each.","Boyd, M.

No proven drug has been found to effectively cure this fast-spreading infection, hence the need to explore old drugs with the known profile in tackling this pandemic. A computer-aided drug design approach involving virtual screening was used to obtain the binding scores and inhibiting efficiencies of previously known antibiotics against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). The drug-likeness analysis of the repurposed drugs were done using the Molinspiration chemoinformatics tool, while the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) analysis was carried out using ADMET SAR-2 webserver. Other analyses performed include bioactivities of the repurposed drug as a probable anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and oral bioavailability analyses among others. The results were compared with those of drugs currently involved in clinical trials in the ongoing pandemic.

Since the first data analyses in China, elevated cardiac troponin has been noted in a substantial proportion of patients, implicating myocardial injury as a possible pathogenic mechanism contributing to severe illness and mortality. Accordingly, high troponin levels are associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. This brief review explores the available evidence regarding the association between COVID-19 and myocardial injury.","Tersalvi, Gregorio; Vicenzi, Marco; Calabretta, Davide; Biasco, Luigi; Pedrazzini, Giovanni; Winterton, Dario",J Card Fail,506,30

Besides pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, the disease leads to multisystem involvement in the form of myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypoxemic brain injury, acute liver and renal function impairment. There are also reports of cutaneous lesions in form of urticarial and maculopapular rashes, chilblain like fingers and toes (covid feet), livedoid vasculopathy and chicken‐pox like or varicelliform vesicles. Clinically, many of these skin lesions are likely secondary to occlusion of small to medium blood vessels due to microthrombi formation or due to viral laden antigen‐antibody immune complexes; and same explanation may hold true for possible hypoxemic injury simultaneously occurring in other vital organs like lungs, heart, brain and kidneys. The histopathology, immunoflorescence and RT‐PCR analysis of skin biopsies can provide useful insights for ascertaining the pathogenesis of this complex viral syndrome. Apparently, it is interplay of disarmed cellular immunity and over‐activated humoral immunity that culminates in end‐organ changes. The morbidity and mortality can be significantly reduced by upgrading the cellular immunity and downgrading the humoral response; along with prevention of hypoxemic and reperfusion injuries by using antivirals, immunomodulators, antioxidants, anti‐platelets and anticoagulants in judicious and phased manner.

However, the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine use at a population level in rural and remote settings remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate changes in the rate of telemedicine use among rural populations and identify patient characteristics associated with telemedicine use prior to and during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study on all monthly and quarterly rural telemedicine visits from January 2012 to June 2020, using administrative data from Ontario, Canada. We compared the changes in telemedicine use among residents of rural and urban regions of Ontario prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Before the pandemic, telemedicine use was steadily low in 2012-2019 for both rural and urban populations but slightly higher overall for rural patients (11 visits per 1000 patients vs 7 visits per 1000 patients in December 2019, P<.001). The rate of telemedicine visits among rural patients significantly increased to 147 visits per 1000 patients in June 2020. A similar but steeper increase (P=.15) was observed among urban patients (220 visits per 1000 urban patients). Telemedicine use increased across all age groups, with the highest rates reported among older adults aged ≥65 years (77 visits per 100 patients in 2020). The proportions of patients with at least 1 telemedicine visit were similar across the adult age groups (n=82,246/290,401, 28.3% for patients aged 18-49 years, n=79,339/290,401, 27.3% for patients aged 50-64 years, and n=80,833/290,401, 27.8% for patients aged 65-79 years), but lower among younger patients <18 years (n=23,699/290,401, 8.2%) and older patients ≥80 years (n=24,284/290,401, 8.4%) in 2020 (P<.001). There were more female users than male users of telemedicine (n=158,643/290,401, 54.6% vs n=131,758/290,401, 45.4%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). There was a significantly higher proportion of telemedicine users residing in relatively less rural than in more rural regions (n=261,814/290,401, 90.2% vs n=28,587/290,401, 9.8%, respectively, in 2020; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine adoption increased in rural and remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its use increased in urban and less rural populations. Future studies should investigate the potential barriers to telemedicine use among rural patients and the impact of rural telemedicine on patient health care utilization and outcomes.","Chu, Cherry; Cram, Peter; Pang, Andrea; Stamenova, Vess; Tadrous, Mina; Bhatia, R Sacha",J Med Internet Res,506,29

A search was conducted on Entrez PubMed on 23 December 2020 using the keywords “gene therapy”, “retinal ganglion cell” and “neuroprotection”. The initial search yielded 82 relevant articles. After restricting publications to those with full text available and in the English language, and then curating for only original articles on gene-based therapy, the final yield was 18 relevant articles. From the 18 papers, 17 of the papers utilized an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector for gene therapy encoding specific genes of interest. Specifically, six of the studies utilized an AAV vector encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), two of the studies utilized an AAV vector encoding erythropoietin (EPO), the remaining 10 papers utilized AAV vectors encoding different genes and one microRNA study. Although the literature shows promising results in both in vivo and in vitro models, there is still a significant way to go before gene-based therapy for RGC neuroprotection can proceed to clinical trials. Namely, the models of injury in many of the studies were more acute in nature, unlike the more progressive and neurodegenerative pathophysiology of diseases, such as glaucoma. The regulation of gene expression is also highly unexplored despite the use of AAV vectors in the majority of the studies reviewed. It is also expected that with the successful launch of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccinations in 2020, we will see a shift towards this technology for gene-based therapy in glaucoma neuroprotection.","Rhee, Jess; Shih, Kendrick Co",Biomolecules,506,27

This approach, however, still requires improvement for its efficient application. In this paper, we present the use of wastewater-based epidemiology in monitoring COVID-19 infection dynamics in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, focusing on four wastewater treatment plants for 14 weeks. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load in influent wastewater was determined using droplet digital PCR, and the number of people infected was estimated using published models as well as using a modified model to improve efficiency. On average, viral loads ranged between 0 and 2.73 × 105 copies/100 ml, 0–1.52 × 105 copies/100 ml, 3 × 104–7.32 × 105 copies/100 ml and 1.55 × 104–4.12 × 105 copies/100 ml in the four wastewater treatment plants studied. The peak in viral load corresponded to the reported COVID-19 infections within the districts where these catchments are located. In addition, we also observed that easing of lockdown restrictions by authorities corresponded with an increase in viral load in the untreated wastewater. Estimation of infection numbers based on the viral load showed that a higher number of people could potentially be infected, compared to the number of cases reported based on clinical testing. The findings reported in this paper contributes to the field of wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19 surveillance, whilst highlighting some of the challenges associated with this approach, especially in developing countries.","Pillay, Leanne; Amoah, Isaac Dennis; Deepnarain, Nashia; Pillay, Kriveshin; Awolusi, Oluyemi Olatunji; Kumari, Sheena; Bux, Faizal",Sci Total Environ,506,16

Because two novel protein-based vaccines against serogroup B are available, the main purpose of this study was to provide data on the diversity and distribution of meningococcal vaccine antigen types circulating in Brazil. METHODOLOGY: Genetic lineages, vaccine antigen types, and allele types of antimicrobial-associated resistance genes based on whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 145 Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B invasive strains recovered in Brazil from 2016 to 2018 were collected. RESULTS: A total of 11 clonal complexes (ccs) were identified among the 145 isolates, four of which were predominant, namely, cc461, cc35, cc32, and cc213, accounting for 72.0% of isolates. The most prevalent fHbp peptides were 24 (subfamily A/variant 2), 47 (subfamily A/variant 3), 1 (subfamily B/variant 1) and 45 (subfamily A/variant 3), which were predominantly associated with cc35, cc461, cc32, and cc213, respectively. The NadA peptide was detected in only 26.2% of the isolates. The most frequent NadA peptide 1 was found almost exclusively in cc32. We found seven NHBA peptides that accounted for 74.5% of isolates, and the newly described peptide 1390 was the most prevalent peptide exclusively associated with cc461. Mutated penA alleles were detected in 56.5% of the isolates, whereas no rpoB and gyrA mutant alleles were found. CONCLUSION: During the study period, changes in the clonal structure of circulating strains were observed, without a predominance of a single hyperinvasive lineage, indicating that an epidemiologic shift has occurred that led to a diversity of vaccine antigen types in recent years in Brazil.","de Lemos, Ana Paula Silva; Sacchi, Claudio Tavares; Gonçalves, Claudia Regina; Camargo, Carlos Henrique; Andrade, Ana Lúcia",PLoS One,506,32

The state of Massachusetts was especially impacted during the initial stages; however, the extent of asymptomatic transmission remains poorly understood due to limited asymptomatic testing in the “first wave.” To address this gap, a geographically representative and contact-free seroprevalence survey was conducted in July-August 2020, to estimate prior undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: Students, faculty, librarians and staff members at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were invited to participate in this study along with one member of their household in June 2020. Two separate sampling frames were generated from administrative lists: all undergraduates and their household members (primary sampling group) were randomly selected with probability proportional to population size. All staff, faculty, graduate students and librarians (secondary sampling group) were selected as a simple random sample. After informed consent and a socio-behavioral survey, participants were mailed test kits and asked to return self-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Samples were analyzed via ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, and then IgM antibodies if IgG-positive. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for survey non-response. Binomial models were used to assess factors associated with seropositivity in both sample groups separately. RESULTS: Approximately 27,000 persons were invited via email to assess eligibility. Of the 1,001 individuals invited to participate in the study, 762 (76%) returned blood samples for analysis. In the primary sampling group 548 returned samples, of which 230 enrolled a household member. Within the secondary sampling group of 214 individuals, 79 enrolled a household member. In the primary sample group, 36 (4.6%) had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated weighed prevalence for this population of 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5 to 8.0). In the secondary sampling group, 10 (3.4%) of 292 individuals had IgG antibodies detected for an estimated adjusted prevalence of 4.0% (95% CI: 2.2 to 7.4). No samples were IgM positive. No association was found in either sample group between seropositivity and self-reported work duties or customer-facing hours. In the primary sampling group, self-reported febrile illness since Feb 2020, male sex, and minority race (Black or American Indian/Alaskan Native) were associated with seropositivity. No factors except geographic regions within the state were associated with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the secondary sampling group. INTERPRETATION: This study provides insight into the seroprevalence of university-related populations and their household members across the state of Massachusetts during the summer of 2020 of the pandemic and helps to fill a critical gap in estimating the levels of sub-clinical and asymptomatic infection. Estimates like these can be used to calibrate models that estimate levels of population immunity over time to inform public health interventions and policy.

Due to the unavailability of any proven treatment or vaccination, the outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide. Hence, there is an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Since, botanicals are an important resource for several efficacious antiviral agents, natural compounds gaining significant attention for COVID-19 treatment. In the present study, methyltranferase (MTase) of the SARS-CoV-2 is targeted using computational approach. The compounds were identified using molecular docking, virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation studies. The binding mechanism of each compound was analyzed considering the stability and energetic parameter using in silico methods. We have found four natural antiviral compounds Amentoflavone, Baicalin, Daidzin and Luteoloside as strong inhibitors of methyltranferase of SARS-CoV-2. ADMET prediction and target analysis of the selected compounds showed favorable results. MD simulation was performed for four top-scored molecules to analyze the stability, binding mechanism and energy requirements. MD simulation studies indicated energetically favorable complex formation between MTase and the selected antiviral compounds. Furthermore, the structural effects on these substitutions were analyzed using the principles of each trajectories, which validated the interaction studies. Our analysis suggests that there is a very high probability that these compounds may have a good potential to inhibit Methyltransferase (MTase) of SARS-CoV-2 and to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.

However, mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated thrombo-coagulopathy, and its impact on patient morbidity and mortality, are still poorly understood. Methods: We performed a comprehensive analysis of coagulation and thromboinflammatory factors in plasma from COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Furthermore, we assessed the functional impact of these factors on clot formation and clot lysis. Results: Across all COVID-19 disease severities (mild, moderate and severe) we observed a significant increase (6-fold) in the concentration of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (UL-VWF) multimers compared to healthy controls. This is likely the result of an interleukin (IL)-6 driven imbalance of VWF and the regulatory protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13). Upregulation of this key pro-coagulant pathway may also be influenced by the observed increase (~6-fold) in plasma -defensins, a consequence of increased numbers of neutrophils and neutrophil activation. Markers of endothelial, platelet and leukocyte activation were accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of Factor XIII (FXIII) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1. In patients with high FXIII we observed alteration of the fibrin network structure in in vitro assays of clot formation, which coupled with increased PAI-1, prolonged the time to clot lysis by the t-PA/plasmin fibrinolytic pathway by 52% across all COVID-19 patients (n=23). Conclusions: We show that an imbalance in the VWF/ADAMTS13 axis causing increased VWF reactivity may contribute to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients. Through immune and inflammatory responses, COVID-19 also alters the balance of factors involved in fibrin generation and fibrinolysis which accounts for the persistent fibrin deposition previously observed in post-mortem lung tissue.","South, K.; Roberts, L.; Morris, L.

These same systemic diseases have been associated with severe COVID-19 infections. Periodontal disease is one of the most prevalent diseases globally. Several recent studies have also suggested hypotheses for the potential association between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19. All this supports the importance of good oral health also in the COVID-19 era. Thus, new strategies and approaches to identify patients at risk of periodontal disease could be beneficial to enhance secondary prevention, especially if targeted to COVID-19 risk groups. Diagnostic biomarkers for periodontal disease have been researched extensively. Potential biomarkers in oral fluid with currently available rapid non-invasive point-of-care technology, such as aMMP-8, could help to extend screening and identification of patients at risk for periodontal disease even to situations and places where professional dental expertise and equipment are limited or unavailable such as nursing and care homes, and rural and distant places. The oral fluid point-of-care technologies could also be useful in the hands of medical professionals (diabetes, CVD, etc.) to identify patients at risk for undiagnosed periodontal disease and to refer them to a dentist for examination and evaluation. Finally, if there is a causality between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19 infections, these point-of-care oral fluid biomarker technologies could possibly help also in assessing the risk of deterioration.","Räisänen, Ismo T.; Umeizudike, Kehinde A.; Pärnänen, Pirjo; Heikkilä, Pia; Tervahartiala, Taina; Nwhator, Solomon O.; Grigoriadis, Andreas; Sakellari, Dimitra; Sorsa, Timo",Med Hypotheses,506,16

All US states have adopted NPI policies, but the compliance to these measures and influence of socio-political factors on NPI adherence is unknown. NPI adherence may be approximated by personal mobility in a population which is tracked by anonymous mobile phone data. Study Design A cross-sectional study of state-level mobility changes across the US. Methods State-level mobility was based on anonymous mobile phone data from multiple participating carriers collected by the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (http://www.healthdata.org). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between political affiliations and mobility restriction across states. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess other factors that may impact personal travel. Results All states experienced a decline in personal mobility but had varying nadirs ranging from a 34% to 69% reduction in mobility which was not temporally related to the timing of state-level NPI measures. There was a statistically significant linear and negative correlation of r= -0.79 between the proportion of Republicans/leaning Republicans and NPI adherence across US states. The negative association between Republicans and NPI adherence was significant even when adjusting for urbanization, proportion of essential workers, population, Gini index, and poverty rates. Conclusions Political orientation affects risk perception, which may contribute to the unwillingness of some individuals to perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as a risk and to comply with NPIs. Our results highlight the importance of socio-political factors in disease control and emphasizes the importance of bipartisan efforts in fighting the pandemic. These results may have implications for the development, dissemination, and communication of public health policies.","Hsiehchen, David; Espinoza, Magdalena; Slovic, Paul",Public Health,506,24

India has high patient to rheumatologist ratio, and patients have limited concepts about telemedicine. Thus, we attempted to find the feasibility and acceptance of patients in switching to teleconsultation. The CARE rheumatology clinic at Kerala, India, caters to average 170 (range: 140–240) patients per day. Patients with prefixed appointments had two-level screening for eligibility for teleconsultation. Those eligible were given the option for teleconsultation on the widely available WhatsApp app. Of those who completed teleconsultations, 100 were chosen at random to provide feedback. In the first 7 days, out of 1469 appointments, 975 were found eligible for teleconsultation. Of these, 723 (74%) opted for it. The average footfall in the clinic was reduced to 67 (range 29–117). The proportion of patients accepting teleconsultations increased with time. Amongst the 100 respondents, median satisfaction was 9 (IQR 8–10) and recommendation for continuing was 9.5 (IQR 8–10) on a 0–10 scale. Multivariate analysis showed the recommendation score was dependent on beliefs about social distancing, perceptions about clinical examination, and the satisfaction score of the first teleconsultation. Age, sex, availability of personal video conferencing app or of vehicles did not independently influence this score. Without teleconsultation facilities, three-fourths of the respondents would have stopped drugs or self-medicated. The switch was feasible and accepted by patients. It enabled quick reduction in the number of persons travelling to the centre. Not making the switch could have deprived approximately three-quarters of these patients of proper medical care.

Research over the last decades has identified an additional role of lipids in cellular signaling, membrane microdomain organization and dynamics, and membrane trafficking. These properties make lipids an attractive target for pathogens to modulate host cell processes in order to allow their survival and replication. In this review we will summarize the often ingenious strategies of pathogens to modify the lipid homeostasis of host cells, allowing them to divert cellular processes. To this end pathogens take full advantage of the complexity of the lipidome. The examples are categorized in generalized and emerging principles describing the involvement of lipids in host–pathogen interactions. Several pathogens are described that simultaneously induce multiple changes in the host cell signaling and trafficking mechanisms. Elucidation of these pathogen-induced changes may have important implications for drug development. The emergence of high-throughput lipidomic techniques will allow the description of changes of the host cell lipidome at the level of individual molecular lipid species and the identification of lipid biomarkers.","van der Meer-Janssen, Ynske P.M.; van Galen, Josse; Batenburg, Joseph J.; Helms, J.

This paper uses data from the American Time Use Survey to explore the relationship between daily work locations and travel in the United States from 2003 to 2017. Outcome variables include travel duration and travel during peak periods. Home is by far the most common non-office work location, but working from other people’s homes, cafés/libraries, vehicles, and combinations of multiple locations are also measured. Findings show that working from home only on a day (full-day telework) decreases daily travel duration and increases the likelihood of avoiding peak hour travel for both work and non-work related travel. However, for homeworkers who also conduct work from their workplace on the same day (part-day telework), there is no reduction in daily travel time, and avoiding peak hour travel is limited to work-related travel. Working from other locations such as cafés/libraries or vehicles increases the likelihood of not traveling at peak hours. Findings also indicate that morning peak periods are more affected by work location decisions than evening peak periods. A survival analysis of daily departure times for both full-day and part-day homeworkers provides insight into this mechanism. We conclude on the basis of these findings that demand management policies and peak avoidance incentives would be more effective if they encourage both temporal and spatial flexibility for employees when partnering with regional employers.","Stiles, Jonathan; Smart, Michael J.",Transportation (Amst),506,16

By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic β cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6–phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by ∼90% as the granules mature. Concomitantly, in exocrine secretory cells lysosomal proenzymes enter and then are sorted out of IGs, just as was previously observed in β cells (Kuliawat, R., J. Klumperman, T. Ludwig, and P. Arvan. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 137:595–608). The exit of MPRs in AP-1/clathrin-coated buds is selective, indicated by the fact that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. We have also made the first observation of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, syntaxin 6, which has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking from the TGN to endosomes (Bock, J.B., J. Klumperman, S. Davanger, and R.H. Scheller. 1997. Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:1261–1271) that enters and then exits the regulated secretory pathway during granule maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR–ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.","Klumperman, Judith; Kuliawat, Regina; Griffith, Janice M.; Geuze, Hans J.; Arvan, Peter",J Cell Biol,506,16

We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (>80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M = 0.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences.

In this study, two advanced deep learning neural networks called recurrent neural network (RNN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) were implemented in the simulation and prediction of limestone price variation. The RNN uses long short-term memory layers (LSTM), dropout regularization, activation functions, mean square error (MSE), and the Adam optimizer to simulate the predictions. The LSTM stores previous data over time and uses it in simulating future prices based on defined parameters and algorithms. The ARIMA model is a statistical method that captures different time series based on the level, trend, and seasonality of the data. The auto ARIMA function searches for the best parameters that fit the model. Different layers and parameters are added to the model to simulate the price prediction. The performance of both network models is remarkable in terms of trend variability and factors affecting limestone price. The ARIMA model has an accuracy of 95.7% while RNN has an accuracy of 91.8%. This shows that the ARIMA model outperforms the RNN model. In addition, the time required to train the ARIMA is than that of the RNN.

OBJECTIVE To review current knowledge on sexual health-related containment measures during pandemics, specifically COVID-19, and focus on 2 main areas: intimacy and relational dynamics and clinical effects on sexual health. METHODS We carried out a literature search encompassing sexual health and pandemic issues using Entrez-PubMed and Google Scholar. We reviewed the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual health regarding transmission and safe sex practices, pregnancy, dating and intimacy amid the pandemic, benefits of sex, and impact on sexual dysfunctions. RESULTS Coronavirus transmission occurs via inhalation and touching infected surfaces. Currently, there is no evidence it is sexually transmitted, but there are sexual behaviors that pose a higher risk of infectivity due to asymptomatic carriers. Nonmonogamy plays a key role in transmission hubs. New dating possibilities and intimacy issues are highlighted. Sexual activity has a positive impact on the immune response, psychological health, and cognitive function and could mitigate psychosocial stressors. COVID-19 pandemic affects indirectly the sexual function with implications on overall health. CONCLUSION Increased awareness of health-care providers on sexual health implications related to the COVID-19 pandemic is needed. Telemedicine has an imperative role in allowing continued support at times of lockdown and preventing worsening of the sexual, mental, and physical health after the pandemic. This is a broad overview addressing sexual issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As this is an unprecedented global situation, little is known on sexuality related to pandemics.

The aim of this study is to assess clinical profiles of COVID-19 in family clusters with children. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of English database (PubMed, Web of Science) and Chinese database (“www.cnki.net”, “www.cqvip.com” and “www.Wanfangdata.com.cn”) to identify papers on family clusters of COVID-19 with children and their family members. RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 34 children and 98 adults from 28 families were included. Fever, cough and ground-grass opacity change of chest computed tomography (CT) were the dominant features, whereas proportion of asymptomatic infections for children was higher than adults with statistical significance (32.4% and 13.3%, respectively, P < 0.05). Median time of longer incubation period (10 days) and shorter duration of pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test positive period (11 days) were seen in children than adults (7 and 17 days, respectively) with statistical significance (P < 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in lymphopenia, increased C-reactive protein and abnormal chest CT between children and adult patients (P < 0.05). Twenty-seven families reported adults as first case of COVID-19 in family clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The same virus strain can cause milder disease in children compared with their caregivers. Children of COVID-19 were infected by adults in family during the early epidemic period. Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of climate with the spread of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study examined climate data from 50 cities worldwide with and without substantial community spread of COVID-19. Eight cities with substantial spread of COVID-19 (Wuhan, China; Tokyo, Japan; Daegu, South Korea; Qom, Iran; Milan, Italy; Paris, France; Seattle, US; and Madrid, Spain) were compared with 42 cities that have not been affected or did not have substantial community spread. Data were collected from January to March 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Substantial community transmission was defined as at least 10 reported deaths in a country as of March 10, 2020. Climate data (latitude, mean 2-m temperature, mean specific humidity, and mean relative humidity) were obtained from ERA-5 reanalysis. RESULTS: The 8 cities with substantial community spread as of March 10, 2020, were located on a narrow band, roughly on the 30° N to 50° N corridor. They had consistently similar weather patterns, consisting of mean temperatures of between 5 and 11 °C, combined with low specific humidity (3-6 g/kg) and low absolute humidity (4-7 g/m(3)). There was a lack of substantial community establishment in expected locations based on proximity. For example, while Wuhan, China (30.8° N) had 3136 deaths and 80 757 cases, Moscow, Russia (56.0° N), had 0 deaths and 10 cases and Hanoi, Vietnam (21.2° N), had 0 deaths and 31 cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the distribution of substantial community outbreaks of COVID-19 along restricted latitude, temperature, and humidity measurements was consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Using weather modeling, it may be possible to estimate the regions most likely to be at a higher risk of substantial community spread of COVID-19 in the upcoming weeks, allowing for concentration of public health efforts on surveillance and containment.","Sajadi, Mohammad M.; Habibzadeh, Parham; Vintzileos, Augustin; Shokouhi, Shervin; Miralles-Wilhelm, Fernando; Amoroso, Anthony",JAMA Netw Open,506,16

Our study sought to compare disease severity measures for patients in Ireland hospitalised with COVID-19 against those hospitalised with seasonal influenza. Study Design Retrospective population-based cohort study. Methods COVID-19 hospital episodes and seasonal influenza hospital episodes were identified using relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes in the Irish national hospitalisation dataset. Occurrence of key metrics of disease severity, length of stay, intensive care admission, ventilatory support, haemodialysis and in-hospital mortality were measured and compared between the two groups using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, stratified by age. Results Hospitalised COVID-19 episodes had a mean length of stay more than twice as long as hospitalised influenza episodes (17.7 days vs. 8.3 days). The likelihood of all measures of disease severity were greater in COVID-19 episodes, and the odds of in-hospital mortality were five-fold higher in this group compared with seasonal influenza episodes (OR 5.07, 95% C.I. 4.29-5.99, p<0.001). Greater likelihood of increased disease severity was observed for COVID-19 episodes in most age groups. Conclusions COVID-19 is a more severe illness than seasonal influenza in hospitalised cohorts. It is imperative that public health professionals ensure evidence-based advocacy is part of the response to COVID-19 to tackle a dangerous “infodemic” which can undermine public health control measures.","Beatty, Kenneth; Hamilton, Vida; Kavanagh, Paul M.",Public Health,506,24

Blood 2020). Furthermore, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been described as a common complication among patients with COVID-19 (Tang et al. J Thromb Haemost 2020). Patients with a history of HM who contract SARS-CoV-2 may be at an even higher risk for VTE, given their elevated baseline VTE risk; however, there is limited clinical data for this patient population. Therefore, we performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and a history of HM. Methods: A REDCap database was created using all patients who were evaluated in the emergency department or admitted to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital/Washington Hospital Center with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test between March and May 2020. Data extraction was performed on all patients to identify demographic and clinical parameters. All data collected reflects clinical encounters related to COVID-19 infection. Our primary end-point was rate of VTE and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in patients with HM compared to the general population. Secondary outcomes assessed were COVID-19 related mortality, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates, and length of ICU stay. Continuous variables were summarized by median quartiles (Q1 and Q3) and categorical variables were summarized by frequency counts and percentages for each category. The two-sample t-test for continuous variables and binomial exact test or Pearson chi square test for categorical variables were conducted to compare the means/distributions of each variable between HM patients and the general population, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to evaluate and compare the median overall survival (OS) between the two groups, exclusively for patients who died from COVID-19, censored at 28 days from admission. Results: As of July 1st, 2020, 737 pts with COVID-19 have been identified and included in this preliminary analysis. Twenty-two pts had a HM: plasma cell dyscrasia (n=7, 31.8%; multiple myeloma n=6, MGUS n=1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=3, 13.6%), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=2, 9.1%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=2, 9.1%), hodgkin’s lymphoma (n=2, 9.1%), and one patient (4.5%) with each of the following malignancies: acute promyelocytic leukemia, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. With respect to HM treatment status, the majority of the patients were in surveillance (n=14, 63.6%); the other eight (36.4%) were on active treatment at time of COVID-19 infection. In patients who had a remission status documented, eight showed complete remission (36.4%), five with partial remission (22.7%), and one patient with progressive disease (4.5%). Six patients (27.3%) either did not yet have a remission status evaluated or were treatment naïve. The HM cohort was found to be older (median age 72 vs. 55) and have a higher rate of historical VTE prior to COVID-19 infection (18.2% vs. 4.3%). Other demographic data for the HM cohort and the general population can be found in Table 1. CVA was more prevalent in the HM cohort compared to our general population cohort (11.1% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.048). Rates of VTE were not statistically different between the two groups (5.6% vs. 3.6%, p=0.494). A higher percentage of HM pts required ICU admission (40.9% vs. 19.2%, p = 0.0246). Our data suggested a trend towards higher rate of case fatality in the HM cohort (27.3% vs. 11.2%, p = 0.069) and a trend towards longer duration of ICU admission (9 days vs. 5 days, p=0.756). The median OS in fatal COVID-19 infection (Figure 1) was 9.5 days (95% CI, 7 to NA) in the HM cohort compared to 9 days (95% CI, 7 to 10, p=0.891) for the general population. Conclusion: Our preliminary findings suggest among patients with COVID-19, there is an increased incidence of CVA in HM patients, but similar rates of VTE when compared to the general population. Our HM cohort had higher rates of ICU admission, but did not have a statistically significant mortality difference at 28 days. Data collection is ongoing, final analysis will be completed with a larger cohort of HM patients.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was performed at a large paediatric academic institution to identify patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a screening electrocardiogram by their primary care providers and were subsequently referred for outpatient cardiology consultation due to an abnormal electrocardiogram. The outcomes were the results from their cardiology evaluations, including testing and final diagnoses. RESULTS: Among 46 patients, during their preceding COVID-19 illness, the majority had mild symptoms, 4 were asymptomatic, and 1 had moderate symptoms. The median length of time from positive SARS-CoV-2 test to screening electrocardiogram was 22 days, and many electrocardiogram findings that prompted cardiology consultation were normal variants in asymptomatic adolescent athletes. Patients underwent frequent additional testing at their cardiology appointments: repeat electrocardiogram (72%), echocardiogram (59%), Holter monitor (11%), exercise stress test (7%), and cardiac MRI (2%). Five patients were incidentally diagnosed with CHD or structural cardiac abnormalities, and three patients had conduction abnormalities (pre-mature atrial contractions, pre-mature ventricular contractions, borderline prolonged QTc), although potentially incidental to COVID-19. No patients were diagnosed with myocarditis or ventricular dysfunction. CONCLUSION: In a small cohort of children with prior COVID-19, who were primarily either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, subsequent screening electrocardiograms identified various potential abnormalities prompting cardiology consultation, but no patient was diagnosed with myocarditis. Larger multi-centre studies are necessary to confirm these results and to evaluate those with more severe disease.","Gartenberg, Ari J.; White, Travus J.; Dang, Khoi; Shah, Maully; Paridon, Stephen M.; Elias, Matthew D.",Cardiol Young,506,2

METHOD: A representative sample of 1,055 English‐speaking Canadians (18+ years) completed measures of MVPA during the COVID‐19 restrictions and reflecting on MVPA prior to these restrictions, as well as demographics, COVID‐19‐related cognitions and behavior (i.e. perceived threat, social distancing), psychological factors (e.g. personality traits, habit, identity, strategic planning), social factors (e.g. dependent children, co‐habitation), home environment affordances (exercise equipment, programming) and the neighborhood environment (e.g. access to outdoor recreation, neighborhood safety). RESULTS: Participants perceived that they had decreased weekly MVPA (p < .01) and the availability of home equipment and strategic planning were critical predictors (p < .01). Profiles by MVPA guidelines, however, showed that 58 per cent of the sample had not changed and 6 per cent had increased MVPA. Identity was the critical predictor of the different MVPA profiles, followed by habit, extraversion, availability of home equipment, and the age of the participant (p < .01). CONCLUSION: Pandemic restrictions have affected the MVPA of many Canadians, and variables across the socio‐ecological spectrum explain who has been able to maintain MVPA during this unprecedented time.","Rhodes, Ryan E.; Liu, Sam; Lithopoulos, Alexander; Zhang, Chun‐Qing; Garcia‐Barrera, Mauricio A.",Appl Psychol Health Well Being,506,9

Therefore, knowing the status of HCPs’ perception about symptoms, transmission, preventive measures, and attitudes towards a vaccine against COVID-19 is crucial. METHODS: This multi-center cross-sectional descriptive study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh among the HCPs - doctors, nurses, and other subordinates (MLSS) engaged at COVID-dedicated hospitals. The study was conducted from February 5, 2021, to March 7, 2021, using a convenience sampling method among 550 HCPs using structured questionnaire with twenty-five questions on a three-point scale of responses. RESULTS: The age range of the respondents were 18 to 64 years with the mean 36.17 ±10.94 years of 524 HCPs, of which the majority of the respondents were female 323 (61.6%) and 201 (38.4%) were male with the 95.27% response rate. Almost all participants had “high” or more than sufficient perception (94.34%) about the symptoms of COVID-19. But all categories of HCPs expressed their poor or fair practice about restraining from shaking hands, and only 6.84% of nurses, 8.33% doctors, and 11.59% of MLSS avoided crowded public gatherings as a practice of prevention. A majority (95.99%) of the HCPs showed positive attitudes about the availability of vaccines free of cost, and 87.40% showed trust in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of the HCPs from the COVID-dedicated hospitals have a good perception and positive attitude towards vaccination; nevertheless, have a poor practice of prevention toward COVID-19. This may play a vital role in motivation and wide acceptance of vaccine among the general population and contribute in comprehensive strategic planning to fight back against the pandemic in the country with the restricted resource.","Nasir, Morshed; Zaman, Md Anisuz; Majumder, Touhidul Karim; Ahmed, Faruque; Nazneen, Rumana; Omar, Eliza; Perveen, Rawshan Ara; Farha, Nadia; Zahan, Tahmina; Hossain, Mir Jakib; Parvin, Sultana; Chowdhury, Moshfiqur Rahman; Begum, Hasina",Infect Drug Resist,506,24

The ability to isolate whole virus represents a better proxy for infectivity. AIM: The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the current literature and compare the reported periods of positive SARS-CoV-2 detection from studies that conducted RT-PCR testing in addition to experiments isolating whole virus. METHODS: Using a rapid review approach, studies reporting empirical data on the duration of positive RT-PCR results and/or successful viral isolation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans were identified through searches of peer-reviewed and pre-print health sciences literature. Articles were screened for relevance, then data were extracted, analysed, and synthesised. RESULTS: Of the 160 studies included for qualitative analysis, 84% (n = 135) investigated duration of positive RT-PCR tests only, 5% (n = 8) investigated duration of successful viral isolations, while 11% (n = 17) included measurements on both. There was significant heterogeneity in reported data. There was a prolonged time to viral clearance when deduced from RT-PCR tests compared with viral isolations (median: 26 vs 9 days). DISCUSSION: Findings from this review support a minimum 10-day period of isolation but certain cases where virus was isolated after 10 days were identified. Given the extended time to viral clearance from RT-PCR tests, future research should ensure standard reporting of RT-PCR protocols and results to help inform testing policies aimed at clearance from isolation.","Park, Mina; Pawliuk, Colleen; Nguyen, Tribesty; Griffitt, Amanda; Dix-Cooper, Linda; Fourik, Nadia; Dawes, Martin",Euro Surveill,506,29

Methods: We designed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in three teaching hospitals of Castilla y Leon, Spain (865.096 people). We selected patients with confirmed COVID-19 and lung involvement with a pO2/FiO2 < 300, excluding those exposed to immunosuppressors before or during hospitalization, patients terminally ill at admission, or died the first 24 hours. We performed a propensity score matching (PSM) adjusting covariates that modify the probability of being treated. Then we used a Cox regression model in the PSM group to consider factors affecting mortality. Results: From 2933 patients, 257 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 124 patients were on corticosteroid pulses, and 133 were not. 30,3% (37/122) of patients died in the corticosteroid pulses group and 42,9% (57/133) in the non-exposed cohort. These differences (12,6%) were statically significant (log-rank 4.72, p=0,03). We performed PSM using the exact method. Mortality differences remained in the PSM group (log-rank 5.31, p=0,021) and were still significant after a Cox regression model (HR for corticosteroid pulses 0,561, p= 0,039). There were no significant differences in intensive care admission rate (p=0,173). The hospital stay was longer in the corticosteroid group (p<0,001). Conclusions: This study provides evidence about treatment with corticosteroid pulses in severe COVID-19 that might significantly reduce mortality.

For this purpose, we have analyzed the results of molecular dynamics simulations where all possible conformational and aggregational space was systematically explored. Two main assumptions were considered; the first is that protein E contains one transmembrane α-helical domain, with its N- and C-termini located in opposite faces of the lipid bilayer. The second is that protein E forms the same type of transmembrane oligomer and with identical backbone structure in different coronaviruses. The models arising from the molecular dynamics simulations were tested for evolutionary conservation using 13 coronavirus protein E homologous sequences. It is extremely unlikely that if any of our assumptions were not correct we would find a persistent structure for all the sequences tested. We show that a low energy dimeric, trimeric and two pentameric models appear to be conserved through evolution, and are therefore likely to be present in vivo. In support of this, we have observed only dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric aggregates for the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E in SDS. The models obtained point to residues essential for protein E oligomerization in the life cycle of the SARS virus, specifically N15. In addition, these results strongly support a general model where transmembrane domains transiently adopt many aggregation states necessary for function.","Torres, Jaume; Wang, Jifeng; Parthasarathy, Krupakar; Liu, Ding Xiang",Biophysical Journal,506,1

The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate the performance characteristics of a new Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) regarding Sars-CoV-2 detection in clinical samples and its potential to be used as a point of care test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All tests were performed using a custom portable hardware device developed by EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS (EMBIO DIAGNOSTICS Ltd, Cyprus). 110 positive and 136 negative samples tested by RT-PCR were used in order to define the lower limit of detection (L.O.D.) of the system, as well as the sensitivity and the specificity of the method. RESULTS: The system was able to detect a viral concentration of 4 genome copies/μL. The method displayed total sensitivity of 92.7% (95%CI: 86.2-96.8) and 97.8% specificity (95%CI: 93.7-99.5). When samples were grouped according to the recorded Ct values the BERA biosensor displayed 100.00% sensitivity (95%CI: 84.6-100.0) for Ct values <20-30. For the aforementioned Ct values the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the method was estimated at 31.4% for COVID-19 prevalence of 1% and at 70.5% for 5% prevalence. At the same time the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the BERA biosensor was at 100.0% for both prevalence rates.

In the context of surging mental health needs and historically limited feasibility of traditional office-based services, telehealth has launched into the clinical mainstream and has become a dominant mode of outpatient mental health care delivery during the pandemic. The articles in this terrific Special Issue outlined some of the field’s most exciting innovations from the past 18 months. The present commentary discusses how these unprecedented times have prompted unprecedented resourcefulness and innovation in the field. Issues related to evolving and uncertain telehealth regulation and reimbursement policies are discussed, and cautions for the road ahead are offered as we prepare for post-pandemic practices. The commentary concludes with a call to redouble efforts to move beyond the use of telehealth to largely treat only those populations who already enjoyed access to traditional office-based services. Understanding and overcoming barriers to telehealth care and ensuring equitable access to telehealth options are critical steps for actualizing the great potential of telehealth strategies for increasing the reach of supported care to underserved populations.","Comer, Jonathan S.",Cogn Behav Pract,506,5

This makes physical therapy (PT) assessments difficult because of the lack of empirical evidence about the reliability of various clinical measurements performed in a virtual environment. One such procedure is the photometric measurement of craniovertebral (CV) angle. Craniovertebral angle measurement is usually performed in an outpatient setting and is defined as the acute angle formed between a straight line connecting the spinous process of C7 to the tragus of the ear, and the horizontal line passing through the spinous process of the C7. Although the photometric measurement of CV angles is considered both valid and reliable in the clinics, no empirical evidence exists about the CV angle measurement reliability when performed in a virtual environment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the inter- and intra-rater reliability of photometric CV angle measurement using a cloud-based video communication platform. Number of Subjects: 66 subjects (57 females). METHODS: All measurements were performed by two final year PT students who had completed the musculoskeletal part of the curriculum and were blinded to each other's measurements. Each subject was photographed in two postures over a HIPAA-compliant video-based telehealth platform: (1) normal/relaxed posture and (2) ideal posture (posture the subject considered good). Student researcher 1 measured the CV angle in both the relaxed posture and ideal posture, while student researcher 2 measured the CV angle only in the relaxed posture. Each subject's CV angle measurement was performed three times on three separate days and the means were used for further analysis. The shape of the CV angle frequency distribution was assessed using kurtosis and skewness values. Rater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and interpreted based on the guidelines provided by Portney and Watkins (2009). RESULTS: The CV angles were normally distributed in both relaxed and ideal postures. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of relaxed posture was 50.7o ± 6.3o with kurtosis and skewness of 0.67 and −0.74 respectively. The mean and SD of ideal posture was 55.5o ± 5.4o, with kurtosis and skewness of 0.1 and −0.54 respectively. The ICC for inter-rater reliability in the relaxed posture was 0.88 and the ICC for intra-rater reliability for relaxed posture was 0.91. CONCLUSIONS: Craniovertebral angles were normally distributed in the sample. An acceptable level of inter- and intra-rater reliability can be attained when measuring CV angle using a cloud-based video communication platform.","Cote, Rylan; Vietas, Cassandra; Kolakowski, Megan; Lombardo, Kayla; Prete, Jacob; Dashottar, Amit",International journal of telerehabilitation,506,21

This research letter presents a cluster of severe medical conditions that were delayed in diagnosis due to postponed presentation to healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ewing sarcoma, severe hemolytic anemia, endocarditis requiring surgery, and septic hip requiring surgery are some examples of cases we encountered with delayed diagnoses. This led to the appearance of a rather low burden of disease in the pediatric population during the pandemic, and pediatric hospitals and clinics experienced a very low volume of activity. Given the low burden of COVID-19 in children, and the well-defined separation between infected and non-infected areas within the hospitals, we should consider improving the guidelines and messages conveyed to the public regarding the importance of prompt medical assessment for other medical conditions, even during a pandemic, along with reassurance of the safety of entering medical facilities given the strict isolation procedures being observed. Conclusion: Medical associations should reconsider the messages being sent to the public during future outbreaks, and encourage medical assessment.","Yeshayahu, Yonatan",Rambam Maimonides Med J,506,21

Of specific interest is a new variant, which was observed in England during December 2020 and is now termed B.1.1.7. This variant is now associated with increased infectivity and therefore its spread within the community is of great importance. The Israeli government established three noteworthy programs namely, mass PCR testing, focused protection of the elderly and more recently an unparalleled prioritized vaccination program. In this study we analyzed primary data of >300,000 RT-PCR samples collected throughout December 6th 2020 until February 10th 2021 in the general community and nursing homes. We identified that within a period of six weeks, the B.1.1.7 variant was capable of out competing the wildtype SARS-CoV-2 strain to become the main strain. Furthermore, we show that the transmission of B.1.1.7 in the 60+ population reached a near complete halt, due to an ongoing surveillance testing program in nursing homes and the vaccination program of Israel. Thus, proactive protection programs such as routine surveillance and monitoring of populations at risk combined with prioritized vaccination, is achievable and will result in a reduction of severe illness and subsequent death.","Munitz, A.; Yechezkel, M.; Dickstein, Y.; Yamin, D.; Gerlic, M.",,506,6

Individuals infected by the virus exhibited different degrees of symptoms, the basis of which remains largely unclear. Currently, though convalescent individuals have been shown with both cellular and humoral immune responses, there is very limited understanding on the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses, in patients with severe COVID-19. Here, we examined 10 blood samples from COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The majority of them (70%) mounted SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity with production of neutralizing antibodies. However, compared to healthy controls, the percentages and absolute numbers of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, accompanied with decreased IFNg expression in CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood from severe patients. Most notably, we failed in detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNg production by peripheral blood lymphocytes from these patients. Our work thus indicates that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms are associated with defective cellular immunity, which not only provides insights on understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, but also has implications in developing an effective vaccine to SARS-CoV-2.","Ni, L.; Cheng, M.-L.; Zhao, H.; Feng, Y.; Liu, J.; Ye, F.; Ye, Q.; Zhu, G.; Li, X.; Wang, P.; Shao, J.; Deng, Y.-q.; Wei, P.; Chen, F.; Qin, C.-f.; Wang, G.; Li, F.; Zeng, H.; Dong, C.",,506,1

Alternative models are being explored to better meet the needs of patients and providers. OB Nest is a telemedicine-enhanced program with a reduced frequency of in-person prenatal visits. The cost implications of connected care services added to prenatal care packages are unclear. METHODS: Using data from the OB Nest randomized, controlled trial we analyzed the provider and staff time associated with prenatal care in the traditional and OB Nest models. Fewer visits were required for OB Nest, but given the compensatory increase in connected care activity and supplies, the actual cost difference is not known. Nursing and provider staff time was prospectively recorded for all patients enrolled in the OB Nest clinical trial. Published 2015 national wages for healthcare workers were used to calculate the actual labor cost of providing either traditional or OB Nest prenatal care in 2015 US dollars. Overhead expenses and opportunity costs were not considered. RESULTS: Total provider cost was decreased caring for the OB Nest participants, but nursing cost was increased. OB Nest care required an average of 160.8 (+/− 45.0) minutes provider time and 237 (+/− 25.1) minutes nursing time, compared to 215.0 (+/− 71.6) and 99.6 (+/− 29.7) minutes for traditional prenatal care (P < 0.01). This translated into decreased provider cost and increased nursing cost (P < 0.01). Supply costs increased, travel costs declined, and overhead costs declined in the OB Nest model. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, labor cost for OB Nest prenatal care was 34% higher than for traditional prenatal care. The increased cost is largely attributable to additional nursing connected care time, and in some practice settings may be offset by decreased overhead costs and increased provider billing opportunities. Future efforts will be focused on development of digital solutions for some routine nursing tasks to decrease the overall cost of the model.

METHODS: All emergency medical services (EMS) transports for chest pain or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the Dutch region Hollands-Midden (population served > 800,000) were evaluated during the initial 6 weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown and during the same time period in 2019. The primary endpoint was the number of evaluated chest pain patients in both cohorts. In addition, the number of EMS evaluations of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and OHCA were assessed. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the EMS evaluated 927 chest pain patients (49% male, age 62 ± 17 years) compared with 1041 patients (51% male, 63 ± 17 years) in the same period in 2019, which corresponded with a significant relative risk (RR) reduction of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81–0.96). Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the number of STEMI patients (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32–0.85), the incidence of OHCA remained unchanged (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.83–1.83). CONCLUSION: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with chest pain or STEMI evaluated by the EMS, while the incidence of OHCA remained similar. Although the reason for the decrease in chest pain and STEMI consultations is not entirely clear, more attention should be paid to the importance of contacting the EMS in case of suspected cardiac symptoms in possible future lockdowns.

WTELS accounted for the high effect size for lower working memory deficits and medium effect size for lower inhibition deficits. In path analysis, the effects of WTELS on decreased WMD were direct, while its effects on the ID were indirect.

We show that the envelope glycoprotein Gn of hantaviruses binds genomic RNA through its cytoplasmic tail (CT). The nucleic acid binding of Gn-CT is unspecific, as demonstrated by interactions with unrelated RNA and with single-stranded DNA. Peptide scan and protein deletions of Gn-CT mapped the nucleic acid binding to regions that overlap with the previously characterized N protein binding sites and demonstrated the carboxyl-terminal part of Gn-CT to be the most potent nucleic acid-binding site. We conclude that recognition of the RNP complex by the Gn-CT could be mediated by interactions with both genomic RNA and the N protein. This would provide the required selectivity for the genome packaging of hantaviruses.","Strandin, Tomas; Hepojoki, Jussi; Wang, Hao; Vaheri, Antti; Lankinen, Hilkka",Virology,506,26

Currently CAD is defined as a chronic, clonal lymphoproliferative disorder, while the presence of cold agglutinins underlying other diseases is known as cold agglutinin syndrome. AIHA is mediated by autoantibodies directed against red blood cells (RBCs) causing premature erythrocyte destruction. The pathogenesis of AIHA is complex and still not fully understood. Recent studies indicate the involvement of T and B cell dysregulation, reduced CD4+ and CD25+ Tregs, increased clonal expansions of CD8 + T cells, imbalance of Th17/Tregs and Tfh/Tfr, and impaired lymphocyte apoptosis. Changes in some RBC membrane structures, under the influence of mechanical stimuli or oxidative stress, may promote autohemolysis. The clinical presentation and treatment of AIHA are influenced by many factors, including the type of AIHA, degree of hemolysis, underlying diseases, presence of concomitant comorbidities, bone marrow compensatory abilities and the presence of fibrosis and dyserthropoiesis. The main treatment for AIHA is based on the inhibition of autoantibody production by mono- or combination therapy using GKS and/or rituximab and, rarely, immunosuppressive drugs or immunomodulators. Reduction of erythrocyte destruction via splenectomy is currently the third line of treatment for warm AIHA. Supportive treatment including vitamin supplementation, recombinant erythropoietin, thrombosis prophylaxis and the prevention and treatment of infections is essential. New groups of drugs that inhibit immune responses at various levels are being developed intensively, including inhibition of antibody-mediated RBCs phagocytosis, inhibition of B cell and plasma cell frequency and activity, inhibition of IgG recycling, immunomodulation of T lymphocytes function, and complement cascade inhibition. Recent studies have brought about changes in classification and progress in understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of AIHA, although there are still many issues to be resolved, particularly concerning the impact of age-associated changes to immunity.","Michalak, Sylwia Sulimiera; Olewicz-Gawlik, Anna; Rupa-Matysek, Joanna; Wolny-Rokicka, Edyta; Nowakowska, Elżbieta; Gil, Lidia",Immun Ageing,506,8

However, it is yet unclear whether sex hormones are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we analysed sex hormone levels (estradiol and testosterone) of male and female COVID-19 patients (n = 50) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in comparison to control non-COVID-19 patients at the ICU (n = 42), non-COVID-19 patients with the most prevalent comorbidity (coronary heart diseases) present within the COVID-19 cohort (n = 39) and healthy individuals (n = 50). We detected significantly elevated estradiol levels in critically ill male COVID-19 patients compared to all control cohorts. Testosterone levels were significantly reduced in critically ill male COVID-19 patients compared to control cohorts. No statistically significant differences in sex hormone levels were detected in critically ill female COVID-19 patients, albeit similar trends towards elevated estradiol levels were observed. Linear regression analysis revealed that among a broad range of cytokines and chemokines analysed, IFN-γ levels are positively associated with estradiol levels in male and female COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, male COVID-19 patients with elevated estradiol levels were more likely to receive ECMO treatment. Thus, we herein identified that disturbance of sex hormone metabolism might present a hallmark in critically ill male COVID-19 patients.","Schroeder, Maria; Schaumburg, Berfin; Mueller, Zacharias; Parplys, Ann; Jarczak, Dominik; Roedl, Kevin; Nierhaus, Axel; de Heer, Geraldine; Grensemann, Joern; Schneider, Bettina; Stoll, Fabian; Bai, Tian; Jacobsen, Henning; Zickler, Martin; Stanelle-Bertram, Stephanie; Klaetschke, Kristin; Renné, Thomas; Meinhardt, Andreas; Aberle, Jens; Hiller, Jens; Peine, Sven; Kreienbrock, Lothar; Klingel, Karin; Kluge, Stefan; Gabriel, Guelsah",Emerging microbes & infections,506,32

In response, a decision was made by the neonatal neuro-developmental follow up (NNFU) clinic staff to select patients with scheduled appointments to have a mail/telephone assessment using Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) or to postpone/skip their visit. The objective of this study was to compare the developmental assessment and its outcome in two groups of NNFU clinic patients, SARS versus non-SARS, over three standard clinic appointments. METHODS: We compared the diagnostic accuracy (identification of developmental delay), and patient management (referral for therapy or communication of a new diagnosis) of the strategies used during SARS, April/May 2003, to the standard assessment methods used for patients seen in April/May 2005 (non-SARS). In all cases data were obtained for 3 patient visits: before, during and after these 2 months and were compared using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: There were 95 patients in the SARS group and 99 non-SARS patients. The gestational age, sex, entry diagnosis and age at the clinic visit was not different between the groups. The NNFU clinic staff mailed ASQ to 27 families during SARS, 17 (63%) were returned, and 8 of the 17 were then contacted by telephone. Criteria used to identify infants at risk selected for either mailed ASQ or phone interviews were not clearly defined in the patients' charts. There was a significant under identification of developmental delay during SARS (18% versus 45%). Of those who responded to the mailed questionnaire, referrals for therapy rates were similar to non-SARS group. The lost to follow up rate was 24% for the SARS group compared with 7% for non-SARS. There was no difference in the overall rate of developmental delay in the two groups as identified at the 'after' visit. CONCLUSIONS: Poor advanced planning led to a haphazard assessment of patients during this infectious disease outbreak. Future pandemic plans should consider planning for outpatient care as well as in hospital management of patients.","Nasef, Nehad; O'Brien, Karel; Wylie, Lesley; Unger, Sharon",BMC Pediatr,506,16

Measles virus is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus and a member of the Morbillivirus genus in the family of Paramyxoviridae. Although RNA viruses have high mutation rates, measles virus is an antigenically monotypic virus and the surface proteins responsible for inducing protective immunity have retained their antigenic structure. The public health significance is that measles vaccines developed decades ago from a single measles virus strain remain protective worldwide. Prior to the development and widespread use of measles vaccine, 30 million cases of measles were estimated to occur each year, resulting in more than 1 million deaths. Several live, attenuated measles vaccines are available, either as single-antigen vaccines or in combination with rubella and mumps vaccines (MR and MMR vaccines). Most of the currently used measles vaccines were derived from the Edmonston strain of measles virus that was isolated by Enders and Peebles in 1954. Measles vaccines are recommended for all susceptible children and adults for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. Despite progress in reducing measles mortality, measles remains a major cause of vaccine-preventable death and an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia. The ideal measles vaccine would be inexpensive, safe, heat-stable, immunogenic in neonates or very young infants, and administered as a single dose without needle or syringe. A number of vaccine candidates with some of these characteristics are undergoing preclinical studies, including DNA vaccines and various viral and bacterial vectored vaccines. The high infectivity of measles virus is a characteristic suitable to a biothreat agent. However, increasingly high levels of measles vaccination coverage throughout the world as part of accelerated measles control efforts would protect many from the deliberate use of measles virus as a biothreat agent. Genetic engineering of a measles virus strain that was not neutralized by antibodies induced by the current attenuated measles vaccines would likely have reduced infectivity, as suggested by the fact that wild-type measles viruses have not mutated to alter their neutralizing epitopes. Measles virus meets many of the biological criteria for disease eradication. Measles virus has no nonhuman reservoir, can be accurately diagnosed, and measles vaccination is a highly effective intervention. Where measles virus differs from smallpox and polio viruses is that it is more highly infectious, necessitating higher levels of population immunity to interrupt transmission. It remains unclear whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication, but provision of a second opportunity for measles vaccination likely could be stopped following eradication.","Moss, William J.; Griffin, Diane E.; Feinstone, W.

Even when the pandemic is finally controlled, will COVID-19 survivors face exaggerated internal inflammatory processes, worsening co-morbidities, and increased susceptibility to age-related diseases? Clues for what may happen in post-COVID-19 patients can be elicited from those who recovered from other conditions that lead to similar hyperinflammatory states such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm syndrome, and post-ICU syndrome. The short-and long-term sequalae following recovery from each of these conditions suggests that these syndromes lead to an accelerated state of chronic subclinical systemic inflammation often seen in aging (termed inflammaging) resulting in increased and worsening age-related conditions including frailty even in younger individuals.","Bektas, Arsun; Schurman, Shepherd H.; Franceschi, Claudio; Ferrucci, Luigi",Immun Ageing,506,1

We present the clinical validation of a pH-dependent colorimetric RT-LAMP (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The method revealed a limit of detection of 19.3 viral genomic copies/uL when using RNA extracted samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs collected in guanidine-containing viral transport medium. Typical RT-LAMP reactions were performed at 65 C for 30 min. When compared to RT-qPCR, up to Ct value 32, RT-LAMP presented 97% (87.4-99.4% 95% CI) sensitivity and 100% (86.2-100%) specificity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection targeting N gene. No cross-reactivity was detected when testing other non-SARS-CoV virus, confirming high specificity. The test is compatible with primary RNA extraction free samples. We also demonstrated that colorimetric RT-LAMP can detect SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI), such as variants occurring in Brazil named P.1, P.2, B.1.1.374 and B.1.1.371. The method meets point-of-care requirements and can be deployed in the field for high-throughput COVID-19 testing campaigns, especially in countries where COVID-19 testing efforts are far from ideal to tackle the pandemics.

Studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched normal controls. We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using gene expression microarray to profile essentially all human genes, we observed that 426 probe signals were changed by >2.9-fold in the SPB placentas, compared with the spontaneous term birth (STB) placentas. Among the genes represented by those probes, we observed an over-representation of functions in RNA stabilization, extracellular matrix binding, and acute inflammatory response. Using RT-quantitative PCR, we observed differences in the RNA concentrations of certain genes only between the SPB and STB placentas, but not between the STB and term elective cesarean delivery placentas. Notably, 36 RNA transcripts were observed at placental microarray signals higher than a threshold, which indicated the possibility of their detection in maternal plasma. Among them, the IL1RL1 mRNA was tested in plasma samples taken from 37 women. It was detected in 6 of 10 (60%) plasma samples collected during the presentation of preterm labor (≤32.9 weeks) in women eventually giving SPB, but was detected in only 1 of 27 (4%) samples collected during matched gestational weeks from women with no preterm labor (Fisher exact test, p = 0.00056). CONCLUSION: We have identified 36 SPB-associated RNA transcripts, which are possibly detectable in maternal plasma. We have illustrated that the IL1RL1 mRNA was more frequently detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples collected from women resulting in SPB than the gestational-age matched controls.","Chim, Stephen S.

Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other functional proteins of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. RESULTS: We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most functional proteins of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly in the middle and late phases. No positive selection was found in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV. Furthermore, specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified. CONCLUSION: This extensive evolutionary analysis revealed the stepwise evolution of different functional proteins of SARS-CoVs at different epidemic stages and different hosts. These results support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV originated from bats and that the spill over into civets and humans were more recent events.","Tang, Xianchun; Li, Gang; Vasilakis, Nikos; Zhang, Yuan; Shi, Zhengli; Zhong, Yang; Wang, Lin-Fa; Zhang, Shuyi",BMC Evol Biol,506,9

Carrying segmented RNA genomes, their genetic variability is even higher. We aimed at analyzing the mutational events occurring during the infection of chickens by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. We therefore studied the different sequences of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as two internal proteins, PB2 and NS. Three organs (lung, spleen, brain) were obtained from a chicken, experimentally infected with a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus. Cloning these PCR fragments enabled us to investigate the mutations undergone by the virus after several replicative cycles. The first outcome is the presence of a strong mutational bias, resembling host-driven ADAR1 adenosine deamination, which is responsible for 81% of all mutations. Whereas the frequency of RNA dependent RNA polymerase-related mutations is compatible with the survival of the virus, the ADAR1-like activity usually strongly increases the mutation frequency into a level of “error catastrophe” in theory incompatible with virus survival. Nevertheless, the virus was successfully infective. HPAI H5N1 virus displayed traits in agreement with the quasispecies theory. The role of this quasispecies structure in successful infection and the superposition with the ADAR1-like response is discussed.","Gutiérrez, Ramona Alikiiteaga; Viari, Alain; Godelle, Bernard; Frutos, Roger; Buchy, Philippe",Infect Genet Evol,506,9

Mauritania's first case was confirmed in March 2020. METHODOLOGY: We provide an update of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mauritania as of December 2020, and describe the country's Health System Response. RESULTS: In total, 133,749 diagnostic tests were performed, 14,364 (10.7%) were positive (309 cases/100,000 inhabitants). Case fatality rate was 2.4%. The 20-39 year-olds (41%) and males (59.1%) were most commonly affected. Comorbidities among fatal cases included cardiovascular diseases (44.8%) and diabetes (37.1%). Clinical symptoms included fever (57%), cough (52%), running nose (47%) and headache (26%). After the first case, prevention measures were progressively tightened, and quarantine implemented for all suspected cases. Schools and universities were closed, and flights to Mauritania suspended. Restaurants and cafeterias were closed, and night curfews installed. Friday prayers were suspended nationwide, and movements between regions restricted. These measures helped to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first pandemic wave, which peaked in June 2020 with low rates. However, the number of daily cases reached high levels in December 2020, during the second wave (40.1% of all cases and 48.9% of deaths). During the first wave, there were 38 ICU beds nationwide, but the ICU's capacity increased in short time. CONCLUSIONS: Mauritania has passed through the first pandemic wave with relatively low case fatality rates, currently being at the end of the second wave.

Se necesita un sistema que nos ayude a determinar la prioridad clínica y la selección de la asistencia presencial o telemática para cada paciente y la forma de realizarlas durante la pandemia. El Grupo Español de Linfología (GEL) ha realizado un documento de consenso con recomendaciones basadas en la bibliografía y experiencia clínica, como guía de práctica clínica en el manejo de anomalías linfáticas y lipedema durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Estas recomendaciones deben adaptarse a las características del paciente, las condiciones locales de los centros y las decisiones de los profesionales de la salud. Es un documento de criterios mínimos, sujeto a modificaciones según evolucione la pandemia, los conocimientos científicos y las instrucciones de las autoridades sanitarias. Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge to the management of non-COVID pathologies such as lymphatic diseases and lipoedema. The use of telemedicine can prevent the spread of the disease. A system is needed to help determine the clinical priority and selection of face-to-face or telemedicine options for each patient and how to carry them out during the pandemic. The Spanish Lymphology Group has drafted a consensus document with recommendations based on the literature and clinical experience, as clinical practice guidelines for the management of lymphatic abnormalities and lipoedema during the COVID-19 pandemic. These recommendations must be adapted to the characteristics of each patient, the local conditions of the centres, and the decisions of health care professionals. The document contains minimum criteria, subject to modifications according to the evolution of the pandemic, scientific knowledge and instructions from health authorities.","Forner Cordero, I.; López Martin, M.; Reina Gutiérrez, L.; Belmonte, R.; Ruiz Miñarro, R.; Crespo Cobo, MP; Pardo Sievers, B.; Pujol Blaya, V.; Benadiba, CM; Puigdellivol, C.",Rehabilitacion (Madr),506,23

On admission to PICU, she was drowsy, tachycardic, tachypneic, with rashes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Lab findings showed thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, low ESR, normal CRP, elevated liver enzymes, high ferritin, LDH, and triglycerides suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Chest X-ray showed left basal pneumonia and DNA PCR of throat swab revealed adenovirus. She was diagnosed as adenovirus-triggered MAS and was initiated on pulse methylprednisolone (6 mg/kg). Because of suboptimal response after 2 doses, manifested by increasing drowsiness, further fall in platelets and rising ferritin, methylprednisolone dosage was increased to 30 mg/kg/day with the addition of oral cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day). In view of worsening of the chest X-ray and increasing oxygen requirement, Cidofovir infusion (1 mg/kg thrice weekly) was also started simultaneously considering increased activity of the adenoviral infection concurrent to immunosuppression. Within 48 h, the child showed signs of recovery with improved consciousness, lower oxygen requirements, and improving lab parameters. She was discharged after 3 weeks of IV Cidofovir, on oral prednisolone and cyclosporine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported use of Cidofovir in adenovirus-induced MAS.

Diagnosis can be difficult and is based on an abnormal ciliary beat frequency, accompanied by specific abnormalities of the ciliary axoneme. It is unknown whether determining ciliary beat pattern related to specific ultrastructural ciliary defects might help in the diagnosis of PCD. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine ciliary beat pattern and beat frequency (CBF) associated with the 5 common ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD. METHODS: Nasal brushings were performed on 56 children with PCD. Ciliary movement was recorded using digital high-speed video imaging to assess beat frequency and pattern. Electron microscopy was performed. RESULTS: In patients with an isolated outer dynein arm or with an outer and inner dynein arm defect, 55% and 80% of cilia were immotile, respectively. Cilia that moved were only flickering. Mean CBF (± 95% CI) was 2.3 Hz (± 1.2) and 0.8 Hz(± 0.8), respectively. Cilia with an isolated inner dynein arm or a radial spoke defect had similar beat patterns. Cilia appeared stiff, had a reduced amplitude, and failed to bend along their length. Immotile cilia were present in 10% of cilia with an inner dynein arm defect and in 30% of radial spoke defects. Mean CBF was 9.3 Hz (± 2.6) and 6.0 Hz (± 3.1), respectively. The ciliary transposition defect produced a large circular beat pattern (mean CBF, 10.7 Hz [± 1.1]). No cilia were immotile. CONCLUSIONS: Different ultrastructural defects responsible for PCD result in predictable beat patterns. Recognition of these might help in the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having PCD.","Chilvers, Mark A; Rutman, Andrew; O'Callaghan, Christopher",J Allergy Clin Immunol,506,24

Therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) is of vital importance. There are several methods described in the literature to increase compliance with PPE use and reduce occupational infections. One of those methods is the institution of PPE inspectors that ensure proper adherence to PPE protocols and ultimately improve the outcomes of many HCWs. Methods A team of PPE inspectors was introduced in a tertiary care university hospital, where they randomly evaluated and reinforced PPE use in accordance with the guidelines set by the local health authority. The study period was from the 10th of May 2020 until the 31st of August 2020. The evaluations were divided into three categories; appropriate, missing, or unnecessary use of PPE and were compared to trends in healthcare workers’ COVID-19 infection rates. Results A total of 720 HCWs were evaluated from the 10th of May 2020 until the 31st of August 2020. The appropriate use of PPE increased from 56% to 89% during the study period. Meanwhile, the incidence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs, which has peaked to 31 cases per day on the 18th of May 2020, has been declining to below 5 cases per day towards the end of the study period. Conclusion PPE inspectors’ team served a positive role in increasing compliance with PPE use and was associated with a reduction in the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 among HCWs.","Shehab, Mohammad; Shuaibi, Sameera; Qadhi, Iman; AhmadAlfadhli,",Infection prevention in practice,506,24

This need has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of a mobile health tool as an early intervention before a clinic-based multidisciplinary weight management program could be an effective treatment strategy that is appropriate during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study aims to assess the effectiveness of and adolescent engagement with a mobile app-based lifestyle intervention program as an early intervention before enrollment in a clinic-based multidisciplinary weight management program. METHODS This prospective single-cohort study involved adolescents, aged 10-16 years, who were overweight and obese (defined as BMI percentile above the 85th percentile). Participants used the mobile Kurbo app as an early intervention before enrolling in a clinic-based multidisciplinary weight management program. Kurbo's health coaches provided weekly individual coaching informed by a model of supportive accountability via video chat, and participants self-monitored their health behavior. The implementation of Kurbo as an early intervention was evaluated using the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework by reach (number who consented to participate out of all patients approached), implementation (Kurbo engagement and evaluation), and effectiveness as measured by the primary outcome of the BMI z-score at 3 months. Secondary outcome measures included changes in body fat percentage, nutrition and physical activity levels, and quality of life at 3 months. Maintenance was defined as the outcome measures at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS Of the 73 adolescents who were approached for enrollment, 40 (55%) of adolescents were recruited. The mean age was 13.8 (SD 1.7) years, and the mean BMI z-score was 2.07 (SD 0.30). In the multiethnic Asian sample, 83% (33/40) of the participants had household incomes below the national median. Kurbo engagement was high, with 83% (33/40) of participants completing at least 7 coaching sessions. In total, 78% (18/23) of participants rated the app as good to excellent and 70% (16/23) stated that they would recommend it to others. There were no statistically significant changes in BMI z-scores at 3 months (P=.19) or 6 months (P=.27). Participants showed statistically significant improvements in measured body fat percentage, self-reported quality of life, and self-reported caloric intake from the 3-day food diaries at 3 and 6 months. CONCLUSIONS The use of Kurbo before enrollment in an outpatient multidisciplinary clinical care intervention is a feasible strategy to expand the reach of adolescent obesity management services to a low-income and racially diverse population. Although there was no significant change in BMI z-scores, the use of Kurbo as an early intervention could help to improve quality of life and reduce body fat percentage and total caloric intake.","Chew, Chu Shan Elaine; Davis, Courtney; Lim, Jie Kai Ethel; Lim, Chee Meng Micheal; Tan, Yi Zhen Henny; Oh, Jean Yin; Rajasegaran, Kumudhini; Chia, Yong Hwa Michael; Finkelstein, Eric Andrew",Journal of medical Internet research,506,10

These messages remain relevant post-COVID-19, with greater priority being given to the challenges for national NTD programmes in continuing to deliver mass drug administration (MDA) during the pandemic. Stakeholder coordination from the earliest stages of the pandemic has occurred at two levels: in the first mile with global partners of the NTD Supply Chain Forum and in the last mile with implementing partners in each country. This has been instrumental to manage delayed MDA, including the impact delays have on the shipment of NTD donated drugs and the distribution of stock held in country.

In addition to respiratory diseases, vascular complications are rapidly emerging as a key threat of COVID-19. Existing nitric oxide (NO) therapies have been shown to improve the vascular system; however, they have different limitations in terms of safety, usability and availability. In light of this, we hypothesise that a natural-mineral-based novel nanomaterial, which was developed based on NO therapy, might be a viable strategy for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. The present study examined if it could induce an increase of intravascular NO, vasodilation and the consequent increase of blood flow rate and temperature in a living body. The intravascular NO concentration in the hepatic portal of rats was increased by 0.17 nM over 35.2 s on average after its application. An ultrasonic Doppler flow meter showed significant increases in the blood flow rate and vessel diameter, but no difference in the blood flow velocity. These were corroborated by measurements of human hand surface temperature. To our knowledge, this result is the first evidence where an increase of intravascular NO and vasodilation were induced by bringing a natural-mineral-based nanomaterial into contact with or close to a living body. The precise mechanisms remain a matter for further investigation; however, we may assume that endothelial NO synthase, haemoglobin and endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor are deeply involved in the increase of intravascular NO.","Akiyama, Tomohiro; Hirata, Takamichi; Fujimoto, Takahiro; Hatakeyama, Shinnosuke; Yamazaki, Ryuhei; Nomura, Tomohiro",Nanomaterials (Basel),506,3

Two groups of people have been investigated: 1) 12,082 persons already proven positive for SARS-CoV-2 (clinical information is studied); 2) 7,864+4,458 persons with respiratory suspicions (PCR tests and clinical information). In the latter, SARS-CoV-2 positive persons comprised 5.37% in March and 11.42% in June 2020. A number of viral co-infections was observed for SARS-CoV-2. Rhinoviruses accounted for the largest co-infection part (7.91% of samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2); respiratory syncytial virus 7.03%; adenoviruses 4.84%; metapneumoviruses 3.29%; parainfluenza viruses 2.42%; enterovirus D68 1.10% and some other viruses (entero-, echo-, parecho-) less than 1%. In the group of 12,537 humans, SARS-CoV-2 case fatality rate was determined to be 0.6% on average (in contrast with official Russian governmental statistics that reports 1.5% mortality). It is within range of mortality caused by other common seasonal respiratory viruses (0.01-2.21% in Russia in 2012-2020 range). Most of deaths were of people with other comorbidities, also similar with different respiratory viruses. Proportion of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic carriers was 56.68% in March and 70.67% in June 2020. Obviously, this new pathogen presents a substantial risk to human population, as it was not contained at the very beginning of its outbreak in Wuhan and spread to the whole world.

Reducing viral load, along with other recommended epidemiological measures, such as social distancing and home confinement, can in time significantly help to reduce the infection R0 (Basic Reproductive Rate) and then mitigate disease burden. Early negativization or otherwise reduction of the viral load can potentially diminish disease severity, resulting in a better-controlled public health response, avoiding collapse of healthcare systems. Nitazoxanide, a widely used thiazolide approved by the FDA as an antiparasitic drug, also approved in Brazil for Norovirus and Rotavirus treatments, has an excellent safety record for a variety of indications. Nitazoxanide exhibits activity in vitro against MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses; and a specific antiviral effect (in micro molar doses) against SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nitazoxanide in reducing the SARS-COV 2 viral load within 7 days of treatment in respiratory samples from COVID-19-infected patients with mild to moderate disease, compared to placebo. An interim analysis showed that the ratio of patients with a viral load reduction [≥] 35% from baseline up to day 7 of treatment was significantly greater for Nitazoxanide compared to placebo (47.8% vs. 15.4%; {Delta} 34.6%; 95% CI: 64.7; 4.6: p = 0.037).","Silva, M.; Espejo, A.; Pereyra, M.

Methods We conducted a single-center, two-arm, randomized and double-blinded study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03953521). 37 inpatients with an at least moderate depressive episode were randomized to receive either neuronavigated or 10-20-EEG-system based F3 guided iTBS. Both groups received twenty week daily sessions of intermittent theta burst stimulation while continuing to receive standard-of-care treatment by their ward physicians. For navigated iTBS, we used magnetic resonance imaging to target the border between the anterior and middle third of the middle frontal gyrus is considered to represent the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Differences in the treatment arms were blinded by completely mimicking the procedures of the respective other treatment group. Rating physicians were not involved in the treatment procedure. Primary outcome was defined as the change of the 21-item version of the Hamilton Depression Score (HAMD) from baseline to end of treatment at week 4. Secondary outcomes included HAMD score during the treatment, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, WHO Quality of Life-BREF and Clinical Global Impression. For primary outcome, we used a planned group comparison for the absolute change in the HAMD. For secondary outcome measures we calculated analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with the within-subjects factor time (primary: baseline vs. week 4; secondary: all visits) and the between-subjects factor group (navigated vs. F3 guided group). We also did planned contrasts between both groups for all variables and all treatment and follow-up visits with the aim not to oversee any group differences. For group contrasts we used Student T-tests for metric and chi-square tests for categorial variables. Significance threshold was set to 5% uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Results Enrolment of 80 patients with interim analysis was planned. Interim analysis was performed after 37 patients (intention to treat). 6 patients dropped out, leaving 31 for analysis. With respect to primary outcome criteria, absolute change in the HAMD did not differ significantly between groups. In accordance, relative change and number of responders and remitters were not significantly different. Overall number of responders was 53% and of remitters was 60%. On a descriptive level, the results favor the clinical effects of the F3 group for the absolute and relative change in the HAMD and the number of responders. Number of remitters were exactly the same for both groups. Therefore, we decided to stop the trial due to the added burden of magnetic resonance imaging and neuronavigated treatment in relation to the effect. Secondary outcomes did also not differ significantly between groups. Patients did not differ in their baseline characteristics nor with respect to intake of medication during the trial period and all had access to the same therapeutic interventions. Conclusion We noticed a high antidepressive effect of add-on intermittent theta burst treatment to standard inpatient treatment but failed to demonstrate a clinical superiority of neuronavigated localization. The non-navigated, F3 guided theta burst treatment used as a control group may be sophisticated enough to dilute potential added benefits, and the difference between the localization approaches is either negligible or too small to justify the additional efforts of navigation. The effects of concomitant treatment may mask effects, but our patient population reflects clinical reality in an inpatient setting. Further prospective studies are warranted to compare neuronavigated with surface-based approaches.","Hebel, Tobias; Göllnitz, Alina; Schoisswohl, Stefan; Weber, Franziska C.; Abdelnaim, Mohamed; Wetter, Thomas C.; Rupprecht, Rainer; Langguth, Berthold; Schecklmann, Martin",Brain stimulation,506,20

Predicting clinical improvement as well as mortality or severity is very important. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the clinical improvement of COVID-19. Methods Overall, 74 patients receiving treatment for COVID-19 at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from April 6th to May 15th, 2020 were included in this study. Clinical improvement was evaluated, which defined as the decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status or discharge alive from the hospital within 28 days after admission. The clinical courses were particularly investigated and the factors related to time to clinical improvement were analyzed with the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazard model. Results Forty-nine patients required oxygen support during hospitalization, 22 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 5 patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A total of 83% of cases reached clinical improvement. Longer period of time from onset to admission (≥10 days) (HR, 1.057; 95% CI, 1.002-1.114), no hypertension (HR, 2.077; 95% CI, 1.006-4.287), and low D-dimer levels (<1 μg/ml) (HR, 2.372; 95% CI, 1.229-4.576) were confirmed to be significant predictive factors for time to clinical improvement. Furthermore, a lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number was also a predictive factor for clinical improvement.

To determine Favipiravir induced cutaneous adverse reactions in COVID-19-infected patients, we observed COVID-19-infected patients who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, a principal centre of emerging infectious disease in Thailand, and presented with cutaneous eruption following Favipiravir prescription. There were 5 cases of Favipiravir induced cutaneous adverse reactions; 2 patients with maculopapular rash, 2 with urticarial rash, and one with Steven-Johnson Syndrome. Median duration between Favipiravir treatment and rash occurrence was 7 days. Mean duration of the rash was 5 days. This findings highlighted that Favipiravir induced cutaneous adverse eruptions in COVID-19-infected patients.

METHODS: A literature review using PubMed, Google Scholar and grey literature search was conducted to map out the current conceptualisation of health workforce governance. We identified all published literature relating to governance in health workforce since 2000 and analysed them on two fronts: the broad definition of governance, and the operationalisation of broad definition into key dimensions of governance. RESULTS: Existing literature adopts governance concepts established in health literature and does not adapt understanding to the health workforce context. Definitions are largely quoted from health literature whilst dimensions are focused around the sub-functions of governance which emphasise operationalising governance practices over further conceptualisation. Two sub-functions are identified as essential to the governance process: stakeholder participation and strategic direction. CONCLUSIONS: Although governance in health systems has gained increasing attention, governance in health workforce remains poorly conceptualised in literature. We propose an improved conceptualisation in the form of a stakeholder-driven network governance model with the national government as a strong steward against vested stakeholder interests. Further research is needed to explore and develop on the conceptual thinking behind health workforce governance.","Lim, Max Ying Hao; Lin, Vivian",Hum Resour Health,506,29

Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients(1–3), how SARS-CoV-2 induces tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned substrates. Strikingly, in vitro-derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo-like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF. Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNT(hi) cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type(4). These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission. Our platform offers unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks of human lung development and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.","Rosado-Olivieri, E.A.; Razooky, B.; Hoffmann, H.-H.; De Santis, R.; Rice, C.M.; Brivanlou, A.H",bioRxiv,506,1

Despite providing valuable insight into the clinical management of CAPA, large-scale prospective studies are limited. Here, we report on one of the largest multicenter epidemiological studies to explore the clinical features and prevalence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary mold infections (CAPMIs) among mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum samples were collected for culture, galactomannan (GM), and β-D-glucan (BDG) testing. Patients were classified as probable CAPMI based on the presence of host factors, radiological findings, and mycological criteria. Results: During the study period, 302 COVID-19 patients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), among whom 105 were mechanically ventilated for ≥4 days. Probable CAPMI was observed among 38% of patients (40/105), among whom BAL culture of 29 patients turned positive for molds, while galactomannan testing on BAL (GM index ≥1) and serum (GM index >0.5) samples were positive for 60% (24/40) and 37.5% (15/39) of patients, respectively. Aspergillus (22/29; 75.8%) and Fusarium (6/29; 20.6%) constituted 96.5% of the molds isolated. Diaporthe foeniculina was isolated from a COVID-19 patient. None of the patients who presented with CAPMI were treated with antifungal drugs. Conclusion: Despite being prevalent, the absence of appropriate antifungal treatment highlights that CAPMI is a neglected complication among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs. CAPMI can be caused by species other than Aspergillus.","Ghazanfari, Mona; Arastehfar, Amir; Davoodi, Lotfollah; Yazdani Charati, Jamshid; Moazeni, Maryam; Abastabar, Mahdi; Haghani, Iman; Mirzakhani, Roghayeh; Mayahi, Sabah; Fang, Wenjie; Liao, Wanqing; Nguyen, M.

Closed environments with reduced ventilation contribute to the spread of COVID‐19, including superspreading events. Exercising in closed places further increases the risk for transmission. Therefore, many fitness facilities were closed as part of mandated shutdowns early in the pandemic. Evidence‐based safety protocols have now emerged and substantially reduce the risk of transmission. We report three positive cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 identified at a Dojo exercise facility in Manlius, NY, at three distinct time points. All cases were present in the Dojo 2 days prior to symptoms, a time period considered to be highly infectious. The safety protocols included universal mask wearing (no valves), multiple high‐efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and reduced capacity which resulted in no known spread of COVID‐19.","Cilhoroz, Burak T.; DeRuisseau, Lara R.",Physiol Rep,506,16

The results of exponential and SIR model showed higher estimates of R0, R and Re. The data driven as well as estimated COVID-19 cases reflect the growing nature of the epidemic in India and world excluding China, whereas the same in China reveal the involved population became infected with the disease and moved into the recovered stage. The epidemic size of India was estimated to be ~30,284 (as of April 15, 2020 with 12,370 infectious cases) with an estimated end of the epidemic on June 9, 2020. The Re values in India before and after lockdown were 1.62 and 1.37 respectively, with SI 5.52 days and 5.98 days, respectively, as of April 17, 2020, reflecting the effectiveness of lockdown strategies.

They search for products that ensure social and environmental sustainability, in addition to more common extrinsic product attributes, such as price, packaging, origin, and brand. In particular, there is increasing interest towards product price fairness. The current study aims at exploring consumers’ perception and understanding of price fairness, focusing on the processed tomato products agro-food chain. The study interviewed 832 people. Data were collected through an online questionnaire with the support of Qualtrics software, and data elaboration was carried out with Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The elaboration includes an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify existing latent factors in the consumers’ perception of enabling agro-food system elements influencing farmers’ reception of fair prices. Then, factor mean values were cross-analysed with socio-economic characteristics and processed tomato consumption habits with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results support the idea that consumers are limitedly aware of the processed tomato agro-food chain dynamics and consider farmers as the most unfairly remunerated partner. Women and frequently purchasing consumers of processed tomato products believe farmers should be treated more fairly. There is a difference between what consumers perceive as fair price distribution and actual price distribution among processed tomato chain actors. Further studies may focus on how fairness attribute impacts on consumer purchasing behaviour.","Samoggia, Antonella; Grillini, Giulia; Del Prete, Margherita",Foods,506,16

Based on a review of 14 international trauma treatment guidance documents that explicitly mentioned children, we reflect on two areas in which these guidelines can become more inclusive and equitable; a) representation of children’s cultural background and b) children’s opportunity to have their voice heard. While a few guidelines mentioned that treatment should be tailored to children’s cultural needs, there was little guidance on how this could be done. Moreover, there still appears to be a strong white Western lens across all stages of producing and evaluating the international evidence base. The available documentation also suggested that no young people under the age of 18 had been consulted in the guideline development processes. To contribute to inclusion and equity, we suggest five elements for future national guideline development endeavours. Promoting research and guideline development with, by, and for currently under-represented communities should be a high priority for our field. Our national, regional and global professional associations are in an excellent position to (continue to) stimulate conversation and action in this domain.","Alisic, Eva; Roth, Jessica; Cobham, Vanessa; Conroy, Rowena; De Young, Alexandra; Hafstad, Gertrud; Hecker, Tobias; Hiller, Rachel; Kassam-Adams, Nancy; Lai, Betty; Landolt, Markus; Marsac, Meghan; Seedat, Soraya; Trickey, David",European journal of psychotraumatology,506,21
