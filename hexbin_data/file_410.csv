3379,3379,3379,Comparing the outcomes of different postgraduate year training programs in Taiwan,17.766586,4.802415,2016-03-09,"BACKGROUND: Postgraduate year training programs play an important role in the development of a comprehensive medical education. The goal of these training programs is to inculcate in physicians the expected level of skill in patient care. After the initiation of such programs in the USA, Europe, and Japan, studies were conducted in Taiwan to investigate relevant training methods, and a training system was established in 2003. Beginning with 3-month programs, followed by 6-month programs, the programs were constantly modified and enhanced by the establishment of the 1-year training program in 2011. This year was the transition period from the 6-month programs to the 1-year programs. METHODS: We used a 50-item multiple choice question (MCQ) test and six 10-min stations for objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which was composed of four stations relating to standardized patients and two stations concerning the clinical skill evaluation, to evaluate the learning results of the trainees. The trainees were divided into four groups according to the training program. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the performance of the 6 months and 1-year groups. The p values were 0.424 in the MCQ test and 0.082 in the OSCE evaluation. CONCLUSION: A well-designed postgraduate training program should develop trainees’ competencies. The results of this study may provide useful insight for ways to improve the design of training programs. Further investigation to better understand the impact of different programs is warranted.","Hsu, Peng-Wei; Hsieh, Ming-Ju; Fu, Ren-Huei; Huang, Jing-Long; Liao, Mei-Chen; Lee, Shih-Tseng",Biomed J,410,1

These patients had barriers to full participation in a facility-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program due to return to work and access to transportation. However, they were willing and able to participate in the TM-HBCR program. DISCUSSION: The two cases discussed herein are examples of individuals who likely would not have fully participated in CR if the only option available was a facility-based program. While HBCR is not an option for all patients, it does address several barriers that are known to limit participation in facility-based CR for some individuals. SUMMARY: Technology has made it possible to provide the key components of a facility-based CR program through a TM-HBCR model using a secure connection to the patients via their personal mobile device.","Berry, Robert; Brawner, Clinton A.; Kipa, S.

17159,17159,17159,Gut bacterial profile in Indian children of varying nutritional status: a comparative pilot study,17.50959,7.272013,2021-04-30,"TOLLIP (Toll-interacting protein) is an intracellular adaptor protein with diverse actions throughout the body. In a context- and cell type–specific manner, TOLLIP can function as an inhibitor of inflammation and endoplasmic-reticulum stress, an activator of autophagy, or a critical regulator of intracellular vacuole trafficking. The distinct functions of this protein have been linked to innate immune responses and lung epithelial-cell apoptosis. TOLLIP genetic variants have been associated with a variety of chronic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation, and with infections, such as tuberculosis, Legionella pneumonia, and respiratory viruses. TOLLIP exists in a delicate homeostatic balance, with both positive and negative effects on the trajectory of pulmonary diseases. This translational review summarizes the genetic and molecular associations that link TOLLIP to the development and progression of noninfectious and infectious pulmonary diseases. We highlight current limitations of in vitro and in vivo models in assessing the role of TOLLIP in these conditions, and we describe future approaches that will enable a more nuanced exploration of the role of TOLLIP in pulmonary conditions. There has been a surge in recent research evaluating the role of this protein in human diseases, but critical mechanistic pathways require further exploration. By understanding its biologic functions in disease-specific contexts, we will be able to determine whether TOLLIP can be therapeutically modulated to treat pulmonary diseases.","Li, Xiaoyun; Goobie, Gillian C.; Gregory, Alyssa D.; Kass, Daniel J.; Zhang, Yingze",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,410,1

These patients often have poor clinical outcomes. Early recognition of IPA in COPD is always challenging. We aimed to develop and validate a risk model using readily available clinical parameters to predict IPA for acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study. AECOPD patients who were admitted to Jinling Hospital between January 2012 and December 2017 were included. 880 AECOPD patients were randomly divided into the training set (70%, n = 616) and validation set (30%, n = 264). A nomogram model was developed using multivariate logistic regression from training set. The discrimination and calibration of model were validated internally. Decision curve analyses assessed the clinical utility of the nomogram. RESULTS: The incidence of IPA in hospitalized AECOPD patients was 9.6% in the training set (59 cases of IPA) and 9.1% in the validation set (24 cases of IPA), respectively. The nomogram model consisted of independent factors associated with IPA included lung function GOLD III–IV, use of broad-spectrum antibiotic over 10 days in the last month, oral or intravenous corticosteroids (prednisone) over 265 mg in the last 3 months and serum albumin < 30 g/L. The model performed good discrimination and calibration in validation set (c-statistic, 0.79 [95%CI 0.68–0.90]). The 95%CI region of calibration belt did not cross the 45-degree diagonal bisector line (P = 0.887). CONCLUSION: The simple risk predictive model for earlier recognition of IPA is useful in hospitalized AECOPD patients.

AIM: To examine the indirect and direct effects of risk factors simultaneously as a network of multiple pathways leading to diabetes in the rurally based adult population (aged 15+) using a household survey. METHODS: This investigation was based on a predictive model using a cross-sectional community-based study to identify the direct and indirect effects of diabetes risk factors in the Dikgale Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) consisting of 15 villages, with 7200 households and a total population of approximately 36 000. Fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol were measured using ILAB 300 with the following cut-off values: high fasting blood glucose 7 mmol/L and triglycerides 1.70 mmol/L. RESULTS: A total of 1407 individuals were interviewed, of whom 1281 had their blood pressure (BP) measured. The conceptual model was validated by the goodness-of-fit indexes (comparative fit index [CFI] = 1.00, Tucker Lewis index [TLI] = 1.041, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.001). Hypertension had the strongest direct effect of 0.0918 on diabetes, followed by age (0.0039) and high waist circumference (−0.0023). Hypertension also mediates the effects that high waist circumference (0.0005) and triglycerides (0.0060) have on diabetes status. CONCLUSION: The results in this study confirm the conceptual model considered in the risk factors for diabetes and suggest that hypertension, age and high waist circumference are the key variables directly affecting the diabetes status in the South African rural black population. The direct effect of triglycerides on diabetes suggests mediation by some measured factor(s).","Mphekgwana, Peter M.; Mabila, Linneth N.; Maimela, Eric",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,410,1

These systems need to be simple to operate and maintain, reliable, and resilient to unreliable electrical service. The NEWgenerator (NG) is a compact, automated, solar-powered wastewater treatment system comprised of three major treatment processes: anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR), nutrient capture system (NCS) with ion exchange and carbon sorption, and electrochlorination (EC). The NG system operated at an informal settlement community in South Africa over a 534 d period, treating high-strength blackwater (BW) and yellow water (YW) from a public toilet facility. Over three test stages (BW, BW + YW, BW) that included several periods of dormancy, the NG system was able to provide a high level of removal of total suspended solids (97.6 ± 3.1%), chemical oxygen demand (94.5 ± 5.0%), turbidity (96.3 ± 9.7%), color (92.0 ± 10.5%), total nitrogen (82.1 ± 24.0%), total phosphorus (43.0 ± 22.1%), E. coli (7.4 ± 1.5 LRV, not detected in effluent), and helminth ova (not detected in effluent). The treatment levels met most of the ISO 30500 NSSS standard for liquid effluent and local water reuse criteria. A series of maintenance events were successfully conducted onsite over the 534 d field trial: two membrane cleanings, two NCS regenerations, and granular activated carbon replacement. Desludging, a major pain point for onsite sanitation systems, was unnecessary during the field trial and thereby not performed. The AnMBR performed well, removing 94.5 ± 5.0% of the influent COD across all three stages. The high COD removal rate is attributed to the sub-micron separation provided by the ultrafiltration membrane. The NCS was highly efficient at removing total nitrogen, residual COD and color, but the regeneration process was lengthy and is a topic of ongoing research. The EC provided effective disinfection, but frequent prolonged run cycles due to power supply and water quality issues upstream limited the overall system hydraulic throughput. This extended field trial under actual ambient conditions successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced NSSS to address the global water and sanitation crises.","Shyu, Hsiang-Yang; Bair, Robert A.; Castro, Cynthia J.; Xaba, Lindelani; Delgado-Navarro, Manuel; Sindall, Rebecca; Cottingham, Ruth; Uman, A.

Common treatments for SDB include adenotonsillectomy and nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but adenotonsillectomy is an invasive surgical procedure, and CPAP is rarely well-tolerated. Further, there is no current consensus on the ability of these treatments to improve cognitive function. Several double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of montelukast, a safe, well-tolerated anti-inflammatory agent, as a treatment for airway obstruction and reducing adenoid size for children who do not have SCA. However, we do not yet know whether montelukast reduces adenoid size and improves cognition function in young children with SCA. METHODS: The Study of Montelukast In Children with Sickle Cell Disease (SMILES) is a 12-week multicentre, double-blind, RCT. SMILES aims to recruit 200 paediatric patients with SCA and SDB aged 3–7.99 years to assess the extent to which montelukast can improve cognitive function (i.e. processing speed) and sleep and reduce adenoidal size and white matter damage compared to placebo. Patients will be randomised to either montelukast or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective of the SMILES trial is to assess the effect of montelukast on processing speed in young children with SCA. At baseline and post-treatment, we will administer a cognitive evaluation; caregivers will complete questionnaires (e.g. sleep, pain) and measures of demographics. Laboratory values will be obtained from medical records collected as part of standard care. If a family agrees, patients will undergo brain MRIs for adenoid size and other structural and haemodynamic quantitative measures at baseline and post-treatment, and we will obtain overnight oximetry. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will increase our understanding of whether montelukast is an effective treatment for young children with SCA. Using cognitive testing and MRI, the SMILES trial hopes to gain critical knowledge to help develop targeted interventions to improve the outcomes of young children with SCA.

Previously, ectopic GC have been associated with increased local autoantibody production. The aim of this study was to determine whether GC in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) defines a distinct seroimmunological phenotype. Retrospectively, a material of 130 haematoxylin and eosin‐stained paraffin‐embedded tissue sections of minor salivary gland tissue from patients with pSS was morphologically screened for the presence of ectopic GC. GC‐like lesions were detected in 33/130 (25%) of the pSS patients. Seventy‐two pSS patients lacking these structures (GC‐) were randomly selected for comparison. Focus score was significantly increased in the GC(+) patients compared to the GC(–) patients (P = 0.035). In the GC(+) group, 54.5% of the patients presented with anti‐Ro/SSA compared to 43.7% in the GC(–) group. Anti‐La/SSB was detected in 31.3% of the GC(+) patients compared to 25.7% of the GC(–) patients. Sixty‐one percentage of GC(+) patients presented with increased levels of IgG, a nonsignificant difference when compared to 39.4% in the GC(–) patients (P = 0.089). Levels of RF, ANA, ENA, IgM and IgA were similar in both patient groups, as were ESR and CRP. In conclusion, patients with ectopic GC have a higher focus score and more often present with autoantibodies and increased levels of IgG compared to pSS patients with regular focal infiltration (GC(–)). Our findings may indicate a certain seroimmunological phenotype and warrant for further prospective studies.","Jonsson, M. V.; Brun, J. G.; Skarstein, K.; Jonsson, R.",Scand J Immunol,410,16

There are about 200 individual viral species in some 20 different viral families that infect the eight major domestic animal species. If antigenic types within an individual viral species are considered and the number of animal species is broadened to include turkey, duck, and zoo and laboratory animals, then the number of individual viruses exceeds 1000. It is, therefore, not surprising that few single laboratories could have available the necessary specific reagents, skills, and experience for the diagnosis of such a large number of infections.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

However, it is defined so broadly, so holistically, that companies find it challenging to improve it through well-defined projects with an impact analysis of the different changes that could be brought about. Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) is supposed to be a suitable means to support the management of such transformation projects. However, the depth and disruptive nature of these changes raise multiple questions concerning the adequacy of EAM for Customer Experience Improvement (CEI). In current corporate practice, there seems to be no regular application of EAM as a central support service for CEI in the digital context. In this paper, we explore how EAM can support CEI and examine how digitalization transforms the customer experience. We further identify the required information inputs for these transformations. Based on this foundation, we identify content elements that EAM can provide by analyzing EAM meta-models. Comparing the requirements by CEI projects and the supply by EAM shows that EAM, in general, provides valuable inputs for organizational issues and roles but shows weaknesses when it comes to information about trends, contextual and environmental information.","Hafsi, Mouaad; Assar, Saïd","Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling",410,24

In this research, a new deep learning prediction model is proposed for short-term forecasting natural gas price and movement. The proposed forecasting model exploits the ability of convolutional layers for providing a deep insight in natural gas data and the efficiency of LSTM layers for learning short-term and long-term dependencies. Additionally, a significant advantage of the proposed model is its abilities to predict the price of natural gas on the following day (regression) and also to predict if the price on the next day will increase, decrease or stay stable (classification) with respect to today’s price. The conducted series of experiments demonstrated that the proposed model considerably outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models.","Livieris, Ioannis E.; Pintelas, Emmanuel; Kiriakidou, Niki; Stavroyiannis, Stavros",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,410,16

We aimed to describe prognostic factors for influenza-associated IA (IAA) and poor outcome and mortality in critically ill patients in Switzerland. All adults with confirmed influenza admitted to the ICU at two Swiss tertiary care centres during the 2017/2018 influenza season were retrospectively evaluated. IAA was defined by clinical, mycological and radiological criteria: a positive galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage or histopathological or cultural evidence in respiratory specimens of Aspergillus spp., any radiological infiltrate and a compatible clinical presentation. Poor outcome was defined as a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU length of stay (LOS), invasive ventilation for > 7 days or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Of 81 patients with influenza in the ICU, 9 (11%) were diagnosed with IAA. All patients with IAA had poor outcome compared to 26 (36%) patients without IAA (p < 0.001). Median ICU-LOS and mortality were 17 vs. 3 days (p < 0.01) and 3/9 (33%) vs. 13/72 (18%; p = 0.37) in patients with vs. without IAA, respectively. Patients with IAA had significantly longer durations of antibiotic therapy, vasoactive support and mechanical ventilation. Aspergillus was the most common respiratory co-pathogen (9/40, 22%) followed by classical bacterial co-pathogens. IAA was not associated with classical risk factors. Aspergillus is a common superinfection in critically ill influenza patients associated with poor outcome and longer duration of organ supportive therapies. Given the absence of classical risk factors for aspergillosis, greater awareness is necessary, particularly in those requiring organ supportive therapies.

Though Pakistan has previously experimented with SEZs, its scale, outreach and impact on the country’s economy and society remained very limited. Thus, the proposed SEZs under the CPEC offer new opportunities for mutual economic cooperation, investment, human resource development, sustained industrialization and, above all, the consolidation of CPEC. Nevertheless, there are several challenges ranging from structural issues to security problems that the proposed SEZs, in particular, and CPEC, in general, face.

Inflammation is a critical mediator in retinal degeneration (RD) diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and RD progression may be prevented through anti-inflammatory activity in RPE cells. The flavonoid polyphenol luteolin (LU) has anti-inflammatory and antidiabetes activities, but its effects regarding retinal protection remain unknown. Here, we examined the ability of luteolin to alleviate markers of inflammation related to RD in cytokine-primed APPE-19 cells. We found that luteolin decreased the levels of interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-8, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and attenuated adherence of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 to IL-1β-stimulated ARPE-19 cells. Luteolin also increased anti-inflammatory protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels. Interestingly, luteolin induced protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, thus inhibiting nuclear factor- (NF-) κB transfer from cytoplasm into the nucleus and suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, cotreatment with MAPK inhibitors and luteolin decreased inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, and further suppressed THP-1 adhesion. Overall, these results provide evidence that luteolin protects ARPE-19 cells from IL-1β-stimulated increases of IL-6, IL-8, sICAM-1, and MCP-1 production by blocking the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, thus ameliorating the inflammatory response.","Huang, Wen-Chung; Liou, Chian-Jiun; Shen, Szu-Chuan; Hu, Sindy; Hsiao, Chien-Yu; Wu, Shu-Ju",Mediators Inflamm,410,30

Inadequate geological knowledge affects not only university students but also the majority of citizens who finish their secondary studies without having learned any basic geological concepts. The insufficient geological training of pre-university teachers who are later expected to teach some geology generates a certain degree of insecurity and fear about teaching geology. Therefore, it is imperative to improve training for trainee teachers to replace usual ways of thinking about geology teaching with new approaches that promote significant geological learning. This research has a dual objective: first, we analyze whether trainee teachers’ theses include geoscience content; second, we explore how innovative ideas and practices can be translated for educational purposes and to promote geologically significant learning. Our findings reveal that environmental impacts, plate tectonics and the hydrosphere are concurrent topics in the geosciences. However, trainee teachers in Spain prefer to develop biology units because many of them have training in bioscience fields of knowledge. Traditional education based on the exposition of learning material by the teacher was identified as the main learning environment developed in the trainee teachers’ theses. However, the number of innovations incorporated into trainee teachers’ theses has increased. Through this process, trainee teachers have a critical role to play: encouraging their future secondary students to develop geology knowledge.","Roca, Núria; Garcia-Valles, Maite",Geoheritage,410,24

Acceptance of such technological advances is crucial for successful implementation. Therefore, we examined technology acceptance specifically for this form of rehabilitation in a sample of healthcare providers involved in cognitive rehabilitation. An adjusted version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire was used, including the subscales for perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm (toward use), and intention to use, which all contribute to actual use of a specific technology. Results indicate a generally favorable attitude toward the use of digital cognitive rehabilitation and positive responses toward the TAM constructs. Only for subjective norm, a neutral mean response was found, indicating that this could pose a potential obstacle toward implementation. Potential differences between subgroups of different age, gender, and professional background were assessed. Age and gender did not affect the attitude toward digital cognitive rehabilitation. Occupational therapists showed lower scores than healthcare psychologists and physiatrists with regard to perceived usefulness, possibly linked to a difference in operational and managerial tasks. The findings of his study stimulate further implementation of digital cognitive rehabilitation, where the role of subjective norms should be specifically considered.","van der Ham, Ineke J.

This World Health Organization-sponsored research aimed to develop a Rural Pathways Checklist. Its purpose was to guide the practical implementation of rural workforce training, development, and support strategies in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). It was intended for any LMICs, stakeholder, health worker, context, or health problem. Method: Multi-methods involved: (1) focus group concept testing; (2) a policy analysis; (3) a scoping review of LMIC literature; (4) consultation with a global Expert Reference Group and; (5) field-testing over an 18-month period. Results: The Checklist included eight actions for implementing rural pathways in LMICs: establishing community needs; policies and partners; exploring existing workers and scope; selecting health workers; education and training; working conditions for recruitment and retention; accreditation and recognition of workers; professional support/up-skilling and; monitoring and evaluation. For each action, a summary of LMICs-specific evidence and prompts was developed to stimulate reflection and learning. To support implementation, rural pathways exemplars from different WHO regions were also compiled. Field-testing showed the Checklist is fit for purpose to guide holistic planning and benchmarking of rural pathways, irrespective of LMICs, stakeholder, or health worker type. Conclusion: The Rural Pathways Checklist provides an agreed global conceptual framework for the practical implementation of “grow your own” strategies in LMICs. It can be applied to scale-up activity for rural workforce training and development in LMICs, where health workers are most limited and health needs are greatest.","O'Sullivan, Belinda; Chater, Bruce; Bingham, Amie; Wynn-Jones, John; Couper, Ian; Hegazy, Nagwa Nashat; Kumar, Raman; Lawson, Henry; Martinez-Bianchi, Viviana; Randenikumara, Sankha; Rourke, James; Strasser, Sarah; Worley, Paul",Front Med (Lausanne),410,24

In the classical setting, the generic complexity to find collisions of an n-bit hash function is [Formula: see text] , thus classical collision attacks based on differential cryptanalysis such as rebound attacks build differential trails with probability higher than [Formula: see text] . By the same analogy, generic quantum algorithms such as the BHT algorithm find collisions with complexity [Formula: see text] . With quantum algorithms, a pair of messages satisfying a differential trail with probability p can be generated with complexity [Formula: see text] . Hence, in the quantum setting, some differential trails with probability up to [Formula: see text] that cannot be exploited in the classical setting may be exploited to mount a collision attack in the quantum setting. In particular, the number of attacked rounds may increase. In this paper, we attack two international hash function standards: AES-MMO and Whirlpool. For AES-MMO, we present a 7-round differential trail with probability [Formula: see text] and use it to find collisions with a quantum version of the rebound attack, while only 6 rounds can be attacked in the classical setting. For Whirlpool, we mount a collision attack based on a 6-round differential trail from a classical rebound distinguisher with a complexity higher than the birthday bound. This improves the best classical attack on 5 rounds by 1. We also show that those trails are optimal in our approach. Our results have two important implications. First, there seems to exist a common belief that classically secure hash functions will remain secure against quantum adversaries. Indeed, several second-round candidates in the NIST post-quantum competition use existing hash functions, say SHA-3, as quantum secure ones. Our results disprove this common belief. Second, our observation suggests that differential trail search should not stop with probability [Formula: see text] but should consider up to [Formula: see text] . Hence it deserves to revisit the previous differential trail search activities.","Hosoyamada, Akinori; Sasaki, Yu",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,410,1

Ecological peril, both in the form of extreme weather events and slow-onset impacts of environmental degradation, has serious repercussions for the already prevailing conundrum that the conception of citizenship entails. Proliferation of ‘natural’ disasters and acceleration of environmental degeneration in recent times have caused large-scale involuntary displacement and consequently a rupture in the sense of ‘belonging’, which is the cornerstone of citizenship. Thus, it is imperative that the notion of ‘citizenship’ is reconceptualised in the light of the lived reality of environmental displacement that produces new forms of precarity while disrupting the sense of being-a-citizen. Displacement caused by a fragile and volatile ecology paves the path for a gradual waning of citizenship rights, often leading to loss of avenues for meaningful citizen engagement, thereby making environmental displacement an exemplary case for understanding how ‘citizenship’ operates as a place-based relation. This article will discuss the precarious conditions of environmentally displaced people and delineate the intractable chasm between the ideas of ‘administered’ citizenship and ‘lived’ citizenship. I argue that drawing on ‘processual’ aspects of citizenship becomes imperative against the backdrop of the rapid degradation of ecosystems which calls for a reworking of the ‘political’ sphere and a reformulation of the idiom of ‘citizenship’.","Samanta, Nabanita",Jindal Global Law Review,410,24

Eighteen patients (12.5%) had a level of HbA1c equal or higher than 6.5%, while 70 (48.6%) patients had a level between 5.7% and 6.5%. Of the patients with HbA1c levels suggesting prior diabetes, 9 (50%) of them did not have hyperglycemia (>140 mg/dl) on admission.

By providing the support to allow the next generation to achieve better mental health outcomes, they are going to be more economically successful and the future economic growth of nations can be better assured. Adoption of mobile-based health interventions (e.g., mHealth) has garnered a lot of attention toward this end. While mHealth interventions are growing in popularity, many researchers/policy-makers appear to have neglected assessing potential (indirect) costs/negative consequences from their use. Evidence from the developed world shows strong associations between extensive cell phone use and negative mental health outcomes, but similar research is minimal in developing world contexts. Additionally, the bulk of work on the outcomes of mobile phone use is studied using a unidirectional approach with blinders to front-end motivations. Using primary data from a large-scale, school-based survey of older adolescents in southwestern Nepal (N = 539), this work investigates such a tension between mobile/smartphone usage as a true mobile health (mHealth) opportunity in Nepal or as a potential problem, introducing additional deleterious well-being effects from over-use. Founded in Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT), robust results of analyses using full structural modeling approaches (and traditional regression-based sensitivity analyses) indicate support for the BPNT framework in explaining statistically significant positive associations between bullying and anxiety, as well as, negative associations between bullying and grit, including evidence to support the mediating role of problematic mobile phone use in these relationships.

Herpesvirus infections in reptiles are often characterised by non-pathognomonic signs including stomatitis, encephalitis, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and proliferative lesions. With the exception of fibropapillomatosis in marine turtles, the absence of specific clinical signs has fostered misdiagnosis and underreporting of the actual disease burden in reptilian populations and hampered potential investigations that could lead to the effective control of these diseases.

An effective and on-time evacuation from disaster-affected areas can avoid any panic-related health problems of the stranded persons. Although the nature of disasters differ in terms of how they occur, the evacuation of stranded persons faces approximately same set of issues related to the communication, time-sensitive computation and energy efficiency of the devices operated in the disaster-affected areas. In this paper, a cyber physical system (CPS) is proposed that takes into account various challenges of the disaster evacuation, so an efficient on-time and orderly evacuation of stranded panicked persons could be realized. The system employs fog-assisted mobile and UAV devices for time-sensitive computation services, data relaying and energy-aware computation. The system uses a fog-assisted two-factor energy-aware computation approach using data reduction, which enables the energy-efficient data reception and transmission (DRecTrans) operations at the fog nodes and compensates to extend the period for other functionalities. The data reduction at fog devices employs Novel Events Identification (NEI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for detecting consecutive duplicate traffic and data summarization of high dimensional data, respectively. The proposed system operates in two spaces: physical and cyber. Physical space facilitates real-world data acquisition and information sharing with the concerned stakeholders (stranded persons, evacuation teams and medical professionals). The cyber space houses various data-analytics layers and comprises of two subspaces: fog and cloud. The fog space helps in providing real-time panic-health diagnostic and alert services and enables the optimized energy consumption of devices operate in disaster-affected areas, whereas the cloud space facilitates the monitoring and prediction of panic severity of the stranded persons, using a conditional probabilistic model and seasonal auto regression integrated moving average (SARIMA), respectively. Cloud space also facilitates the disaster mapping for converging the evacuation map to the actual situation of the disaster-affected area, and geographical population analysis (GPA) for the identification of the panic severity-based critical regions. The performance evaluation of the proposed CPS acknowledges its Logistic Regression-based panic-well being determination and real-time alert generation efficiency. The simulated implementation of NEI and PCA depicts the fog-assisted energy efficiency of the DRecTrans operations of the fog nodes. The performance evaluation of the proposed CPS also acknowledges the prediction efficiency of the SARIMA and disaster mapping accuracy through GPA. The proposed system also discusses a case study related to the pandemic disaster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), where the system can help in panic-based selective testing of the persons, and preventing panic due to distressing period of COVID-19 outbreak.","Sahil,; Sood, Sandeep Kumar",Comput J,410,1

However, the mediating factors that explain this relationship remain unclear. The current study aimed to investigate whether specific cognitive processes, namely, self-critical rumination and associated metacognitions, mediate this relationship. An opportunity sample of 347 participants completed a battery of online questionnaires measuring clinical perfectionism, self-critical rumination, metacognitions about self-critical rumination, self-esteem, and levels of psychological distress. Several hypotheses were tested to examine the associations between the study variables. Following this, a path analysis was used to determine whether the influence of perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic striving on self-esteem is mediated by positive metacognitions about self-critical rumination, self-critical rumination, and negative metacognitions about self-critical rumination, serially. Positive metacognitions about self-critical rumination, self-critical rumination, and negative metacognitions about self-critical rumination partially mediated the relationship between perfectionistic concerns and self-esteem and fully mediated the relationship between perfectionistic striving and self-esteem. These results point towards possible interventions for those who struggle with low self-esteem due to their perfectionistic tendencies. Further investigations should explore additional factors that help to explain why perfectionism impacts self-esteem levels, whilst also addressing the limitations of this current research.","Fearn, Monica; Marino, Claudia; Spada, Marcantonio M.; Kolubinski, Daniel C.",J Ration Emot Cogn Behav Ther,410,6

To date, there is little information regarding the effects of COVID‐19 on the heart after infection, especially among young healthy adults. PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether contracting SARS‐CoV‐2 affects cardiac function in young, otherwise healthy adults and whether these alterations recede after testing positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on 7 subjects with SARS‐CoV‐2 (3F/4M, 21±1y, 24±2 kgᐧm(‐1)) who tested positive 3‐4 weeks prior to baseline testing followed by 1‐month and 2‐month follow‐up testing. A parasternal long‐axis view was utilized to measure septal and left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left ventricular volume, and left ventricular outflow tract dimensions. A four‐chamber view was utilized to measure mitral and tricuspid valve, left ventricular, and pulmonary vein function. Data are mean±SD. RESULTS: Stroke volume (Baseline: 44±11ml, 1‐month: 42±13ml, 2‐month: 54±12ml) and stroke index (Baseline: 24±6ml/m^2, 1‐month: 22±7ml/m^2, 2‐month: 29±6ml/m^2) were elevated at 2‐month follow‐up (p<0.05). Left ventricular posterior wall thickness was lower at 1‐month follow‐up (Baseline: 1.56±0.10cm, 1‐month: 1.44±0.08cm, 2‐month: 1.47±0.13cm) (p<0.05).

First, as measured in the early part of the second quarter of 2020, COVID‐19 is associated with an increased prevalence of household food insecurity as measured by Statistics Canada. Also, as we predicted, we did not observe a rapid general increase in food prices that would have suggested a breakdown in parts of the food system. In this regard, we now develop a general insight that we believe is worthy of ongoing consideration. Put simply, concerns expressed about food insecurity should not be seen as tantamount to a failure of our food supply system. Household income, for example, is an important part of the story. The converse is also true: the success of our food supply system as measured by its capacity to adapt to challenges like COVID‐19 or provide a variety of food at relatively low prices—while necessary, and (in our opinion) critical considerations—will not alone eliminate food insecurity in Canada. The oversimplified conflation of food insecurity concerns with the robustness of our food supply system does a disservice to ongoing efforts to address food insecurity as well as our capacity to assess and improve the Canadian food supply system.","Deaton, B.

Chromatographic development was performed using a HPTLC aluminum plate, pre-coated with silica gel 60 F(254) with hexane‒chloroform‒methanol‒formic acid as the mobile phase. Densitometric quantification for 20-β-hydroxyecdysone and cordifolioside A was performed at 254 nm and for columbin at 600 nm after derivatization with anisaldehyde‒sulfuric acid. The optimized mobile phase resulted in chromatographic separation of peaks for cordifolioside A, 20-β-hydroxyecdysone, and columbin at R(F) of 0.12, 0.47, and 0.86, respectively. The linear concentration range was found to be 750‒2250 ng/band for 20-β-hydroxyecdysone and cordifolioside A and 675‒1875 ng/band for columbin with (r(2) > 0.99). The methodology showed good recoveries as 98.96‒101.43% for cordifolioside A, 98.15‒101.56% for 20-β-hydroxyecdysone, and 98.06‒98.80% for columbin. The limit of detection was found for columbin, 20-β-hydroxyecdysone, and cordifolioside A as 53.86 ng/band, 40.90 ng/band, and 107.05 ng/band, while the limit of quantification was found to be 163.21 ng/band, 123.94 ng/band, and 324.38 ng/band, respectively. The relative standard deviation for precision and robustness study for all the markers was found to be within 2%. Three markers were identified and confirmed in T. cordifolia stem extracts by ESI‒MS/MS. Compounds were assigned as norditerpene furan glycosides, ecdysteroids, and diterpenoid furanolactone: cordifolioside A (m/z = 527 [M + Na](+); UV λ(max) 221 nm), 20-β-hydroxyecdysone (m/z = 481.30 [M + H](+); UV λ(max) 247 nm), and columbin (m/z = 359 [M + H](+); UV λ(max) 210 nm). The optimized method was found accurate, reproducible, robust, and specific and can be applied for the quantification of cordifolioside A, 20-β-hydroxyecdysone, and columbin for quality control of extracts of T. cordifolia.

To gain insight into molecular determinants of transformation, we studied B cell evolutionary trajectories in lymphoma tissue from diagnosis to relapse or transformation to non-Hodgkin lymphoma by immunoglobulin heavy chain next-generation sequencing. NLPHL cases that later transformed showed higher age, IgD negativity, absence of the characteristic IGHV3/IGHD3/IGHJ6 LP rearrangement and high repertoire clonality. We constructed phylogenetic trees within the compartment of the malignant clone to investigate clonal evolution. In all relapsing cases, the LP rearrangement was identical at diagnosis and relapse. NLPHL cases with transformation showed more complex trajectories with strong intraclonal diversification. The dominant founder clone in transformations showed clonal evolution, if derived from the same cell of origin, or originated from a different cell of origin. Together, our data point to a significant role of antigenic drive in NLHPL transformations and identify high B cell repertoire clonality with dominant intraclonal LP cell diversification as a hallmark of transformation.

Thus far the role of emergent pneumonectomy is not established. METHODS The outcome of patients who underwent anatomic lung resection for lung gangrene at 3 centers for thoracic surgery during the last 13 years was retrospectively analyzed. Only cases of necrotizing pneumonia were included whereas malignant lesions were excluded. RESULTS Overall 44 patients were indentified (average age 56.3 years). Pulmonary sepsis (27 of 44), pleural empyema (29 of 44), persistent air leakage (14 of 44), and respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation (14 of 44) were present preoperatively. The mean Charlson comorbidity index was 2.77. Procedures were segmentectomy (7), lobectomy (26), and pneumonectomy (11). In-hospital mortality was 7 of 44; 2 following pneumonectomy and 5 after lobectomy. In comparing the pneumonectomy group with the lobectomy group we found no significant differences in age (p=0.59), Charlson comorbidity index (p=0.18), and postoperative mortality (p=1). Charlson comorbidity index 3 or greater (odds ratio [OR], 8.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 421.71; p=0.04), preoperative pleural empyema (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 179.62; p=0.39) and preoperative persistent air leak (OR, 7.34; 95% CI, 1.00 to 89.98; p=0.02) were associated with higher risk for fatal outcome. Furthermore, patients with sepsis (p=0.03) and patients sustaining acute renal failure (p=0.04) had significantly higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS Pulmonary sepsis and its complications as well as preexisting comorbidity are the major reasons for fatal outcome, whereas the extent of surgical resection shows no significant influence. Emergent pneumonectomy as ultimate ratio is not only justified but also life saving. Further improvement seems achievable by earlier surgical intervention before the onset of pulmonary sepsis.","Schweigert, Michael; Giraldo Ospina, Carlos F; Solymosi, Norbert; Karmy-Jones, Riyad; Dubecz, Attila; Fernández, Marta Jiménez; Quero Valenzuela, Florencio; Ofner, Dietmar; Stein, Hubert J",The Annals of thoracic surgery,410,16

Progress in prenatal diagnosis, less-invasive catheter techniques and perioperative intensive care as well as surgical techniques have led to an increased focus on extracardiac comorbidities, including potential neurodevelopmental sequelae associated with CHD. A growing body of literature reports impairments in early and school-age developmental outcome; however, there is a substantial variability in the spectrum of examined CHD types, assessment ages and applied test batteries. Furthermore, little information is available on executive function impairments in this population. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to determine the impact of CHD on intellectual outcome and executive functioning at school age and to determine risk factors for impaired outcomes by means of a systematic search. METHODS A systematic review of literature that reports neurodevelopmental outcome in children with CHD undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Intelligence quotient or executive function scores will be considered primary outcomes. Databases such as Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO will be searched. DISCUSSION The results of this systematic review will summarize the current evidence on intellectual and executive function outcome after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in school-age children with CHD. This review will thus be the basis for better patient and parental counselling and the establishment of tailored follow-up programmes and interventional trials.

This study evaluated long-term outcomes of osteochondral autologous transplantation (OAT) for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the knee. DESIGN This retrospective case series included patients who underwent OAT for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the knee from 1998 to 2008. The survivorship and need for secondary surgery were evaluated, and the clinical outcome was evaluated with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score. Preoperative and final Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of the femorotibial and patellofemoral joints were individually evaluated. RESULTS Fourteen knees of 10 patients whose mean age was 32.5 (95%CI 26.4-38.6) years were included and followed for 14.0 (12.4-15.7) years. The mean lesion size of 6.9 (5.3-8.5) cm2 was repaired using 4 median (minimum 2, maximum 5) osteochondral plugs. No revision surgeries were performed for transplanted osteochondral plugs. The IKDC subjective score improved from 32.9 (24.5-41.3) to 74.2 (61.9-88.5) (P < 0.001). Knee flexion was improved at the final follow-up, and Seiza sitting was finally possible in 9 knees in 7 patients. Although the osteoarthritic change did not progress in femorotibial joint, patellofemoral joint showed early osteoarthritic changes at the final follow-up (mean KL grade: 0.8 [0.5-1.1]). CONCLUSIONS Prosthetic joint replacement was successfully avoided for at least the first decade by OAT in young patients with steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the knee. The progression of KL grade of the patellofemoral joint is of concern.","Nishitani, Kohei; Nakagawa, Yasuaki; Kobayashi, Masahiko; Nakamura, Shinichiro; Mukai, Shogo; Kuriyama, Shinichi; Matsuda, Shuichi",Cartilage,410,17

Similarly, cerebral autoregulation (CA) monitoring has shown to be an accurate technique for predicting clinical outcomes. However, little is known about the relationship between CA measurements and GCS scores among neurological critically ill patients. This study aimed to explore the association between noninvasive CA multimodal monitoring measurements and GCS scores. METHODS Acutely comatose patients with a variety of neurological injuries admitted to a neurocritical care unit were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy-based multimodal monitoring for up to 72 hours. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2), cerebral oximetry index (COx), GCS, and GCS motor data were measured hourly. COx was calculated as a Pearson correlation coefficient between low-frequency changes in rScO2 and mean arterial pressure. Mixed random effects models with random intercept was used to determine the relationship between hourly near-infrared spectroscopy-based measurements and GCS or GCS motor scores. RESULTS A total of 871 observations (h) were analyzed from 57 patients with a variety of neurological conditions. Mean age was 58.7±14.2 years and the male to female ratio was 1:1.3. After adjusting for hemoglobin and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, COx was inversely associated with GCS (β=-1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.94 to -0.31, P=0.007) and GCS motor score (β=-1.06, 95% CI, -2.10 to -0.04, P=0.04). In contrast rScO2 was not associated with GCS (β=-0.002, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01, P=0.76) or GCS motor score (β=-0.001, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01, P=0.84). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that fluctuations in GCS scores are inversely associated with fluctuations in COx; as COx increases (impaired autoregulation), more severe neurological impairment is observed. However, the difference in COx between high and low GCS is small and warrants further studies investigating this association. CA multimodal monitoring with COx may have the potential to be used as a surrogate of neurological status when the neurological examination is not reliable (ie, sedation and paralytic drug administration).","Healy, Ryan J; Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Ziai, Wendy; Mirski, Marek A; Hogue, Charles W; Geocadin, Romergryko; Radzik, Batya; Palmisano, Caitlin; Rivera-Lara, Lucia",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,410,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A 72-year-old man presented with two nodules of an ICC with a maximum diameter of 10 and 4 cm, respectively. To produce overlapping ablation areas and cover the entire tumor volume, 18 paths for the placement of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probes at multiple locations were planned on 2D and 3D reconstructions of the computed tomographic (CT) data. The 15-gauge coaxial needles were advanced through the aiming device to the preplanned depth. A control CT fused to the planning CT data confirmed correct needle placements. RFA was performed with an impedance-based multiple-electrode RFA system. Fusion of the contrast-enhanced control CT with the planning CT showed an appropriate zone of ablation. RESULTS Besides a mild asymptomatic pleural effusion, no complications occurred. Twenty-seven months after the first RFA, two new small distant liver metastases were successfully treated by SRFA. Currently, 38 months after diagnosis and 36 months after the first SRFA, the patient is free of detectable disease.

To evaluate these effects, blood was collected regularly from 28 university-owned horses (10 Non-PPID, 9 PPID control [PC], and 9 PPID treatment [PT]) over approximately 15 mo. Pergolide treatment was initiated after Day 0 collections. Analyses included ACTH, insulin, total cortisol, free cortisol, complete blood counts, plasma myeloperoxidase, and cytokine/receptor gene expression in basal whole blood and in vitro stimulations (PMA/ionomycin, heat-inactivated Rhodococcus equi, and heat-inactivated Escherichia coli) of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The results were analyzed using a linear mixed model (SAS 9.4) with significance set at P < 0.05. Significant group (P = 0.0014) and group-by-time (P = 0.0004) effects were observed in resting ACTH such that PT horses differed from Non-PPID horses only at Day 0. PT horses had significantly lower changes in ACTH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation tests than PC horses at non-fall time points only, mid-late February 2018 (P = 0.016) and early April 2018 (P = 0.0172). When PT and PC horses did not differ, they were combined before comparison to Non-PPID horses. No significant group or group-by-time effects were seen in resting insulin, total cortisol, or free cortisol; however, significant time effects were observed in these measures. PPID horses had lower absolute lymphocyte (P = 0.028) and red blood cell (P = 0.0203) counts than Non-PPID horses. In unstimulated whole blood, PPID horses had increased IL-8 expression compared with Non-PPID horses (P = 0.0102). In addition, PPID horses had decreased interferon γ production from PBMCs after stimulation with R. equi (P = 0.0063) and E. coli (P = 0.0057) and showed increased transforming growth factor β expression after E. coli stimulation (P = 0.0399). The main limitations of this study were a limited sample size and an inability to truly randomize the PPID horses into treatment groups. Resting ACTH is likely the best choice for determining successful responses to pergolide. Neither PPID nor pergolide appears to influence insulin, total cortisol, and free cortisol. As measured, systemic immune function was altered in PPID horses, and it is likely that these horses are indeed at increased risk of opportunistic infection. Despite reducing ACTH, pergolide treatment did not appear to influence immune function.","Miller, A B; Loynachan, A T; Bush, H M; Hart, K A; Barker, V D; Campana-Emard, A G; Grubbs, S T; Adams, A A",Domestic animal endocrinology,410,28

Six major themes emerged: device attributes, patient experiences, parent experiences, provider experiences, barriers, and facilitators. Nasal trauma was the most commonly reported complication. Barriers included unreliable electricity and lack of bioengineering support. Facilitators included training, mentorship and empowerment of healthcare providers. Device design, supply chain infrastructure, and training models were imperative to the adoption and sustainability of CPAP. CONCLUSION Sustainable implementation of CPAP in low resource settings requires easy-to-use devices, ready access to consumables, and holistic, user-driven training. Further research is necessary on standardizing metrics, interventions that support optimal provider performance, and conditions needed for successful long-term health system integration.","Dada, Sara; Ashworth, Henry; Sobitschka, Alina; Raguveer, Vanitha; Sharma, Rupam; Hamilton, Rebecca L; Burke, Thomas",PloS one,410,17

However, the unprecedented year of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a drastic change in healthcare provision across all disease areas. In this review, we summarize changes that have been introduced to support rehabilitation in axSpA during the pandemic and considerations for the future of axSpA rehabilitation in the wake of COVID-19. We have witnessed the launch of online virtual physical therapy and education, in addition to an emphasis on remote monitoring. We have been propelled into a new era of digital service provision; not only providing a temporary stop-gap in treatment for some patients, but in future potentially allowing for a wider reach/ provision of care and resilience of vital services. Unique collaboration between patients, healthcare professionals and researchers will be key to foster relationships/ trust and facilitate wider evaluation and implementation of digital services at each stage in a patient's journey - imperative to relieve pressure from healthcare providers. Despite the potential of such digital interventions, it is important to highlight the maintained critical need for face-to-face services, particularly for vulnerable patients or during diagnosis or a flare of symptoms. It is also vital that we remain vigilant regarding digital exclusion, to avoid further widening of existing health inequalities. Optimisation of digital infrastructure, staff skills and digital education alongside promoting accessibility, engagement and building trust among communities will be vital as we enter this new age of blended in-person/ digital service provision.","Barnett, Rosemarie; Sengupta, Raj",Arthritis care & research,410,7

METHODS Seventy-one patients who underwent RT-PCR test for COVID-19 and chest CT within an interval of 4 days or less were included. Seventy-five CTs were reviewed and classified as typical, indeterminate, or atypical appearance or negative for pneumonia by 2 radiologists. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of the CT diagnostic criteria in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. RESULTS The prevalence of positive RT-PCR was 45.1%. It was obtained a sensitivity of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78%-89%), a specificity of 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%), an accuracy of 91% (95% CI, 85%-96%), a positive predictive value of 97% (95% CI, 91%-99%), and a negative predictive value of 86% (95% CI, 80%-92%). The diagnostic performance was excellent, considering the area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.99).

Little is known about how hospital surgeons spend their days, how they like specific tasks, and the role of core tasks (i.e. surgery-related tasks) versus tasks that may keep them from core tasks (e.g., administrative work). This study aimed at a more detailed picture of hospital surgeons' daily work - how much time they spend with different tasks, how they like them, and associations with satisfaction. METHODS Hospital surgeons (N = 105) responded to a general survey, and 81 of these provided up to five daily questionnaires concerning daily activities and their attractiveness, as well as their job satisfaction. The data were analyzed using t-tests, analysis of variance, as well as analysis of covariance and repeated measures analysis of variance for comparing means across tasks. RESULTS Among 14 tasks, surgery-related tasks took 21.2%, patient-related tasks 21.7% of the surgeons' time; 10.4% entailed meetings and communicating about patients, and 18.6% documentation and administration. The remaining time was spent with teaching, research, leadership and management, and not task-related activities (e.g. walking between rooms). Surgery was rated as most (4.25; SD = .66), administration as least attractive (2.63; SD = .78). A higher percentage of administration predicted lower perceived legitimacy; perceived legitimacy of administrative work predicted job satisfaction (r = .47). Residents were least satisfied; there were few gender differences. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons seem to thrive on their core tasks, most notably surgery. By contrast, administrative duties are likely perceived as keeping them from their core medical tasks. Increasing the percentage of medical tasks proper, notably surgery, and reducing administrative duties may contribute to hospital surgeons' job satisfaction.","Holzer, Eliane; Tschan, Franziska; Kottwitz, Maria U; Beldi, Guido; Businger, Adrian P; Semmer, Norbert K",BMC surgery,410,1

Check It is a seek-test-treat community-based Ct screening program for African American (AA) men who have sex with women and who are ages 15-24 years. This is an evaluation of adaptations made to the program aimed at improving index/partner notification and treatment rates. METHODS The original Check It intervention included free testing and treatment, contact tracing performed by a third party, expedited index therapy (EIT), and expedited partner therapy (EPT) via pharmacy pickup. The intervention was adapted following a series of in-depth interviews eliciting information to refine the program. Changes included continuity of testing, notification, and treatment by the same staff; expanded hours; and patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) with a medication mail-delivery option. Rates of index male and partner treatment were compared using log-binomial models and generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Men in the adapted intervention (n=85) were more likely than men in the original intervention (n=99) to be contacted (RR=1.14; 95% CI=1.02-1.27), make a treatment plan (RR=1.14; 95% CI=1.01-1.27), and complete treatment (RR=1.45; 95% CI=1.20-1.75).

We found that HeLa cells infected with 229E via APN formed syncytia when treated with trypsin or other proteases but not in a low-pH environment, a finding consistent with syncytium formation by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In addition, trypsin induced cleavage of the 229E S protein. By using infectious viruses and pseudotyped viruses bearing the 229E S protein, we found that its infection was profoundly blocked by lysosomotropic agents as well as by protease inhibitors that also prevented infection with SARS-CoV but not that caused by murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHMV, which enters cells directly from the cell surface. We found that cathepsin L (CPL) inhibitors blocked 229E infection the most remarkably among a variety of protease inhibitors tested. Furthermore, 229E infection was inhibited in CPL knockdown cells by small interfering RNA, compared with what was seen for a normal counterpart producing CPL. However, its inhibition was not so remarkable as that found with SARS-CoV infection, which seems to indicate that while CPL is involved in the fusogenic activation of 229E S protein in endosomal infection, not-yet-identified proteases could also play a part in that activity. We also found 229E virion S protein to be cleaved by CPL. Furthermore, as with SARS-CoV, 229E entered cells directly from the cell surface when cell-attached viruses were treated with trypsin. These findings suggest that 229E takes an endosomal pathway for cell entry and that proteases like CPL are involved in this mode of entry.","Kawase, Miyuki; Shirato, Kazuya; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,410,7

Methods: IBD patients in remission receiving infliximab or adalimumab treatment for ≥1 year who discontinued treatment were included. Relapse rates and predictors for relapse were studied using survival and Cox regression analysis. Results: In total, 101 patients were included (77 CD, 24 UC). A total of 56 patients (55%) experienced a relapse (CD 38, UC 18) with a median time to relapse of 32 and 18 months in CD and UC, respectively. Of patients that were retreated with the same anti-TNF agent, 84% responded. A trough serum concentration ≥2 µg/ml within 1 year prior to anti-TNF discontinuation was associated with a higher relapse rate in CD patients (HR 2.89; p = .018), which was more evident in patients requiring retreatment with biologicals, bowel-related surgery or experimental medication (HR: 4.18; p = .009). A young age (<17 years) at diagnosis was associated with a higher relapse rate (HR: 2.29; p = .040) and fecal calprotectin levels <25 µg/g with a lower relapse rate in CD patients (HR: 0.34; p = .041). Relapse rates, requiring treatment with biologicals or experimental medication, was lower in UC patients who continued immunosuppressive treatment (HR: 0.26; p = .042). Conclusions: Approximately 55% of patients relapsed after anti-TNF withdrawal with a median time to relapse of 32 and 18 months in CD and UC, respectively. Retreatment with the same anti-TNF was successful in 84% of patients.","Bots, Steven J; Kuin, Sabine; Ponsioen, Cyriel Y; Gecse, Krisztina B; Duijvestein, Marjolijn; D'Haens, Geert R; Löwenberg, Mark",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,410,31

Intubation with Shikani Optical Stylet (SOS) has become increasingly popular in difficult airway. We compared the effects of intubation with SOS versus Macintosh laryngoscope (MLS) in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis. METHODS A total of 270 patients scheduled for elective surgery for cervical spondylosis of spinal cord and nerve root type from August 2012 to January 2016 were enrolled and randomly allocated to the MLS or SOS group by random numbers. Patients were evaluated for difficult airway preoperatively, and Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopy classification was determined during anesthesia induction. Difficult airway was defined as Cormack-Lehane Grades III-IV. Patients were intubated with the randomly assigned intubation device. The success rate, intubation time, required assistance, immediate complications, and postoperative complaints were recorded. Categorical variables were analyzed by Chi-square test, and continuous variables were analyzed by independent samples t-test or rank sum test. RESULTS The success rate of intubation among normal airways was 100% in both groups. In patients with difficult airway, the success rates in the MLS and SOS groups were 84.2% and 94.1%, respectively (P = 0.605). Intubation with SOS took longer compared with MLS (normal airway: 25.1 ± 5.8 s vs. 24.5 ± 5.7 s, P = 0.426; difficult airway: 38.5 ± 8.5 s vs. 36.1 ± 8.2 s, P = 0.389). Intubation with SOS required less assistance in patients with difficult airway (5.9% vs. 100%, P< 0.001). The frequency of postoperative sore throat was lower in SOS group versus MLS group in patients with normal airway (22.0% vs. 34.5%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS SOS is a safe and effective airway management device in patients undergoing surgery for cervical spondylosis. Compared with MLS, SOS appears clinically beneficial for intubation, especially in patients with difficult airway.

The distinct differences between devices along with disadvantages and ways of minimizing hazards will be analyzed. RECENT FINDINGS Since the first surgical application of electricity in the 1880s, the use of radiofrequency current in surgery has grown. Although monopolar and bipolar energy form the backbone of electrosurgery, various modifications have been made to both the electrosurgical generators and the hand instruments. Much of the driving force behind these modifications has been the goal of minimizing possible complications while improving surgical efficiency. Recently, the ability to obtain vessel sealing has dramatically impacted clinical practice in open, laparoscopic, and vaginal surgery. SUMMARY Current evidence demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of electrosurgical devices in gynecologic surgery. Technology has evolved to allow vessel sealing capability through various instruments. Critical to the successful use of these advanced electrosurgical devices is a thorough understanding of their individual differences and nuances in order to obtain the desired tissue effects. Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate applications and surgical procedures for these devices.","Advincula, Arnold P; Wang, Karen",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,410,1

CVST usually occurs young adults with a female predominance. The current mainstay for treating CVST is anticoagulation with heparin. However, more aggressive interventions, endovascular treatment as an example, may be indicated in selected patients who are non-responsive to heparin and other anticoagulants. Endovascular approaches include catheter-based local chemical thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty and mechanical thrombectomy, all of which may rapidly recanalize the occluded venous sinus, restore the blood flow, reduce the increased intracranial pressure, and subsequently relieve the corresponding symptoms. However, as an invasive strategy, endovascular procedures per se may cause complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage, vessel dissection and pulmonary embolization, which may substantially decrease the benefit-risk ratio of the treatment. Due to the rareness of the condition and the limited indication of this invasive strategy, safety and efficacy of endovascular procedures in treating CVST are less feasible to be evaluated in large randomized clinical trails. Therefore, the evidences for justifying this treatment strategy are largely derived from case reports, cohort studies and clinical observations.","Qiu, Zhongming; Sang, Hongfei; Dai, Qiliang; Xu, Gelin",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,410,1

The results of conducted studies investigating the effects of videolaryngoscopies on hemodynamic response of tracheal intubation are conflicting. We know little about the effects of videolaryngoscopies on cardiac output changes during tracheal intubation. We compared cardiac output (COP) and hemodynamic responses in normal blood pressure (n=60) and hypertensive patients (n=60) among 3 intubation devices: the MAC, the UE videolaryngoscopy ® (UE), and the UE video intubation stylet ® (VS). Cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded using LidcoRapid (V2)® preinduction, preintubation, and every minute for the first 5 min after intubation. We assessed oropharyngeal and laryngeal structures injury as well. Intubation time was significantly shorter than MAC groups (P<0.001) only in UE group of normotensive and hypertensive patients. In normotensive patients, there were no significant differences in any of COP variables or hemodynamic variables among the three devices. In hypertensive patients, SBP and DBP in the MAC group were significantly higher (P<0.05 or <0.01) than the UE and VS groups at 1, 2 and 3 min after intubation, but there were no significant differences in CI, SVI and HR among the three devices. There was no significant difference in oropharyngeal and laryngeal structures injury among all groups. It was concluded that both the UE and VS attenuate only the hemodynamic response to intubation as compared with the MAC in hypertensive patients, but not in normotensive patients.","Abdelgawad, Amro Faez; Shi, Qin-Fang; Halawa, Mohamed Abo; Wu, Zhi-Lin; Wu, Zhou-Yang; Chen, Xiang-Dong; Yao, Shang-Long",Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

This study is an evaluation of the use of PC during the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at a single hospital. METHODS Fifty patients with AC were admitted as of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey through June 2020. Patients with pancreatitis, cholangitis, and/or incomplete data were excluded from the study. Data of the remaining 36 patients included in the study were recorded and a descriptive statistical analysis was performed. The patients were divided into three groups: PC (n=14), only conservative treatment with antibiotherapy (OC) (n=14), and LC (n=8). The findings were compared with a group of 70 similar patients from the pre-pandemic period. RESULTS The mean age of the pandemic period patients was 53 years (range: 26-78 years).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May 2014 and June 2015, three consecutive oncologic patients (mean age 65 years; range 57-75 years) with symptomatic pathological shoulder-girdle fractures unsuitable for surgery and radiotherapy underwent percutaneous image-guided screw fixation. Fractures occurred through metastases (n = 2) or a post-ablation cavity (n = 1). Mechanical properties of osteosynthesis were adjudged superior to stand-alone cementoplasty in each case. Cannulated screws were placed under combined CT and fluoroscopic guidance with complementary radiofrequency ablation or cementoplasty to optimise local palliation and secure screw fixation, respectively, in two cases. Follow-up was undertaken every few weeks until mortality or most recent appointment. RESULTS Four pathological fractures were treated in three patients (2 acromion, 1 clavicular, 1 coracoid). Mean size of associated lesion was 2.6 cm (range 1-4.5 cm). Technical success was achieved in all cases (100 %), without complications. Good palliation and restoration of mobility were observed in two cases at 2-3 months; one case could not be followed due to early post-procedural oncologic mortality. CONCLUSION Percutaneous image-guided shoulder-girdle osteosynthesis appears technically feasible with good short-term efficacy in this complex patient subset. Further studies are warranted to confirm these promising initial results.","Garnon, Julien; Koch, Guillaume; Ramamurthy, Nitin; Caudrelier, Jean; Rao, Pramod; Tsoumakidou, Georgia; Cazzato, Roberto Luigi; Gangi, Afshin",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,410,31

Months later Elaine Pico and I tried to pick up where we had left off, but after putting out an initial call for papers and having essentially no responses, it seemed that we would not fulfill Dr. Neufeld's vision of having an issue focusing on ethical issues. Then a global pandemic hit that disrupted every aspect of our lives: how we view ourselves, how we take care of our patients, even how we interact with friends, family, and colleagues. Dr. Pico recognized the incredible ethical impact of all this, and we resuscitated the plan for an issue addressing the myriad ethical issues facing us as we try to provide the best possible care to our patients in the midst of the most trying times of our generation. This issue covers many topics you will find relevant to your practice. One issue not addressed by any of the authors in this edition is that of a COVID-19 vaccine. In my role as chair of the Pediatric Ethics Committee of the University of Michigan and Co-Chief of the Clinical Ethics Service of the Center for Bioethics & Social Sciences in Medicine (CBSSM), I am privileged to have discussed the many complicated issues related to a vaccine with my colleagues over the past several months. What follows has benefitted from conversations with my clinical ethics fellow Lulia Kana, my co-chief of clinical ethics, Andrew G. Shuman, and the chief of our research ethics committee, Kayte Spector-Bagdady.","Vercler, Christian",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,410,1

OBJECTIVES This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated resistance training for body composition outcomes in healthy adults. Our primary outcome was body fat percentage; secondary outcomes were body fat mass and visceral fat. DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES We searched five electronic databases up to January 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included randomised trials that compared full-body resistance training for at least 4 weeks to no-exercise control in healthy adults. ANALYSIS We assessed study quality with the TESTEX tool and conducted a random-effects meta-analysis, with a subgroup analysis based on measurement type (scan or non-scan) and sex (male or female), and a meta-regression for volume of resistance training and training components. RESULTS From 11,981 records, we included 58 studies in the review, with 54 providing data for a meta-analysis. Mean study quality was 9/15 (range 6-15). Compared to the control, resistance training reduced body fat percentage by - 1.46% (95% confidence interval - 1.78 to - 1.14, p < 0.0001), body fat mass by - 0.55 kg (95% confidence interval - 0.75 to - 0.34, p < 0.0001) and visceral fat by a standardised mean difference of - 0.49 (95% confidence interval - 0.87 to - 0.11, p = 0.0114). Measurement type was a significant moderator in body fat percentage and body fat mass, but sex was not. Training volume and training components were not associated with effect size.

Examples include school closures, environmental cleaning and disinfection, mask mandates, restrictions on freedom of assembly and lockdowns. These NPIs depend on coercion for their effectiveness, either directly or indirectly. A widely held view is that coercive policies need to be publicly justified-justified to each citizen-to be legitimate. Standardly, this is thought to entail that there is a scientific consensus on the factual propositions that are used to support the policies. In this paper, we argue that such a consensus has been lacking on the factual propositions justifying most NPIs. Consequently, they would on the standard view be illegitimate. This is regrettable since there are good reasons for granting the state the legitimate authority to enact NPIs under conditions of uncertainty. The upshot of our argument is that it is impossible to have both the standard interpretation of the permissibility of empirical claims in public justification and an effective pandemic response. We provide an alternative view that allows the state sufficient room for action while precluding the possibility of it acting without empirical support.","Dahlquist, Marcus; Kugelberg, Henrik D",Journal of medical ethics,410,1

This study was designed to determine event-free survival (EFS) for adolescents with GCTs and compared them with children and young adults. METHODS An individual patient database of 11 GCT trials was assembled: 8 conducted by pediatric cooperative groups and 3 conducted by an adult group. Male patients aged 0 to 30 years with metastatic, nonseminomatous, malignant GCTs of the testis, retroperitoneum, or mediastinum who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were included. The age groups were categorized as children (0 to <11 years), adolescents (11 to <18 years), and young adults (18 to ≤30 years). The study compared EFS and adjusted for risk group by using Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS From a total of 2024 individual records, 593 patients met the inclusion criteria: 90 were children, 109 were adolescents, and 394 were young adults. The 5-year EFS rate was lower for adolescents (72%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-79%) than children (90%; 95% CI, 81%-95%; P = .003) or young adults (88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P = .0002). The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group risk group was associated with EFS in the adolescent age group (P = .0020). After adjustments for risk group, the difference in EFS between adolescents and children remained significant (hazard ratio, 0.30; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS EFS for adolescent patients with metastatic GCTs was similar to that for young adults but significantly worse than for that children. This finding highlights the importance of coordinating initiatives across clinical trial organizations to improve outcomes for adolescents and young adults. LAY SUMMARY Adolescent males with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) are frequently treated with regimens developed for children. In this study, a large data set of male patients with metastatic GCTs across different age groups has been built to understand the outcomes of adolescent patients in comparison with children and young adults. The results suggest that adolescent males with metastatic GCTs have worse results than children and are more similar to young adults with GCTs. Therefore, the treatment of adolescents with GCTs should resemble therapeutic approaches for young adults.","Shaikh, Furqan; Stark, Daniel; Fonseca, Adriana; Dang, Ha; Xia, Caihong; Krailo, Mark; Pashankar, Farzana; Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos; Olson, Thomas A; Nicholson, James C; Murray, Matthew J; Amatruda, James F; Billmire, Deborah; Stoneham, Sara; Frazier, A Lindsay",Cancer,410,31

Meaning salience, or the awareness of the meaning in one's life, is believed to partially explain this relationship. However, in times of isolation, what might be most salient to people are the meaningful aspects of their lives that have disappeared. This study seeks to understand how making gained versus lost meaning salient affects anxiety and depression. Participants either wrote for 5 minutes about how their life gained meaning (n = 29) or lost meaning (n = 30) due to the coronavirus restrictions, or about music (i.e., the control condition; n = 32). Those who wrote about gained meaning experienced less momentary anxiety than those who wrote about lost meaning. In addition, meaning salience moderated the relationship between meaning and both anxiety and depression. Those who wrote about gained meaning appeared to exhibit a positive relationship between meaning in life (MIL) and both anxiety and depression, while those who wrote about lost meaning exhibited negative relationships. In all, this suggests that meaning salience is not always positive and that researchers and practitioners should consider how making positive meaning salient may be more beneficial than a general focus on MIL.","Klussman, Kristine; Nichols, Austin Lee; Langer, Julia",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,410,1

A number of foodborne outbreaks associated with food products of animal and non-animal origins, which often involve multiple cases of variety of food streams, have been reported. Although several viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, parvovirus, and other enteroviruses, significantly contribute to incidence of gastrointestinal diseases, systematic information on the role of food in transmitting such viruses is limited. Most of the outbreak cases caused by infected food handlers were the source of 53% of total outbreaks. Therefore, prevention and hygiene measures to reduce the frequency of foodborne virus outbreaks should focus on food workers and production site of food products. Pivotal strategies, such as proper investigation, surveillance, and reports on foodborne viral illnesses, are needed in order to develop more accurate measures to detect the presence and pathogenesis of viral infection with detailed descriptions. Moreover, molecular epidemiology and surveillance of food samples may help analysis of public health hazards associated with exposure to foodborne viruses. In this present review, we discuss different aspects of foodborne viral contamination and its impact on human health. This review also aims to improve understanding of foodborne viral infections as major causes of human illness as well as provide descriptions of their control and prevention strategies and rapid detection by advanced molecular techniques. Further, a brief description of methods available for the detection of viruses in food and related matrices is provided.","Shukla, Shruti; Cho, Hyunjeong; Kwon, O Jun; Chung, Soo Hyun; Kim, Myunghee",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,410,1

The study aim was to compare short- and long-term outcomes among HCC patients with normal and diseased liver parenchyma, undergoing potentially curative liver resection in a developing country. MATERIALS AND METHODS From November 2001 until January 2017, 228 patients with HCC underwent curative-intent hepatectomy at the University Clinic for Digestive Surgery. From that number, 190 patients were eligible for analysis. Diseased liver (DL) was present in 112 patients while 78 patients had HCC in non-diseased liver (NDL). RESULTS Median age, sex, ASA score, the presence of extrahepatic disease and lobar distribution of tumors were similar in both groups. The number of tumors was higher in DL group, while tumor diameter was higher in NDL group. Anatomic liver resection and major liver resections were performed more commonly in NDL than in DL group (66.7 vs 47.4%, p = 0.008; 33.3 vs. 15.2%, p = 0.003). Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher in DL group (p = 0.004). Overall survival was statistically longer in NDL group (p = 0.024). By univariate analysis potential prognostic factors for long-term survival were identified: presence of chronic HCV infection, presence of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score B and operative time longer than 240 min. The last two were confirmed by multivariate analysis as independent negative prognostic factors for overall survival. CONCLUSION Liver resection in patients with HCC arising in non-diseased livers, despite of need for extended hepatectomies, provides favorable long-term prognosis.","Bogdanovic, Aleksandar; Bulajic, Predrag; Zuvela, Marinko; Bidzic, Nemanja; Zivanovic, Marko; Galun, Danijel",Surgical oncology,410,6

However, studies relating to the ecological impacts of DBPs on the aquatic environment remain insufficient. In this study, we comparatively investigated the toxicities and ecological risks of 17 typical, halogenated DBPs to three trophic levels of organisms in the freshwater ecosystem, including phytoplankton (Scenedesmus sp.), zooplankton (Daphnia magna), and fish (Danio rerio). Toxicity of DBPs was found to be species-specific: Scenedesmus sp. was the most sensitive to haloacetic acids, while D. magna was the most sensitive to haloacetonitriles and trihalomethanes. Specific to each DBP, toxicities were also related to their classes and substituted halogen atoms. Damage to photosystems and oxidative stress served as the potential mechanisms for DBPs toxicity to microalgae. The different sensitivities to DBPs indicate that a battery of bioassays with organisms at different trophic levels is necessary to determine the ecotoxicity of DBPs. Furthermore, the ecological risks of DBPs were assessed by calculating the risk quotients (RQs) based on toxicity data from multiple bioassays. The cumulative RQs of DBPs to all the organisms were greater than 1.0, indicating high ecological risks of DBPs in wastewater effluents.","Cui, Huijun; Chen, Baiyang; Jiang, Yuelu; Tao, Yi; Zhu, Xiaoshan; Cai, Zhonghua",Environmental science & technology,410,1

To better understand which populations cannot access telemedicine during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, this study aims to demographically describe and identify the most important demographic predictors of telemedicine visit completion in an urban health system. METHODS Patient de-identified demographics and telemedicine visit data (N = 362,764) between March 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020 were combined with Internal Revenue Service 2018 individual income tax data by postal code. Descriptive statistics and mixed effects logistic regression were used to determine impactful patient predictors of telemedicine completion, while adjusting for clustering at the clinical site level. RESULTS Many patient-specific demographics were found to be significant. Descriptive statistics showed older patients had lower rates of completion (p < 0.001). Also, Hispanic patients had statistically significant lower rates (p < 0.001). Overall, minorities (racial, ethnic, and language) had decreased odds ratios of successful telemedicine completion compared to the reference. DISCUSSION While telemedicine use continues to be critical during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, entire populations struggle with access-possibly widening existing disparities. These results contribute large datasets with significant findings to the limited research on telemedicine access and can help guide us in improving telemedicine disparities across our health systems and on a wider scale.","Gmunder, Kristin N; Ruiz, Jose W; Franceschi, Dido; Suarez, Maritza M",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,410,24

SPSI was tested on LnCAP prostate tumor models in mice; tumor localization was observed after intravenous (IV) injection of the contrast agent. Consistent with enhanced permeability and retention, the silica nanoparticles displayed an extended imaging lifetime of 3.3±1 days (mean±standard deviation). With added tumor specific folate functionalization, the useful lifetime was extended to 12 ± 2 days; in contrast to ligand-based tumor targeting, the effect of the ligands in this application is enhanced nanoparticle retention by the tumor.

Due to their regenerative and reparative properties, MSCs are extremely valuable for cell-based therapy in tackling several pathological conditions including COVID-19. Iron is essential for MSC processes but iron-loading, which is common in several chronic conditions, hinders normal MSC functionality. This not only aggravates disease pathology but can also affect allogeneic and autologous MSC therapy. Thus, understanding MSCs from an iron perspective is of clinical significance. Accordingly, this review highlights the roles of iron and iron-related proteins in MSC physiology. It describes the contribution of iron and endogenous iron-related effectors like hepcidin, ferroportin, transferrin receptor, lactoferrin, lipocalin-2, bone morphogenetic proteins and hypoxia inducible factors in MSC biology. It summarises the excess-iron-induced alterations in MSC components, processes and discusses signalling pathways involving ROS, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, p53, AMPK/MFF/DRP1 and Wnt. Additionally, it evaluates the endogenous and exogenous saviours of MSCs against iron-toxicity. Lastly, it elaborates on the involvement of MSCs in the pathology of clinical conditions of iron-excess, namely, hereditary hemochromatosis, diabetes, β-thalassaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. This unique review integrates the distinct fields of iron regulation and MSC physiology. Through an iron-perspective, it describes both mechanistic and clinical aspects of MSCs and proposes an iron-linked MSC-contribution to physiology, pathology and therapeutics. It advances the understanding of MSC biology and may aid in identifying signalling pathways, molecular targets and compounds for formulating adjunctive iron-based therapies for excess-iron conditions, and thereby inform regenerative medicine.","Mehta, Kosha J",Journal of cellular physiology,410,16

We now identify the IFN-γ-producing cells as a mixture of natural killer (NK) and T cells. Although both caspase-1 and caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D in macrophages and neutrophils, we find that NLRC4-activated caspase-1 triggers pyroptosis in macrophages, but this pathway does not trigger pyroptosis in neutrophils. In contrast, caspase-11 triggers pyroptosis in both macrophages and neutrophils. This translates to an absolute requirement for caspase-11 in neutrophils during B. thailandensis infection in mice.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).

Social relationships and meaningful activities performed by PWA are also crucial to promote positive psychosocial well-being. As a precautionary measure specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, most PWA worldwide have generally followed the guidelines of going out less, restricting when and where to gather with friends and peers, reducing social activities, and maintaining appropriate social distance; these acts are contrary to the traditional principles of managing aphasia. This article aims to (a) highlight and add to our understanding of issues related to the impact of the currently evolving COVID-19 pandemic on PWA, (b) direct readers to relevant reports in the literature of telerehabilitation for aphasia to look for useful information regarding remote assessment and therapy to be considered during the pandemic, (c) summarize support initiatives developed and resources compiled thus far as well as provide links for caregivers and PWA to find more information about COVID-19 in their communities, and (d) offer recommendations to potentially move the field of aphasia research and clinical PWA services forward in a positive way to endure the pandemic and in the forthcoming post-COVID world. Conclusions At present, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the short and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on PWA and their caregivers. It is crucial that different stakeholders be sensitive and flexible when addressing the psychosocial and rehabilitation needs of PWA to mitigate the negative effects during and after the COVID-19 era.","Kong, Anthony Pak-Hin","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",410,8

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that MWA has comparable safety and efficacy to Cryo in the treatment of selected T1a renal masses. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective comparative analysis of two patient cohorts was carried out on 83 nodules in 72 consecutive patients treated using image-guided percutaneous ablation with either Cryo or MWA. Patient demographics, tumor histology and characteristics, technical success, procedure time, adverse events and complications, nephrometry score (mRENAL) and renal function were evaluated. Local recurrence was evaluated at 1, 6, 12 and 18-24 months. RESULTS Fifty-one nodules were treated with Cryo and 32 with MWA (44 and 28 patients, respectively). No statistical differences were observed following Cryo or MWA in median tumor size (p = 0.6), mRENAL (p = 0.1) or technical success (p = 0.8). Median procedure time was significantly lower using microwave ablation (p = 0.003). Median follow-up time was similar in the two groups (22 and 20 months, respectively). Occurrence of complications did not differ (Cryo 5/51, MWA 2/32; p = 0.57), and probability of complications or technical success adjusted for mRENAL did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.6). Renal function was preserved in all patients regardless of techniques. Disease recurrence was observed in 3/47 and in 1/30 treated nodules in the Cryo and MWA groups, respectively, without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.06).

The accelerated weathering test applied consecutive steps of UV irradiation (at 340 nm and 0.76 W m-2 irradiance) and moisture at 50 °C following the ASTM D4329 standard for up to 2000 h of exposure time. The morphology, chemical structure, crystallization, as well as the mechanical and thermal properties were studied. Samples were characterized after 500, 1000, and 2000 h of exposure time. Different degradation mechanisms were proposed to occur during the weathering exposure and were confirmed based on the experimental data. The PHBV surface revealed cracks and increasing roughness with the increasing exposure time, whereas the PHBV/TiO2 nanocomposites showed surface changes only after 2000 h of accelerated weathering. The degradation of neat PHBV under moisture and UV exposure occurred preferentially in the amorphous phase. In contrast, the presence of TiO2 in the nanocomposites retarded this process, but the degradation would occur simultaneously in both the amorphous and crystalline segments of the polymer after long exposure times. The thermal stability, as well as the temperature and rate of crystallization, decreased in the absence of TiO2. TiO2 not only provided UV protection, but also restricted the physical mobility of the polymer chains, acting as a nucleating agent during the crystallization process. It also slowed down the decrease in mechanical properties. The mechanical properties were shown to gradually decrease for the PHBV/TiO2 nanocomposites, whereas a sharp drop was observed for the neat PHBV after an accelerated weathering exposure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), using the amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM) tool, also confirmed the mechanical changes in the surface area of the PHBV and PHBV/TiO2 samples after accelerated weathering exposure. The changes in the physical and chemical properties of PHBV/TiO2 confirm the barrier activity of TiO2 for weathering attack and its retardation of the degradation process.","Antunes, Ana; Popelka, Anton; Aljarod, Omar; Hassan, Mohammad K; Kasak, Peter; Luyt, Adriaan S",Polymers,410,31

Methods: The average age of 72 corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients was (45.53±16.74)years(median age:47 year), including (44.88±17.09) years(median age:46 year) for 38 males and (46.32±16.52)years (median age:46 year) for 34 females in Loudi City, Hunan Province. There is no significant difference in genders between the severe and mild groups (χ²=0.916, P>0.05). There is a significant difference in the age between the severe and mild groups (F=3.315, P<0.05). The blood samples of 72 discharged patients were collected and the consistence of IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence method. SPSS25.0 was used for gender, age, case type and antibody analysis of variance, χ2 test and other analysis. Results: The average time of the serum samples collection of 72 patients was (34.89±9.02)days (median time: 34 days) from onset of COVID-19, and (14.53±8.35) days (median time: 14 days) from discharge. The positive rate of IgM or IgG was 97.22% (70/72), and the positive rate of IgM and IgG was 48.61% (35/72) and 97.22% (70/72) respectively. Serum COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 72 patients from 1st to 40th days after discharge. The average concentration of IgM in 1-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days, 22-28 days, above 29 days were 21.91(7.07-52.84)AU/ml, 14.16(6.19-32.88)AU/ml, 11.36(6.65-42.15)AU/ml, 8.15(3.66-30.12)AU/ml, 2.98(0.46-6.37)AU/ml. There was no significant difference in the time of IgM antibody concentration (H= 8.439, P>0.05). The average concentrations of IgG in 1-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days, 22-28 days, 29 days and above were 169.90 (92.06-190.91) AU/ml, 163.89 (91.19-208.02) AU/ml, 173.31 (95.06-191.28) AU/ml, 122.84 (103.19-188.34) AU/ml, 101.98 (43.75-175.30) AU/ml, respectively, (H=2.232, P>0.05). The IgM becomes negative after the 3rd week of discharge and decreases rapidly with time. The IgG concentration higher than IgM during the same period, and keep at high level without any change, and decrease in the fourth week. Among them, 5 cases developed ""re-infection"" within 1-3 weeks after discharge, and the rate of ""re-infection"" was 6.94% (5/72 cases). Conclusions: After the COVID-19 patients are discharged from the hospital, the level of antibodies produced varies greatly among individuals, but the overall changes in antibodies have a certain pattern. It is recommended to strengthen the antibody monitoring during hospitalization and after discharge from the hospital to reduce the ""re-infection"" rate and potential risk of infection.","Shen, G; Yang, G; Zeng, Z Y; Hu, Y; Li, Q; Liu, Z G; Fu, H Y; Hu, J Y; Zhu, P; Huang, J H; Lu, Q Q; Shi, S J; He, Y; Xie, X B",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],410,1

Although the drug discovery process is a challenging and time-consuming, fortunately, the plant kingdom was found to have many active therapeutics possessing broad-spectrum antiviral activity including those candidates active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV). Herein, nine traditional Chinese medicinal plant constituents from different origins (Glycyrrhizin 1, Lycorine 2, Puerarin 3, Daidzein 4, Daidzin 5, Salvianolic acid B 6, Dihydrotanshinone I 7, Tanshinone I 8, Tanshinone IIa 9) previously reported to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV were virtually screened in silico (molecular docking) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 target proteins. The tested medicinal plant compounds were in silico screened for their activity against two key SARS-CoV-2 target proteins; 3CLpro, and Spike binding-domain proteins. Among the tested medicinal plant compounds, Salvianolic acid B 6 (Sal-B) showed promising binding affinities against the two specified SARS-CoV-2 target proteins compared to the reference standards used. Hence molecular dynamics simulations followed by calculating the free-binding energy were carried out for Sal-B providing information on its affinity, stability, and thermodynamic behavior within the two SARS-CoV-2 target proteins as well as key ligand-protein binding aspects. Besides, the quantum mechanical calculations showed that Sal-B can adopt different conformations due to the existence of various rotatable bonds. Therefore, the enhanced antiviral activity of Sal-B among other studied compounds can be also attributed to the structural flexibility of Sal-B. Our study gives an explanation of the structure activity relationship required for targeting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and Spike proteins and also facilitates the future design and synthesis of new potential drugs exhibiting better affinity and specificity. Besides, an ADME study was carried out on screened compounds and reference controls revealing their pharmacokinetics properties.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with pathologic N2 NSCLC who underwent complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from 2006 to 2010 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base and stratified by use of PORT (≥ 45 Gy). A total of 4,483 patients were identified (PORT, n = 1,850; no PORT, n = 2,633). The impact of patient and treatment variables on OS was explored using Cox regression. RESULTS Median follow-up time was 22 months. On univariable analysis, improved OS correlated with younger age, treatment at an academic facility, female sex, urban population, higher income, lower Charlson comorbidity score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT. On multivariable analysis, improved OS remained independently predicted by younger age, female sex, urban population, lower Charlson score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT (hazard ratio, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.798 to 0.988). Use of PORT was associated with an increase in median and 5-year OS compared with no PORT (median OS, 45.2 v 40.7 months, respectively; 5-year OS, 39.3% [95% CI, 35.4% to 43.5%] v 34.8% [95% CI, 31.6% to 38.3%], respectively; P = .014).

OBJECTIVE To describe surgical techniques and provide clinical outcomes for robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) with selective clamping and robotic upper urinary tract reconstruction featuring novel applications of NIRF imaging. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from 90 patients who underwent successful RPN with selective clamping or upper urinary tract reconstruction utilizing NIRF imaging between April 2011 and October 2012 were reviewed. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed RPN utilizing NIRF imaging to aid with selective clamping and upper tract reconstruction with NIRF imaging, the details of which are outlined in this paper and the accompanying video. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Patient characteristics, perioperative outcomes, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Of the 48 RPN patients for whom selective clamping was attempted successfully, median estimated blood loss was 200.0 ml, warm ischemia time was 17.0 min, and median change in estimated glomerular filtration rate was -6.3%. There was a 12.5% complication rate, and all complications were Clavien grade 1-3 (14.3%). The upper urinary tract reconstruction utilizing NIRF imaging was performed in 42 patients and included pyelopasty (n=20), ureteral reimplant (n=13), ureterolysis (n=7), and ureteroureterostomy (n=2). Radiographic and symptomatic improvement was observed in 100% of the pyeloplasty, ureteral reimplant, and ureteroureterostomy patients and 71.4% of ureterolysis patients, for an overall success rate of 95.2%. This study is limited by the small sample size, the short follow-up period, and the lack of a comparative cohort. CONCLUSIONS Our technique of RPN with selective arterial clamping and robotic upper urinary tract reconstruction utilizing NIRF imaging is presented. This technology provides real-time intraoperative angiogram to confirm selective ischemia and may be an adjunct technology to confirm well-perfused tissue within a reconstruction anastomosis. Further investigation is needed to evaluate long-term outcomes of NIRF imaging in robotic upper urinary tract surgery and to delineate its indications.","Bjurlin, Marc A; Gan, Melanie; McClintock, Tyler R; Volpe, Alessandro; Borofsky, Michael S; Mottrie, Alexandre; Stifelman, Michael D",European urology,410,12

Previous literature reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of using SBL in nursing education. However, there is a need to explore how and why it works to expand the theoretical foundation of SBL. Realist reviews are a theory-based approach to synthesizing existing evidence on how complex programs work in particular contexts or settings. OBJECTIVE This review aims to understand how, why, and in what circumstances the use of simulation affects learning as part of the bachelor's program in nursing. METHODS A realist review will be conducted in accordance with the realist template for a systematic review. In particular, we will identify and explore the underlying assumption of how SBL is supposed to work, that is, identify and explore program theories of SBL. The review will be carried out as an iterative process of searching, appraising, and synthesizing the evidence to uncover theoretical concepts that explain the causal effects of SBL. In the final section of the review, we will involve stakeholders in the Norwegian community in a web-based Delphi survey to ensure that the emerging theoretical framework derived from the published literature aligns with stakeholders' experience in practice. RESULTS The Norwegian Centre for Research Data (project number 60415) has approved the study. We have performed an initial literature search, whereas quality appraisal and data extraction are ongoing processes.

Serum biochemistry and histological examination indicated severe liver damage consistent with microcystin toxicosis. Microscopic observation of reservoir water samples, limited to frozen or poorly stored and partially degraded samples, indicated the presence of abundant Anabaena/Dolichospermum, but the presence of other toxic cyanobacteria such as Microcystis could not be excluded. Metagenomic analysis showed the presence in these samples of a single cyanobacterium whose cpcBA, rpoB and rbcL genes indicated membership in the Anabaena/Dolichospermum genus. The sequence of a complete mcy gene cluster with homology to previously identified Anabaena mcy genes was recovered. These results emphasize the capacity for Anabaena/Dolichospermum blooms to produce lethal levels of microcystin, posing a danger to public health and livestock.

There are numerous receptors, antigens, and biomarkers that have been discovered as oncological targets (oncotargets) for cancer diagnosis and treatment applications. Oncotargets are critically important to navigate active anticancer drug ingredients to specific disease sites with no/minimal effect on surrounding normal cells. In silico techniques relating to genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics have catalyzed the discovery of oncotargets for various cancer types. Effective oncotargeting requires high-affinity probes engineered for specific binding of receptors associated with the malignancy. Computational methods such as structural modeling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations offer opportunities to structurally design novel ligands and optimize binding affinity for specific oncotargets. This article proposes a streamlined approach for the development of ligand-oncotarget bioaffinity systems via integrated structural modeling and MD simulations, making use of proteomics, genomic, and X-ray crystallographic resources, to support targeted diagnosis and treatment of cancers and tumors.","Jeevanandam, Jaison; Sabbih, Godfred; Tan, Kei X; Danquah, Michael K",Molecular biotechnology,410,20

Recent evidence suggests that stress may enhance virus shedding by bats increasing the possibility of transmission to other species. To understand the reasons for spillover is therefore important to determine the molecular pathways that link stress to virus reactivation and shedding in bats. We recently isolated and characterized a gammaherpesvirus (Eptesicus fuscus herpesvirus, EfHV) autochthonous to North American big brown bats. Since herpesviruses are known to reactivate from latent infections in response to a wide variety of stressors, EfHV presents us with an opportunity to study how physiological, behavioural or environmental changes may influence the big brown bats' relationship with EfHV. To understand the biology of the virus and how the extended periods of torpor experienced by these bats during hibernation along with the stress of arousal might influence the virus-host relationship, we attempted to detect the virus in the blood of wild-caught non-hibernating bats as well as captive bats arising from hibernation. We compared the prevalence of EfHV in the blood (using PCR) and EfHV-specific antibodies (using ELISA) between captive hibernating bats and wild-caught non-hibernating bats. We detected EfHV only in the blood of captive hibernating bats (27.8% = 10/36) and not in wild-caught non-hibernating bats (0.0% = 0/43). In contrast, the EfHV-specific antibody titres were higher in the non-hibernating bats compared to the hibernating bats. Our study suggests that: (a) viral DNA in blood indicates reactivation from latency, (b) long periods of hibernation lead to suppression of immunity, (c) stress of arousal from hibernation reactivates the virus in bats with lower levels of anti-viral immunity (indicated by humoral immune response), and (d) levels of anti-viral immunity increase in non-hibernating bats following reactivation.","Gerow, Caleigh M; Rapin, Noreen; Voordouw, Maarten J; Elliot, Melanie; Misra, Vikram; Subudhi, Sonu",Transboundary and emerging diseases,410,1

RESULTS Across the sample 13% reported moderate depressive symptoms, 9% reported moderate anxiety symptoms, and 26% endorsed being ""lonely."" The emotionally distressed group endorsed more loneliness, lower resiliency, less physical exercise, and worse physical health. The low Socio-Economic Status group endorsed less loneliness, less likely to engage in physical exercise and worse physical health.The lonely group endorsed less resilience, less physical exercise, and worse physical health. A multiple logistic regression found that resilience, socioeconomic status, and physical health were significant predictors of loneliness, whereas global health was the best predictor of emotional distress. CONCLUSIONS Even after prolonged social distancing, older adults in this study did not report greater psychological distress compared to earlier studies of older adults during COVID-19. Older adults with lower SES, worse physical health, and less resiliency, were more likely to report more loneliness. It is this group that should be the focus of intervention.","Sams, Nichole; Fisher, Dylan M; Mata-Greve, Felicia; Johnson, Morgan; Pullmann, Michael D; Raue, Patrick J; Renn, Brenna N; Duffy, Jaden; Darnell, Doyanne; Fillipo, Isabell Griffith; Allred, Ryan; Huynh, Kathy; Friedman, Emily; Areán, Patricia A",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,410,31

Our primary objective is to determine the trocar site hernia rate among our patients. METHODS This retrospective study is based on the analysis of demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data of 219 patients who underwent cholecystectomy or sigmoidectomy by LESS surgery between December 1st, 2009 and November 30th, 2012. RESULTS Cholecystectomy and sigmoidectomy LESS surgery were performed on 190 and 29 patients, respectively. Three patients developed a trocar site hernia within a median follow-up time of 34.7 months. Eleven patients were obese, 20 had a history of abdominal surgery, and 20 had a preoperative umbilical hernia but none of them developed a trocar site hernia, neither did the 11 subsequently pregnant women. Significant association was found between preoperative umbilical hernia and early complications including incisional cellulitis and hematoma. CONCLUSIONS A rate of 1.4% of trocar site hernia was observed in our study population. This rate is similar to the one reported after conventional laparoscopy. Peri-umbilical incision, longer than that with conventional laparoscopy, allowed better preexisting hernia handling, made anatomical closing easier among obese patients, and facilitated specimen extraction thus limiting traumatic operations.","Smirnoff, A; de Poncheville, L; Allix-Béguec, C; Lefant, P-Y; Drapier, E",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,410,1

We set out to identify the impact of laparoscopy and robotics on our AWR program by performing an economic analysis before and after the institution of minimally invasive AWR. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed inpatient hospital costs and economic factors for a consecutive series of 104 AWR cases that utilized separation of components technique (57 open, 38 laparoscopic, 9 robotic). Patients were placed into two groups by date of procedure. Group 1 (Pre MIS) was July 2012-June 2015 which included 52 open cases. Group 2 (Post MIS) was July 2015-August 2016 which included 52 cases (5 open, 38 laparoscopic, 9 robotic). RESULTS A total of 104 patients (52 G1 vs. 52 G2) with mean age (54.2 vs. 54.1 years, p = 0.960), BMI (34.7 vs. 32.1 kg/m2, p = 0.059), and ASA score (2.5 vs. 2.3, p = 0.232) were included in this review. Total length of stay (LOS) was significantly shorter for patients in the Post MIS group (5.3 vs. 1.4 days, p < 0.001). Although operating room (OR) supply costs were $1705 higher for the Post MIS group (p = 0.149), total hospital costs were $8628 less when compared to the Pre MIS group (p < 0.001). Multiple linear regressions identified increased BMI (p = 0.021), longer OR times (p = 0.003), and LOS (p < 0.001) as predictors of higher total costs. Factors that were predictive of longer LOS included older patients (p = 0.003) and patients with larger defect areas (p = 0.004). MIS was predictive of shorter hospital stays (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Despite an increase in operating room supply costs, transition to performing MIS AWR in cases that were previously done through an open approach decreased LOS and translated into significant overall total cost savings.","Belyansky, Igor; Weltz, Adam S; Sibia, Udai S; Turcotte, Justin J; Taylor, Haley; Zahiri, H Reza; Turner, T Robert; Park, Adrian",Surgical endoscopy,410,17

We systematically reviewed the existing literature on the prevalence of eating disorders in Latin America. RECENT FINDINGS Of 1583 records screened, 17 studies from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela were included in the analysis. Most studies reported point-prevalence rates and only three studies provided lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates. We found a mean point-prevalence rate of 0.1% for anorexia nervosa, 1.16% for bulimia nervosa, and 3.53% for binge-eating disorder (BED) in the general population. Heterogeneity for bulimia nervosa and BED was large. This meta-analysis indicates that the prevalence of anorexia nervosa seems to be lower, whereas the prevalence of bulimia nervosa and especially of BED seems to be higher in Latin America than in Western countries. SUMMARY Our findings show that eating disorders are common mental disorders in Latin America. However, some facets of Latin American culture might be protective for the development of anorexia nervosa and increase the risk for bulimia nervosa and BED. Further studies investigating the epidemiology of eating disorders and their relation to culture in Latin America are needed.

There also will be continued interest in vaccines that are more effective or have improved scalability to facilitate mass vaccination campaigns. Ongoing clinical testing of new vaccines also will be needed as variant strains continue to emerge that may elude some aspects of immunity induced by current vaccines. Randomized clinical trials meaningfully enhance the efficiency and reliability of such clinical testing. In clinical settings with limited or no access to known effective vaccines, placebo-controlled randomized trials of new vaccines remain a preferred approach to maximize the reliability, efficiency and interpretability of results. When emerging availability of licensed vaccines makes it no longer possible to use a placebo control, randomized active comparator non-inferiority trials may enable reliable insights. METHODS In this article, ""hybrid"" methods are proposed to address settings where, during the conduct of a placebo-controlled trial, a judgment is made to replace the placebo arm by a licensed COVID-19 vaccine due to emerging availability of effective vaccines in regions participating in that trial. These hybrid methods are based on proposed statistics that aggregate evidence to formally test as well as to estimate the efficacy of the experimental vaccine, by combining placebo-controlled data during the first period of trial conduct with active-controlled data during the second period. RESULTS Application of the proposed methods is illustrated in two important scenarios where the active control vaccine would become available in regions engaging in the experimental vaccine's placebo-controlled trial: in the first, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 50%-70% for the 4- to 6-month duration of follow-up of its placebo-controlled trial; in the second, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 90%-95% during that duration. These two scenarios approximate what has been seen with adenovirus vaccines or mRNA vaccines, respectively, assuming the early estimates of vaccine efficacy for those vaccines would hold over longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSION The proposed hybrid methods could readily play an important role in the near future in the design, conduct and analysis of randomized clinical trials performed to address the need for multiple additional vaccines reliably established to be safe and have worthwhile efficacy in reducing the risk of symptomatic disease from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Fleming, Thomas R; Nason, Martha; Krause, Philip R; Longini, Ira M; Henao-Restrepo, Ana-Maria",Clinical trials,410,31

This study was aimed at performance assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISAs, and investigation of their utility for patient diagnosis and sero-epidemiologic investigations. Methods Serum/plasma samples from COVID-19 patients or asymptomatic contacts (n=180) and healthy donors (n=90) were tested in parallel using two commercial IgM ELISAs (Erbalisa and Inbios), and four IgG ELISAs (Kavach, Euroimmun, Erbalisa and Inbios) along with an indigenous β-propiolactone inactivated virus-based ELISA (IRSHA-IgG-ELISA). Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was used as reference test. Results Among 180 COVID-19 patients, 125 tested positive by PRNT. Inbios-IgM-ELISA showed sensitivity (Se)/specificity (Sp)/positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV) of 93.6/97.8/98.4/94.4 per cent in relation to PRNT, and performed better than Erbalisa-IgM-ELISA (Se: 48%, Sp: 95.6%, PPV: 95.2%, NPV: 65.2%). During the first week of disease, only 47.4 per cent of the COVID-19 patients tested IgM positive by Inbios-IgM-ELISA, detection improving at two weeks and beyond (~86-100%). Among IgG tests, Inbios-IgG-ELISA ranked first in terms of sensitivity (83.2%), followed by IRSHA (64.8%), Euroimmun (64%), Erbalisa (57.6%) and Kavach (56%) tests. For all IgG tests, sensitivity improved during the third (73.9-95.7%) and fourth week (100%) of illness. The specificity (96.7-100%) and PPV (96.2-100%) of all IgG tests were high; NPV ranged between 71.9 and 87.1 per cent with Inbios-IgG-ELISA scoring highest. Interpretation & conclusions Our results show that IgM detection by the current, most sensitive ELISAs cannot replace molecular diagnosis, but may aid as a supplement test. The available IgG tests are suitable for serosurveys for the assessment of previous virus exposure.","Kulkarni, Ruta; Shrivastava, Shubham; Patil, Harshad P; Kore, Pravin; Rane, Prajakta; Palkar, Sonali; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh Chandra; Arankalle, Vidya A",The Indian journal of medical research,410,1

We hypothesized that changes in average peak systolic mitral annular velocity (s') from 24 h (h) to 72 h following start of targeted temperature management (TTM) predict six-month neurological outcome in comatose OHCA survivors. METHODS We investigated the association between peak systolic velocity of the mitral plane (s') and six-month neurological outcome in a population of 99 patients from a randomised controlled trial comparing TTM at 33 ± 1 °C for 24 h (h) (n = 47) vs. 48 h (n = 52) following OHCA (TTH48-trial). TTE was conducted at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after reaching target temperature. The primary outcome was 180 days neurological outcome assessed by Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC180) and the primary TTE outcome measure was s'. Secondary outcome measures were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), global longitudinal strain (GLS), e', E/e' and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). RESULTS Across all three scan time points s' was not associated with neurological outcome (ORs: 24 h: 1.0 (95%CI: 0.7-1.4, p = 0.98), 48 h: 1.13 (95%CI: 0.9-1.4, p = 0.34), 72 h: 1.04 (95%CI: 0.8-1.4, p = 0.76)). LVEF, GLS, E/e', and TAPSE recorded on serial TTEs following OHCA were neither associated with nor did they predict CPC180. Estimated median e' at 48 h following TTM was 5.74 cm/s (95%CI: 5.27-6.22) in patients with good outcome (CPC180 1-2) vs. 4.95 cm/s (95%CI: 4.37-5.54) in patients with poor outcome (CPC180 3-5) (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS s' assessed on serial TTEs in comatose survivors of OHCA treated with TTM was not associated with CPC180. Our findings suggest that serial TTEs in the early post-resuscitation phase during TTM do not aid the prognostication of neurological outcome following OHCA. TRIAL REGISTRATION NCT02066753 .

However, there is no existing review of environmental and epidemiologic methods applied to measure stillbirths resulting from exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy. The objective of this study is to systematically review published methods, data sources, and data linkage practices to characterize associations between ambient temperature and stillbirth to inform stillbirth prevention and risk management strategies. METHODS A systematic review of published studies that assess the association between ambient temperature exposure during pregnancy using any measures or approach and stillbirth was undertaken in Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science of studies (2000-2020, inclusive). Selection of studies were assessed by pre-specified eligibility criteria and documented using PRISMA. Citations were managed using EndNote X8 whilst selection, reviewing, and data extraction were performed using Covidence. The screening, selection, and data extraction process consisted of two blind, independent reviews followed by a tertiary independent review. An adapted Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist was used to assess quality and bias. The main findings and characteristics of all studies was extracted and summarized. Where appropriate, a meta-analysis will be performed for measures of association. RESULTS Among 538 original records, 12 eligible articles were identified that analysed associations between ambient temperature exposure and stillbirth for 42,848 stillbirths among 3.4 million births across seven countries. Varied definitions of stillbirth were reported based on gestational age, birthweight, both, or neither. The overall rate of stillbirth ranged from 1.9 to 38.4 per 1000 among six high-income countries and one low-middle-income country. All study designs were retrospective and included ten cohort studies, three case-crossover studies, and two additional case-control subgroup analysis. Exposure data for ambient temperature was mostly derived from standard municipal or country-level monitors based on weather stations (66.6%) or a forecasting model (16.7%); otherwise, not reported (16.7%). Results were not statistically pooled for a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of methods and models among included studies. All studies reported associations of increased risk of stillbirth with ambient temperature exposures throughout pregnancy, particularly in late pregnancy. One study estimates 17-19% (PAR) of stillbirths are potentially attributable to chronic exposure to hot and cold ambient temperatures during pregnancy. Overall, risk of stillbirth was observed to increase below 15°C and above 23.4°C, where highest risk is above 29.4°C. CONCLUSION Exposure to hot and cold temperatures during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, although a clear causative mechanism remains unknown. Despite lack of causal evidence, existing evidence across diverse settings observed similar effects of increased risk of stillbirth using a variety of statistical and methodological approaches for exposure assessments, exposure windows, and data linkage. Managing exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy could potentially decrease risk of stillbirth, particularly among women in low-resource settings where access to safe antenatal and obstetric care is challenging. To fully understand the effects or dose-response relationship of maternal exposure to ambient temperatures and stillbirth, future studies should focus on biological mechanisms and contributing factors in addition to improving measurement of ambient temperature exposure.","Sexton, Jessica; Andrews, Christine; Carruthers, Selena; Kumar, Sailesh; Flenady, Vicki; Lieske, Scott",Environmental research,410,31

It is known that GP interacts with cellular C-type lectins for virus attachment to cells. Since primary target cells of filoviruses express C-type lectins, C-type lectin-mediated entry is thought to be a possible determinant of virus tropism and pathogenesis. We compared the efficiency of C-type lectin-mediated entry between Marburg virus strains Angola and Musoke by using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype system. VSV pseudotyped with Angola GP (VSV-Angola) infected K562 cells expressing the C-type lectin, human macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (hMGL), or dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) more efficiently than VSV pseudotyped with Musoke GP (VSV-Musoke). Unexpectedly, the binding affinity of the C-type lectins to the carbohydrates on GPs did not correlate with the different efficiency of C-type lectin-mediated entry. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the amino acid at position 547, which switched the efficiency of C-type lectin-mediated entry. In a three-dimensional model of GP, this amino acid was in close proximity to the putative site of cathepsin processing. Interestingly, the cathepsin inhibitors reduced the infectivity of VSV-Angola less efficiently than that of VSV-Musoke in C-type lectin-expressing K562 cells, whereas only a limited difference was found in control cells. The amino acid at position 547 was critical for the different effects of the inhibitors on the virus infectivities. These results suggest that the efficiency of C-type lectin-mediated entry of filoviruses is controlled not only by binding affinity between C-type lectins and GP but also by mechanisms underlying endosomal entry, such as proteolytic processing by the cathepsins.","Matsuno, Keita; Kishida, Noriko; Usami, Katsuaki; Igarashi, Manabu; Yoshida, Reiko; Nakayama, Eri; Shimojima, Masayuki; Feldmann, Heinz; Irimura, Tatsuro; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Takada, Ayato",Journal of virology,410,19

Benincasa hispida is being used in the treatment of various neurological diseases in Ayurveda system of medicine. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of Benincasa hispida fruit extract in the Alzheimer's disease rats. METHODS Benincasa hispida fruits extract was administered orally for 16 weeks at doses of 250 and 500-mg/kg/day. The cognitive deficits were examined by behavioural tests like Morris water maze test, Y-maze and rota-rod test. Biochemical and neurochemical analysis of Acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin levels and anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory markers were evaluated and the mRNA expression of Keap/Nrf2 axis was analysed by RT-PCR. RESULTS Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) induction altered the behavioural profile and produced significant alterations in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain and the treatment with Benincasa hispida extract at doses of 250-mg/kg/day (p<0.05) and 500mg/kg/day (p<0.05) alleviated the acetylcholine, dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter levels. The antioxidant enzyme markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) were increased and the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde(MDA) was decreased. The inflammatory cytokine levels of TNF-α, IL-1β were decreased in Alzheimer's disease induced rats. We further estimated Keap/Nrf2/HO-1 genes these anti-oxidant genes were upregulated(p < 0.001) in treatment groups. Further, the neuroprotective activity of Benincasa was further confirmed by histopathological studies of hippocampal CA3 fields. CONCLUSIONS The findings of the current study indicates Benincasa hispida as a possible neuroprotective alternative for Alzheimer's disease.","Rapaka, Deepthi; Bitra, Veera Raghavulu; Ummidi, Ravishankar; Akula, Annapurna",Neuropeptides,410,1

OBJECTIVE We aimed to study the worldwide pattern of web based information seeking by public on obesity and related terms and topics using Google Trends. METHODS We compared the relative frequency of search terms and topics related to Obesity between 2004 and 2019 on Google Trends. The mean relative interest score (RIS) was compared between a 4-year period quartiles. RESULTS The mean RIS of the search term ""Obesity"" consistently decreased with time in all four quartiles (2004-2019), whereas the RIS of the search topics ""Weight loss"" and ""Abdominal Obesity"" increased. The topic ""Weight loss"" was popular during the month of January and its median RIS for January as compared to other months was higher for the entire study period (p<0.001). The RIS for the search term ""Obese"" decreased over time, whereas ""Body positivity"" and ""Self-Love"" increased after 2013. CONCLUSIONS Despite increase in prevalence of obesity worldwide, its popularity on internet diminishes. The reason for peaks in months should be explored and may be applied to awareness campaigns for better effectiveness. These patterns suggest normalization of obesity in the society with rise of public curiosity towards image-related obesity rather than its medical implications and harm.

Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls.

However, their clinical relevance in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not well characterized. We analyzed the frequency, clinical significance, and prognostic relevance of RAS pathway alterations in 328 pediatric patients with de novo AML. RAS pathway alterations were detected in 80 (24.4%) out of 328 patients: NF1 (n = 7, 2.1%), PTPN11 (n = 15, 4.6%), CBL (n = 6, 1.8%), NRAS (n = 44, 13.4%), KRAS (n = 12, 3.7%). Most of these alterations were mutually exclusive and were also mutually exclusive with other aberrations of signal transduction pathways such as FLT3-ITD (p = 0.001) and KIT mutation (p = 0.004). NF1 alterations were frequently detected in patients with complex karyotype (p = 0.031) and were found to be independent predictors of poor overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (p = 0.007). At least four of seven patients with NF1 alterations had bi-allelic inactivation. NRAS mutations were frequently observed in patients with CBFB-MYH11 and were independent predictors of favorable outcomes in multivariate analysis [OS, p = 0.023; event-free survival (EFS), p = 0.037]. Patients with PTPN11 mutations more frequently received stem cell transplantation (p = 0.035) and showed poor EFS than patients without PTPN11 mutations (p = 0.013).

It is a safe and feasible approach in the hands of trained surgeons. The introduction of robotics into surgery represents progression in the field of minimally invasive surgery but has seen a slow uptake in the hepatopancreaticobiliary subspeciality. We report our initial experience in 20 cases of laparoscopic robotic liver resection (LRLR). From March 2011 to April 2013 patients with lesions within the liver were assessed and consented for laparoscopic robotic liver surgery. This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively kept database on preoperative details and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. During the time period there were 20 LRLRs. The median age was 62 years (range 39-80 years) with a male to female ratio of 14:6. Ten patients had left lateral sectionectomies, 10 patients had atypical segmental resections; 14 patients had resections for malignancies, 6 patients had resections for benign disease. One case was converted to open resection. The mean operating time was 176.4 ± 74.6 min (range 60-300 min), the mean blood loss was 107 ± 106 ml (range 50-700 ml) and the mean hospital stay was 6.5 ± 3.7 days (range 2-16 days). Two patients required blood transfusions. The incidence of postoperative complications was 10 % (n = 2). LRLR overcomes some of the disadvantages of conventional laparoscopic surgery. It is a technically feasible and safe approach for wedge resections and left lateral sectionectomy of the liver without oncological compromise. However, this surgical technique requires advanced laparoscopic skills and there is an associated steep learning curve. Further studies are needed to determine the potential advantages of this technique for the patient compared to the traditional laparoscopic approach.","Salloum, Chady; Subar, Daren; Memeo, Riccardo; Tayar, Claude; Laurent, Alexis; Malek, Alexandre; Azoulay, Daniel",Journal of robotic surgery,410,1

Although the work environment has received more attention than specific determinants of personality traits, the latter might contribute to burnout. STUDY OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the association of Type D personality, job and organizational determinants with burnout, stress and work engagement as outcome factors among emergency physicians and hospital physicians working in intensive care and surgery departments. We specifically focused on our group of emergency physicians. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, self-report questionnaires were distributed via social media using a specific survey link to 531 Belgian hospital physicians working at the Emergency Department, Intensive Care, and Surgery Department between October 21, 2018, and April 11, 2019. The survey instrument included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, job characteristics, organizational factors, job satisfaction, social support by supervisors and colleagues (Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire for Medical Doctors) and Type D personality (Distress Scale-14) and as outcomes burnout (Oldenburg Burnout Inventory) and work engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale). A multiple regression analysis was used to examine the associations between the determinants and each of the outcomes with emergency physicians as the study population. RESULTS Eligible data were available for 436 questionnaires and involved 212 emergency physicians, 162 other hospital physicians (Intensive Care and Surgery Department) and 62 residents concerning both groups of physicians. Type D personality ranged from 28.5 to 29.1% in emergency physicians and other hospital physicians. Additionally, even after correcting for job-related and organizational factors, emergency physicians with Type D personality were seven times more likely to have a high risk for burnout. CONCLUSION As a result, this study offers a new perspective on the associations between burnout, stress and Type D personality. Type D personality might be a personality-related risk factor for burnout among emergency physicians. Therefore, we recommend enhanced prevention measures that take into account this individual factor in the further development of coaching programs. Improving the professional well-being of emergency physicians is necessary, especially in the scope of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which has put a high demand on acute and emergency care departments.","Somville, Francis; Van der Mieren, Gerry; De Cauwer, Harald; Van Bogaert, Peter; Franck, Erik",International archives of occupational and environmental health,410,30

The results show that the odds of having unrealized fertility were higher among Hausa-Fulani women compared with women of other ethnic groups in Nigeria. Also, having daughters only (no sons) was associated with higher odds of unrealized fertility, after controlling for other important covariates.

It is now possible to differentiate donor-derived cfDNA (ddcfDNA) from recipient cfDNA in the plasma or urine of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in the absence of donor and recipient genotyping. The assessment of ddcfDNA is being increasingly studied as a non-invasive means of identifying acute rejection (AR) in SOT, including subclinical AR. We herein review the literature on the correlation of ddcfDNA with AR in kidney transplantation. There have been at least 15 observational studies that have assessed ddcfDNA in urine or plasma using various methodologies with various thresholds for abnormality. Overall, elevated ddcfDNA indicates allograft injury as may occur with AR, infection, or acute tubular injury, but may also be found in clinically stable patients with normal histology. Sensitivity is greater for antibody-mediated AR than for cell-mediated AR (CMR), and normal levels do not preclude significant CMR. Measurement of ddcfDNA is not a replacement for biopsy that remains the gold standard for diagnosing AR. Serial monitoring of stable patients may allow earlier detection of subclinical AR, but the efficacy of this approach remains to be established. Normal levels should not preclude planned protocol biopsies. There may be roles for following ddcfDNA levels to assess the adequacy of treatment of AR and to guide the intensity of immunosuppression in the individual patient. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate the benefit and cost-effectiveness for these various uses. No firm recommendations can be made at this time.","Filippone, Edward John; Farber, John L",Transplantation,410,1

Although respiratory tract symptoms are often the initial presentation among kidney transplant recipients who contract COVID-19, other clinical features which may indicate underlying SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, are not uncommon. Hyponatremia can develop and may reflect underlying inflammation. Interferon-6 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 complications and may play a role in the inappropriately higher secretion of antidiuretic hormone leading to hyponatremia. This pathway is the so-called immuno-neuroendocrine interface. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 has been reported in a few case series of non-kidney transplant patients and only one reported kidney transplant recipient. However, the clinical course and prognostic value of hyponatremia in this population is not described in detail. We report a kidney transplant recipient who was infected with COVID-19 and exhibited severe hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia is one of the clinical presentations of COVID-19, although less common, and may occur more frequently in kidney transplant recipients. Thus the possible underlying immuno-neuroendocrine relationship related to the inflammatory process of COVID-19 leading to hyponatremia, and its prognostic value, are reviewed.","Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Reddy, Uttam G; Duong, Dang K; Ferrey, Antoney J; Ichii, Hirohito; Dafoe, Donald C; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,410,26

Patients with cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities are typically prescribed with long-term medications. We reviewed the management of co-medications prescribed for CVDs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. AREAS COVERED There is no specific contraindication or caution related to COVID-19 on the use of antihypertensives unless patients develop hypotension from septic shock where all antihypertensives should be discontinued or severe hypokalemia in which continuation of RAS inhibitors is not desired. The continuation of antiplatelet and statin in case of adverse CV event should be based on risk-benefit assessment. Patients with atrial fibrillation receiving oral anticoagulants, particularly those who are critically ill, should be considered for substitution to parenteral anticoagulants. EXPERT OPINION An individualized approach to medication management among hospitalized patients with concurrent CVDs would seem prudent with attention paid to changes in clinical conditions and medications intended for COVID-19. The decision to change prescribed long-term medications should be entailed by close follow-up to check if a revision on the decision is needed, with resumption or a plan for resumption of any long-term medication before hospital discharge if it is discontinued during hospitalization for COVID-19, for continuity of care.","Kow, Chia Siang; Thiruchelvam, Kaeshaelya; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,410,16

Methods After a standard approach laparoscopic pyelolithotomy in a patient with a large (42 × 36 mm) pelvic calculus, Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty was performed. A transverse posterior colpotomy was performed laparoscopically with the assistance of the Colpassist Vaginal Positioning Device (Boston Scientific) and the calculus was extracted, intact, through the vagina with the aid of an endoscopic retrieval bag. The vaginal incision was then closed intra-corporeally. A systematic review on the topic was also performed. Results The stone was removed in its entirety through an occult vaginal incision. There were no complications reported and the patient was stone free at follow-ups. Conclusions This simple, novel technique is an easily reproducible method, for the removal of large urinary calculi during either traditional laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic stone surgery in the appropriate female patient. It avoids the need for additional abdominal incisions or complex techniques involving lithotripsy which may be more complicated and time consuming. All previously published stone extraction techniques for large calculi (greater than 20 mm) within this systematic review are also critically appraised.","Adam, Ahmed; Reddy, Deshin",Current urology,410,24

Arthroscopic capsular shift combined with Bankart repair can reduce the capsular volume and reinforce the redundant capsule; however, as the capsuloligamentous structure has viscoelastic properties, it is possible for the shifted and tensioned capsule of the glenohumeral joint to slowly stretch out again over time, resulting in an increase in capsular volume. PURPOSE To analyze changes in capsular volume of the glenohumeral joint over time after arthroscopic Bankart repair and capsular shift, the factors associated with these changes, and their relevance to outcomes. STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS Included in this study were 105 patients (mean age, 25.8 ± 8.2 years) who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair and capsular shift for anterior shoulder instability and computed tomography arthrography (CTA) at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively and whose various functional outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow-up (>12 months). Among these patients, 27 also had preoperative CTA. These 27 patients were used to make comparisons between preoperative and 3-month postoperative CTA measurements, and all 105 patients were used for all other comparisons. Two raters measured the separate anterior and posterior capsular volume and cross-sectional area at the 5-o'clock position using 3-dimensional (3D) Slicer software. These measurements were subsequently adjusted for each glenoid size. The changes in capsular volume and cross-sectional area at the 5-o'clock position over time, the factors related to higher change in anterior capsular volume, and their correlation with outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Three months postoperatively, the total and anterior capsular volume and anterior cross-sectional area significantly decreased; however, these values increased again at 1 year postoperatively (all P < .01). The inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the measurements were excellent (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.717-0.945). Female sex, being an elite athlete, and more dislocations before surgery were related to a higher increase in anterior capsular volume at 1 year (all P < .05). Eight patients had redislocation, and 18 exhibited positive apprehension test postoperatively, and these patients showed significantly higher increases in anterior and total capsular volume at 1 year than did those without redislocation or positive apprehension sign (all P < .01). However, with the exception of Rowe score, a higher increase in anterior capsular volume was not related to functional outcome measures. CONCLUSION Surgeons should be aware of the re-increase in anterior capsular volume or restretching trait of the anterior capsule over time, even after successful arthroscopic Bankart repair and capsular shift. In this study, women, elite athletes, and those with frequent dislocations were at high risk of capsular restretching. An increase in capsular volume was related to redislocation and positive apprehension sign as well as with Rowe score.","Park, Jin-Young; Chung, Seok Won; Kumar, Gurudeo; Oh, Kyung-Soo; Choi, Jin Hyeok; Lee, Deukhee; Park, Sehyung",The American journal of sports medicine,410,31

Due to restraints in physical contacts, providers switched from face-to-face contacts to teletherapy, but prior experiences were mostly limited. The study aimed at assessing symptom dynamics, potentially increased adversities and factors influencing a successful transition into teletherapy in adolescent psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD Thirty adolescent psychiatric outpatients participated in an interview-based study. The differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was measured by integrating patients' and psychiatrists' judgements. RESULTS Patients who reported deteriorated symptoms and patients who showed (partial) improvement of symptomatology could be separated by feelings of isolation (specific to deterioration) and perceived reduction in school-associated stress (unique to improvement). Patients with worsening symptomatology showed a significantly higher degree of psychosocial disability before lockdown and at the first interview. Patients who deteriorated in their level of psychosocial functioning also reported negatively on teletherapy. These patients were verbally less differentiated concerning emotions and affect, reported introspection and rumination, and stated distinctly lower levels of perceived social support. Concerning adversities, no clear trend could be identified, but some patients reported increased domestic violence and neglect. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher degree of psychosocial disability suffer disproportionally from the crisis, so that an assessment of functioning should serve as a triage tool. Also, a screening of the perceived level of social support should be established before offering teletherapy. Additionally, the provision of strategies to enhance verbalisation and differentiation of emotions and affect might be beneficial.","Huscsava, Mercedes M; Scharinger, Christian; Plener, Paul L; Kothgassner, Oswald D",Child and adolescent mental health,410,33

Immediately after an epidemic, governments and social organizations often provide psychological services for children and adolescents to relieve their distress. However, many adolescents report distress even long after a traumatic event because of the unaddressed traumatic atmosphere in schools or families. To advance this issue, this article proposes a cooperative model of psychological services provision for children and adolescents in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. This model suggests that psychological services should simultaneously include social, school, and family systems, which interact and have a synergistic effect. The social system provides direct services not only for children and adolescents but also for their school and family systems; school and family systems cooperate to support adolescents. Psychological work also needs to emphasize the key elements of school and family systems. Attention should be given to teachers' distress, teacher-student relationships, and peer relationships in the school system, as well as to parents' distress, parent-child relationships, and the marital relationship in the family system. In these ways, adolescents can achieve an efficient and sustainable recovery following a disaster.

Left untreated, gingivitis can lead to tooth loss. Periodic dental examinations are important for early diagnosis and treatment of gum diseases. To contain the spread of the coronavirus, governments, including in Israel, have restricted movements of their citizens which might have caused routine dental checkups to be postponed. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine the ability of a mobile health app, iGAM, to reduce gingivitis, and to determine the most effective interval between photograph submissions. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study with 160 unpaid participants divided into 2 equal groups using the iGAM app was performed. The intervention group photographed their gums weekly for 8 weeks. The wait-list control group photographed their gums at the time of recruitment and 8 weeks later. After photo submission, the participants received the same message ""we recommended that you read the information in the app regarding oral hygiene habits."" A single-blinded researcher examined all the images and scored them according to the Modified Gingival Index (MGI). RESULTS The average age of the intervention group was 26.77 (SD 7.43) and 28.53 (SD 10.44) for the wait-list control group. Most participants were male (intervention group: 56/75,74.7%; wait-list control group: 34/51, 66.7%) and described themselves as ""secular""; most were ""single"" non-smokers (intervention group: 56/75, 74.7%; wait-list control group: 40/51, 78.4%), and did not take medications (intervention group: 64/75, 85.3%; wait-list control group: 40/51, 78.4%). A total of 126 subjects completed the study. A statistically significant difference (P<.001) was found in the dependent variable (MGI). Improvements in gingival health were noted over time, and the average gingivitis scores were significantly lower in the intervention group (mean 1.16, SD 1.18) than in the wait-list control group (mean 2.16, SD 1.49) after 8 weeks. Those with more recent dental visits had a lower MGI (P=.04). No association was found between knowledge and behavior. Most participants were familiar with the recommendations for maintaining oral health, yet they only performed some of them. CONCLUSIONS A dental selfie taken once a week using an mobile health app (iGAM) reduced the signs of gingivitis and promoted oral health. Selfies taken less frequently yielded poorer results. During the current pandemic, where social distancing recommendations may be causing people to avoid dental clinics, this app can remotely promote gum health.","Tobias, Guy; Spanier, Assaf B",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,410,7

Closed suction catheters (CSCs) minimize lung volume loss during suctioning but require cleaning post-suction. Despite their widespread use, there is no published evidence examining lung volumes during CSC cleaning. The study objectives were to quantify lung volume changes during CSC cleaning and to determine whether these changes were preventable using a CSC with a valve in situ between the airway and catheter cleaning chamber. METHODS This prospective randomized crossover study was conducted in a metropolitan tertiary ICU. Ten patients mechanically ventilated via volume-controlled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV-VC) and requiring manual hyperinflation (MHI) were included in this study. CSC cleaning was performed using 2 different brands of CSC (one with a valve [Ballard Trach Care 72, Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, Georgia] and one without [Portex Steri-Cath DL, Smiths Medical, Dublin, Ohio]). The maneuvers were performed during both SIMV-VC and MHI. Lung volume change was measured via impedance change using electrical impedance tomography. A mixed model was used to compare the estimated means. RESULTS During cleaning of the valveless CSC, significant decreases in lung impedance occurred during MHI (-2563 impedance units, 95% CI 2213-2913, P < .001), and significant increases in lung impedance occurred during SIMV (762 impedance units, 95% CI 452-1072, P < .001). In contrast, cleaning of the CSC with a valve in situ resulted in non-significant lung volume changes and maintenance of normal ventilation during MHI and SIMV-VC, respectively (188 impedance units, 95% CI -136 to 511, P = .22; and 22 impedance units, 95% CI -342 to 299, P = .89). CONCLUSIONS When there is no valve between the airway and suction catheter, cleaning of the CSC results in significant derangements in lung volume. Therefore, the presence of such a valve should be considered essential in preserving lung volumes and uninterrupted ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients.","Corley, Amanda; Sharpe, Nicola; Caruana, Lawrence R; Spooner, Amy J; Fraser, John F",Respiratory care,410,16

This study evaluated the costs associated with implementing such a program. METHODS Retrospective analysis of total hospital costs and payments for treating patients with ischemic stroke at SLNI (n=1570) as program enhancement evolved over time (2005, 2007, and 2010) and compared with published national estimates. Analyses were stratified by patient demographic characteristics, patient outcomes, treatments, time, and comorbidities. RESULTS Controlling for inflation, there was no difference in SLNI total costs between 2005 and either 2007 or 2010, suggesting that while SLNI provided an increased level of services, any additional expenditures were offset by efficiencies. SLNI total costs were slightly lower than published benchmarks. Consistent with previous stroke care cost estimates, the median overall differential between total hospital costs and payments for all ischemic stroke cases was negative. CONCLUSIONS SLNI total costs remained consistent over time and were slightly lower than previously published estimates, suggesting that a focused, streamlined stroke program can be implemented without a significant economic impact. This finding further demonstrates that providing comprehensive stroke care with improved access and treatment may be financially feasible for other hospitals.","Rymer, Marilyn M; Armstrong, Edward P; Meredith, Neil R; Pham, Sissi V; Thorpe, Kevin; Kruzikas, Denise T",Stroke,410,17

We conducted this study to elucidate how anastomotic leakage affects the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 61 patients who underwent esophagectomy. We evaluated their preoperative status, the surgical procedures, and postoperative systemic response, including white blood cell count, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and laboratory data up to postoperative day (POD) 4. RESULTS Anastomotic leakage developed in nine patients (14.8%) and was found on POD 7 on average. These patients had a significantly longer hospital stay than those without leakage. Although no difference was observed in postoperative changes of any of the SIRS criteria, the postoperative incidence of SIRS was significantly higher in the patients with anastomotic leakage on POD 4. The number of positive criteria for SIRS was also significantly higher in patients with anastomotic leakage than in those without leakage on PODs 3 and 4. CONCLUSIONS The SIRS scoring system is valuable for evaluating the severity of systemic inflammatory response caused by anastomosis leakage, and may serve as an indicator for prompt management.","Tsujimoto, Hironori; Ono, Satoshi; Takahata, Risa; Hiraki, Shuichi; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Kumano, Isao; Matsumoto, Yusuke; Yoshida, Kazumichi; Aiko, Satoshi; Ichikura, Takashi; Yamamoto, Junji; Hase, Kazuo",Surgery today,410,1

The method involves the simultaneous detection of two biomarkers of T helper cancer cells. One biomarker conjugates with immunofunctionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), enabling the separation of the T helper cells from a mixed population of cells. The other biomarker is used for detection during enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. The specific T helper cells can be quantified according to their ELISA absorbance values following magnetic separation. The experimental results demonstrate that immunofunctionalized MNPs can function as magnetic sensors and separate specific T helper cells from a mixed population with high efficiency and high specificity. Coupled with the ELISA technique, the immunofunctionalized MNPs can simultaneously detect rare cells. Results indicated increasing absorbance with increasing T cell number (from 10 to 10(6)). The total detection time was less than 15 minutes, even at a low T cell count. The advantages of the proposed method for detecting specific cells at low concentration include ease of preparation, low cost, rapid detection, and high sensitivity.

The 2-year follow-up results of ATTRACTION-2 are presented herein. METHODS ATTRACTION-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (49 sites; Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The median (min-max) follow-up period was 27.3 (24.1-36.3) months. The primary endpoint was OS. A subanalysis of OS was performed based on best overall response and tumor-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression status. RESULTS Overall, 493 of 601 screened patients were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (330) or placebo (163). OS (median [95% confidence interval; CI]) was significantly longer in the nivolumab group (5.26 [4.60-6.37] vs 4.14 [3.42-4.86] months in placebo group) at the 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.62 [0.51-0.76]; P < 0.0001). A higher OS rate was observed in the nivolumab vs placebo group at 1 (27.3% vs 11.6%) and 2 years (10.6% vs 3.2%). The OS benefit was observed regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Among patients with a complete or partial response (CR or PR) in the nivolumab group, the median OS (95% CI) was 26.6 (21.65-not applicable) months; the OS rates at 1 and 2 years were 87.1% and 61.3%, respectively.

Inhaled methoxyflurane represents a promising treatment option; however, data in the elderly population are limited. Patients and Methods Subgroup, post hoc analysis including 69 patients aged ≥65 years from a randomized, active-controlled, open-label study in the emergency setting. Key inclusion criterion was moderate-to-severe pain (Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] score ≥ 4]) secondary to trauma in a single limb. Patients received inhaled methoxyflurane (3 mL) or standard analgesic treatment (SAT; IV paracetamol 1 g or ketoprofen 100 mg for moderate pain [NRS 4-6] and IV morphine 0.1mg/kg for severe pain [NRS ≥7]). The primary endpoint was the overall change in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity from randomization to the next 3, 5, and 10 min. Secondary endpoints included time to onset of pain relief (TOPR), efficacy up to 30 min, judgment of operators and patients, and safety. Results Pain reduction over time was similar in both groups. Median TOPR was shorter for methoxyflurane (9 min; 95% CI: 7.8, 10.2 min) than SAT (15 min; 95% CI: 10.2, 19.8 min). In terms of treatment satisfaction, patients and operators rated treatment efficacy and practicality, respectively, as ""Excellent"" or ""Very good"" 5.7 times and 3.4 times more frequently than SAT. A similar rate of adverse events (methoxyflurane: 6 events; SAT: 7 events) was recorded, all non-serious. No clinically significant changes in vital signs parameters were observed, and methoxyflurane did not result in cases of bradycardia or hypotension. Conclusion In elderly patients with trauma pain, inhaled methoxyflurane shows similar pain relief and safety compared to SAT, offering advantages in terms of onset of effect and user's satisfaction. Although this analysis presents some methodological limitations, it provides the first specific evidence of the use of inhaled methoxyflurane in the elderly population.

It is a very complex systemic disease in terms of pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. Pharmacological treatment may include antiviral and antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids as well as low-molecular-weight heparins to prevent the evolution of the disease from reaching the severe inflammatory phase that can lead to respiratory complications, multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and finally death. Therefore, pending the development of the much sought-after vaccine, there needs to be a multidisciplinary approach to tackling this disease, and it is essential to use different medical treatments at the correct pathogenic moment. The aim of this article is to evaluate the rationale and reason behind the use of antirheumatic drugs, by expert point of view, in the various phases of the disease. Another important aspect in the management of the disease is to identify patients at high risk, both to change their lifestyle and to correct the state of their health through non-pharmacological measures for improving their immuno-balance. Our literature review reveals the important role and the therapeutic potential of antirheumatic agents in preventing the progression of the disease and aiding recovery from the disease. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of these agents, indicating that further randomized controlled studies are required.","Valentini, Marco; Zmerly, Hassan",Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharmacologie clinique,410,17

Even low levels of acquired resistance at the cellular level lead to impaired response to cisplatin. In ovarian cancer intraperitoneal therapy, nanoparticle formulation can improve the cisplatin's pharmacokinetics and safety profile. Purpose This work aimed to investigate the chemo-sensitivity of ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells upon short-term (72h) single treatment of cisplatin and cisplatin-loaded biodegradable nanoparticles (Cis-NP). The aim was then to determine the therapeutic properties of Cis-NP in vivo using a SKOV3-luc cells' xenograft model in mice. Methods Cell cytotoxicity was assessed after the exposure of the cell culture to cisplatin or Cis-NP. The effect of treatments on EMT and CSC-like phenotype was studied by analyzing a panel of markers by flow cytometry. Intracellular platinum concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICS-MS), and gene expression was evaluated by RNAseq analysis. The efficacy of intraperitoneal chemotherapy was evaluated in a SKOV3-luc cells' xenograft model in mice, through a combination of bioluminescence imaging, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses. Results We observed in vitro that short-term treatment of cisplatin has a critical role in determining the potential induction of chemoresistance, and a nanotechnology-based drug delivery system can modulate it. The RNAseq analysis underlines a protective effect of nanoparticle system according to their ability to down-regulate several genes involved in chemoresistance, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The highest intracellular platinum concentration obtained with Cis-NP treatment significantly improved the efficacy. Consistent with in vitro results, we found that Cis-NP treatment in vivo can significantly reduce tumor burden and aggressiveness compared to the free drug. Conclusion Nanoparticle-mediated cisplatin delivery may serve as an intracellular depot impacting the cisplatin pharmacodynamic performance at cellular levels. These features may contribute to improving the drawbacks of conventional intraperitoneal therapy, and therefore will require further investigations in vivo.","Bortot, Barbara; Mongiat, Maurizio; Valencic, Erica; Dal Monego, Simeone; Licastro, Danilo; Crosera, Matteo; Adami, Gianpiero; Rampazzo, Enrico; Ricci, Giuseppe; Romano, Federico; Severini, Giovanni Maria; Biffi, Stefania",International journal of nanomedicine,410,1

We sought to examine whether their messaging varied over time and whether it varied across jurisdictions. METHODS We conducted a qualitative study of news releases from Canadian provincial government websites during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak between Jan. 21 and Mar. 31, 2020. We performed content analysis using a predefined data extraction framework to derive themes. RESULTS We identified 290 news releases. Four broad thematic categories emerged: describing the government's preparedness and capacity building, issuing recommendations and mandates, expressing reassurance and encouraging the public, and promoting public responsibility. Most of the news releases were prescriptive, conveying recommendations and mandates to slow transmission. Cross-jurisdictional variations in messaging reflected local realities, such as evidence of community transmission. Messaging also reflected changing information about the pandemic over time, shifting from a tone of reassurance early on, to a sudden emphasis on social distancing measures, to a concern with public responsibility to slow transmission. INTERPRETATION Messaging across jurisdictions was generally consistent, and variations in the tone and timing of CMOH messaging aligned with different and changing realities across contexts. These findings indicate that when evaluating CMOHs' statements, it is critical to consider the context of the information they possess, the epidemiologic circumstances in their jurisdiction and the way the province has structured the CMOH role.","Fafard, Patrick; Wilson, Lindsay A; Cassola, Adèle; Hoffman, Steven J",CMAJ open,410,12

Such a breach, in the practice or home-care setting, can lead to medical, social, and financial impacts on patients, clients, and staff, as well as damage the reputation of the hospital. To mitigate these negative outcomes, the AAHA ICPB Guidelines Task Force believes that hospital teams should improve upon their current efforts by limiting pathogen exposure from entering or being transmitted throughout the hospital population and using surveillance methods to detect any new entry of a pathogen into the practice. To support these recommendations, these practice-oriented guidelines include step-by-step instructions to upgrade ICPB efforts in any hospital, including recommendations on the following: establishing an infection control practitioner to coordinate and implement the ICPB program; developing evidence-based standard operating procedures related to tasks performed frequently by the veterinary team (hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, phone triage, etc.); assessing the facility's ICPB strengths and areas of improvement; creating a staff education and training plan; cataloging client education material specific for use in the practice; implementing a surveillance program; and maintaining a compliance evaluation program. Practices with few or no ICPB protocols should be encouraged to take small steps. Creating visible evidence that these protocols are consistently implemented within the hospital will invariably strengthen the loyalties of clients to the hospital as well as deepen the pride the staff have in their roles, both of which are the basis of successful veterinary practice.","Stull, Jason W; Bjorvik, Erin; Bub, Joshua; Dvorak, Glenda; Petersen, Christine; Troyer, Heather L",Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association,410,16

Bacteria have been shown to be the predominant pathogen of sepsis among patients with pathogens detected, while sepsis caused by viruses is underdiagnosed worldwide. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 in China and now in many other countries has brought viral sepsis back into the vision of physicians and researchers worldwide. Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited.

Intranasal delivery of VSV-hDCT activated both CD4(+) and CD8(+) DCT-specific T-cell responses. The magnitude of these responses could be significantly increased by booster immunization with recombinant adenovirus (Ad)-hDCT, which led to enhanced efficacy against B16-F10 melanoma in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Notably, the interval of VSV/Ad heterologous vaccination could be shortened to as few as 4 days, making it a potential regimen to rapidly expand antigen-specific effector cells.

We investigated whether chimpanzees show the expert effect and how humans and chimpanzees differ by testing chimpanzees (human experts) with human body stimuli and testing humans (chimpanzee experts) with chimpanzee and human body stimuli in body recognition tasks. The main finding was that humans (chimpanzee experts) showed the expert effect to chimpanzee bodies, while chimpanzees partially showed it to human bodies. This suggests that compared with chimpanzees, the special processing in humans can be more flexibly tuned for other objects. We also tested humans that were not chimpanzee experts using chimpanzee body stimuli. Although they showed similar performances as the chimpanzee experts, the two groups had differences in some situations, indicating the effect of expertise.

Indications and contraindications for renal denervation have been defined in an interdisciplinary manner. The efficacy and safety of the procedure were evaluated. RESULTS Currently, indication for renal denervation is limited to patients with primary hypertension and a systolic blood pressure of ≥ 160 mm Hg (or ≥ 150 mm Hg in diabetes type 2) despite optimal medical therapy with ≥ 3 different antihypertensive drugs. In this specific patient population, an average blood pressure reduction of 32/14 mmHg was observed in non-randomized/-controlled trials after renal denervation. These results were not confirmed in the first randomized controlled trial with a non-significantly superior blood pressure reduction of 14.1 ± 23.9 mm Hg compared to controls (-11.74 ± 25.94 mm Hg, difference -2.39 mm Hg p = 0.26 for superiority with a margin of 5 mm Hg) who underwent a sham procedure. CONCLUSION The efficacy and long-term effects of renal denervation need to be re-evaluated in light of the HTN3 study results. To date, renal denervation should not be performed outside of clinical trials. Future trials should also assess if renal denervation can be performed with sufficient safety and efficacy in patients with hypertension-associated diseases. The use of renal denervation as an alternative therapy (e. g. in patients with drug intolerance) can currently not be advocated. KEY POINTS The indication for renal denervation should be assessed in an interdisciplinary fashion and according to current guidelines with a special focus on ruling out secondary causes for arterial hypertension. 5 - 10 % of patients with hypertension suffer from refractory hypertension, but only about 1 % of patients meet the criteria for a renal denervation. Renal denervation leads to a significant decrease in office blood pressure; however, the impact on 24-hour blood pressure measurements remains unclear. In the first randomized controlled trial on renal denervation with a control group undergoing a sham procedure, blood pressure reduction failed to reach the anticipated level of superiority over best medical treatment. Periprocedural complications are rare, but long-term safety can currently not be appraised due to the limited data available.","Nähle, C P; Düsing, R; Schild, H",RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,410,28

METHODS Six European centres submitted their series of consecutive anatomical lung resections with the intention to treat by VATS. Conversions to thoracotomy, vascular injuries and major intraoperative complications were studied in relation to surgeons' experience. Major complications included immediate life-threatening complications (i.e. blood loss of more than 2 l), injury to proximal airway or other organs or those leading to unplanned additional anatomical resections. All cases were discussed by a panel and recommendations were drafted. RESULTS A total of 3076 patients were registered. Most resections (90%, n = 2763) were performed for bronchial carcinoma. There were 3 intraoperative deaths, including 1 after conversion for technical reasons. In-hospital mortality was 1.4% (n = 43). Conversion to open thoracotomy was observed in 5.5% (n = 170), of whom 21.8% (n = 37) were for oncological reasons, 29.4% (n = 50) for technical reasons and 48.8% (n = 83) for complications. Vascular injuries were reported in 2.9% (n = 88) patients and led to conversion in 2.2% (n = 70). In 1.5% (n = 46), major intraoperative complications were identified. These consisted of erroneous transection of bronchovascular structures (n = 9); injuries to gastrointestinal organs (n = 5) or proximal airway (n = 6); complications requiring additional unplanned major surgery (n = 9) or immediate life-threatening complications (n = 17). Twenty-three percent of the in-hospital mortalities (n = 10/43) were related to major intraoperative complications. Eight pneumonectomies (five intraoperative and three postoperative at 0.3%) were a consequence of a major complication. Surgeon's experience was related to non-oncological conversions, but not to vascular injuries or major complications in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION Major intraoperative complications during VATS anatomical lung resections are infrequent, seem not to be related to surgical experience but have an important impact on patient outcome. Constant awareness and a structured plan of action are of paramount importance to prevent them.","Decaluwe, Herbert; Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik; Piwkowski, Cezary; Augustin, Florian; Brunelli, Alessandro; Schmid, Thomas; Papagiannopoulos, Kostas; Moons, Johnny; Gossot, Dominique",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,410,31

Recently developed, single-port-access surgery is of growing interest in an attempt to minimize abdominal wall trauma. Various abdominal procedures have already been performed via single-port access, but to date, single-port-access surgery has never been reported for liver resection. METHODS One patient underwent laparoscopic fenestration of a giant (30-cm) right hepatic cyst. Three patients underwent left liver resection through a single port for isolated liver metastasis located in segments 3/4B, 2/3, and 3/4B, respectively, and a cirrhotic patient underwent a 4B wedge resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. RESULTS Each procedure was performed through a single 40-mm Gelport. No supplemental ports were required. The liver was transected using a combination of LigaSure harmonic scalpels and staplers. In one case, parenchymal transection was intraoperatively prepared by a zone of microwave ablation along the line of intended division. The total operative times for the aforementioned five patients were 140,110, 110, 120, and 55 min, respectively. The respective blood losses were 20, 50, 50, 25, and 50 ml, and the overall size of the incision was 50 mm in each case. The postoperative courses were uneventful, and each patient was discharged on postoperative day 2. CONCLUSION This preliminary experience suggests the technical feasibility and safety of left liver wedge resection through single-port access in terms of intra- and postoperative results. Additional experiences are mandatory to assess the viability of this emerging technique and to expand its application to additional right liver resections.","Gaujoux, Sébastien; Kingham, T Peter; Jarnagin, William R; D'Angelica, Michael I; Allen, Peter J; Fong, Yuman",Surgical endoscopy,410,4

Acoustic rhinometry (AR) can provide quantitative data on the nasal airway, which has not been previously applied to skull base surgery. We sought to employ AR to quantify the changes in nasal patency following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery and identify the relationship between these changes and septal deviation, nasoseptal flap harvest, and sinonasal quality of life (QOL). METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic transsphenoidal resection of a sellar or suprasellar tumor were prospectively enrolled. All subjects were adults who completed AR and the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) preoperatively and postoperatively. Cross-sectional area (CSA) was recorded at the internal nasal valve (CSA1), middle turbinate head (CSA2), and middle turbinate body (CSA3). Normative data were also collected from a larger cohort. RESULTS Forty patients met study criteria. Significant increases occurred postoperatively in mean CSA2 (1.08 cm(2)) and CSA3 (2.47 cm(2)) (p < 0.001), whereas CSA1 remained unchanged. Nasoseptal flap harvest and correction of septal deviation did not significantly alter mean postoperative AR values. Mean SNOT-22 scores were comparable despite septal pathology, whereas strong correlation was not found with change in AR values. Preoperative and postoperative QOL scores were not significantly affected by the presence of nasal septal deviation. CONCLUSION The endoscopic transsphenoidal approach to the skull base can result in increased intranasal area without a detrimental effect on sinonasal QOL. These effects are independent of nasoseptal flap harvest and correction of nasal septal deviation.","McCoul, Edward D; Patel, Amit S; Bedrosian, Jeffrey C; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",International forum of allergy & rhinology,410,1

In this post-hoc analysis, we investigated the impact of anesthesia type on clinical outcomes in patients included in SWIFT PRIME trial. Methods: Ninety-seven patients treated with MT were included. Patients treated in centers with general anesthesia (GA) policy (n = 32) were compared with those treated in centers with conscious sedation (CS) policy (n = 65). Primary outcomes studied included times to treatment initiation (TTI), rates of successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3), and functional independence (mRS 0-2 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes were adverse events, lowest systolic and diastolic blood pressures (LSBP and LDBP) during MT. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression logistic modeling were conducted. Results: The GA-policy and CS-policy groups presented comparable TTI (94 ± 36 min vs. 102 ± 48 min; p = 0.44), rates of TICI 2b/3 recanalization (22/32 [68.8%] vs. 51/65 [78.5%]; p = 0.32). CS-policy was associated to higher rate of functional independence than GA-policy, but the difference was not significant (43/65 [66.2%] vs. 16/32 [50.0%]; p = 0.18). GA-policy patients had a higher rate of postoperative pneumonia (11/32 [34.4%] vs. 8/65 [12.3%]; p = 0.02) and lower LSBP (110 [30,160] mmHg vs. 119 [77,170] mmHg; p = 0.03) and LDBP (55 (15,75) mmHg vs. 67 [40,121]; p < 0.001). When corrected for differences in baseline characteristics, GA-policy was associated with lower rate of functional independence (OR 0.32; p = 0.05). A 10-point increase in perprocedural LDBP was associated with an increased likelihood of favorable outcome (OR 1.51; p = 0.01). Conclusions: GA-policy for MT presented comparable TTI and rates of successful revascularization to CS-policy. However, GA-policy was associated with lower rates of functional independence and with higher incidence of perprocedural hypotension and postoperative pneumonia.

Sustaining a hand injury can be detrimental to function including the ability to work. As the literature on work-related transitions is scattered across a range of journals, it is difficult to get a sense of how much literature there is, what is known and where the gaps lie. This scoping study will provide a single source of up-to-date evidence to inform health professionals about the strategies occupational therapists employ to facilitate work-related transitions for people with hand injuries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The methodological framework by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) will form the structure of the scoping review. The search strategy has been developed in collaboration with a subject librarian. The following databases will be searched: EBSCOhost including only Medline, CINAHL and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition; PubMed, Scopus, The Cochrane library and Web of Science. Reference lists will be examined, and grey literature sources will be searched to ensure that literature missed in the database searches is included. Covidence will be used to manage the project. Full-texts will be uploaded for literature that meets the inclusion criteria. A process of blind review will be used to ensure that consistency and rigour is upheld. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The findings of the scoping review will be disseminated in an article, within 2019, to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

SAFF consisted of a column with an up-flow biofilter. The biological oxygen demand (BOD)5, chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate and phosphate were the chosen pollutants for evaluation. The pollutants removal efficiency was determined at varying organic loading rates and hydraulic retention time. The organic loading rate was varied between 0.25 and 1.25 kg COD m-3 d-1. The removal efficiency of SAFF and tubesettler combined was 75 % COD, 67 % BOD and 67 % phosphate, respectively. However, nitrate saw an increase in concentration by 25 %. SAFF contribution in the removal of COD, BOD5 and Phosphate was 48 %, 46 % and 29 %, respectively. While for accumulation of nitrate, it was responsible for 56%, respectively. Tubesettler performed better than SAFF with 52 %, 54 % and 69 % reduction of COD, BOD5 and phosphate, respectively. But in terms of nitrate, tubesettler was responsible for 44 % accumulation. The nutrient reduction decreased with an increase in the organic loading rate. Nitrification was observed in the SAFF and tubesettler, which indicated a well-aerated system. An anaerobic unit is required for completing the denitrification process and removing nitrogen from the effluent. The better performance of tubesettler over SAFF calls for necessitates extended retention time over design criteria.

Aim of the study is evaluating the management of severe ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia using non-invasive ventilatory support (NIVS), studing safety and effectiveness of non-invasive ventilatory support (NIVS). METHODS This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Primary outcomes were NIVS failure with intubation rate and hospital mortality . Secondary outcomes were: hospital stay and factors related to NIVS failure and mortality. These outcomes were compared with patients intubated and admitted to ICU. RESULTS 162 patients were hospitalized because of severe respiratory failure ( PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 250 ). 138 patients were admitted to Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) for a NIVS trial. One hundred patients were treated successfully with NIVS (74.5%); 38 failed NIVS trial (27.5%). In-hospital mortality was 23.18% in RICU group and 30.55% in ICU group. Patients with NIVS failure were older, had a lower number of lymphocytes, a higher IL-6 , lower PaO2, PaCO2, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, higher respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate at admission and lower PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio and higher RR after 1-6 hours . Multivariate analysis identified higher age, C-reactive protein as well as RR after 1-6 hours and PaO2/FiO2 ratio after 1-6 hours as an independent predictor mortality.

However, exploration of sleep-related issues in general, and more specifically of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been scarce and restricted to a single location. The present study investigated the prevalence of insomnia and its predictive factors in the general population, and included Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to identify regional heterogeneities of insomnia in Bangladesh. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Information related to socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behaviors related to COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, and insomnia were included in a questionnaire, and coupled with GIS-based spatial analysis to identify regional susceptibility to insomnia. RESULTS Approximately 30.4%, 13.1% and 2.8% of participants reported sub-threshold, moderate, and severe forms of insomnia, respectively. Independent predictive risk factors of insomnia symptoms included female gender, college education, urban residence, presence of comorbidities, using social media, taking naps during daytime, and fear of COVID-19. District-wide variations in the spatial distribution of fear of COVID-19 and insomnia were significantly associated. CONCLUSION Insomnia is frequently present during a pandemic, and exhibits regional variability along with multifactorial determinants. These analytic approaches should enable improved detection and targeting of at-risk sectors of the population, and enable implementation of appropriate measures to ensure improved sleep quality.","Al Mamun, Firoj; Gozal, David; Hosen, Ismail; Misti, Jannatul Mawa; Mamun, Mohammed A",Sleep medicine,410,16

Although current evidence supports the primary repair of these defects with mesh reinforcement, it is unclear which mesh is superior for any given clinical scenario. The purpose of this review was to explore the characteristics of and clinical relevance behind bioprosthetic tissue matrices in an effort to better clarify their role in abdominal wall reconstruction. METHODS We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature on the use of bioprosthetic mesh in human subjects. Basic science articles and large retrospective and prospective reviews were included in author's analysis. The clinical performance and characteristics of 13 bioprosthetic tissue matrices were evaluated. RESULTS The majority of the products evaluated perform well in contaminated fields, where the risk of wound-healing difficulties is high. Clinical outcomes, which included infection, reherniation, and bulge formation, were variable, and the majority of the studies had a mean follow-up of less than 24 months. CONCLUSIONS Although bioprosthetic matrix has a multitude of indications within the growing field of abdominal wall reconstruction, the functionality, regenerative capacity, and long-term fate of these products have yet to be fully established. Furthermore, the clinical performance, indications, and contraindications for each type of matrix need to be fully evaluated in long-term outcome studies.","Broyles, Justin M; Abt, Nicholas B; Sacks, Justin M; Butler, Charles E",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) exerts significant effects in vascular endothelial cell injury. However, PRNCR1, a novel lncRNA, remains scarcely understood in terms of its functions in PVEC injury. Both in vivo and in vitro models of PVEC injury were constructed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. The relative expressions of PRNCR1, miR-330-5p, and TLR4 were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Besides, gain and loss assays of PRNCR1/miR-330-5p were conducted to verify their effects on LPS-induced PVEC injury. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay used to measure cell viability and flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. Besides, the protein levels of caspase 3, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and inflammatory cytokines (including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β [IL-1β], and IL-6) were evaluated via Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, a dual-luciferase activity experiment and RNA immunoprecipitation were applied to confirm the targeting relationship between PRNCR1 and miR-330-5p, miR-330-5p, and TLR4. PRNCR1 and TLR4 levels were significantly upregulated in LPS-treated PVEC, both in vivo and in vitro, while miR-330-5p were downregulated. Inhibiting PRNCR1 or overexpressing miR-330-5p markedly attenuated LPS-induced PVEC injury, expressions of TLR4, NF-κB, and inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, PRNCR1 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA by sponging miR-330-5p and then promoting TLR4 expression. PRNCR1 was upregulated in LPS-induced PVEC and aggravated its injury via modulating the miR-330-5p/TLR4 axis.","Yu, Yingqing; Sun, Hongzhi; Zhu, Lei; Ji, Lianfeng; Liu, Haibo",Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,410,24

Nevertheless, whether bupivacaine can cause neurotoxicity in fetus remains unclear. Hence, this study was design to investigate the effects of maternal bupivacaine use on fetus hippocampal cell apoptosis and the possible related mechanism. METHODS On day 15 of pregnancy, sciatic nerve of pregnant wistar rat (180-200 g) were exposed by lateral incision of the right thigh and 0.2 ml of bupivacaine was injected. After their delivery, we randomly selected one male offspring of every mother. On day 30 after of their birth, the rat's hippocampi were isolated for molecular studies. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8 and p-Akt in fetal hippocampus. RESULTS Our results showed that maternal bupivacaine use caused a significant increment of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression in fetal hippocampus compared with the sham group. In addition, maternally administered bupivacaine could significantly decrease hippocampal P.Akt/T.Akt ratio which was concurrent with an increment of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression.

METHODS DVT evaluation was performed by noninvasive venous ultrasonography. We retrospectively reviewed 88 Japanese patients (88 knees) receiving primary unilateral TKA, who had no preoperative DVT. We examined the influence of the following four factors on postoperative DVT: (1) patient factors (age, sex, body height, body weight, and body mass index), (2) surgical factors (operation time, bleeding amount, avascularization time, and anesthesia method), (3) postoperative factors (bleeding amount, period to ambulation, period of venous foot pump use, and ratio of graduated compression stocking use), and (4) DVT conditional factors (location, length, number of vein branches, and the presence of >5 mm vasodilatation). RESULTS The total prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was 62.5% (55 of the 88 patients). Among the 55 VTE patients, the rates of distal and proximal DVT were 96.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Bilateral DVT was found in 34.5%, while unilateral DVT on the surgical and nonsurgical sides were 52.7% and 12.7%, respectively. Asymptomatic pulmonary embolism was 1.8%. DVT was exacerbated in five patients (11.9%), of whom three showed additional thrombus formation. The remaining two patients had thrombus elongation or propagation from distal to proximal veins. In comparisons between thrombus-unresolved and -resolved groups within the sixth postoperative month, statistical significances were found in the incidence of bilateral DVT (50.0% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.02) and unilateral DVT (43.8% vs. 76.9%, p = 0.02). On the other hand, operation time (107.0 ± 17.3 min vs. 94.5 ± 11.9 min, p = 0.01) and avascularization time (99.8 ± 17.6 min vs. 88.0 ± 11.5 min, p = 0.01) in bilateral DVT patients were significantly longer than in unilateral ones.

This study assessed the safety and feasibility of LAPG with esophagogastrostomy in these patients and compared postgastrectomy disturbances and nutritional status following LAPG and LATG. METHODS This study compared 40 patients who underwent LAPG with esophagogastrostomy and 59 who underwent LATG with esophagojejunostomy, both with OrVil™. Surgical outcomes, postoperative complications, nutritional status at 1 and 2 years, and relapse-free survival were compared in these two groups. RESULTS Operation time was significantly shorter in the LAPG group than in the LATG group (280 min vs. 365 min, P < 0.001). Although the rate of surgical complications was similar in the two groups, the rate of anastomotic stricture was significantly higher in the LAPG group than in the LATG group (28 vs. 8.4 %; P = 0.012). Rates of reflux esophagitis graded A or higher in the Los Angeles classification were 10 and 5.1 %, respectively. Hemoglobin levels 2 years after surgery, relative to baseline levels, were significantly higher in the LAPG group than in the LATG group (98.6 vs. 92.9 %, P = 0.020). Body weight, albumin and total protein concentrations, and total lymphocyte count 1 and 2 years after surgery were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the LAPG group. Relapse-free survival rates were similar, as were 5-year overall survival rates (86 vs. 79 %, P = 0.42). CONCLUSIONS LAPG with esophagogastrostomy using OrVil™ was safe and feasible for patients with cT1N0 gastric cancer. LAPG may have nutritional advantages over LATG, but the rate of anastomotic stricture was significantly higher for LAPG than for LATG.","Hosoda, Kei; Yamashita, Keishi; Katada, Natsuya; Moriya, Hiromitsu; Mieno, Hiroaki; Shibata, Tomotaka; Sakuramoto, Shinichi; Kikuchi, Shiro; Watanabe, Masahiko",Surgical endoscopy,410,24

Although feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a very common disease, the ante-mortem diagnosis of this disease still remains a challenge. Immunofluorescence staining of FCoV in macrophages in effusion has been considered as the reference standard for the diagnosis, but recently this method has been shown to have lower specificity than previously reported. In addition, this method is not widely available and requires the use of fluorescence microscopes. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to evaluate the diagnostic potential of an immunocytochemical (ICC) assay using body cavity effusion. Methods Effusion samples from 27 cats with immunohistochemically confirmed FIP and 29 cats with suspected FIP but a definitive diagnosis of another disease were examined. ICC specimens were evaluated with respect to positive immunostaining. In addition, effusion samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and evaluated cytologically. Results A diagnostic sensitivity of 85.2% was recorded for effusion specimens (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.3-95.8), while the diagnostic specificity was only 72.4% (95% CI 52.8-87.3). Conclusions and relevance Once the clinical disease of FIP develops in a cat, it always leads to death, and most of the cats are euthanased within a few days or weeks. As false-positive results might lead to euthanasia of cats suffering from potentially treatable diseases, the diagnostic specificity of a diagnostic tool is the most important factor in a fatal disease like FIP. Thus, the diagnostic utility of this test proved to be insufficient and positive ICC results should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, full-body necropsy could not be performed in 13/29 control cats. It is possible that these cats actually suffered from early-stage FIP and that this fact might have influenced the diagnostic specificity of the ICC. Based on the results of the present study, however, ICC of effusion samples currently cannot be recommended to confirm a suspicion of FIP.","Felten, Sandra; Matiasek, Kaspar; Gruendl, Stefanie; Sangl, Laura; Wess, Gerhard; Hartmann, Katrin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,410,1

We conducted community-based surveillance in conjunction with hospital-based surveillance in a rural region in Bangladesh from June 2006 to September 2007 to assess the incidence and etiology of community-acquired viral infections among neonates. METHODS Community health workers (CHWs) assessed neonates at home on days 0, 2, 5 and 8 after birth and referred cases of suspected illness to the hospital (CHW surveillance). Among neonates with clinically suspected upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), pneumonia, sepsis and/or meningitis, virus identification studies were conducted on nasal wash, cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood specimens. In the hospital-based surveillance, similar screening was conducted among all neonates (referred by CHWs and self-referred) who were admitted to the hospital. RESULTS CHW surveillance found an incidence rate of 15.6 neonatal viral infections per 1000 live births with 30% of infections identified on the day of birth. Among neonates with suspected sepsis, a viral etiology was identified in 36% of cases, with enterovirus accounting for two-thirds of those infections. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common etiologic agent among those with viral pneumonia (91%) and URTI (68%). There was a low incidence (1.2%) of influenza in this rural population. CONCLUSION Viral infections are commonly associated with acute newborn illness, even in the early neonatal period. The estimated incidence was 5-fold greater than reported previously for bacterial infections. Low-cost preventive measures for neonatal viral infections are urgently needed.","Farzin, Azadeh; Saha, Samir K; Baqui, Abdullah H; Choi, Yoonjoung; Ahmed, Nawshad Uddin; Simoes, Eric A F; El Arifeen, Shams; Al-Emran, Hassan M; Bari, Sanwarul; Rahman, Syed M; Mannan, Ishtiaq; Crook, Derrick; Seraji, Habibur Rahman; Begum, Nazma; Black, Robert E; Santosham, Mathuram; Darmstadt, Gary L",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,410,1

Despite their wide use those drugs are all dose dependent and their effect last for no longer than two years, with several side effects. The search of novel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors remains as the main scientific route. Here we describe the synthesis, characterization, biological activity and an NMR binding-target study of a novel cis-[Ru(Bpy)2(EtPy)2]2+, (RuEtPy), Bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine and EtPy = 4,2-Ethylamino-pyridine) as a potential AChE inhibitor. The classic Ellman's colorimetric assay suggests that the RuEtPy exhibits a high inhibitory activity, following a competitive mechanism, with a remarkable low inhibition constant (Ki ≈ 16.8 μM), together with a IC50 = 39 μM. Hence, we have studied the spatial interactions for this novel candidate towards the human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) using saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR, in order to describe the mechanism of the interaction. NMR binding-target results shows that the 4,2-Ethylamino-Pyridine group is spatially closer to hAChE surface chemical arrangement than 2,2' bipyridine counterpart, exerting an efficient intermolecular interaction, with a low dissociation constant (KD ≈ 55 μM), probing that 4,2-Ethylamino-pyridine motif plays a key role in the inhibitory action.","Almeida, Marlon P; Kock, Flávio V C; de Jesus, Hugo C R; Carlos, Rose M; Venâncio, Tiago",Journal of inorganic biochemistry,410,1

One of the major challenges with inferring rates of molecular evolution is the observation of a strong correlation between estimated rates and the timeframe of their measurements. Recent empirical analysis of virus evolutionary rates suggest that a power-law rate decay best explains the time-dependent pattern of substitution rates and that the same pattern is observed regardless of virus type (e.g. groups I-VII in the Baltimore classification). However there exists no explanation for this trend based on molecular evolutionary mechanisms. We provide a simple predictive mechanistic model of the time-dependent rate phenomenon, incorporating saturation and host constraints on the evolution of some sites. Our model recapitulates the ubiquitous power-law rate decay with a slope of −0.65 (95% HPD: −0.72, −0.52) and can satisfactorily account for the variation in inferred molecular evolutionary rates over a wide range of timeframes. We show that once the saturation of sites starts - typically after hundreds of years in RNA viruses and thousands of years in DNA viruses - standard substitution models fail to correctly estimate divergence times among species, while our model successfully re-creates the observed pattern of rate decay. We apply our model to re-date the diversification of genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) to 396,000 (95% HPD: 326,000 - 425,000) years before present, a time preceding the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and also showed that the most recent common ancestor of sarbecoviruses dates back to 23,500 (95% HPD: 21,100 - 25,300) years ago, nearly thirty times older than previous estimates. This not only creates a radical new perspective for our understanding the origins of HCV but also suggests a substantial revision of evolutionary timescales of other viruses can be similarly achieved.","Ghafari, Mahan; Simmonds, Peter; Pybus, Oliver G; Katzourakis, Aris",bioRxiv,410,1

This study aimed to review the mode of delivery and the possible risk of vertical transmission related to delivery routes in pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS Literature research was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO database with the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pregnancy, vertical transmission, and delivery. The extracted data were as follows: author, country, study design number of cases, maternal age, mode of delivery, and the SARS-CoV-2 status in neonates. RESULTS Of 11 studies found, vaginal birth was reported in 218 cases (34.53%) and cesarean delivery was reported in 385 women (65.47%). The indication for cesarean delivery was majority due to COVID-19 related condition (53.61%). In total, 8 neonates who confirmed positive for COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay were reported. The pooled odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for SARS-CoV-2-positive neonates in cesarean delivery compared with vaginal birth was 0.622 (0.237-1.633) with p = 0.335. CONCLUSIONS Cesarean delivery is more common than vaginal delivery in patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Disturbed amygdala-frontal network functions are central to the pathophysiology of SAD, marked by hypoactivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hypersensitivity of the medial PFC and amygdala. The objective of this study was to determine whether modulation of dorsolateral and medial PFC activity with a novel intensified stimulation protocol reduces SAD core symptoms, improves treatment-related variables, and reduces attention bias to threatening stimuli. Methods: In this randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial, we assessed the efficacy of an intensified stimulation protocol (20 min, twice-daily sessions with 20 min intervals, 5 consecutive days) in two intensities (1 vs 2 mA) compared to sham stimulations. 45 patients with SAD were randomized in three tDCS arms. SAD symptoms, treatment-related variables (worries, depressive state, emotion regulation, quality of life), and attention bias to threatening stimuli (dot-probe paradigm) were assessed before and right after the intervention. SAD symptoms were also assessed at 2-month follow-up. Results: Both 1 mA and 2mA protocols significantly reduced fear/avoidance symptoms, worries and improved, emotion regulation and quality of life after the intervention compared to the sham group. Improving effect of the 2 mA protocol on avoidance symptoms, worries and depressive state was significantly larger than the 1 mA group.

Conclusions: Modulation of lateral-medial PFC activity with intensified stimulation can improve cognitive control, motivation and emotion networks in SAD and thereby results in therapeutic effects. These effects can be larger with 2 mA vs 1 mA intensities, though a linear relationship between intensity and efficacy should not be concluded.","Jafari, E.; Alizadehgoradel, J.; Pourmohseni Koluri, F.; Nikoozadehkordmirza, E.; Refahi, M.; Taherifard, M.; Nejati, V.; Hallajian, A.-H.; Ghanavati, E.; Vicario, C.

In these changed social and acoustical contexts, we wanted to evaluate the perception of the indoor acoustic environment in relation to traditional and new activities performed at home, i.e., relaxation, and working from home (WFH). Taking London as a case study, the present paper presents the results of an online survey administered to 464 home workers in January 2021. The survey utilized a previously developed model for the assessment of indoor soundscapes to describe the affective responses to the acoustic environments in a perceptual space defined by comfort (i.e. how comfortable or annoying the environment was judged) and content (i.e., how saturated the environment is with events and sounds) dimensions. A mixed-method approach was adopted to reinforce result validity by triangulating data from questionnaires and spontaneous descriptions given by participants. In this first part of the study, the main objectives were: (1) evaluating differences in soundscape evaluation, in terms of comfort and content dimensions, based on the activity performed at home, (2) identifying appropriate conditions for WFH and relaxation, and (3) investigating associations between psychological well-being and indoor soundscapes. The results showed that the environments were perceived as more comfortable and slightly fuller of content when rated in relation to relaxation than for WFH, thus suggesting a stricter evaluation of the acoustic environment in the latter case. As regards the second objective, spaces that were more appropriate for relaxation had high comfort, whereas spaces appropriate for WFH resulted more private and under control, i.e. with high comfort and low content scores. Lastly, better psychological well-being was associated with more comfortable soundscapes, both for WFH (rs = 0.346, p &lt;.0005), and relaxation (rs = 0.353, p &lt;.0005), and with lower content while WFH (rs = −0.133, p = .004). The discussion points out the need of considering the implications of changed working patterns to rethink the design of soundscapes in residential buildings, also in relation to potential well-being outcomes that will be further investigated in the Part II of the study. © 2021 The Author(s)","Torresin, S.; Albatici, R.; Aletta, F.; Babich, F.; Oberman, T.; Stawinoga, A.

It is important to compute the consequences of time variation in demographic rates for kinship stuctures. Objectives Our goal is to develop a matrix model for the dynamics of kinship networks subject to arbitrary temporal variation in survival, fertility, and population structure. Methods We develop a system of equations for the dynamics of the age structure of each type of kin of a Focal individual. The matrices describing survival and fertility vary with time. The initial conditions in the time-invariant model are replaced with a set of boundary conditions for initial time and initial age. Results The time-varying model maintains the network structure of the time-invariant model. In addition to the results of the time-invariant model, it provides kinship structures by period, cohort, and age. It applies equally to historical sequences of past rates and to projections of future rates. As an illustration, we analyze the kinship structure of Sweden from 1891 to 2120. Contribution The time-varying kinship model makes it possible to analyze the consequences of changing demographic rates, in the past or the future. It is easily computable, requires no simulations, and is readily extended to include additional, more distant relatives in the kinship network. The method can also be used to show the growth of families, lineages, and dynasties in populations across time and place and between social groups.","Caswell, Hal; Song, Xi",bioRxiv,410,24

In contrast, video conferencing software such as Zoom uses custom congestion control algorithms whose fairness behavior is mostly unknown. Aggravatingly, video conferencing has recently seen a drastic increase in use - partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - and could hence negatively affect how available Internet resources are shared. In this paper, we thus investigate the flow-rate fairness of video conferencing congestion control at the example of Zoom and influences of deploying AQM. We find that Zoom is slow to react to bandwidth changes and uses two to three times the bandwidth of TCP in low-bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, also when competing with delay aware congestion control such as BBR, we see high queuing delays. AQM reduces these queuing delays and can equalize the bandwidth use when used with flow-queuing. However, it then introduces high packet loss for Zoom, leaving the question how delay and loss affect Zoom's QoE. We hence show a preliminary user study in the appendix which indicates that the QoE is at least not improved and should be studied further.","Sander, Constantin; Kunze, Ike; Wehrle, Klaus; Ruth, Jan",,410,1

Early detection of the disease is crucial in preventing the rapid propagation of the virus. Although Computed Tomography (CT) technology is not considered to be a reliable first-line diagnostic tool, it does have the potential to detect the disease. While several high performing deep learning networks have been proposed for the automated detection of the virus using CT images, deep networks lack the explainability, clearness, and simplicity of other machine learning methods. Sparse representation is an effective tool in image processing tasks with an efficient algorithm for implementation. In addition, the output sparse domain can be easily mapped to the original input signal domain, thus the features provide information about the signal in the original domain. This work utilizes two sparse coding algorithms, frozen dictionary learning, and label-consistent k-means singular value decomposition (LC-KSVD), to help classify Covid-19 CT lung images.

Coronavirus has had a negative impact almost on all industries. According to the forecast of International Monetary Fund the growth of the world economy is expected to be at the level of -4.9%. In such conditions where social sphere including medical is going to be the most important one, governments are faced with the problem of relocation of their expenditures. Therefore, the military expenditures probably would suffer cuts like it was during last crises for example financial crisis of 2007-2008. The EU defence industry is also influenced by coronavirus crisis, this was yielded in the downtime and supply dates shifts during lock down. However together with armed forces defence companies were engaged in fight with coronavirus: production of medical and protective equipment, disinfection, transportation and etc. But these efforts cannot be considered as an efficient measure to limit negative impacts of coronavirus crisis on the prospects of defence industry. The following coronavirus crisis consequences for the defence industry can be outlined: stock prices fall, civil aviation crisis, supply chain disturbance and difficulties for small and medium enterprises during lock down. Such effects of course can slow down the development of the defence industry and complicate the operation. However the most crucial one is military expenditures cuts, because such changes put defence industry in the new environment with reduced demand for arms. Defence cuts are also a threat to the joint EU defence industry development programs. The importance of these programs is that their goal is to contribute to the military capability of the EU and these programs could be used for coronavirus crisis consequences overcome. However the budget allocated for these programs was also cut, so their implementation is hampered. But defence companies and their associations are working on the plans to boost the development. The author believes that in such conditions the key point for the successful overcome of coronavirus crisis and further sustained development of the EU defence industry is the joint efforts in this direction. The current level of cooperation between member state in the sphere of defence industry is not enough not only for the overcome of coronavirus crisis, but also for the development even in the standard conditions. Therefore the deepen of the cooperation is required and important like never before. As a result current crisis situation is a chance for the EU defence industry to joint the efforts in the defence sphere and expend integration in defence and security.","Seroshtanov, K.

In the current study, we address this question by investigating the association between existential threats and the certitude of societal discourse. According to appraisal theory, threats give rise to anxiety and perceptions of uncertainty;as such, it predicts that exposure to life-threatening events will increase expressions of uncertainty. An alternative possibility is that people will respond to threats by utilizing psychological compensation mechanisms that will give rise to greater expressions of certainty. Across two studies, we measured linguistic certainty in more than 3.2 million tweets, covering different psychological contexts: (i) the 15 major terrorist and school shooting events that took place between 2016 and 2018;(ii) the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with the idea of compensatory processing, the results show that levels of expressed certainty increased following intentional and natural existential threats.

The Kenyan government embarked to fill capacity gaps in essential and advanced critical care needed for the management of severe and critical COVID-19. However, given scarce resources, gaps in both essential and advanced critical care persist. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of investments in essential and advanced critical care to inform the prioritization of investment decisions. Methods: We employed a decision tree model to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of investment in essential care (EC) and investment in both essential and advanced critical care (EC+ACC) compared to current health care provision capacity (status quo) for COVID-19 patients in Kenya. We used a health system perspective, and an inpatient care episode time horizon. Cost data was obtained from primary empirical analysis while outcomes data was obtained from epidemiological model estimates. We used univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to assess the robustness of the results. Results: The status quo option is more costly and less effective compared to investment in essential care and is thus dominated by the later. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Investment in essential and advanced critical care (EC+ACC) was US $1,378.21 per DALY averted and hence not a cost-effective strategy when compared to the Kenyan cost-effectiveness threshold (USD 908). Conclusion: When the criterion of cost-effectiveness is considered, and within the context of resource scarcity, Kenya will achieve better value for money if it prioritizes investments in essential care before investments in advanced critical care. This information on cost-effectiveness will however need to be considered as part of a multi-criteria decision-making framework that uses a range of criteria that reflect societal values of the Kenyan society.

Several key studies have elucidated functions of few other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in miRNAs biogenesis, making it necessary to look miRNA biogenesis models with fresh approach. ResultsA comprehensive study of >25TB of high-throughput data revealed that various combinations of RBPs and their networks determine the miRNA pool, regardless of DROSHA/DICER. The discovered RBP and miRNA associations displayed strong functional alliances. An RBP, AAR2, was found highly associated with miRNAs biogenesis, which was experimentally validated. The RBPs combinations and networks were tested successfully across a large number of experimentally validated data and cell lines for the observed associations. The RBP networks were finally modeled into a XGBoosting-regression based tool to identify miRNA profiles without any need of doing miRNA-seq, which scored a reliable average accuracy of 91% on test sets. It was further tested across >400 independent experimental samples and scored consistently high accuracy. This tool was applied to reveal the miRNAome of Covid19 patients about which almost negligible information exists. A significant number of Covid19 specific miRNA targets were involved in IFN-gamma, Insulin/IGF/P3K/AKT, and Ub-proteasome systems, found in cross-talk with each other and down-regulated heavily, holding promise as strong candidates for therapeutic solution. A large number of them belonged to zinc-finger family. ConclusionThere are several RBPs and their networks responsible for miRNA biogenesis, regardless of DROSHA/DICER.

Allele families showed extreme differences in number of recognized epitopes, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Among them, the B27 supertype showed the lowest number of epitopes. Epitope escape mutations identified in ~118,000 NCBI isolates mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27, which reached up to 33%. In contrast to most supertypes, eight particular allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles. Collectively, these data indicate that independent escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. This study highlights the automated integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially affecting the population as a whole, as well as minority subpopulations. AUTHOR SUMMARY The cytotoxic T response, a type of immune response dependent upon an individual's genetics that does not require antibodies, is critical for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential bypass of the cytotoxic T response by mutations acquired by the virus after one year of the pandemic is therefore of maximal concern. We have approached the complexity of human variability and more than 100.000 viral genomes in this respect using a computational strategy. We have detected numerous mutations in these genomes that mask some viral regions involved in the cytotoxic response. However, the accumulation of these changes in independent isolates is still too low to threaten the global human population. In contrast, our protocol has identified mutations that may be relevant for specific populations and minorities with cytotoxic genetic backgrounds susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some viral variants co-existed in the same country with these human communities which warrants deeper surveillance in these cases to prevent local outbreaks. Our study support the integration of massive data of different natures in the surveillance of viral pandemics.","Foix, Anna; López, Daniel; McConnell, Michael J.; Martín-Galiano, Antonio J.",bioRxiv,410,1

In this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. We train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. We find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 AUC ROC under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. From these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as `but' and `except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. Only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction. This work suggests opportunities for teams to assess, track, and visualize their own viability in real time as they collaborate.","Cao, Hancheng; Yang, Vivian; Chen, Victor; Lee, Yu Jin; Stone, Lydia; Diarrassouba, N'godjigui Junior; Whiting, Mark E.; Bernstein, Michael S.",,410,11

Consequently, numerous studies have been published towards the disclosure of circRNA biogenesis and function. Initially, circRNAs were described as a subclass of cytoplasmic non-coding RNA, however, a few recent observations have proposed that circRNAs may instead be templates for protein production. The extent to which this is the case is currently debated, and therefore using rigorous data analysis and proper experimental setups is instrumental to settle the current controversies. Here, the conventional experiments used for detecting circRNA translation are outlined, and guidelines to distinguish signal from the inherent noise are discussed. While these guidelines are specific for circRNA translation, most also apply to all other aspects of non-canonical translation.","Hansen, TB",bioRxiv,410,24

Nevertheless, relative to the conventional methods, the anisotropic properties exhibited by FFF 3D printed parts cause the mechanical strength to be less satisfactory. In order to resolve the problem, we propose an in-process laser local pre-deposition heating (LLPH) method, which is capable of enhancing thermal relaxation at inter-layer interface and reinforcing inter-layer adhesion, that ultimately resulted in an increase in tensile strength along the build direction. This improvement in tensile strength of the build parts with in-process laser power has been demonstrated in this manuscript. Besides, the subsequent relevance with polymer relaxation, reptation and entanglement has been discussed. As verified by mechanical testing, tensile strength was improved by 350% compared to control sample and 99.5% isotropy was achieved (build-direction strength divided by in-plane strength) with the application of laser.

There are several possible reasons behind it, some of them, like competitive pricing, convenience or low cost of information search, considered to be extrinsic, others—like ease of use of this channel, pleasure related to it or willingness to reduce social interactions—intrinsic. The purpose of this research is to evaluate another factor, i.e., consumers’ environmental attitudes, in the perspective of their possible relation with the perception and willingness to use online and conventional shopping channels. In order to achieve this, a self-reporting questionnaire was developed and the data from a representative sample of 1000 Polish Internet users was gathered. The research procedure included cluster analysis, whose objective was to identify groups of customers with similar composition of environmental attitudes and next, a set of Kruskal–Wallis tests, aimed at identifying differences in opinions on channels between these clusters. The research proved that large groups of consumers with consistent sets of environmental attitudes exist and the scope of differences between such clusters is not reduced to a unidimensional, “positive–negative” continuum. Furthermore, there are significant differences between clusters in the declared willingness to use online and conventional shopping channels—groups more environmentally-oriented are more willing to purchase online and trust online shops, although they neither perceive conventional retail in a more negative way nor directly prefer online over conventional channels. The nature of such a phenomenon is open to explanation and interpretation, nevertheless, the research proves that environmental attitudes should be included in future models of consumers’ channel choice.","Gąsior, Marcin",Sustainability,410,1

This study investigated whether laboratory blood tests can discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections at emergency department (ED) presentation. Methods: 723 influenza A/B positive (2018/1/1 to 2020/3/15) and 1,281 SARS-CoV-2 positive (2020/3/11 to 2020/6/30) ED patients were retrospectively analyzed. Laboratory test results completed within 48 hours prior to reporting of virus RT-PCR results, as well as patient demographics were included to train and validate a random forest (RF) model. The dataset was randomly divided into training (2/3) and testing (1/3) sets with the same SARS-CoV-2/influenza ratio. The Shapley Additive Explanations technique was employed to visualize the impact of each laboratory test on the differentiation. Results: The RF model incorporating results from 15 laboratory tests and demographic characteristics discriminated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections, with an area under the ROC curve value 0.90 in the independent testing set. The overall agreement with the RT-PCR results was 83% (95% CI: 80-86%). The test with the greatest impact on the differentiation was serum total calcium level. Further, the model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in a new dataset including 519 SARS-CoV-2 ED patients (2020/12/1 to 2021/2/28) and the previous 723 influenza positive patients. Serum calcium level remained the most impactful feature on the differentiation. Conclusion: We identified characteristic laboratory test profiles differentiating SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections, which may be useful for the preparedness of overlapping COVID-19 resurgence and future seasonal influenza.","Liu, J.; Westblade, L.

As ridership drops and revenues decline, many public and private providers may respond by cutting service or reducing vehicle maintenance to save costs. As a result, those who depend on public transit and shared mobility services, particularly those without access to private automobiles, will experience further loss of their mobility. These transportation shifts will be further influenced by changing work-from-home policies (e.g., telework). While uncertainty remains, work-from-home will likely alter public transit and shared mobility needs and patterns, necessitating different services, operation plans, and business structures.

While previous work either addressed shorter gaps or relied on exemplars by copying available information from other signal parts, GACELA addresses the inpainting of long gaps in two aspects. First, it considers various time scales of audio information by relying on five parallel discriminators with increasing resolution of receptive fields. Second, it is conditioned not only on the available information surrounding the gap, i.e., the context, but also on the latent variable of the conditional GAN. This addresses the inherent multi-modality of audio inpainting at such long gaps and provides the option of user-defined inpainting. GACELA was tested in listening tests on music signals of varying complexity and gap durations ranging from 375~ms to 1500~ms.

Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual article designed to articulate a viewpoint that despite COVID-19 the strategic considerations that marketers need to make remain unchanged. Findings As a result of the pandemic, there is much more obvious use of interactivity in other, aligned functions such as sales and customer services. The effectiveness of interactive marketing will only be increased by having focus on the fundamental roles of the marketing discipline, strategy and segmentation, and understanding customers at the individual level. We also need reminding briefly that the rules of competition had changed well before the COVID-19 pandemic. The traditional make and sell model has been substantially replaced by new technology-enabled organisations without the restrictions of high fixed costs and cloying bureaucracy. Customers can now search for and evaluate products and services independent of suppliers and now have as much information about suppliers as suppliers have of customers. This is the backcloth against which marketers face the challenges at the beginning of 2021. We conclude that there is a great future ahead. There is no reason why the best of interactive marketing will not be capable of building relationships that are great for customers, great for the people who create them, great for all stakeholders and great for the environment. Originality/value This is a practitioner viewpoint outlining the view that COVID-19 has not had as great of an impact on interactive marketing practice as technological change has and that interactive marketing will continue to develop after COVID-19 has receded.","McDonald, M.",Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,410,22

One is affected that life in an urban area. The metropolitan area that is usually crowded with human activity changes drastically to the empty urban. This phenomenon happened because many cities apply the lockdown policy to reduce the spread of COVID-19. This lockdown policy reduces the activity of transportation and industry, causing changes in air quality in the urban area. This study aims to see how much the impact of lockdown policy on air quality in 4 major cities in Indonesia, which is: Jakarta, Medan, Balikpapan, and Makasar. The method that used in this research is using Remote Sensing data by extracting Sentinel Satellite Image data, which produces air quality data, namely data NO2 levels in the air, then comparing the distribution of NO2 in the air between the year 2019 and 2020, and comparing data NO2 concentration in each month in 2020. Form the result of the spatial analysis of Sentinel Image Satellite data, during the lockdown policy in the year 2020 was implemented, the NO2 level in Jakarta significantly changed positively, the NO2 levels in the air decreased compared to the year 2019. For cities outside Jakarta, there has been a decrease in NO2, but the change that occurred is not significant. From this research, it can be seen that the lockdown policy during COVID-19 has improved the air quality in major cities in Indonesia.","Irland, Fardani Tarlani Aji Riswandha Risang",IOP Conference Series.

Currently, the appropriate therapeutic drugs are not yet available to treat diseases caused by this coronavirus infection. This is due to the fact that discoveries and developments of new medications require a lot of time and resources. The alternative solution for this viral infection is to utilize medicinal plant-based bioactive compounds as therapeutic agents to fight against COVID-19. Methods: Herein, through an extensive search of the literature, we reviewed the potential of some bioactive compounds from medicinal plants as therapeutic agents against COVID-19. The results of this review still require further investigation to clinically validate them, either in vitro or in vivo, in order to find the effective antiviral drugs from medicinal plants for COVID-19 treatment. Results: From a total of 60 identified medicinal plants, 50 of them have possible effects as therapeutic agents against particular target proteins encoded by the coronavirus genes such as Nsp1, Nsp3 (Nsp3b, Nsp3c, PLpro and Nsp3e), Nsp7-Nsp8, Nsp9-Nsp10, Nsp14-Nsp16 complexes, 3CL(pro), E protein, ORF7a, Spike (S) glycoprotein, C-terminal RNA binding domain (CRBD), N-terminal RNA binding domain (NRBD), helicase and RdRp. The most common bioactive compounds from the medicinal plants as therapeutic agents for COVID-19 treatment were flavonoid compounds. Conclusion: Medicinal plants can serve as starting points for therapeutic agent development against some target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, the results require clinical validation, either in vitro or in vivo, for COVID-19 treatment.","Khairan, K.; Idroes, R.; Tallei, T. E.; Nasim, M.

While the emergence of the variant virus was delayed in the course of infecting C(3)H macrophages with large inocula of MHV(PRI), the second passage grew to a high titer in both cell types without delay. Thus, adaptation to the new host was immediate. Interference, apparently not interferon-mediated, between the two variant viruses may have been the cause for the delay in the emergence of the variant virus. The delayed destruction of C(3)H-cultured macrophages by large inocula of MHV(PRI) uniformly resulted in the emergence of MHV(C(3)H).

It can also be used in 3D (dimensional) database searching for potentially finding biologically active compounds and providing new research ideas and directions for drug-discovery projects. To stimulate the structure-based drug design against SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), a pharmacophore search was conducted over 3.6 millions of compounds based on the atomic coordinates of the complex obtained by docking KZ7088 (a derivative of AG7088) to SARS CoV M(pro) (coronavirus main proteinase), as reportedly recently (Chou, K. C.; Wei, D. Q.; Zhong, W. Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003, 308, 148-151). It has been found that, of the 3.6 millions of compounds screened, 0.07% are with the score satisfying five of the six pharmacophore points. Moreover, each of the hit compounds has been evaluated for druggability according to 13 metrics based on physical, chemical, and structural properties. Of the 0.07% compounds thus retrieved, 17% have a perfect score of 1.0; while 23% with one druggable rule violation, 13% two violations, and 47% more than two violations. If the criterion for druggability is set at a maximum allowance of two rule violations, we obtain that only about 0.03% of the compounds screened are worthy of further tests by experiments. These findings will significantly narrow down the search scope for potential compounds, saving substantial time and money. Finally, the featured templates derived from the current study will also be very useful for guiding the design and synthesis of effective drugs for SARS therapy.","Sirois, Suzanne; Wei, Dong-Qing; Du, Qishi; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Journal of chemical information and computer sciences,410,28

To improve quality of screening, it is essential to have powerful methods for the analysis of the compound databases. For this purpose, we have developed a novel and practical scoring function to assess the druggability of compounds. The proposed function consists of 12 metrics that take into account physical, chemical and structural properties as well as the presence of undesirable functional groups. We have applied this 12-metric scoring function to 44 different databases that include more than 3.8 million compounds, which are commercially available. The overall quality of each database was evaluated according to the score and rank measured by our 12-metric function. Our findings suggest that, the majority of compounds that do not satisfy druggable rules do so due to high molecular weight, high logP values and the presence of reactive functional groups.","Sirois, Suzanne; Hatzakis, George; Wei, Dongqing; Du, Qishi; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Computational biology and chemistry,410,0

This study was conducted to compare the outcome of these two treatments. METHODS Prospective study on consecutive cases of primary pterygium (February 2001 to March 2002) randomised into two adjuvant groups: (1) intraoperative 0.02% MMC for 5 minutes or (2) LCAU. Patients were followed for recurrence (defined as fibrovascular tissue invading the cornea >1.5mm) and complications for a period of one year. RESULTS 115 eyes in 114 patients who completed the study were randomised to receive MMC (n = 63) and LCAU (n = 52). There were 10 recurrences (15.9%) in the MMC group and only one recurrence (1.9%) in the LCAU group. There was a statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between the two groups (p = 0.04). There were a total of three conjunctival cysts, three symblephara, one granuloma, and one dellen. No other visually significant complications were encountered in either group. CONCLUSION Although LCAU resulted in better one year success rates, it is technically more difficult and inapplicable in cases with previous limbal disturbance. Simple excision followed by MMC or LCAU are both safe and acceptable adjuvants for pterygium excision. Choice of adjuvant should be carefully made based on assessment of recurrence risk, local practices, and surgeon's expertise.","Young, A L; Leung, G Y S; Wong, A K K; Cheng, L L; Lam, D S C",The British journal of ophthalmology,410,17

Corticosteroid therapy targets this hyperinflammation, otherwise known as a cytokine storm. It is the only therapeutic agent to date with a mortality benefit, with clear guidelines from national and international health authorities guiding its use. Objectives. To compare severity-of-illness indices, survival, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and potential ICU complications in patients treated with different corticosteroid regimens (high-dose hydrocortisone, high-dose methylprednisolone and lower-dose dexamethasone). Methods. In this single-centre descriptive retrospective observational study of a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to a COVID-dedicated ICU, we compared patients treated with the three different corticosteroid regimens. Results. In 242 cases we could not demonstrate any statistically or clinically significant difference in the outcome of patients with critical COVID-19 treated with high-dose intravenous hydrocortisone (n=88) or methylprednisolone (n=46) compared with a relatively lower dose of dexamethasone (n=108). The survival rates were 38.6%, 39.1% and 33.3%, respectively (p=0.68). Patients treated with methylprednisolone tended to have a shorter length of ICU stay (median (interquartile range) 6 (4 - 10), 4 (2 - 8) and 5 (2 - 8) days; p=0.015) and fewer episodes of nosocomial sepsis (47.7%, 32.6% and 48.1%; p=0.01). Conclusions.

We aimed to describe the incidence, clinical features, management, outcome, and midterm follow-up in patients with PMVT after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS This retrospective and descriptive study included patients who underwent LSG between November 2009 and July 2015 and developed PMVT. The following data were analyzed: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), thrombosis risk factors, surgical technique, thromboembolic prophylaxis, primary surgery outcomes, clinical features, treatment, thrombophilia testing results, and follow-up findings, including imaging and endoscopic findings. RESULTS A total of 1236 patients underwent LSG, and 5 (0.4 %) developed PMVT. The mean age was 34.4 years, and 3 patients were women. The mean BMI was 38.5 kg/m2. Two patients had received hormonal contraceptive treatment. Four patients had a history of smoking. All of the patients received anticoagulant treatment, and none required surgery. The mean hospitalization duration was 7.6 days. Two patients showed complete recanalization. One patient showed portal cavernomatosis on delayed images. Two patients had a positive thrombophilia test. No portal hypertension endoscopic findings were observed. CONCLUSIONS PMVT is a rare complication, for which smoking was identified as a predominant risk factor. Early diagnosis and prompt anticoagulant therapy could lead to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of intestinal infarction, mortality, and extrahepatic portal hypertension in the near future. However, careful follow-up is necessary to evaluate the impact of PMVT on long-term patient outcomes.","Villagrán, Rodrigo; Smith, Gabriela; Rodriguez, Walter; Flores, Carlos; Cariaga, Mario; Araya, Sofía; Yañez, Marisol; Fuentes, Paulina; Linares, Jeannette; Zapata, Antonio",Obesity surgery,410,26

Regarding consumers, demand for food produced by the livestock industry has shown steady growth for a century. Over the last few decades, this growth has been sustained by the developing countries, and is based mainly on pig and poultry production, which provides cheaper products. Regarding the public, society is showing greater concern about the conditions in which livestock is reared, transported and slaughtered. The public demands not only that ill treatment of animals be fought against and penalised, but also that any unnecessary suffering should be avoided and even that animals should be guaranteed a certain degree of 'comfort'. Animal health, the most important aspect of their welfare, has vastly improved, as has the care of sick or injured animals. At the same time, the latest amenities used in livestock rearing, transport and slaughter are helping to eliminate situations involving extreme stress and suffering.

Although detailed evaluation on phylogenetic analysis of HMPV has been described in other countries, there are no data from Turkey on this subject. The aim of this study was to demonstrate for the first time, the phylogenetic diversity of HMPV strains circulating in Turkey during two consecutive epidemic seasons. A total of 2900 upper respiratory tract samples collected from patients with respiratory illness were evaluated between January 2011 and December 2013, without any special selection criteria. The presence of respiratory viruses in the samples were detected by real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 21 Multiplex RT-PCR, Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxemburg), and 76 (2.6%) samples positive for HMPV were included in the study. HPMV nucleocapsid (N) (nt: 454-878) and fusion (F) (nt: 3624-4130) genes were selected for phylogenetic analysis. In sequence analysis, F and N gene sequences could only be obtained successfully from 46 out of 76 HMPV positive samples. According to sequences obtained, 54.3% belonged to B2, 17.4% to B1, 4.3% to A1, 4.3% to A2a, and 20% to A2b. In 2011, the A2b sublineage was predominant, while in 2012 and 2013, B2 lineages were predominant together with the B1 lineage. The A1 lineage was observed only in 2013. For the F gene fragment, nucleotide distance between group A and B was in the range of 0.138-0.168, however aminoacid distance amongst Turkish HMPV sequences were in the range of 0.028-0.042. For the N gene fragment, nucleotide distance between group A and B was in the range of 0.141-0.163, but aminoacid distance between group A and B was in the range of 0.037-0.050. Nucleotide diversity was higher than aminoacid diversity between and within lineages found in this study. This result indicated that the functional constraints on F and N genes prevent dramatic aminoacid changes, and indicated that the evolution of HMPV was slow. The seasonal peaks were observed from April to July in 2011, from January to June in 2012 and from January to May in 2013.

The Act defines invasive alien species as those recognised as, or suspected of, causing damage to ecosystems, human safety, agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Invasive alien species are carefully regulated: raising, planting, keeping or transporting them is prohibited without the express permission of the relevant minister. The Act represents a revolutionary advance for biological conservation in Japan. However, enforcing the Act is problematic. Dealing with the European bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), for example, involved resolving a bitter dilemma between biological conservation and agricultural productivity. The Act also has a serious loophole; it does not include alien micro-organisms. The incursion of amphibian chytridiomycosis into Japan caused confusion for scientists and the Japanese Government because control of such an alien micro-organism was not anticipated in the Act. Japan faces particular difficulties in attempting to control alien species because of its reliance on imports.","Goka, K",Revue scientifique et technique,410,20

Clinical and environmental features surrounding the index cases involved were compared with cases in non- SSEs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data on 231 cases of probable SARS admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) were used. Index cases directly causing 10 or more secondary cases were classified as having been involved in SSEs; all others were defined as non-SSEs. RESULTS Only 5 cases were involved in SSEs; all 5 were isolated on day 5 of illness or later, and spent at least a brief period in a non-isolation ward; in contrast, amongst the 226 non-SSE cases, only 40.7% and 4.0% were isolated late and admitted to non-isolation wards respectively, and only 3.1% had both these environmental features present; the differences were highly significant (P = 0.012, P <0.001 and P <0.001 by Fisher's Exact test). When compared to 7 non-SSE cases with delayed isolation and an admission to non-isolation wards, SSEs were more likely to have co-morbid disease or require ICU care at time of isolation (P = 0.045 for both factors). CONCLUSION SSEs were likely due to a conglomeration of environmental factors of delayed isolation and admission to a non-isolation ward, coupled with severe disease stage at time of isolation.","Chen, Mark I C; Loon, Seng-Chee; Leong, Hoe-Nam; Leo, Yee-Sin","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",410,1

CASE SUMMARY An 18-year-old male with TD was prescribed aripiprazole 10 mg orally daily, which produced a significant improvement in his symptoms. However, after 3 days of treatment, he experienced an acute episode of dystonia with facial muscle spasm, oculogyric crisis, and torticolis. All symptoms resolved after a single intramuscular injection of biperidine 5 mg. The Naranjo probability scale indicated that the adverse events were probably caused by aripiprazole. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, as of this writing, this is the first report concerning an aripiprazole-induced dystonic episode in an adult, and it is especially notable because it occurred at low dosage. Aripiprazole is a dopamine partial agonist and a serotonin(2A) antagonist with a favorable adverse effect profile. Short-term clinical trials reported a very low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, with akathisia being the most common, although there have been reports of severe extrapyramidal symptoms in a 3-year-old child and in an adolescent with a previous history of such symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Acute dystonic phenomena may be caused by aripiprazole, although the drug's suggested mode of action largely precludes them.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Siamouli, Melina; Kantartzis, Sotiris; Panagiotidis, Panagiotis; Iacovides, Apostolos; Kaprinis, George St",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,410,16

Runoff transcription from this cDNA by SP6 polymerase resulted in capped synthetic RNAs bearing authentic 5' and 3' ends of the viral genome that had specific infectivities of >5 x 10(5) PFU/microg of RNA. The synthetic viruses recovered from the transfected cells were genotypically and phenotypically indistinguishable from the parental virus. Using our system, a series of genomic RNAs with nucleotide deletions in their 5' ends produced viruses with decreased or no infectivity. Various pseudorevertants were isolated, and acquisition of novel 5' sequences of various sizes, composed predominantly of A and U bases, restored their infectivities, providing a novel insight into functional elements of the 5' end of the PRRSV genome. In addition, our system was further engineered to generate a panel of self-replicating, self-limiting, luciferase-expressing PRRSV viral replicons bearing various deletions. Analysis of these replicons revealed the presence and location of a 3' cis-acting element in the genome that was required for replication. Moreover, we produced enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing infectious viruses, which indicates that the PRRSV cDNA/viral replicon/recombinant virus can be developed as a vector for the expression of a variety of heterologous genes. Thus, our PRRSV reverse genetics system not only offers a means of directly investigating the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV replication and pathogenesis but also can be used to generate new heterologous gene expression vectors and genetically defined antiviral vaccines.","Choi, Yu-Jeong; Yun, Sang-Im; Kang, Shien-Young; Lee, Young-Min",Journal of virology,410,16

This technique is based on transforming atmospheric water vapor into Engineered Water Nano-Structures (EWNS) via electrospray. The generated EWNS possess a unique set of physical, chemical, morphological and biological properties. Their average size is 25 nm and they contain reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. In addition, EWNS are highly electrically charged (10 electrons per particle on average). A link between their electric charge and the reduction of their evaporation rate was illustrated resulting in an extended lifetime (over an hour) at room conditions. Furthermore, it was clearly demonstrated that the EWNS have the ability to interact with and inactivate airborne bacteria. Finally, inhaled EWNS were found to have minimal toxicological effects, as illustrated in an acute in-vivo inhalation study using a mouse model. In conclusion, this novel, chemical free, nanotechnology-based method has the potential to be used in the battle against airborne infectious diseases.","Pyrgiotakis, Georgios; McDevitt, James; Bordini, Andre; Diaz, Edgar; Molina, Ramon; Watson, Christa; Deloid, Glen; Lenard, Steve; Fix, Natalie; Mizuyama, Yosuke; Yamauchi, Toshiyuki; Brain, Joseph; Demokritou, Philip",Environmental science.

Regarding COVID-19, handwashing and social distancing through stay-at-home orders or quarantine measures are effective at slowing the spread of illness. Use of proper face masks (not gaiters or bandanas) is also effective at preventing trans- mission. This is important because the virus can infect others during the presymptomatic phase. Aspirin can no longer be recommended for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Human papillomavirus vaccination is strongly associated with reduced risk of invasive cervical cancer, especially in women who were vaccinated before 17 years of age. When a woman who is postmenopausal has a screening bone mineral density test, rechecking the test after three years does not help to identify those who will have a fragility fracture. A higher daily step count is associated with lower all-cause mortality. After one year of follow-up, physical therapy is preferred to glucocorticoid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee; acetaminophen is ineffective for acute low back pain or pain due to knee or hip osteoarthritis; and adding a muscle relaxant to ibuprofen does not improve functional outcomes or pain in people reporting moderate to severe back pain one week after starting treatment. Although short-term antibiotics and steroids are effective in treating acute exacerbations of COPD, not much else is. Successful communication with patients seeking an antibiotic for a flulike illness can be achieved with combinations of messaging, including information on antibiotic resistance and the self-limiting nature of the illness. A new prediction rule effectively identifies patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have a low likelihood of positive findings on allergy testing. Low-value screening tests in asymptomatic, low-risk patients often lead to further testing, diagnostic procedures, or referrals. A new tool helps determine the amount of change needed to signify a real difference between two laboratory values in the same person over time. Finally, a pillar of our specialty, continuity of care, is associated with decreased all-cause mortality.","Grad, Roland; Ebell, Mark H",American family physician,410,16

METHODS Phosphorus and magnesium serum concentrations of 130 elite track and field athletes (65 males and 65 females, age range 20-30 years) from the National Athletics Sports Medicine Center database in Thessaloniki, Greece were measured. RESULTS Abnormal results were found in 61 (47%) athletes (32 men and 29 women). In male athletes, serum phosphate was higher than normal in 18% and decreased in 1.5%, whereas serum magnesium concentration was higher in 26%, and lower in 3%. Regarding female athletes, higher serum phosphate and magnesium levels were detected in 26% and 17% respectively, whereas decreased serum magnesium was found in 3%. The most common alterations were higher serum phosphate (29/61, 47%) and magnesium concentrations (28/61, 46%). Abnormalities of serum phosphorus and magnesium concentrations were detected in almost half of the athletes. Hyperphosphataemia and hypermagnesaemia were the most common abnormalities. CONCLUSION The reference intervals used for general population cannot be used for athletes. Given the lack of pathological manifestations, the physiopathological significance of these findings is uncertain. Further studies on the interpretation of reported ion concentrations in athletes should take in account the type of sport practiced and also the possible variations during the training and competition season.","Malliaropoulos, Nikolaos; Tsitas, Kostas; Porfiriadou, Anthoula; Papalada, Agapi; R Ames, Paul; Del Buono, Angelo; Lippi, Giuseppe; Maffulli, Nicola",Asian journal of sports medicine,410,16

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, recognized as a respiratory disease, is an example of zoonotic transmission of the RNA virus known as SARS-CoV-2. The development and regulatory approval of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 pose multiple preventive and therapeutic challenges, especially during an ongoing pandemic. Objective The review intended to examine the challenges and recent achievements in the development of vaccine candidates against COVID-19. Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant and up to date information from the literature. The sources of data included Google Scholar, PubMed, NCBI, and Yahoo. The search terms used were COVID-19 challenges, SARS-CoV-2 prospective challenges, RNA viruses adoptability, host switching by RNA viruses, COVID-19 vaccines. Setting The study took place at the digital libraries of contributing institutions. The data was combined, selected for further analysis and manuscript preparation at King Abdulaziz University. Results RNA viruses with high rate of genome alterations and evolution have better chances to survive in the adverse environmental conditions by adopting the alternate host species. The recent epidemics such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are examples of zoonotic transmission of RNA viruses from animal species to the humans. However, the mechanisms involved in the switching-on to new host species need further investigations to control the zoonotic transmissions in near future. As of April 2020, 115 candidate vaccines were being evaluated; 78 of them had been found to be active, and a few of them are in Phase I trials. In the development of different types of vaccine candidates against COVID-19, multiple international pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are involved. Conclusions Emerging and re-emerging pathogenic RNA viruses pose a serious threat to human health. Little is known about the human-host adoptive mechanism for zoonotic transmission. Deep insights into the molecular mechanism responsible for the switching of animal or bird viruses to humans could provide target molecules or events to prevent such transmissions in the near future. Fast development and approval of efficacious and safe vaccines is key to the effort to provide preventive measures against COVID-19 and future viruses. However, the development and availability of a vaccine candidate is a time-consuming process and often can't be completed during an epidemic. Currently, several types of vaccines are under development, and most of them won't realistically be available in time for the present COVID-19 pandemic.","Shahid Nadeem, Muhammad; Ali, Akbar; Al-Ghamdi, Maryam A; Azam Khan, Jalaluddin; Zamzami, Mazin A; Nazia Murtaza, Bibi; Kazmi, Imran; Ur Rehman, Mujadid",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,410,24

Aims: The main aim of the present study was to find the coagulation profile of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients with COVID-19 from Kermanshah, Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods: Coagulation parameters were analyzed using appropriate methods in 74 patients (24 patients aged <60 years and 50 patients &#8805;60 years) and were compared with 35 survivors (severe COVID-19) and 39 non-survivors (severe COVID-19) historically admitted to the ICU. Results: Forty-two percent of patients had abnormal prothrombin time and international normalized ratio. The rates of mortality and comorbidity in patients aged &#8805; 60 years were 73.7% and 78.4% compared to 26.3% and 21.6%, respectively, in patients aged < 60 years. Conclusion: We found an abnormal pattern of coagulation parameters and association of advanced age and comorbidities with a high rate of mortality in severe COVID-19 patients, which should be taken into consideration in their hospital management.","Sayad, Babak; Rahimi, Zohreh",East Mediterr Health J,410,1

Results of a satisfaction survey during the first wave of COVID-19 in Liverpool,17.569237,5.110161,2021,"We report a novel material containing a rare metal-free dopant chromophore with controlled electronic symmetry, which exhibits strong optical limiting (OL) capabilities under weak, continuous, sky-blue irradiance. Electron-donating substituents at positions C2 and C7 of pyrene allow significant triplet generation because of the symmetrically forbidden transition between the ground state and the lowest singlet excited state, which leads to accumulation of triplet excitons in the dopant chromophore. This also leads to a small ground state absorption coefficient and induces greater absorption of sky-blue wavelengths when triplet excitons of the chromophore accumulate. Consequently, molecular glass doped with the designed chromophore displays stronger OL characteristics compared with those of the rare element-containing glass that previously demonstrated the greatest OL performance under continuous sky-blue irradiance at sunlight power levels. The described approach to developing cost-effective, state-of-the-art OL materials is crucial for nonlinear optical applications working at a large scale under sunlight or room lights.","Kamatsuki, Takuya; Bhattacharjee, Indranil; Hirata, Shuzo",J Phys Chem Lett,410,16

Here, we report a highly sensitive and specific one-pot assay for the fluorescence-based detection of RNA from pathogens. The assay, which can be performed within 30-50 min of incubation time and can reach a limit of detection of 0.1-attomolar RNA concentration, relies on a sustained isothermal reaction cascade producing an RNA aptamer that binds to a fluorogenic dye. The RNA aptamer is transcribed by the T7 RNA polymerase from the ligation product of a promoter DNA probe and a reporter DNA probe that hybridize with the target single-stranded RNA sequence via the SplintR ligase (a Chlorella virus DNA ligase). In 40 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 samples, the assay reached positive and negative predictive values of 95 and 100%, respectively. We also show that the assay can rapidly detect a range of viral and bacterial RNAs.","Woo, Chang Ha; Jang, Sungho; Shin, Giyoung; Jung, Gyoo Yeol; Lee, Jeong Wook",,410,16

Consumer digital tools used to collect data, such as the Apple-Google digital contact tracing program, offer opportunities to reduce COVID-19 transmission but introduce privacy concerns. Objective: To assess uses of consumer digital information for COVID-19 control that US adults find acceptable and the factors associated with higher or lower approval of use of this information. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study obtained data from a nationally representative sample of 6284 US adults recruited by email from the web-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel in July 2020. Respondents evaluated scenarios reflecting uses of digital data for COVID-19 control (case identification, digital contact tracing, policy setting, and enforcement of quarantines). Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of support for use of personal digital data in 9 scenarios to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection, rated on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted for each scenario and included factors hypothesized to be associated with views about digital data use for COVID-19 mitigation measures. Black and Hispanic survey respondents were oversampled; thus, poststratification weights were used so that results are representative of the general US population. Results: Of 6284 individuals invited to participate in the study, 3547 responded, for a completion rate of 56%. A total of 1762 participants (52%) were female, 715 (21%) identified as Black, 790 (23%) identified as Hispanic, and 1224 (36%) were 60 years or older; mean (SD) age was 51.7 (16.6) years. Approval of scenarios was low, ranging from 28% to 43% (52%-67% when neutral responses were included). Differences were found based on digital data source (smartphone vs social media: coefficient, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23-0.35]; P < .001; smart thermometer vs social media: coefficient, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.03-0.16]; P = .004). County COVID-19 rates (coefficient, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.16 to 0.13 for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1) and prior family diagnosis of COVID-19 (coefficient, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.25) were not associated with support. Compared with self-described liberal individuals, conservative (coefficient, -0.81; 95% CI, -0.96 to -0.66; P < .001) and moderate (coefficient, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.38; P < .001) individuals were less likely to support the scenarios. Similarly, large political differences were observed in support of the Apple-Google digital contact tracing program, with less support from conservative (coefficient, -0.99; 95% CI, -1.11 to -0.87; P < .001) and moderate (coefficient, -0.59; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.48; P < .001) individuals compared with liberal individuals. Respondents from racial/ethnic minority groups were more supportive of the scenarios than were White, non-Hispanic respondents. For example, compared with White respondents, Black respondents were more supportive of the Apple-Google contact tracing program (coefficient, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.32; P = .002). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, many were averse to their information being used on digital platforms to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. These findings suggest that in current and future pandemics, public health departments should use multiple strategies to gain public trust and accelerate adoption of tools such as digital contact tracing applications.","Grande, David; Mitra, Nandita; Marti, Xochitl Luna; Merchant, Raina; Asch, David; Dolan, Abby; Sharma, Meghana; Cannuscio, Carolyn",JAMA Netw Open,410,9

The most promising vaccines have targeted the surface glycoprotein (S-protein) of SARS-CoV-2 and achieved an approximate 85%-95% reduction in the risk of symptomatic COVID-19, while retaining excellent safety profiles and modest side effects in the phase III clinical trials. The mRNA, replication-incompetent viral vector, and protein subunit vaccine technologies have all been successfully employed. Some novel SARS-CoV-2 variants evade but do not appear to fully overcome the potent immunity induced by these vaccines. Emerging real-world effectiveness data add evidence for protection from severe COVID-19. This is an impressive first demonstration of the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccine and vector vaccine platforms. The success of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development should be credited to open science, industry partnerships, harmonization of clinical trials, and the altruism of study participants.

However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients (e. g. Aguilar et al., 2020; Chugthai et al, 2020; Li, et al., 2020; Mizumoto et al., 2020a, 2020b and Yelin et al., 2020). In this situation, in order to estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw sound probabilistic inference. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic in earlier time (Brogi et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\`a so as to obtain a more representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a distribution which is more similar to the population (Valliant et al., 2018). In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order to derive the weights necessary for reweighting them using age and gender as post-stratification variables thus obtaining more reliable estimation of prevalence and lethality.","Bassi, Francesca; Arbia, Giuseppe; Falorsi, Pietro Demetrio",,410,1

Radical social distancing with the associated shutdown of schools, restaurants, sport clubs, workplaces, and traveling has been shown to be effective in reducing virus spread, but its economic and social costs are unsustainable in the medium term. Simple measures like frequent handwashing, facial masks, and other physical barriers are being commonly adopted to prevent virus transmission. However, their efficacy may be limited, particularly in shared indoor spaces, where, in addition to airborne transmission, elements with small surface areas such as elevator buttons, door handles, and handrails are frequently used and can also mediate transmission. We argue that additional measures are necessary to reduce virus transmission when people resume attending schools and jobs that require proximity or some degree of physical contact. Among the available alternatives, UV-C light satisfies the requirements of rapid, widespread, and economically viable deployment. Its implementation is only limited by current production capacities, an increase of which requires swift intervention by industry and authorities.","García de Abajo, F Javier; Hernández, Rufino Javier; Kaminer, Ido; Meyerhans, Andreas; Rosell-Llompart, Joan; Sanchez-Elsner, Tilman",ACS Nano,410,16

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic and exposure data from physical therapists from April to May 2020. All physical therapists working in an inpatient and outpatient care in Italy were eligible. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among all eligible physical therapists to collect (1) demographic characteristics, (2-3) personal- and work-related exposures, and (4) signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Factors associated with a COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) were explored through logistic regression models and multivariate methods. RESULTS: A total of 15,566 respondents completed the survey, with a response rate of 43.3%, achieving high statistical precision (99% CI, 1% type I error). Among physical therapists who received NPS testing, 13.1% (95% CI = 12.1-14.1%) had a positive result, with a peak reached in March 2020 (36%). The top five symptoms were fatigue and tiredness (69.1%), loss of smell (64.5%), aches and pains (60.8%), loss of taste (58.3%), and headache (51.1%). No symptoms were reported by 8.9%. Working in a health care institution [odds ratio (OR) = 7.2; 95% CI = 5.4-9.7], being reallocated to a different unit (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3-2.2) and changing job tasks (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.2) increased the risk of being COVID-19 positive. In therapists with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, comorbidities were associated with male sex and age older than 51 years. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave in Italy, almost 1 out of 7 physical therapists tested positive on the COVID-19 NPS test. Considering personal- and work-related exposures, health care organizations should adopt prevention measures and adequate preparedness to prevent high rate of infections during future pandemics. IMPACT: This is the largest investigation about the spread of and the main risk factors for COVID-19 in the physical therapy field.","Gianola, Silvia; Bargeri, Silvia; Campanini, Isabella; Corbetta, Davide; Gambazza, Simone; Innocenti, Tiziano; Meroni, Roberto; Castellini, Greta; Turolla, Andrea",Phys. ther,410,2

The first two cases of COVID-19 were detected in Venezuela on March 13, 2020. The aim of this study was the genetic characterization of Venezuelan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A total of 7 full SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing, from patients of different regions of Venezuela, mainly from the beginning of the epidemic. Ten out of 11 isolates (6 complete genomes and 4 partial spike genomic regions) belonged to lineage B, bearing the D614G mutation in the Spike protein. Isolates from the first outbreak that occurred in the Margarita Island harbored an in-frame deletion in its sequence, without amino acids 83-85 of the NSP1 of the ORF1. The search for deletions in 48,635 sequences showed that the NSP1 gene exhibit the highest frequency of deletions along the whole genome. Structural analysis suggests a change in the N-terminal domain with the presence of this deletion. In contrast, isolates circulating later in this island lacked the deletion, suggesting new introductions to the island after this first outbreak. In conclusion, a high diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were found circulating in Venezuela, with predominance of the D614G mutation. The first small outbreak in Margarita Island seemed to be associated with a strain carrying a small deletion in the NSP1 protein, but these isolates do not seem to be responsible for the larger outbreak which started in July.","Loureiro, C.

The COVID-19 epidemic has emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city of China and spread rapidly to other parts of the world. This quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection to many states across the globe affecting many people has led WHO to declare it a pandemic on March 12, 2020. As of July 4, 2020, more than 523,011 people lost their lives worldwide because of this deadly SARS-CoV-2. The current situation becomes more frightening as no FDA-approved drugs or vaccines are available to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current therapeutic options for COVID-19 are limited only to supportive measures and non-specific interventions. So, the need of the hour is to search for SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral treatments and to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Also, it is equally important to maintain our immunity, and natural products and Ayurvedic medicines are indispensable in this regard. In this review, we discuss recent updates regarding various therapeutic approaches to combat COVID-19 pandemic and enlist the major pipeline drugs and traditional medicines that are under trial for COVID-19. Also, possible mechanisms involved in viral pathogenesis are discussed, which further allow us to understand various drug targets and helps in discovering novel therapeutic approaches for COVID-19.

Death education is a type of intervention that helps people manage their fear of death by offering them effective strategies to deal with loss and anxiety. To that end, a path of death education has been carried out with University students of psychology. The main purpose of the research is to understand how students who participated in the death education course perceive the lockdown experience in light of course teachings. The research was carried out at a University in northern Italy in an area severely affected by COVID-19, during the first year of the pandemic. The group of participants included 38 students, 30 women and 8 men, with an average age of 25.45 years (SD = 7). At the end of the course, the students could respond on an optional basis to the request to comment on the training experience according to what they experienced during the pandemic. A thematic analysis was subsequently carried out on the texts, which made it possible to identify the most relevant thematic areas for the students. The qualitative analyses permitted recognition of three main forms of discovery: the removal of death in contemporary culture; the importance of community, ritual and funeral, and spirituality; and the significance of death education for future health professionals. The texts have highlighted how the removal of these issues exposes people to the risk of being unable to handle extremely painful events such as those related to dying. The results show the positivity of death education pathways conducted at the University level to help students reflect on these issues and manage the related anguish.","Testoni, Ines; Iacona, Erika; Corso, Cecilia; Pompele, Sara; Dal Corso, Laura; Orkibi, Hod; Wieser, Michael Alexander",Front Public Health,410,10

We studied whether hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory diseases experienced worse outcomes compared to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without chronic inflammatory diseases. METHODS: Danish nationwide registers were used to establish a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthropathy (SpA), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (exposed), and a control cohort without these diseases (unexposed) between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. We compared median length of hospital stay, used median regression models to estimate crude and adjusted differences. When estimating crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mechanical ventilation, in-hospital death, 14-day and 30-day mortality, we used logistic regression models. RESULTS: We identified 132 patients with COVID-19 and IBD, RA, SpA, or PsA, and 2811 unexposed admitted to hospital with COVID-19. There were no differences between exposed and unexposed regarding length of hospital stay (6.8 days vs. 5.5 days), need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs. 9.4%), or CPAP (11.4% vs. 8.8%). Adjusted OR for in-hospital death was 0.71 (95% CI 0.42-1.22), death after 14-days 0.70 (95% CI 0.42-1.16), and death after 30-days 0.68 (95% CI 0.41-1.13). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory diseases did not have statistically significant increased length of hospital stay, had same need for mechanical ventilation, and CPAP. Mortality was similar in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and chronic inflammatory diseases, compared to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and no chronic inflammatory diseases.","Kjeldsen, Jens; Nielsen, Jan; Ellingsen, Torkell; Knudsen, Torben; Nielsen, Rasmus Gaardskær; Larsen, Michael Due; Lund, Ken; Nørgård, Bente Mertz",J Autoimmun,410,1

This consisted of 40 open- and close-ended questions. The questionnaire was completed by 1375 (67.1%) students. Accordingly, 52.4% of medical students reported feeling mentally unwell. Although 50.8% of medical students reported generally/usually obtaining information about COVID-19 through the social media, 82.0% did not trust information/messages arriving through the social media and WhatsApp. We found that 86.7% of students regarded frequent hand washing as the most important means of protection against COVID-19, and 19.3% of students did not regard the COVID-19 pandemic as a severe public health problem for Turkey at that moment. In addition, 61.6% of students stated that a suppression strategy involving tight restrictions need to be applied to being the pandemic under control in Turkey. Use can be made of medical students in the transmission of accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, tumor cells can display on their surface heat shock proteins/molecular chaperones that are mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 molecules (including the Spike protein), similarly to what happens in other bacterial or viral infections. Since molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and tumoral proteins can elicit an immune reaction in which antibodies or cytotoxic cells produced against the virus cross-react with the tumor cells, we want to prompt clinical studies to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on prognosis and follow up of various forms of tumors.

No alternative curriculum existed to fill the educational void for clinical students. The traditional approach to curriculum development was not feasible during the pandemic as faculty were redeployed to clinical care, and the immediate need for continued learning necessitated a new model. APPROACH: One student developed an outline for an online course on pandemics based on peer-to-peer conversations regarding learners' interests and needs, and she proposed that students author the content given the immediate need for a curriculum. Fifteen student volunteers developed content to fill knowledge gaps, and expert faculty reviewers confirmed that the student authors had successfully curated a comprehensive curriculum. EVALUATION: The crowdsourced student content coalesced into a 40-hour curriculum required for all 371 clinical-level students at UMMS. This student-driven effort took just 17 days from outline to implementation, and the final product is a full course comprising five modules, multiple choice questions, discussion boards, and assignments. Learners were surveyed to gauge success, and 93% rated this content as relevant to all medical students. REFLECTION: The successful implementation of this model for curriculum development, grounded in the Master Adaptive Learner framework, suggests that medical students can be entrusted as stewards of their own education. As we return to a post-pandemic ""normal,"" this approach could be applied to the maintenance and de novo development of future curricula.","Kercheval, Jacquelyn B; Khamees, Deena; Keilin, Charles A; Markovitz, Netana H; Losman, Eve D",Perspectives on medical education,410,16

MEANS is offered through secure messaging via the My HealtheVet patient portal system. Materials and Methods: Women veterans aged 45-60 years registered at the Miami, West Palm Beach, and Orlando Veterans Affairs Healthcare Systems (VAHS). Intervention group: women in the Miami VAHS enrolled in My HealtheVet who were sent an invitation, agreed to participate, and completed the baseline survey. Comparison group: women from the Miami, West Palm Beach, and Orlando VAHS who responded to the baseline survey. Results: The intervention group enrolled 269 women at Miami VAHS: average age 53.2 years; 42.4% white, 43.1% black, and 24.2% Hispanic; 95.9% already used My Healthe Vet. The Comparison group had 590 women: average age 53.8 years; 70.8% white, 20.7% black, and 10.2% Hispanic; 57.6% already used My Healthe Vet. Conclusions: The differences between the intervention and comparison groups likely represent the regional demographic variations and the disparate recruitment techniques adopted for the two groups. Using within- and between-group comparisons at the end of the 6-month intervention, this novel project will evaluate the feasibility of a patient portal intervention on knowledge and shared decision-making regarding menopause among racially and ethnically diverse women. The study highlights the scalable and enormous potential for patient portals in nonurgent chronic disease management and shared decision-making, important in the existing health care climate, wherein ""meaningful use"" of electronic health records is mandated. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care has abruptly changed to telehealth and this approach to patient education is more relevant now than ever before.

HLA-G expression is mainly restricted to the fetal-maternal interface on the extravillous cytotrophoblast, placenta, amnion.Methods: The purpose of this study is to investigate the HLA-G and KIR2DL4 expression in chorionic villous among 2 groups with missed abortion: group 1 - 27cases with normal karyotype and group 2 - 22 with fetal polyploidy. Criteria of inclusion: abortive material from two groups of women with missed abortion; 6-12 weeks gestational age, singleton pregnancy, cytogenetic of chorionic villous was obligatory - normal fetal karyotype and polyploidy of fetus.Results: During IHC investigations the average relative area of HLA-G expression in trophoblast was counted (in 1st group 33.9 ± 3.5 and in 2nd group 38.6 ± 2.8). Expression of HLA-G the most verified in extravillous chorion stroma. The average relative area of KIR2DL4 receptor was not statistically different among two groups (31.6 ± 2.4 and 32.2 ± 1.7). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the role of HLA-G for the progression in early reproductive losses. Low expression of HLA-G is associated with pregnancy complications and can be one of the reasons for spontaneous abortion.","Bespalova, Olesya; Bakleicheva, Margarita; Ivashchenko, Tatiana; Tral, Tatiana; Tolibova, Gulrukhsor; Kogan, Igor",Gynecol Endocrinol,410,24

METHODS: Between March 29 and May, 2020, the words COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, COVID-19 and pregnancy, SARS-CoV2 and pregnancy, and SARS and pregnancy were searched in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases; the guidelines from well-known societies and institutions (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [RCOG], American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology [ISUOG], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]) were also included. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a pandemic with > 3.3 million cases and 230 thousand deaths until May 2nd. It is caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus and may lead to severe pulmonary infection and multi-organ failure. Past experiences show that unique characteristics in pregnancy make pregnant women more susceptible to complications from viral infections. Yet, this has not been reported with this new virus. There are risk factors that seem to increase morbidity in pregnancy, such as obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 35), asthma and cardiovascular disease. Current reports describe an increased rate of preterm birth and C-section. Vertical transmission is still a possibility, due to a few reported cases of neonatal positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in nasal swab, amniotic fluid, and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) in neonatal blood. Treatments must be weighed in with caution due to the lack of quality trials that prove their effectiveness and safety during pregnancy. Medical staff must use personal protective equipment in handling SARS-CoV2 suspected or positive patients and be alert for respiratory decompensations.","Czeresnia, Ricardo Mamber; Trad, Ayssa Teles Abrao; Britto, Ingrid Schwach Werneck; Negrini, Romulo; Nomura, Marcelo Luís; Pires, Pedro; Costa, Fabricio da Silva; Nomura, Roseli Mieko Yamamoto; Ruano, Rodrigo",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,410,21

We studied 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations in children with PIMS-TS, admitted to a tertiary paediatric hospital in the United Kingdom (U.K), due to its postulated role in cytokine regulation and immune response.

Diphyllin and diphyllinosides are known as natural blockers of cellular vacuolar ATPases, and so can act as inhibitors of the pH-dependent fusion of viral envelopes with host cell endosomal membranes. Such pH-dependent fusion is a critical early step during the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. Accordingly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 profiles and cytotoxicities of diphyllin, diphyllinoside cleistanthin B, and two structurally related compounds, helioxanthin 8-1 and helioxanthin 5-4-2, are evaluated here using in vitro cell-based assay systems. Neither helioxanthin exhibits any obvious anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro. By contrast diphyllin and cleistanthin B do exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in Vero cells, with respective 50% effective concentrations (EC50) values of 1.92 and 6.51 µM. Diphyllin displays anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect also in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) cells. Moreover, when diphyllin is added at various times post infection, a significant decrease in viral titer is observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, even at high viral multiplicities of infection. Importantly, neither diphyllin nor cleistanthin B are found cytotoxic to Vero cells in concentrations up to 100 µM. However, the cytotoxic effect of diphyllin is more pronounced in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that diphyllin and diphyllin analogues might be perfected as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in future preclinical studies, most especially if nanomedicine approaches may be invoked to optimize functional drug delivery to virus infected cells.","Stefanik, Michal; Strakova, Petra; Haviernik, Jan; Miller, Andrew D; Ruzek, Daniel; Eyer, Ludek",,410,1

Many hospitalized patients may continue testing COVID-19 positive even after the resolution of symptoms. Thus, a pressing concern for clinicians is the safety of discharging these asymptomatic patients if they have any remaining infectivity. This case report explores the viral viability in a patient with persistent COVID-19 over the course of a 2-month hospitalization. Positive nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and isolated in the laboratory and analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), and serology was tested for neutralizing antibodies throughout the hospitalization period. The patient experienced waning symptoms by hospital day 40 and had no viable virus growth by hospital day 41, suggesting no risk of infectivity, despite positive RT-PCR results which prolonged his hospital stay. Notably, this case showed infectivity for at least 24 days after disease onset, which is longer than the discontinuation of transmission-based precautions recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Thus, our findings suggest that the timeline for discontinuing transmission-based precautions may need to be extended for patients with severe and prolonged COVID-19 disease.

Unprecedented public health actions were introduced, including social distancing, travel restrictions and quarantine. The Belgian government announced a national emergency plan, thereby postponing all non-urgent medical consultations and operations. This report analyses the impact of these measures on cancer screening, through assessment of the workload of a laboratory for histopathology and cytopathology. METHODS: Data on monthly numbers of histological and cytological samples, immunohistochemistry and molecular tests were extracted from the laboratory information management system. RESULTS: The global histopathological and cytological workload was substantially reduced. The impact on oncology-related surgical procedures was rather limited. The anti-COVID-19 measures significantly diminished all screening-related samples, such as colon biopsies, breast biopsies and cervical cytology, and strongly reduced the number of samples related to ""functional"" pathology, such as thyroidectomies and gastric biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Since many health care interventions are reflected in the workload of a pathology laboratory, this study enabled us to identify areas for ""deconfinement"" health care actions. Our findings indicate that various areas in medicine were affected, but the impact seemed largest for cancer screening.

METHODS: IR procedural volumes were compiled, stratified by location and compared with Diagnostic Radiology (DR) volumes during the same timeframe. Procedure volume was categorized by type, including oncology, dialysis interventions, and drainage procedures with comparisons made using Z-score test for proportions. IR and system-wide surgical procedural volume was compared with baseline values. RESULTS: System-wide IR procedural volume decreased by 35%, with a 41% decrease in outpatient and a 25% decrease in inpatient volume during the state-mandated order. DR volume decreased by 45%, with a 57% decrease in outpatient and a 22% decrease in inpatient volume. Total IR procedural volume during the mandate was 1077 versus 1518 during the preceding six weeks. The proportion of Interventional Oncology and dialysis interventions showed no significant change (p > 0.05) while that of drainage procedures increased (p < 0.05). Compared to baseline values, system-wide procedural volumes for IR, Vascular Surgery, Urology, General Surgery, Gastroenterology and Gynecology decreased by 3%, 11%, 25%, 20%, 38% and 31% in March 2020 and 25%, 47%, 68%, 63%, 79% and 73% in April 2020 respectively. CONCLUSION: Outpatient IR volumes were less impacted compared to DR during the initial phase of COVID-19. Oncology, dialysis and drainage interventions may be considered essential procedures due to their stability. IR volumes were less affected compared to other procedural specialties.","Hashmi, Ahmad; Parikh, Keval; Al-Natour, Mohammed; Azar, Nami; Sutter, Christopher; Ramaiya, Nikhil; Davidson, Jon; Tavri, Sidhartha",Clin Imaging,410,1

During infectious disease outbreaks, forecasting models are often developed to inform resource utilization. Pregnancy and delivery pose unique challenges, given the altered maternal immune system and the fact that most American women choose to deliver in the hospital setting. Objective: This study aimed to forecast the first pandemic wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the general population and the incidence of severe, critical, and fatal coronavirus disease 2019 cases during delivery hospitalization in the United States. Study Design: We used a phenomenological model to forecast the incidence of the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States. Incidence data from March 1, 2020, to April 14, 2020, were used to calibrate the generalized logistic growth model. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulation was performed for each week from March 1, 2020, to estimate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 for delivery hospitalizations during the first pandemic wave using the available data estimate. Results: From March 1, 2020, our model forecasted a total of 860,475 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 in the general population across the United States for the first pandemic wave. The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 during delivery hospitalization is anticipated to be 16,601 (95% confidence interval, 9711-23,491) cases, 3308 (95% confidence interval, 1755-4861) cases of which are expected to be severe, 681 (95% confidence interval, 1324-1038) critical, and 52 (95% confidence interval, 23-81) fatal. Assuming similar baseline maternal mortality rate as the year 2018, we projected an increase in maternal mortality rate in the United States to at least 18.7 (95% confidence interval, 18.0-19.5) deaths per 100,000 live births as a direct result of coronavirus disease 2019. Conclusion: Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnant women is expected to severely affect obstetrical care. From March 1, 2020, we forecast 3308 severe and 681 critical cases with about 52 coronavirus disease 2019-related maternal mortalities during delivery hospitalization for the first pandemic wave in the United States. These results are significant for informing counseling and resource allocation.","Putra, Manesha; Kesavan, Malavika; Brackney, Kerri; Hackney, David N; Roosa, Kimberlyn M",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,410,2

Scientists at all academic levels had to think creatively and design, if possible, engaging remote projects for their students. Based on journal reviews from renowned educators, we decided to perform a systematic literature review of publicly available material to summarize information about SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current pandemic, which has affected 87.5 million people with 1.89 million deaths worldwide (as of Jan 7, 2021). Using the PubMed Central (PMC) advanced search builder, we were able to narrow the initial 93,999 results for COVID-19 related articles published in the past year (Nov 2019 ? Nov 2020) to 543 publications that were related to SARS-CoV-2, spike protein structure and its receptor. Relevant articles in peer-reviewed journals were identified from this list and comprehensive analysis of ~40 research articles were conducted and summarized. This compilation was used in a case-study model to narrate a story simplifying the complexities of COVID-19 infection while providing detailed qualitative information, which would otherwise be difficult and sensitive to discuss. This model for summer research enhanced students? critical thinking skills necessary to ponder questions related to COVID-19 in preparation to enter the healthcare profession. This directed patient case study was designed by using data from real life situations and applying it to fictitious patients to maintain anonymity. The storyline follows three individuals (85-year-old male, 80-year-old female, and a 50-year-old male) and their families during the 2019?2020 coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The timeline of patients? infections, testing, interventions, and outcomes are discussed. Additional sections on COVID-19 gender disparities and atypical symptoms are also provided. Students in upper-level biology and health science courses, such as physiology and pathophysiology, will research the symptoms, susceptibility, mechanism of action, progression of the infection, opportunistic infections, extrapulmonary complications and treatments. The case concludes with an assignment to discuss the most current information available regarding the progress made in designing novel treatments. This project was presented at the Natural Science Summer Research program and parts of it will be introduced to students in local high schools as part of Benedictine University's (BenU) outreach activity. We are in the process of submitting a detailed version of this case to the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. Working on the various aspects of the case, including instructor notes, answer key and presentations, honed the critical analysis and communication skills of the research students. Despite various tragedies and challenges, the pandemic offered the unique opportunity to identify novel topics and techniques to circumvent original project goals and traditional undergraduate research methods, as well as provide freedom for innovation that can ultimately benefit the academic community.","Simkeviciute, Gerda Mehmood Daniyal Donner Faith Perez Morales Tiara Sarathy Jayashree",The FASEB Journal,410,16

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with diabetes hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 7 May 2020 at a large academic medical center in New York City. Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent association of HbA1c levels and outpatient diabetes treatment regimen with mortality, in addition to independent effects of demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: We included 1,126 hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19 for analysis, among whom mean age was 68 years, 50% were male, 75% were Black, mean BMI was 30 kg/m2, 98% had type 2 diabetes, mean HbA1c was 7.5%, and 33.1% died. HbA1c levels were not associated with mortality in unadjusted or adjusted analyses, but an outpatient regimen with any insulin treatment was strongly predictive. Additionally, age, sex, and BMI interacted such that in all age categories, mortality was higher with increasing BMI in males compared with females. CONCLUSIONS: In this large U.S. cohort of hospitalized patients with diabetes and COVID-19, insulin treatment, as a possible proxy for diabetes duration, and obesity rather than long-term glycemic control were predictive of mortality. Further investigation of underlying mechanisms of mortality and inpatient glycemic control is needed.","Agarwal, Shivani; Schechter, Clyde; Southern, Will; Crandall, Jill P; Tomer, Yaron",Diabetes Care,410,1

METHODS: This prospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19 infection was conducted from 6 June to 26 November 2020 in different wards of a tertiary hospital. MR-proANP, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitive cardiac troponin I levels on admission were collected and tested for their association with disease severity and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 213 eligible patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analyses of whom 13.2% (n = 28) died within 28 days. Median levels of MR-proANP at admission were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (307 pmol/L IQR, [161 - 532] vs 75 pmol/L [IQR, 43 - 153], P < .001) compared to survivors and increased with disease severity and level of hypoxaemia. The area under the ROC curve for MR-proANP predicting 28-day mortality was 0.832 (95% CI 0.753 - 0.912, P < .001). An optimal cut-off point of 160 pmol/L yielded a sensitivity of 82.1% and a specificity of 76.2%. MR-proANP was a significant predictor of 28-day mortality independent of clinical confounders, comorbidities and established prognostic markers of COVID-19 (HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.21 - 6.37; P = .016), while NT-proBNP failed to independently predict 28-day mortality and had a numerically lower AUC compared to MR-proANP.

The current pharmaceutical pipeline is disproportional focused on oncology, where about 1/3 of all phases of development is in this therapeutic area. The emphasis brings about substantial breakthroughs and has made positive impact on the quality of life. However, oncology remains a threat to human existence. To facilitate this process, a comprehensive list of novel/first molecularly targeted oncology drug approvals by the FDA from 2017 to 2020 is assessed. Here, we focus on molecularly targeted oncology drugs and not cytotoxic ones, although the latter remain important. To achieve this purpose, besides their sponsors, years of approval, drug classes, and cancer indications, clinical significance is included. The results show that approved molecularly targeted drugs span across diverse classes, including small molecule receptor inhibitors, and biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, check-point inhibitors (i.e., PD1, PDL1, CTLA4) and CAR-T cell therapies. Although complete cure of cancer remains limited, we have made substantial inroads and more is yet to come.

However, conventional measurements of accessibility cannot capture individual experiences and perceptions of accessibility. Moreover, since many daily necessities and services can only be acquired online during the pandemic, the ease of using smartphone-based services play an essential role in people’s everyday lives. Therefore, this paper investigates the relationship between the ease of using smartphone-based services, perceived accessibility, and perceived transport equity during the pandemic. Based on 186 family interviews, a panel survey with 569 respondents was conducted monthly from February to October 2020 in Kunming, China, and a three-wave cross-lagged panel model was developed to understand the causal relationship between the three constructs. The results indicate that the ease of using smartphone-based services dominantly influence transport equity in the early phase of the pandemic, but its effect faded after the lifting of travel restrictions. Perceived accessibility to services appears a sound indicator for transport equity in the new normal, but perceived accessibility and transport equity are not strongly associated when staying at home is perceived as desirable. Moreover, we found that contemporary practices of smartphone-based new mobility services only favour those who already have convenient access to services and have further excluded and marginalised disadvantaged populations, which urgently require policy interventions.","Liu, Qiyang An Zihao Liu Yang Ying Wanyun Zhao Pengjun",Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,410,24

Although pregnant women are considered at risk for respiratory infections by other viruses, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), little is known about their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, this study aims to identify and present the main studies on the topic, including the postpartum period. METHODS: In this narrative review, articles were searched in various databases, organizations, and health entities using keywords compatible with medical subject headings (MeSH), such as: COVID-19, pregnancy, vertical transmission, coronavirus 2019, and SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The review of the scientific literature on the subject revealed that pregnant women with COVID-19 did not present clinical manifestations significantly different from those of non-pregnant women; however, there are contraindicated therapies. Regarding fetuses, studies were identified that reported that infection by SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women can cause fetal distress, breathing difficulties and premature birth, but there is no substantial evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of adequate information and the limitations of the analyzed studies, it is necessary to provide detailed clinical data on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 and on the maternal-fetal repercussions caused by this infection. Thus, this review may contribute to expand the knowledge of professionals working in the area as well as to guide more advanced studies on the risk related to pregnant women and their newborns. Meanwhile, monitoring of confirmed or suspected pregnant women with COVID-19 is essential, including in the postpartum period.","Godoi, Ana Paula Nogueira; Bernardes, Gilcelia Correia Santos; Nogueira, Leilismara Sousa; Alpoim, Patrícia Nessralla; Pinheiro, Melina de Barros",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,410,1

Mortality in these critically ill patients is high. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in these severe courses are associated with poor outcome. Extracorporeal cytokine adsorption is an approach to lower elevated IL-6 levels. However, there is no randomised controlled data on the efficacy of cytokine adsorption and its effect on patient outcome in severe COVID-19 related ARDS requiring V-V ECMO support. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We here report the protocol of a 1:1 randomised, controlled, parallel group, open-label intervention, superiority multicentre trial to evaluate the effect of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption using the CytoSorb device in severe COVID-19 related ARDS treated with V-V ECMO. We hypothesise that extracorporeal cytokine adsorption in these patients is effectively reducing IL-6 levels by 75% or more after 72 hours as compared with the baseline measurement and also reducing time to successful V-V ECMO explantation. We plan to include a total of 80 patients at nine centres in Germany.

This project aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of TeleNP in a pediatric clinical population and disseminate clinical decision-making procedures to guide best practices for pediatric TeleNP. METHOD: This project conducted during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic reflects the largest clinical cohort to date of TeleNP in a pediatric population (N = 129). Data were gathered retrospectively from patients who were rescheduled from in-person assessment to TeleNP between March to June 2020. RESULTS: TeleNP was an accessible option for most patients and families, with no differences in demographic variables in patient appointment attendance, whether testing was conducted, and whether the patient was referred for face-to-face follow-up. Patients using laptops/desktops were more likely to undergo remote test administration in comparison with patients using phones/tablets (&#967;2 = 23.83, p < .002). Sixty-three percent of the sample were referred for a face-to-face follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: TeleNP is feasible in a pediatric clinical population ranging to begin the process of differential diagnosis and treatment planning. Pediatric TeleNP may be most efficacious as a screening procedure due to limited measures suited for remote administration and behavioral challenges interfering with testing requiring in-person follow-up. TeleNP screening as standard practice for patients who do not require a full, traditional neuropsychological battery may provide a more efficient care model, with more patients able to be seen using shorter batteries with less wait time.","Ransom, Danielle M; Butt, Sakina M; DiVirgilio, Emily K; Cederberg, Charles D; Srnka, Kyle D; Hess, Colleen T; Sy, Megan C; Katzenstein, Jennifer M",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,410,16

METHODS: Using positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), we constructed a spreadsheet tool for determining the minimum clinical specificity (conditional on NPV or PPV, sensitivity and prevalence) and minimum clinical sensitivity (conditional on NPV or PPV, specificity and prevalence) of tests. RESULTS: At a prevalence of 1%, there are no minimum sensitivity requirements to achieve a desired NPV of 60%-95% for a given clinical specificity above 20%. It is not possible to achieve 60-95% PPV even with 100% clinical sensitivity, except when the clinical specificity is near 100%. The opposite trend is seen in high prevalence settings (60%), where a relatively low minimum clinical sensitivity is required to achieve a desired PPV for a given clinical specificity, and a higher minimum clinical specificity is required to achieve a desired NPV for a given clinical sensitivity. DISCUSSION: The selection of laboratory tests and the testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 involves delicate trade-offs between NPV and PPV based on prevalence and clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Practitioners and health authorities should carefully consider the clinical scenarios under which the test result will be used and select the most appropriate testing strategy that fulfils the a priori defined clinical performance specification.","Loh, Tze Ping; Lord, Sarah J; Bell, Katy; Bohn, Mary Kathryn; Lim, Chun Yee; Markus, Corey; Fares Taie, Hernan; Adeli, Khosrow; Lippi, Giuseppe; Sandberg, Sverre; Horvath, Andrea",Clin. biochem,410,10

Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees' access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. METHODS: This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called ""UHSAs"" (which stands for ""unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées"", and can be translated as ""specially equipped hospital units"").

Clearly, not all of these measures are possible in every country due to a lack of resources and healthcare infrastructure, and it will surely be patients who will suffer the most as a result. This issue must be dealt with responsibly on the local level by all countries and patients cooperating with and supporting overwhelmed healthcare systems and aiding the planned implementation of mitigation measures. If not, pockets of SARS-CoV-2 will remain in these regions with continuous suffering of their populations.

We present a simple epidemiological model that is amenable to implementation in Excel spreadsheets and sufficiently accurate to reproduce observed data on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemics in different regions [i.e., New York City (NYC), South Korea, Mexico City]. We show that the model can be adapted to closely follow the evolution of COVID-19 in any large city by simply adjusting parameters related to demographic conditions and aggressiveness of the response from a society/government to epidemics. Moreover, we show that this simple epidemiological simulator can be used to assess the efficacy of the response of a government/society to an outbreak. The simplicity and accuracy of this model will greatly contribute to democratizing the availability of knowledge in societies regarding the extent of an epidemic event and the efficacy of a governmental response.","Alvarez, Mario Moisés; González-González, Everardo; Trujillo-de Santiago, Grissel",Sci Rep,410,1

For instance, evolutionary medicine proposed that there is an evolutionary mismatch between the human anatomy and physiology and novel, man‐made environments, leading to the so‐called diseases of civilization. Constraints exist on the process of natural selection, and evolutionary trade‐offs can prevent traits from being optimal, leaving humans with traits that at first sight seem maladaptive, such as the very narrow birth canal of humans. More generally, certain traits can increase reproduction at the cost of health and longevity. Other traits, such as pain and fever, are related to protective physiological defences, and not diseases. Some medical topics have biological roots in the field of ethology, particularly human ethology, such as the behavioural aspects of psychiatry and addiction. Compulsive overeating and binge eating show similarities to substance‐linked addictions and behavioural addictions. Interactions between behaviour, stress and diseases have ancient evolutionary roots, which may lead to a mismatch to the modern human environment. A subject of high, topical interest is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic, as the behavioural aspects of population compliance are crucial for the success in fighting the pandemic. Ethology, and evolutionary biology in general, can substantially contribute to improving the biological understanding of medical phenomena, and therefore of medical and public health interventions. This applies not only to research but also to education.

COVID-19 is a current pandemic that influences the mental health of various populations, especially pregnant women. Despite the importance of sexual health, the specific nature of its relationship to overall mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is not clearly defined. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between sexual function and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iranian pregnant women. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical, cross-sectional study was carried out among 437 pregnant women using the sociodemographic and obstetrics characteristics questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Inventory, Stress, Depression, and Anxiety Scales. Random sampling was employed to select pregnant women who had a medical record in Health Centers of Tabriz city, Iran. The questionnaires were sent to the participants' cell phones via WhatsApp or text messages, including links of questionnaires and the participants completed these questionnaires. Spearman correlation test was used to determine the relationship between sexual function and stress, anxiety, and depression. Generalized linear modeling was used to estimate each of the independent variables (sociodemographic characteristics, stress, anxiety, and depression) on the dependent variable (sexual function). RESULTS: The mean (Standard Deviation) sexual functioning (total) score was 20.0 (8.50) from the available range of 2 to 36. The mean (SD) of depression, stress, and anxiety scale was 4.81 (5.22), 5.13 (4.37), and 7.86 (4.50) (possible score ranging from 0 to 21), respectively. Based on Spearman's correlation test, there was a significant reverse correlation between the total sexual function score and stress, anxiety, and depression, indicating that all three variables negatively impacted sexual functioning. Variables such as mild stress, spouse type of job, sufficient household income, living with parents, higher marital satisfaction, and higher gestational age had a significant, positive impact on sexual function and could predict 35.8% of the variance model. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual functioning was significantly impacted by stress, anxiety, and depression - all of which are heightened during a pandemic. This topic warrants further study, and the general public should be educated on the protective influence of safe sex/intimacy on overall mental health.","Effati-Daryani, Fatemeh; Jahanfar, Shayesteh; Mohammadi, Azam; Zarei, Somayeh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,410,16

The status of the infection in the female genital system is still unknown. The study aimed to evaluate whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the vaginal fluid of women with COVID-19 infection in reproductive period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Women who were between the ages of 18-50 years and clinically confirmed to have COVID-19 infection at our hospital between 20 April-31 May 2020 were included in the study. Women who were in their menstrual cycle during the study and who had a known cervical intraepithelial lesion and/or cancer, sexually transmitted disease and history and/or symptoms of vaginitis were excluded from the study. In patients in whom no pathology was detected during the examination, a sample was taken from the vaginal fluid for PCR by using Dacron tip swab. Analysis was performed with Genesig Real-Time PCR COVID-19 kit (Primer Design, England). RESULTS: Eighteen women who were in reproductive period and diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 38.16 ± 8.54. None of the patients were in their menopause period. The clinical symptoms of these women were similar to those of confirmed severe COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 was found to be negative in the samples taken from the vaginal fluid in all patients.

A predominant thesis in the ongoing debate on the drivers of this observed heterogeneity is that a key determinant of the swift and extensive vaccine rollout is state capacity. Here, we utilize two measures that quantify different aspects of the state capacity: i) the external capacity (measured through the soft power and the economic power of the country) and ii) the internal capacity (measured via the country's government effectiveness) and investigate their relationship with the coronavirus vaccination outcome in the initial period (up to 30th January 2021). By using data on 189 countries and a two-step Heckman approach, we find that the economic power of the country and its soft power are robust determinants of whether a country has started with the vaccination process. In addition, the government effectiveness is a key factor that determines vaccine roll-out. Altogether, our findings are in line with the hypothesis that state capacity determines the observed heterogeneity between countries in the initial period of COVID-19 vaccines rollout.","Tevdovski, Dragan; Jolakoski, Petar; Stojkoski, Viktor",,410,10

This novel coronavirus, caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-), is described as highly infectious. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the novel coronavirus as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, and declared it as a ""pandemic."" Almost all countries have undertaken wide-scale precautions so as to prevent or limit the spread of the virus, with most having practiced some form of ""lockdown"" along with ""social distancing,"" as well as dispensed recommendations for proper hand washing, avoiding touching the face, wearing facemasks, and using disposable tissues when either coughing or sneezing. Whereas it is well known that slowing the spread of this new epidemic requires the cooperation of all citizens, some people still seem to willfully disregard the rules and guidelines, and thereby ignore the health risks posed to both themselves and to others they come into contact with. People have responded differently to lockdown rules and social distancing practices. Whilst the majority follow the rules and recommendations with great care, others are more lax or simply refuse to comply. These differences might be accounted for according to a number of factors including personal, social, cultural, mental, and economic variables. Being persuaded to comply with preventive rules, especially those concerned with health-related behaviors, also bring certain other factors into play. Fear is one of those factors, and is one of the most powerful. It is well known that fear-based appeals can be effective in inculcating health behaviors, with many theories having been developed in this area. However, both the content of the message (the level of the fear it contains) and certain personal variables can determine the persuasive power of the fear appeal. It can even have an adverse effect if not properly applied. Many theories have been developed to address the persuasive effectiveness of the fear appeal (e.g., fear-drive theory, protection-motivation theory), and this study aims to discuss these individual differences in precautionary and preventive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic within the framework of the basic assumptions of these theoretical approaches.","Demirtas-Madran, H.

With dicyanovinyl as the recognition site, a Michael addition reaction-based fluorescent probe Hcy-DCV was developed for malononitrile detection. A notable advantage of this probe is that it responds quickly to malononitrile without any additive to speed the sensing reaction. It has a good water solubility and the detection limit was determined to be 6.92 ppb in 100% aqueous solution. In particular, Hcy-DCV exhibited good selectivity towards malononitrile over other interfering substances including hydrazine and other active methylene compounds. The probe was applied successfully to quantitate malononitrile in pure water with satisfying recovery and relative standard deviation. Additionally, the ability of visualizing malononitrile by using probe-coated strip papers was displayed, which may facilitate the on-site detection of malononitrile. Moreover, the bioimaging of malononitrile in living H1975 cells and zebrafish larvae was also demonstrated. All the experimental results suggested the potential of Hcy-DCV for practical detection of malononitrile in both environmental and biological samples.","Tu, Liangping; Liu, Jian; Zhang, Zichang; Qi, Qingrong; Yao, Shun; Huang, Wencai",Analyst,410,10

We determined factors independently associated with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Among all (n=349) patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in a university hospital in a French region with a high rate of COVID-19, we analysed patients who underwent CTPA for clinical signs of severe disease (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry &#8804;93% or breathing rate &#8805;30â breaths·min-1) or rapid clinical worsening. Multivariable analysis was performed using Firth penalised maximum likelihood estimates. RESULTS: 162 (46.4%) patients underwent CTPA (mean±sd age 65.6±13.0â years; 67.3% male (95% CI 59.5-75.5%). PE was diagnosed in 44 (27.2%) patients. Most PEs were segmental and the rate of PE-related right ventricular dysfunction was 15.9%. By multivariable analysis, the only two significant predictors of CTPA-confirmed PE were D-dimer level and the lack of any anticoagulant therapy (OR 4.0 (95% CI 2.4-6.7) per additional quartile and OR 4.5 (95% CI 1.1-7.4), respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a D-dimer cut-off value of 2590â ng·mL-1 to best predict occurrence of PE (area under the curve 0.88, p<0.001, sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 83.8%). D-dimer level >2590â ng·mL-1 was associated with a 17-fold increase in the adjusted risk of PE. CONCLUSION: Elevated D-dimers (>2590â ng·mL-1) and absence of anticoagulant therapy predict PE in hospitalised COVID-19 patients with clinical signs of severity. These data strengthen the evidence base in favour of systematic anticoagulation, and suggest wider use of D-dimer guided CTPA to screen for PE in acutely ill hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Mouhat, Basile; Besutti, Matthieu; Bouiller, Kevin; Grillet, Franck; Monnin, Charles; Ecarnot, Fiona; Behr, Julien; Capellier, Gilles; Soumagne, Thibaud; Pili-Floury, Sébastien; Besch, Guillaume; Mourey, Guillaume; Lepiller, Quentin; Chirouze, Catherine; Schiele, François; Chopard, Romain; Meneveau, Nicolas",Eur. respir. j,410,10

METHODS: Psychiatric outpatient visits and patient diagnostic information were extracted from the EHR(electronic health records) of a Korean tertiary hospital during 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and 3 months before the COVID-19 outbreak. Visit rates of psychiatric outpatients according to primary psychiatric diagnosis category before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were compared using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model. The temporal associations between the number of daily outpatient visits and the daily number of newly confirmed cases were examined by time-series analysis within each diagnosis category. RESULTS: Total daily outpatient visit rate was significantly reduced during the pandemic. Among the nine most prevalent diagnosis categories, the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were significantly reduced by about 29.8%, 14.8%, and 13.3% respectively. Time-series analysis showed significant temporal correlations between the daily number of newly confirmed cases and the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, whereas patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders showed no significant temporal association. LIMITATIONS: Potential confounding factors unrelated to the pandemic might have influenced the results. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that patients with anxiety or depressive disorders may have concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19, and may be more reluctant to visit psychiatry outpatient clinics.

Of the many recognized drug targets of SARS-CoV-2, the main protease is one of the most important target due to its function in viral replication. We conducted an in silico study with repurposing drugs of antibiotics class against virus protease and peptidase using AutoDock tool. The following significant binding energy interaction was observed with protease (PDB: 6LU7) like piperacillin -7.25; tobramycin -9.20 and doxorubicin (Doxo) -10.04 kcal/mol and with peptidase (PDB: 2GTB) piperacillin -7.08; tobramycin -8.54 and Doxo -9.89 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the interaction and stability behavior of the Doxo-protease and Doxo-peptidase complexes were analyzed for a 100-nanosecond (ns) time. Calculated RMSD values observed using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were found to be 0.15-0.25 nm, RMSF calculation per residues showed a value near 0.2 nm and Rg values remained approximately 2.25 nm. MM-PBSA analysis of total binding energy calculation of Doxo-protease and Doxo-peptidase complexes are found to be -148.692 and -105.367 kJ/mol, respectively. Moreover, amino acid residue ASP-197 showed the lowest contribution binding energy i.e. -18.1185 kJ/mol, and amino acid residue ASP-187 showed -17.0267 kJ/mol contribution energy. Thus, significant docking interaction and stable dynamicity of Doxo-protease complex with time was suggested that Doxo could be a choice to inhibit potentially the viral proteases that could prevent the entry inside the host cell to control the COVID-19 disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A great interest is currently directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure. All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system (RAAS) in which ACE 2 plays a central role. In the last few days, much confusion has appeared about the management of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in infected patients and in those at risk of critical illness in case of infection.

Compared to organic fluorophores, the narrower emission band and wider absorption bands of QDs offer great advantages in cell imaging and biosensor applications. The optoelectronic features of QDs have prompted their intensive use in bioanalytical, biophysical, and biomedical research. As the nanomaterials have been integrated into microfluidic systems, microfluidic technology has accelerated the adaptation of nanomaterials to clinical evaluation together with the advantages such as being more economical, more reproducible, and more susceptible to modification and integration with other technologies. Microfluidic systems serve an important role by being a platform in which QDs are integrated for biosensing applications. As we combine the advantages of QDs and microfluidic technology for biosensing technology, QD-based biosensor integrated with microfluidic systems can be used as an advanced and versatile diagnostic technology in case of pandemic. Specifically, there is an urgent necessity to have reliable and fast detection systems for COVID-19 virus.

To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical decision is the extent to which policy makers rely on voluntary as opposed to enforced compliance, and nations vary along this dimension. While enforcement may secure higher compliance, there is experimental and other evidence that it may also crowd out voluntary motivation. How does enforcement affect citizens' support for anti-COVID-19 policies? A survey conducted with 4,799 respondents toward the end of the first lockdown in Germany suggests that a substantial share of the population will support measures more under voluntary than under enforced implementation. Negative responses to enforcement-termed control aversion-vary across the nature of the policy intervention (e.g., they are rare for masks and frequent for vaccination and a cell-phone tracing app). Control aversion is less common among those with greater trust in the government and the information it provides, and among those who were brought up under the coercive regime of East Germany. Taking account of the likely effectiveness of enforcement and the extent to which near-universal compliance is crucial, the differing degrees of opposition to enforcement across policies suggest that for some anti-COVID-19 policies an enforced mandate would be unwise, while for others it would be essential. Similar reasoning may also be relevant for policies to address future pandemics and other societal challenges like climate change.","Schmelz, Katrin",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A,410,4

This study examines the prevalence and factors associated with shortages of NH staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: We obtained self-reported information on staff shortages, resident and staff exposure to COVID-19, and PPE availability from a survey conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in May 2020. Multivariate logistic regressions of staff shortages with state fixed-effects were conducted to examine the effect of COVID-19 factors in NHs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 11,920 free-standing NHs. MEASURES: The dependent variables were self-reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other ancillary staff. We controlled for NH characteristics from the most recent Nursing Home Compare and Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, market characteristics from Area Health Resources File, and state Medicaid reimbursement calculated from Truven data. RESULTS: Of the 11,920 NHs, 15.9%, 18.4%, 2.5%, and 9.8% reported shortages of licensed nurse staff, nurse aides, clinical staff, and other staff, respectively. Georgia and Minnesota reported the highest rates of shortages in licensed nurse and nurse aides (both >25%). Multivariate regressions suggest that shortages in licensed nurses and nurse aides were more likely in NHs having any resident with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.44, 1.60, respectively) and any staff with COVID-19 (AOR = 1.37, 1.34, respectively). Having 1-week supply of PPE was associated with lower probability of staff shortages. NHs with a higher proportion of Medicare residents were less likely to experience shortages. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Abundant staff shortages were reported by NHs and were mainly driven by COVID-19 factors. In the absence of appropriate staff, NHs may be unable to fulfill the requirement of infection control even under the risk of increased monetary penalties.","Xu, Huiwen; Intrator, Orna; Bowblis, John R",J Am Med Dir Assoc,410,14

Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing.

RESULTS: The 'impression of exhaustion and fear', 'feeling the unfairness', 'perceiving incompetence in rescue task' and 'unexpected professional benefits' were the main factors affecting the professional identity of rescue nurses. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that special attention and targeted support measures should be provided to improve the professional identity of rescue nurses. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers should make a post-epidemic recovery plan to help nurses to improve the professional identity. Designed education programmes and complete disaster response system should be developed to deal with infection disease in the future.","Sheng, Qingqing; Zhang, Xi; Wang, Xinyu; Cai, Chunfeng",J. nurs. manag,410,21

We use the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study (2008-2012), based on a random sample of 1,003 women ages 18-19 residing in a Michigan county. Women were interviewed weekly for 2.5 years, resulting in an age range of 18-22. We test three sets of hypotheses about change over time within a relationship, using relationship-level within-between models, which compare a couple's contraceptive behaviors across different times in the relationship. First, we find that a couple is less likely to use contraception when the relationship is more intimate and/or committed and that a couple becomes less likely to use contraception over time, regardless of intimacy and commitment. Second, we find that a couple using contraception becomes increasingly likely to choose hormonal over coital methods, but this change occurs as a relationship endures and is unrelated to intimacy and/or commitment. Third, we find that a condom-using couple's consistency does not decline when there is conflict; rather, consistency of condom use declines over time regardless of the relationship's characteristics. We also demonstrate that conflict and power imbalance increase reliance on hormonal methods among those using contraception; conflict decreases consistency among withdrawal (but not condom) users; and nonmonogamy increases reliance on condoms and decreases withdrawal consistency. The strong and consistent link between duration and contraceptive behaviors-regardless of intimacy, commitment, conflict, or power imbalance-suggests that the continual vigilance required for long-term contraceptive use is difficult during early emerging adulthood.","Kusunoki, Yasamin; Barber, Jennifer S",DemographyDemography,410,10

Healthcare professionals and students have a key role in shaping public opinion about vaccines. This study aimed to evaluate the attitudes of dental students globally towards COVID-19 vaccines and explore the potential drivers for students' acceptance levels. METHODS: A global cross-sectional study was carried out in February 2021 using an online questionnaire. The study was liaised by the scientific committee of the International Association of Dental Students (IADS), and data were collected through the national and local coordinators of IADS member organizations. The dependent variable was the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine, and the independent variables included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experience, and the drivers of COVID-19 vaccine-related attitude suggested by the WHO SAGE. RESULTS: A total of 6639 students from 22 countries, representing all world regions, responded to the questionnaire properly. Their mean age was 22.1 +/- 2.8 (17-40) years, and the majority were females (70.5%), in clinical years (66.8%), and from upper-middle-income economies (45.7%). In general, 22.5% of dental students worldwide were hesitant, and 13.9% rejected COVID-19 vaccines. The students in low- and lower-middle-income (LLMI) economies had significantly higher levels of vaccine hesitancy compared to their peers in upper-middle- and high-income (UMHI) economies (30.4% vs. 19.8%;p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The global acceptance level of dental students for COVID-19 vaccines was suboptimal, and their worrisome level of vaccine hesitancy was influenced by the socioeconomic context where the dental students live and study. The media and social media, public figures, insufficient knowledge about vaccines, and mistrust of governments and the pharmaceutical industry were barriers to vaccination. The findings of this study call for further implementation of epidemiology (infectious diseases) education within undergraduate dental curricula.","Riad, A.; Abdulqader, H.; Morgado, M.; Domnori, S.; Koscik, M.; Mendes, J.

Adjunctive vein of Marshall (VOM) ethanol infusion (VOM-Et) can facilitate acute MI block. However, little is known regarding its long-term success. This study sought to evaluate the impact of adjunctive VOM-Et on MI block achievement and durability compared to RFCA alone. Methods - Patients undergoing a first attempt of posterior MI ablation were grouped according to their MI block index strategy: adjunctive VOM-Et and RFCA alone. Rates of acute MI block and MI reconnection observed during repeat procedures were compared between the two groups. Results - The VOM-Et group consisted of 152 patients (63.8 ± 9.4 years) undergoing adjunctive VOM-Et for MI block. The RFCA group consisted of 110 patients (60.9 ± 9.2 years) undergoing MI ablation using RFCA alone. Acute MI block was more frequently achieved in the VOM-Et group (98.7% [150/152] vs. 63.6% [70/110]; p < 0.001) with shorter RFCA duration (5.00 [3.00-7.00] vs. 19.0 [13.6-22.0] mins; p < 0.001). Of the 220 patients with MI block achieved during the index procedure, 81 underwent a repeat procedure during follow-up (VOM-Et group: 23.3% [35/150] vs. RFCA group: 65.7% [46/70], respectively; p < 0.001). A significantly greater number of patients exhibited durable MI block in the VOM-Et group (62.9% [22/35] vs. 32.6% [15/46], respectively; p = 0.008). Conclusions - Beyond facilitating acute MI block, VOM-Et is associated with greater lesion durability as evidenced by higher rates of MI block during repeat procedures.","Nakashima, Takashi; Pambrun, Thomas; Vlachos, Konstantinos; Goujeau, Cyril; André, Clémentine; Krisai, Philipp; Ramirez, F Daniel; Kamakura, Tsukasa; Takagi, Takamitsu; Nakatani, Yosuke; Kitamura, Takeshi; Takigawa, Masateru; Roux, Jean-Rodolphe; Cheniti, Ghassen; Tixier, Romain; Chauvel, Remi; Welte, Nicolas; Duchateau, Josselin; Sacher, Frédéric; Cochet, Hubert; Hocini, Mélèze; Haïssaguerre, Michel; Jaïs, Pierre; Derval, Nicolas",Circ.

They are protected by the respiratory epithelium and immune cells to maintain a dynamic balance. Both innate and adaptive immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subset of unconventional T cells, which have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Although MAIT cells account for a small part of the total immune cells in the lungs, evidence suggests that these cells are activated by T cell receptors and/or cytokine receptors and mediate immune response. They play an important role in immunosurveillance and immunity against microbial infection, and recent studies have shown that subsets of MAIT cells play a role in promoting pulmonary inflammation. Emerging data indicate that MAIT cells are involved in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and possible immunopathogenesis in COVID-19. Here, we introduce MAIT cell biology to clarify their role in the immune response. Then we review MAIT cells in human and murine lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer, and discuss their possible protective and pathological effects.

Echocardiography may provide useful insights into COVID-19 physiopathology. METHODS: Twenty-three COVID-19 patients were enrolled in a medical ward. Gas exchange, transthoracic echocardiographic, and hemodynamic variables were collected. RESULTS: Mean age was 57 ± 17 years. The patients were hypoxemic (PaO2 /FiO2 = 273.0 ± 102.6 mmHg) and mildly hypocapnic (PaCO2 = 36.2 ± 6.3 mmHg, pH = 7.45 ± 0.03). Mean arterial pressure was decreased (86.7 [80.0-88.3] mmHg). Cardiac index was elevated (4.32 ± 0.90 Lâmin-1 âm-2 ) and the resulting systemic vascular resistance index low (1,458 [1358-1664] dynâsâcm-5 âm-2 ). The right heart was morphologically and functionally normal, with pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm, 18.0 ± 2.9 mmHg) and Total Pulmonary Resistances (TPR, 2.3 [2.1-2.7] mmHgâl-1 âmin-1 ) within normal limits. When stratifying for SVRI, patients with an SVRI value below the cohort median had also more severe oxygenation impairment and lower TPR, despite a similar degree of CXR infiltrates. Oxygen delivery index in this group resulted supranormal. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stages of COVID-19 infection the hemodynamic profile is characterized by a hyperdynamic circulatory state with high CI and low SVRI, while the right heart is functionally unaffected. Our findings suggest that hypoxemia, viral sepsis or peripheral shunting are possible mechanisms for the vasodilation that dominates at this stage of the disease and may itself worsen the gas exchange.","Busana, Mattia; Schiavone, Marco; Lanfranchi, Antonio; Battista Forleo, Giovanni; Ceriani, Elisa; Beatrice Cogliati, Chiara; Gasperetti, Alessio",Physiol Rep,410,1

This disease has spread to 215 nations, affecting a diverse variety of persons. It was formally called extreme acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease, by the World Health Organization as a pandemic. This pandemic forced countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to avoid its widespread presence. This study focuses on how the pollution of particulate matter during the coronavirus pandemic in the period from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 was reduced compared to the pre-pandemic situation in the country. The improvement in air quality and atmosphere due to the coronavirus pandemic in Pakistan was identified by both ground-based and satellite observations with a primary focus on the four provincial capitals and country capitals, namely, Peshawar, Karachi, Quetta, Lahore, and Islamabad, and statistically verified through paired Student's t test. Both datasets have shown a significant decrease in the levels of PM2.5 pollutions across Pakistan (ranging from 15 to 35% for satellite observations, while 27 to 61% for ground-based observations). The result shows that poor air quality is one of the key factors for a higher COVID-19 spread rate in major Pakistani cities. By extending the same investigation across the nation, there is a greater need to investigate the connections between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, both higher population density rates and frequent population exposure can be partially attributed to increased levels of PM2.5 concentrations before the pandemic of the coronavirus.","Khan, Yousaf Ali",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Given the contemporary limitations of the supply chain, it is imperative to identify effective means of decontaminating, reusing, and thereby conserving N95 respirator stockpiles. To be effective, decontamination must result in sterilization of the N95 respirator without impairment of respirator filtration or user fit. Although numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist, none are universally accessible. In this work, we describe a microwave-generated steam decontamination protocol for N95 respirators for use in health care systems of all sizes, geographies, and means. Using widely available glass containers, mesh from commercial produce bags, a rubber band, and a 1,100-W commercially available microwave, we constructed an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators. Employing this methodology against MS2 phage, a highly conservative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination, we report an average 6-log10 plaque-forming unit (PFU) (99.9999%) and a minimum 5-log10 PFU (99.999%) reduction after a single 3-min microwave treatment. Notably, quantified respirator fit and function were preserved, even after 20 sequential cycles of microwave steam decontamination. This method provides a valuable means of effective decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators by frontline providers facing urgent need.IMPORTANCE Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is an increasing shortage of protective gear necessary to keep health care providers safe from infection. As of 9 April 2020, the CDC reported 9,282 cumulative cases of COVID-19 among U.S. health care workers (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 69:477-481, 2020, https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6915e6). N95 respirators are recommended by the CDC as the ideal method of protection from COVID-19. Although N95 respirators are traditionally single use, the shortages have necessitated the need for reuse. Effective methods of N95 decontamination that do not affect the fit or filtration ability of N95 respirators are essential. Numerous methods of N95 decontamination exist; however, none are universally accessible. In this study, we describe an effective, standardized, and reproducible means of decontaminating N95 respirators using widely available materials. The N95 decontamination method described in this work will provide a valuable resource for hospitals, health care centers, and outpatient practices that are experiencing increasing shortages of N95 respirators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zulauf, Katelyn E; Green, Alex B; Nguyen Ba, Alex N; Jagdish, Tanush; Reif, Dvir; Seeley, Robert; Dale, Alana; Kirby, James E",mBio (Online),410,16

One technology involves co-location tracking through mobile Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth to permit health agencies to monitor people's contact with each other, thereby triggering targeted social-distancing when a person turns out to be infected. The effectiveness of tracking relies on the willingness of the population to support such privacy encroaching measures. We report the results of two large surveys in the United Kingdom, conducted during the peak of the pandemic, that probe people's attitudes towards various tracking technologies. The results show that by and large there is widespread acceptance for co-location tracking. Acceptance increases when the measures are explicitly time-limited and come with opt-out clauses or other assurances of privacy. Another possible future technology to control the pandemic involves ""immunity passports"", which could be issued to people who carry antibodies for the COVID-19 virus, potentially implying that they are immune and therefore unable to spread the virus to other people. Immunity passports have been considered as a potential future step to manage the pandemic.

As seen in many other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also shows respiratory infection, but the basic reproductive number (R0) in transmission and the clinical latency are quite dissimilar from those of SARS-or MERS-CoVs. Many scientists infer that the time point of cross-barrier transfer from bats to mediate animals or to humans should be a rather recent event based on the full-length genome analyses obtained from the very first patients.

METHODS: From 1 to 22 March 2020, patients with pneumonia symptoms, positive lung CT scan, and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were consecutively enrolled. Clinical data was collected. Outcome was defined as favourable or adverse (i.e., need for mechanical ventilation or death) and registered over a period of 10 days following CT. Volume of disease (VoD) on CT was calculated semi-automatically. Multiple linear regression was used to predict VoD by clinical/laboratory data. To predict outcome, important features were selected using a priori analysis and subsequently used to train 4 different models. RESULTS: A total of 106 consecutive patients were enrolled (median age 63.5 years, range 26-95 years; 41/106 women, 38.7%).

In this work, we propose a mathematical framework for optimal stabilizing vaccine allocation, where our goal is to send the infections to zero as soon as possible with a fixed number of vaccine doses. This framework allows us to efficiently compute the optimal vaccine allocation policy for general epidemic spread models including SIS/SIR/SEIR and a new model of COVID-19 transmissions. By fitting the real data in New York State to our framework, we found that the optimal stabilizing vaccine allocation policy suggests offering vaccines priority to locations where there are more susceptible people and where the residents spend longer time outside the home. Besides, we found that offering vaccines priority to young adults (20-29) and middle-age adults (20-44) can minimize the cumulative infected cases and the death cases. Moreover, we compared our method with five age-stratified strategies in \cite{bubar2021model} based on their epidemics model. We also found it's better to offer vaccine priorities to young people to curb the disease and minimize the deaths when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is moderately above one, which describes the most world during COVID-19.

Recently, associations between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity and mortality have been reported in adults, while no reports are available in pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality, severity, clinical, and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood in 96 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19. Among all patients, 6 (6%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Out of the six patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, four (67%) had a severe form of the disease, and two out of the 6 patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia passed away (33%). Our results show that the symptoms more commonly found in the cases of COVID-19 in the study (fever, cough, tachypnea, and vomiting), were found at a higher percentage in the patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Creatine phosphokinase and magnesium tests showed significant differences between the positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia groups. Among all laboratory tests, magnesium and creatine phosphokinase could better predict SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with area under the curve levels of 0.808 and 0.748, respectively. In conclusion, 67% of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia showed a severe COVID-19 and one-third of the patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia passed away. Our findings suggest that magnesium and creatine phosphokinase might be considered as markers to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia.","Pourakbari, Babak; Mahmoudi, Shima; Mahmoudieh, Yasmine; Eshaghi, Hamid; Navaeian, Amene; Rostamyan, Maryam; Mamishi, Setareh",J Med Virol,410,16

BACKGROUND: Today, with the development of complex health systems, diplomacy in health care can take place at organizational, national and international levels. INTRODUCTION: Diplomacy's role is to convince others peacefully to achieve goals. Diplomacy in nursing can facilitate professional development and direct policy and decision-making process towards the development of a healthcare system. METHODS: The study used a qualitative descriptive approach. The sampling method was purposeful, and data were collected via in-depth, unstructured and face-to-face interviews with 16 participants. The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed through conventional content analysis based on Graneheim and Lundman's work. RESULTS: In total, 212 codes were generated, which were grouped into three main categories, namely paradigmatic socio-political changes (two subcategories), nurses' dissatisfaction with their status in healthcare system (two subcategories) and multidimensional development of the nursing profession (four subcategories). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Socio-political changes, development of the nursing profession and nurses' dissatisfaction with the health system have led to the emergence of diplomacy roles in nurse managers, the recognition and development of which can improve the effectiveness of nurse managers in policymaking. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING & HEALTH POLICY: The recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has demonstrated the urgent need to use diplomacy to solve health problems and adjust or develop policymaking at the national and international levels. Strengthening their role in diplomacy, nurse managers can play an important role as diplomats at various levels of policymaking and in health crisis management.","Sharafi, Simin; Cheraghi, Mohammad Ali; Nasiri, Ahmad; Mahmoudirad, Gholamhossein",Int. nurs. rev,410,16

We seek to emulate the drying, flow and precipitation dynamics of such air borne mucosalivary droplets. Observations with the surrogate fluid are validated by similar experiments with actual samples from a healthy subject. A unique feature emerges with regards to the final crystallite dimension; it is always 20-30% of the initial droplet diameter for different sizes and ambient conditions. The preserved precipitates from levitated droplets show that 15% of the total virion population remain dispersed on the outer surface of air-desiccated air borne nuclei.

Classical compartmental models are useful, however, likely oversimplify the complexity when studying epidemics. This study aimed to develop a multi-regional, hierarchical-tier mathematical model for better understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of COVID-19 spread and control. By incorporating the epidemiological and population flow data, we have successfully constructed a multi-regional, hierarchical-tier SLIHR model. With this model, we revealed insight into how COVID-19 was spread from the epicenter Wuhan to other regions in Mainland China based on the large population flow network data. By comprehensive analysis of the effects of different control measures, we identified that Level 1 emergency response, community prevention and application of big data tools significantly correlate with the effectiveness of local epidemic containment across different provinces of China outside the epicenter. In conclusion, our multi-regional, hierarchical-tier SLIHR model revealed insight into how COVID-19 spread from the epicenter Wuhan to other regions of China, and the subsequent control of local epidemics. These findings bear important implications for many other countries and regions to better understand and respond to their local epidemics associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Qinyue; Wang, Xinwei; Bao, Chunbing; Ji, Yunpeng; Liu, Hua; Meng, Qingchun; Pan, Qiuwei",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Attachment is the first step in viral life cycle, which is dependent on the interactions of virions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Studying this process will help in understanding virus infection and controlling viral diseases. In this study, the roles of primary ECM components in TFV attachment were investigated. The results on the kinetics of virus attachment showed successful TFV attachment to the cell surface as a relatively rapid process after the TFV was used to inoculate cells for 10â¯minâ¯at 4â¯°C. Western blot and quantitative PCR analysis results showed that soluble fibronectin, collagen IV, laminin, or hyaluronic acid treatment with TFV caused no significant effect on virus attachment. Soluble heparin, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A/B could inhibit TFV attachment in a dose-dependent manner. Enzymic digestion by cell surface heparin/heparan sulfate using heparinase I, II, and III could significantly prevent TFV attachment, suggesting that heparan sulfate plays an important role in TFV attachment. Furthermore, the binding assays of heparin-agarose beads and virion showed that TFV virions specifically bound with heparin in a dose-dependent manner. Given that heparin is a structural analogue of heparan sulfate, the above results suggest that heparan sulfate might serve as an attachment factor of TFV infection. Our work would be beneficial to understand the mechanisms of TFV attachment and the interactions of TFV with cellular receptors.","Liu, Chang; Qin, Xiao-Wei; He, Jian; Weng, Shao-Ping; He, Jian-Guo; Guo, Chang-Jun",Fish shellfish immunol,410,14

In the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage Phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of Phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for EBOV and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1 cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels; a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a slower rate on all materials under low AH conditions with a decay rate of 0.06 log10PFU/d to 0.11 log10PFU/d, as compared to the higher AH conditions with a decay rate of 0.65 log10PFU/h to 1.42 log10PFU/d. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and non-porous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, Phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low AH conditions, in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi6 under similar conditions, therefore Phi6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in healthcare facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated western indoor hospital conditions, Phi 6 was used to assess suitability as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.","Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura",,410,26

Higher odds of readmission were observed in patients age >60 vs. 1840 (odds ratio [OR]=1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.48, 2.50), and admitted in the Northeast vs. West (OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.14, 1.79) or South (OR=1.28, 95% CI=1.11, 1.49). Comorbidities including diabetes (OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.12, 1.60), CVD (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.23, 1.72), CKD stage 1-5 (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.25,1.81) and stage 5 (OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.81, 2.86) were associated with higher odds of readmission. 12.3% of readmitted patients died during second hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Among this large US population of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, readmission was associated with certain comorbidities and acute conditions during first hospitalization. These findings may inform strategies to mitigate risks of readmission due to COVID-19 complications.","Verna, Elizabeth C; Landis, Charles; Brown, Robert S; Mospan, Andrea R; Crawford, Julie M; Hildebrand, Janet S; Morris, Heather L; Munoz, Breda; Fried, Michael W; Reddy, K Rajender",Clin. infect. dis,410,1

Recently, various studies demonstrate that the increased activity of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) causes health benefits in energy regulation. Thus, great efforts have been made to develop AMPK activators as a metabolic syndrome treatment. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the AMPK activator C24 on dyslipidemia and the potential mechanisms. We showed that C24 (5-40 µM) dose-dependently increased the phosphorylation of AMPK&#945; and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and inhibited lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. Using compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or hepatocytes isolated from liver tissue-specific AMPK knockout AMPK&#945;1&#945;2fl/fl;Alb-cre mice (AMPK LKO), we demonstrated that the lipogenesis inhibition of C24 was dependent on hepatic AMPK activation. In rabbits with high-fat and high-cholesterol diet-induced dyslipidemia, administration of C24 (20, 40, and 60 mg · kg-1· d-1, ig, for 4 weeks) dose-dependently decreased the content of TG, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in plasma and played a role in protecting against hepatic dysfunction by decreasing lipid accumulation. A lipid-lowering effect was also observed in high-fat and high-cholesterol diet-fed hamsters. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the small molecular AMPK activator C24 alleviates hyperlipidemia and represents a promising compound for the development of a lipid-lowering drug.","Sun, Shui-Mei; Xie, Zhi-Fu; Zhang, Yang-Ming; Zhang, Xin-Wen; Zhou, Chen-Dong; Yin, Jian-Peng; Yu, Yan-Yan; Cui, Shi-Chao; Jiang, Hao-Wen; Li, Teng-Teng; Li, Jia; Nan, Fa-Jun; Li, Jing-Ya",Acta pharmacol.

Materials and methods We described some critical changes in our routine to minimize the COVID infection among patients and healthcare workers. From March 1st to May 25th, 2020, we described our actions and surgical outcomes of patients treated in our center during the pandemic. Results Preventing hospital visits, we implemented some modifications in our office routine in terms of patient appointment, follow up, and management of non-surgical candidates. In this period, 147 patients underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) without intraoperative complications. The median operative time and blood loss were 91 minutes (IQR= 25) and 50 ml (IQR= 50), respectively. The median hospitalization time was 15.8 hours (IQR= 2.5). None of the patients of our study had COVID in the postoperative follow-up, and only two patients were rescheduled due to a positive rapid COVID test one day before surgery. The final pathology described 10 patients (6.8%) Grade Group (GrGp) 1, 34 (23.1%) GrGp 2, 31(21%) GrGp 3, 16(10.8%) GrGp 4, 37 (25.3%) GrGp 5, and 19 (13%) with deferred Gleason. Two patients, COVID negative, were readmitted due to infected lymphocele managed with antibiotic and Interventional Radiology drainage. Conclusion Our experience managing patients with prostate cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that changing the office routine, stratifying the patients according to the NCCN risk, and adopting COVID-based criteria to select patients for surgery are necessary actions to maintain the best quality of treatment and minimize the viral infection among our oncological patients. In our routine, the RARP during the COVID pandemic is safe and feasible for patients and healthcare workers if the necessary precautions described in this article are taken.","Covas Moschovas, Marcio; Bhat, Seetharam; Rogers, Travis Phillip; Onol, Fikret Fatih; Roof, Shannon; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara; Rocco, Bernardo; Patel, Vipul",J. endourol,410,14

Prognostic tools may be useful in crisis conditions as risk stratification can help determine resource allocation. One published tool, the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage Severity Score, seems particularly promising because of its predictive ability and ease of application at the bedside. We sought to understand the performance of a modified version of this score (mPRIEST) in our institution for identifying patients with a greater than minimal risk for adverse outcome (death or organ support) at 30 days after index visit. METHODS: Consecutive visits at two northern Manhattan EDs with a new diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 were identified between November and December of 2020. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics were obtained from chart review. Outcomes were obtained from chart review and follow-up phone call. RESULTS: Outcomes were available on 306 patients. The incidence of death or mechanical ventilation at 30 days for patients in patients with mPRIEST above the threshold value was 43/181 (23.8%), and for patients below 1/125 (0.8%). The sensitivity of the score for adverse outcome was 97.7% (95% CI: 93.3% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests the mPRIEST score, which can be calculated from clinical variables alone, has potential for use in EDs to identify patients at very low risk for adverse outcomes within 30 days of COVID diagnosis. This should be confirmed in larger formal validation studies in diverse settings.","Suh, Edward H; Lang, Kendrick J; Zerihun, Lillian M",Am J Emerg Med,410,16

In this article, we provide a commentary on challenges and dilemmas identified in the response to COVID-19 for care homes and their residents. We highlight the low sensitivity of PCR testing and the difficulties this poses for blanket screening and isolation of residents. We discuss quarantine of residents and the potential harms associated with this. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply for care homes during the pandemic has been suboptimal and we suggest that better integration of procurement and supply is required. Advance care planning has been challenged by the pandemic and there is a need to for healthcare staff to provide support to care homes with this. Finally, we discuss measures to implement augmented care in care homes, including treatment with oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and the frameworks which will be required if these are to be sustainable. All of these challenges must be met by healthcare, social care and government agencies if care home residents and staff are to be physically and psychologically supported during this time of crisis for care homes.","Gordon, Adam L; Goodman, Claire; Achterberg, Wilco; Barker, Robert O; Burns, Eileen; Hanratty, Barbara; Martin, Finbarr C; Meyer, Julienne; O039,; Neill, Desmond; Schols, Jos; Spilsbury, Karen",Age ageing,410,24

Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and-importantly-some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%-80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. CONCLUSIONS: With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year's flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.","Adil Mahmoud Yousif, Nessma; Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian Junior; Ngucho Mbeutchou, Yvan Jordan; Kwamou Ngaha, Sandy Frank; Kayanula, Loyce; Kamanga, George; Ibrahim, Toheeb Babatunde; Bwanu Iliya, Patience; Iyanda, Sulyman; Alawam Nemer, Looli; Helle, Kristina Barbara; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda Ijang; Schneider, Kristan Alexander",PLoS One,410,1

The objective of this study is to test a machine-learning (ML) method based on radiomics features extracted from chest CT images for screening COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The study is carried out on two groups of patients, including 138 patients with confirmed and 140 patients with suspected COVID-19. We focus on distinguishing pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from the suspected cases by segmentation of whole lung volume and extraction of 86 radiomics features. Followed by feature extraction, nine feature-selection procedures are used to identify valuable features. Then, ten ML classifiers are applied to classify and predict COVID-19 cases. Each ML models is trained and tested using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The predictive performance of each ML model is evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy. RESULTS: The range of accuracy and AUC is from 0.32 (recursive feature elimination [RFE]+Multinomial Naive Bayes [MNB] classifier) to 0.984 (RFE+bagging [BAG], RFE+decision tree [DT] classifiers) and 0.27 (mutual information [MI]+MNB classifier) to 0.997 (RFE+k-nearest neighborhood [KNN] classifier), respectively. There is no direct correlation among the number of the selected features, accuracy, and AUC, however, with changes in the number of the selected features, the accuracy and AUC values will change. Feature selection procedure RFE+BAG classifier and RFE+DT classifier achieve the highest prediction accuracy (accuracy: 0.984), followed by MI+Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and logistic regression (LGR)+DT classifiers (accuracy: 0.976).

As the world mobilizes to contain the COVID-19, scientists and public health experts are increasingly alarmed about the potentially catastrophic effects of an outbreak in Africa. The establishment of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention by the Africa Union in 2017 was an unprecedented move toward strengthening national responses, so far enabling all fifty member states with confirmed cases of COVID-19 to adequately respond, break chains of transmission and effectively contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We enter an uncertain and challenging period that may severely test the preparedness, organizational resource and resilience of African states and the fabric of their societies. However, we speculate that the fear associated with COVID-19 may also lead to some of the long-standing messages about simple measures to reduce the spread, such as hand washing, finally becoming absorbed and more universally adopted by health workers and the public. Is it possible that regardless of the terrible threat posed by SARS-CoV-2, the increased adoption of these health protection measures may result in a reduction in the spread of other infectious diseases?","Wadoum, Raoul Emeric Guetiya; Clarke, Andrew",Pan Afr Med J,410,16

The epidemiological relationship between carceral facilities and community health during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, remains largely unexamined. Using data from Cook County Jail, we examine temporal patterns in the relationship between jail cycling (i.e., arrest and processing of individuals through jails before release) and community cases of COVID-19 in Chicago ZIP codes. We use multivariate regression analyses and a machine-learning tool, elastic regression, with 1,706 demographic control variables. We find that for each arrested individual cycled through Cook County Jail in March 2020, five additional cases of COVID-19 in their ZIP code of residence are independently attributable to the jail as of August. A total 86% of this additional disease burden is borne by majority-Black and/or -Hispanic ZIPs, accounting for 17% of cumulative COVID-19 cases in these ZIPs, 6% in majority-White ZIPs, and 13% across all ZIPs. Jail cycling in March alone can independently account for 21% of racial COVID-19 disparities in Chicago as of August 2020. Relative to all demographic variables in our analysis, jail cycling is the strongest predictor of COVID-19 rates, considerably exceeding poverty, race, and population density, for example. Arrest and incarceration policies appear to be increasing COVID-19 incidence in communities. Our data suggest that jails function as infectious disease multipliers and epidemiological pumps that are especially affecting marginalized communities. Given disproportionate policing and incarceration of racialized residents nationally, the criminal punishment system may explain a large proportion of racial COVID-19 disparities noted across the United States.","Reinhart, Eric; Chen, Daniel L",Proc.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. RESULTS: The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.","Sun, Niuniu; Wei, Luoqun; Shi, Suling; Jiao, Dandan; Song, Runluo; Ma, Lili; Wang, Hongwei; Wang, Chao; Wang, Zhaoguo; You, Yanli; Liu, Shuhua; Wang, Hongyun",Am J Infect Control,410,24

To increase diagnostic capacity and reduce the risk of diagnostic delay, CT colonography (CTC) and colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) are increasingly being relied upon. Endoscopic assessment and treatment will be required for those patients with large colonic polyps or malignant tumours detected by CTC or CCE, provided they are fit enough to undergo further investigation. The management of patients with intermediate (6-9mm) and diminutive (<6mm) colonic polyps, reported by CTC and CCE, will increasingly be decided by clinicians. Published literature suggests the risk of progression to malignancy of intermediate or diminutive polyps over 3 years is low. Furthermore, the risk of intermediate or diminutive polyps harbouring malignancy is extremely low. The benefits, and timeline, for the removal of these polyps must be carefully considered for patients. We present a pragmatic approach to managing intermediate and diminutive polyps. We suggest delayed polypectomy (up to one year) for patients with intermediate polyps who are likely to benefit. For those patients with diminutive polyps, we advocate further surveillance only for younger patients where clinical concern exists. This meets the aspirations of Realistic Medicine, providing a risk-based approach for patients, while appropriately prioritising resources.","The ScotCap clinical leads, collaboration MacLeod C.; Mowat, C.; Winters, J.; Todd, J.; Ray, C.; Maxwell, F.; McKinley, A.; Noble, C.; Collins, P.; Wilson, L.; Cruikshank, N.; Hendry, P.; Leggett, G.; Fletcher, J.; Weber, B.; Moug, S.; Watson, A.

We tested the hypothesis that patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome are at higher risk of in-hospital mortality due to prolonged coma compared with other patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome matched for disease severity. DESIGN: Propensity-matched cohort study. SETTING: Seven ICUs in an academic hospital network, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). PATIENTS: All mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients between March and May 2020 were identified and matched with patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiology. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using clinical data obtained from a hospital registry, we matched 114 coronavirus disease 2019 patients to 228 noncoronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome patients based on baseline disease severity. Coma was identified using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale less than or equal to -3. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the percentage of comatose days, sedative medications used, and the association between coronavirus disease 2019 and in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality (48.3% vs 31.6%, adjusted odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.34-3.44; p = 0.002), the percentage of comatose days (66.0% ± 31.3% vs 36.0% ± 36.9%, adjusted difference, 29.35; 95% CI, 21.45-37.24; p < 0.001), and the hypnotic agent dose (51.3% vs 17.1% of maximum hypnotic agent dose given in the cohort; p < 0.001) were higher among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Brain imaging did not show a higher frequency of structural brain lesions in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (6.1% vs 7.0%; p = 0.76). Hypnotic agent dose was associated with coma (adjusted coefficient, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.78; p < 0.001) and mediated (p = 0.001) coma. Coma was associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 5.84; 95% CI, 3.58-9.58; p < 0.001) and mediated 59% of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with matched patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiology, patients with coronavirus disease 2019 received higher doses of hypnotics, which was associated with prolonged coma and higher mortality.","Wongtangman, Karuna; Santer, Peter; Wachtendorf, Luca J; Azimaraghi, Omid; Baedorf Kassis, Elias; Teja, Bijan; Murugappan, Kadhiresan R; Siddiqui, Shahla; Eikermann, Matthias",Crit. care med,410,1

Because of its lethality, it is important to understand the current strain's effects and mechanisms not only in the respiratory system, but in other affected organ systems as well. Past coronavirus outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV inflicted life-threatening acute kidney injuries (AKI) on their hosts leading to significant mortality rates, which went somewhat overlooked in the face of the severe respiratory effects. Recent evidence has emphasized renal involvement in SARS-CoV-2, stressing that kidneys are damaged in COVID-19 patients. The mechanism by which this virus inflicts AKI is still unclear, but evidence from other coronavirus strains may hold some clues. Two theories exist for the proposed mechanism of AKI: 1) the AKI is a secondary effect to reduced blood and oxygen levels causing hyperinflammation and 2) the AKI is due to cytotoxic effects. Kidneys express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 target receptor as well as collectrin, an ACE2 homologue, that localizes to the primary cilium, an organelle historically targeted by coronaviruses. While the available literature suggests that kidney damage is leading to higher mortality rates in COVID-19 patients, especially in those with pre-existing kidney and cardiovascular diseases, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still being investigated. Here, we present brief literature review supporting our proposed hypothesis of a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection and cilia.","Buqaileh, Raghad; Saternos, Hannah; Ley, Sidney; Aranda, Arianna; Forero, Kathleen; AbouAlaiwi, Wissam A",Physiol. genomics,410,24

This method for studying the activity of viroporins may facilitate screening for new antiviral drugs to identify novel treatments for COVID-19. ABSTRACT: The envelope (E) protein of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 is proposed to form an ion channel or viroporin that participates in viral propagation and pathogenesis. Here we developed a technique to study the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 in mammalian cells by directed targeting using a carboxyl-terminal fluorescent protein tag, mKate2. The wild-type SARS-CoV-2 E protein can be trafficked to intracellular organelles, notably the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex, where its expression increases pH inside the organelle. We also succeeded in targeting SARS-CoV-2 E to the plasma membrane, which enabled biophysical analysis using whole-cell patch clamp recording in a mammalian cell line, HEK 293 cells, and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes. The results suggest that the E protein forms an ion channel that is permeable to monovalent cations such as Na+ , Cs+ and K+ . The E current is nearly time- and voltage-independent when E protein is expressed in mammalian cells, and is modulated by changes of pH. At pH 6.0 and 7.4, the E protein current is activated, whereas at pH 8.0 and 9.0, the amplitude of E protein current is reduced, and in oocytes the inward E current fades at pH 9 in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. Using this directed targeting method and electrophysiological recordings, potential inhibitors of the E protein can be screened and subsequently investigated for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and possible efficacy in treating COVID-19.","Cabrera-Garcia, David; Bekdash, Ramsey; Abbott, Geoffrey W; Yazawa, Masayuki; Harrison, Neil L",J Physiol,410,16

To supplement the traditional text descriptions, figures, and lecture material we had students play the role of glomerular filtrate, gaining and losing osmolarity while moving through a simulated Loop of Henle. Students were given three poker chips, each representing an osmotic pressure of 100 milliosmolar (mOsm). Each student took a position at one of six steps on each side of a table. For each round, 1) students on the ?ascending? side conducted ?active transport? to produce a maximum gradient of 200 mOsm between the lumen of the ascending loop and the interstitial space (difference of 2 chips);2) after students ?pumped? their ions, students on the ?descending? side ?equilibrated? with the interstitial space by collecting chips from a cup until they had the same quantity as in the interstitial space;3) students then physically ?flowed? through the loop. This learning tool, which was highly effective in a face-to-face classroom, did not translate well to a remote environment. Despite spending an entire online class explaining the activity, students remained confused. Unlike in the classroom where everyone participates simultaneously and sees the process ?in real-time,? only one person could participate at any given time virtually, making it hard to visualize flow. To address this shortcoming we collaborated with two undergraduate students to develop a ?flipped? version of the CCM activity. In the online version the player 1) actively participates in CCM in ?freeplay? mode or 2) watches the process in ?simulation? mode. During freeplay, the player drags and drops icons representing solutes or water from the loop of Henle into the interstitial fluid to build the osmotic gradient;a color gradient associated with solute concentrations highlights how the gradient forms. Modeled after the in-person activity, the loop of Henle is divided into boxes, six on the ascending limb and six on the descending limb, where each box represents the positions of students in the original activity. To maximize engagement by minimizing repetitive dragging and dropping, the player is confined to one box at a time and is only responsible for adjusting the concentration of this ?home? box. If the player adjusts the concentration correctly, the player's home box moves one unit over to the adjacent box and thus ?flows? through the loop. Along the way, concentration shifts within other boxes are automated by the game engine. The freeplay game ends when the player's home box reaches the top of the ascending limb and exits the loop. In the simulation mode, the icons of solute and water move by themselves, and the osmotic gradient is created automatically. The player can watch the CCM process unimpeded and may pause or speed up the process as desired. We will pilot this interactive, online game in our Spring 2021 course and assess student learning with reflections, homework problems, and exam questions. We predict implementation of this game will enhance student understanding of the CCM mechanism in the mammalian kidney. All protocols were approved by Rice University IRB (Protocol FY2017-294).","Beason-Abmayr, Beth Arana Miguel Viol Andressa",The FASEB Journal,410,7

However, less clear is the role played by life stages (i.e., gender, marital status and parenthood) on telework behavior. This study investigated to which extent telework frequency associated with life stages, and how these associations could be explained based on the work-life conflict perspective. Representative data were obtained from German Microcensus 2010 (N = 188,081 participants). The outcome variable was measured as ordered telework participation levels (i.e., never, infrequently and frequently). After testing for multicollinearity, a zero-inflated ordered probit regression model was applied to assess the associations between telework and family-life stages, while adjusting for individual, household, job-related and environmental characteristics. Results suggest that life stages associate with telework behavior in a complex way. Three patterns have been distinguished. Specifically, irrespective of gender and marital status, parents are less likely to telework compared to those without children. Regarding individuals without children, single individuals are more likely to telework than married ones, and males more likely than females. In contrast, for individuals with children, the partnered parents are more likely to telework than single parents, and females more likely than males. Our findings suggest that as the most important feature in family-life stages, children play a vital role in telework behavior. It not only increases both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, but also triggers housework re-division within couples and aggravates gender differences. Policies that support formal childcare resources could relieve the family-to-work conflict and encourage people to work at home.","Zhang, Shihang; Moeckel, Rolf; Moreno, Ana Tsui; Shuai, Bin; Gao, Jie",Transp.

Medical education has benefitted from a rapid pace of innovation, but due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many paradigms underpinning the medical education of trainees shifted-rendering numerous teaching modalities unusable. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, accelerated the development of novel teaching methodologies, which our trainees are now adapting to. We sought to examine emerging teaching methodologies to understand the opportunities available for medical education to innovate our teaching practices for learners in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this narrative review, we drew upon the experiences of the authors as both life-long learners and educators. We then reviewed literature pertaining to novel teaching methodologies developed in medical education since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Several medical specialties have employed novel teaching methodologies including use of telemedicine, remote teaching, online curricula, virtual rotations, virtual conferences, simulations, and learning consortia to continue engaging trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of literature that addresses efficacy of novel teaching methodologies compared to more traditional teaching methodologies. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity for medical education to combine new and innovative teaching methodologies to create novel, accessible, and engaging learning opportunities for our trainees.","Ho, Patrick A; Girgis, Christina; Rustad, James K; Noordsy, Douglas; Stern, Theodore A",Prim. care companion CNS disord.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In vitro studies included in this study were identified from PubMed/MEDLINE, Lilacs, and Scopus databases up until March 2019, without limits on publication year or language. Two reviewers independently selected the studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias of all studies. A random effects model was used for pairwise meta-analyses (control vs. post-space preparation groups) at a significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS: Of the 2,832 potentially eligible studies, 453 studies were selected for full-text analysis, and 75 were included in this systematic review. Only one study was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, post-space treatment significantly improves the bond strength to root canal dentin (p<0.00001).

Many scholars have studied the institutional management of these incidents, but a qualitative study of stakeholders' perspectives on vaccine hesitancy in China is missing. To address this lacuna, we conducted in-depth interviews and collected online data to explore diverse stakeholders' narratives on vaccine hesitance. Our analysis shows the different perspectives of medical experts, journalists, parents, and self-defined vaccination victims on vaccination and vaccination hesitance. Medical experts generally consider vaccines, despite some flaws, as safe, and they consider most vaccine safety incidents to be related to coupling symptoms, not to vaccinations. Some parents agree with medical experts, but most do not trust vaccine safety and do not want to put their children at risk. Media professionals, online medical experts, and doctors who do not need to align with the political goal of maintaining a high vaccination rate are less positive about vaccination and consider vaccine hesitance a failure of expert-lay communication in China. Our analysis exhibits the tensions of medical expert and lay perspectives on vaccine hesitance, and suggests that vaccination experts 'see like a state', which is a finding consistent with other studies that have identified the over-politicization of expert-lay communication in Chinese public discourse. Chinese parents need space to express their concerns so that vaccination programs can attune to them.","Yang, Ronghui; Penders, Bart; Horstman, Klasien",,410,22

In our cohorts, the seropositivity in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different subcohorts. Seroposivity progressively decreased in other cities as the distance to the epicenter increased. Patients who visited a hospital for maintenance hemodialysis and healthcare workers also had a higher seroprevalence of 3.3% (51 of 1,542, 2.5-4.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 1.8% (81 of 4,384, 1.5-2.3%, 95% CI), respectively.

Online platforms such as iNaturalist accumulate crowdsourced biological observations from around the world and these data could also be useful for monitoring vectors. The aim of this study was to explore the availability of observations of important vector taxa on the iNaturalist platform and examine the utility of these data to complement existing vector surveillance activities. Of ten vector taxa investigated, records were most numerous for mosquitoes (Culicidae; 23,018 records, 222 species) and ticks (Ixodida; 16,214 records, 87 species), with most data from 2019-2020. Case studies were performed to assess whether images associated with records were of sufficient quality to identify species and compare iNaturalist observations of vector species to the known situation at the state, national and regional level based on existing published data. Firstly, tick data collected at the national (United Kingdom) or state (Minnesota, USA) level were sufficient to determine seasonal occurrence and distribution patterns of important tick species, and were able to corroborate and complement known trends in tick distribution. Importantly, tick species with expanding distributions (Haemaphysalis punctata in the UK, and Amblyomma americanum in Minnesota) were also detected. Secondly, using iNaturalist data to monitor expanding tick species in Europe (Hyalomma spp.) and the USA (Haemaphysalis longicornis), and invasive Aedes mosquitoes in Europe, showed potential for tracking these species within their known range as well as identifying possible areas of expansion. Despite known limitations associated with crowdsourced data, this study shows that iNaturalist can be a valuable source of information on vector distribution and seasonality that could be used to supplement existing vector surveillance data, especially at a time when many surveillance programs may have been interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions.","Cull, Benjamin",PLoS One,410,32

We initiated a program of systematic SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in all asymptomatic patients receiving radiotherapy (RT) at a large radiation oncology network in the Charlotte, NC metropolitan region and report adherence and results of the testing program. METHODS: Patients undergoing simulation for RT between May 18, 2020 and July 10, 2020 within the Levine Cancer Institute radiation oncology network who were asymptomatic for COVID-19 associated symptoms, without previous positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, and without recent high-risk contacts were included. PCR testing was performed on nasal cavity or nasopharyngeal swab samples. Testing was performed within 2 weeks of RT start (pre-RT) and at least every 4 weeks during RT for patients with prolonged RT courses (intra-RT). An automated task based process using the oncology electronic medical record (EMR) was developed specifically for this purpose. RESULTS: A total of 604 unique patients were included in the cohort. Details on testing workflow and implementation are described herein. Pre-RT PCR testing was performed in 573 (94.9%) patients, of which 4 (0.7%) were positive. The adherence rate to intra-RT testing overall was 91.6%. Four additional patients (0.7%) tested positive during their RT course, of whom 3 were tested due to symptom development and 1 was asymptomatic and identified via systematic testing. A total of 8 (1.3%) patients tested positive overall. There were no known cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from infected patients to clinic staff and/or other patients. CONCLUSIONS: We detailed the workflows used to implement systematic SARS-CoV-2 for asymptomatic patients at a large radiation oncology network. Adherence rates for pre-RT and intra-RT testing were high using this process. This information allowed for appropriate delay in initiating RT, minimizing the occurrence of RT treatment interruptions, and no known cases of transmission from infected patients to clinic staff and/or other patients.","Prabhu, Roshan S; Dhakal, Reshika; Hicks, Amy S; McBride, James; Patrick, Alicia L; Corso, Christopher D; Murphy, Tomain; Thonen, Melissa; Lipford, Edward H; Raghavan, Derek; Burri, Stuart H",Radiat Oncol,410,1

This is especially important when we have cause for concern that the other is indeed sick, such as is the case during the world-wide outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020. In three studies, one conducted several years before the pandemic, and two during the pandemic, we showed that facial expressions of emotions are used as signals of health status. Specifically, happy expressers are perceived as healthier than expressers showing negative emotions or neutrality (Studies 1-3), whereas anger was interpreted as a signal of ill health (Study 3). Importantly, however, facial expressions affected health perception only when there was a prior reason to suspect ill health. This was the case for older expressers before and after the pandemic for whom age-related stereotypes set expectations of ill health and for all ages during a wide-spread pandemic, which extends this suspicion to everyone. In Study 3, we showed that the effect of emotion expressions was also generalized to the physical distance that the observer wishes to keep from the expresser.

In this work, we measure the severity of the disease by the ratio of Intensive Care Units (ICU) spaces occupied by COVID-19 patients and the number of Active Cases (AC) each month from April to October 2020. We also use the ratio of the number of Deaths (D) to the number of Active Cases. What clearly emerges, from rigorous statistical analysis, is a progressive decrease in both ratios until August, indicating progressive mitigation of the disease. This is particularly evident when comparing March-April with July-August; during the summer period the two ratios became roughly 18 times lower. We test such sharp decreases against possible bias in counting active cases and we confirm their statistical significance. We then interpret such evidence in terms of the well-known seasonality of the human immune system and the virus-inactivating effect of stronger UV rays in the summer. Both ratios, however, increased again in October, as ICU/AC began to increase in September 2020.

AIMS: To describe the COVID-19 impact on medical oncology care provision in an Australian setting. METHODS: Calvary Mater Newcastle and Newcastle Private Hospital medical oncology data from 1 February to 31 April 2019 versus 2020 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-four inpatient admissions occurred in 2020, 21% less than in 2019. Total inpatient days decreased by 22% (2842 vs 2203). April was most impacted (36% and 44% fewer admissions and inpatient days respectively). Mean length of stay remained unchanged (6.4 vs 6.2 days, P = 0.7). In all, 5072 outpatient consultations were conducted, including 417 new-patient consultations (4% and 6% increase on 2019 respectively). Telephone consultations (0 vs 1380) replaced one-quarter of face-to-face consultations (4859 vs 3623, -25%), with minimal telehealth use (6 vs 69).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital in China between January 2016 and December 2018. Schizophrenia patients with normal thyroid tests at admission were included. Hypothyroidism, which was defined as TSH>4.20 mU/L and free T4<12.00 pmol/L, or on L- thyroxine prescriptions, was the outcome measure, and quetiapine treatment between admission and subsequent thyroid test was the exposure measure of this study. Adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the independent association of quetiapine treatment with risk of new onset hypothyroidism. The dose-response association was further analyzed by three quetiapine doses: low (<=0.2 g/d), medium (0.2-0.6 g/d), and high (>0.6 g/d). RESULTS: A total of 2,022 eligible patients were included in the final analysis. Sixty patients (15.0%) in the quetiapine group developed hypothyroidism, while 56 patients (3.5%) in non-quetiapine group developed hypothyroidism. Relative risk (95% confidence interval) of developing hypothyroidism for quetiapine use was 4.01 (2.86-5.64) after adjusting for a number of potential confounding factors. A strong dose-response association between quetiapine use and risk of developing hypothyroidism was observed: adjusted relative risks (95% confidence intervals) were 1.00 (0.25-2.59), 4.22 (2.80-6.25), and 5.62 (3.66-8.38), respectively, for low-, medium-, and high-dose quetiapine, as compared with no quetiapine. CONCLUSION: Acute phase quetiapine treatment for schizophrenia patients was strongly associated with increased risk of developing new onset hypothyroidism, with a clear dose-response association.","Zhao, Ying; Wen, Shi Wu; Li, Mengzhe; Sun, Zhongyu; Yuan, Xiang; Retnakaran, Ravi; Zhang, Ruiling; Zhai, Desheng",,410,16

(Focus issue on atrial fibrillation.),17.925493,5.076397,2020,"OBJECTIVES: After coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, striking decreases in the number of hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and rises in rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have been noted. STUDY DESIGN: This is an analysis of prospectively collected data from a cardiology department in a single, large volume hospital of the National Health System of the Metropolitan area of Athens. METHODS: We investigated the numbers of OHCA and hospital admissions for ACS during a 1-year period and made comparisons between the pre-COVID-19 and the COVID-19 outbreak periods. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty five patients were admitted during the total period of observation with the diagnosis of ACS. The mean monthly number of admissions for ACS for the pre-COVID-19 era was significantly higher than that for the post-COVID-19 era (20.1 ± 7.8 vs 8.8 ± 6.5 admissions, &#929; = 0.024). The cases of OHCA which were transferred to our emergency room department by emergency medical services during the same period were nominally lower in the prepandemic compared with the postpandemic era (1.9 ± 1.7 vs 4.0 ± 4.6, P = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides hints on the potential unintended consequences of the pandemic in countries characterized by fewer COVID-19 cases and fatalities but prompt measures of social contact restrictions and lockdown.","Kapelios, C J; Siafarikas, C; Bonou, M; Liatis, S; Barbetseas, J",Public Health,410,24

Tonal stability has been linked to emotion, yet systematic investigations of the associations between the hierarchy of melodic scale-degrees and perceived emotional valence are lacking. Here, we examined such associations in three experiments, in musicians and in non-musicians. We used an explicit task, in which participants matched probe tones following key-establishing sequences to facial expressions ranging from sad to happy, and an implicit speeded task, a variant of the Implicit Association Test. Stabler scale-degrees were associated with more positive valence in all experiments, for both musicians and nonmusicians. This notwithstanding, results significantly differed from those of a comparable goodness-of-fit task, suggesting that perceived tonal valence is not reducible to tonal fit. Comparisons of the explicit and implicit measures suggest that associations of tonality and emotional valence may rely on two distinct mechanisms, one mediated by conceptual musical knowledge and conscious decisional processes, the other - largely by non-conceptual and involuntary processes. The joint experimental paradigms introduced here may help mapping additional connotative meanings, both emotional and cross-modal, embedded in tonal structure, thus suggesting how extra-musical meanings are conveyed to listeners through musical syntax.","Maimon, Neta B.; Lamy, Dominique; Eitan, Zohar",,410,16

However, poor conductivity, severe volume change, and harmful aggregation of the material during charge/discharge lead to unsatisfying electrochemical performance. Herein, a facile and green strategy for yolk-shell structure based on the principle of metal evaporation is proposed. SnS2 nanoparticle is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanobox (SnS2 @C). The carbon nanoboxes accommodate the volume change and aggregation of SnS2 during cycling, and form 3D continuous conductive carbon matrix by close contact. The well-designed structure benefits greatly in conductivity and structural stability of the material. As expected, SnS2 @C exhibits considerable capacity, superior cycling stability, and excellent rate capability in both SIBs and PIBs. Additionally, in situ Raman technology is unprecedentedly conducted to investigate the phase evolution of polysulfides. This work provides an avenue for facilely constructing stable and high-capacity metal dichalcogenide based anodes materials with optimized structure engineering.

We examined the availability and geographic accessibility of pharmacies across neighborhoods based on their racial/ethnic composition in the thirty most populous US cities. In all cities examined, we found persistently fewer pharmacies located in Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than White or diverse neighborhoods throughout 2007-15. In 2015 there were disproportionately more pharmacy deserts in Black or Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods than in White or diverse neighborhoods, including those that are not federally designated Medically Underserved Areas. These disparities were most pronounced in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Dallas, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. We also found that Black and Hispanic/Latino neighborhoods were more likely to experience pharmacy closures compared with other neighborhoods. Our findings suggest that efforts to increase access to medications and essential health care services, including in response to COVID-19, should consider policies that ensure equitable pharmacy accessibility across neighborhoods in US cities. Such efforts could include policies that encourage pharmacies to locate in pharmacy deserts, including increases to Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates for pharmacies most at risk for closure.","Guadamuz, Jenny S; Wilder, Jocelyn R; Mouslim, Morgane C; Zenk, Shannon N; Alexander, G Caleb; Qato, Dima Mazen",Health Aff (Millwood),410,1

It is important to accurately analyze the available evidence to provide correct clinical guidance for optimal patient care. We aim to discuss current clinical evidence regarding chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, and the cardiovascular burden of COVID-19. METHODS: A literature review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Additional clinical trials were identified through the ""TrialsTracker"" project. RESULTS: We found conflicting evidence of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and remdesivir in COVID-19 despite promising early reports of in vitro antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Some of the current studies have demonstrated adverse drug reactions to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin. Widespread systemic inflammation and procoagulant/hypercoagulable state, including thrombotic microangiopathy, endothelial dysfunction, bleeding disorder, and thrombosis are increasingly being witnessed in COVID-19. Evidence of cardiac injury and stroke is mostly reported in hospitalized patients; however, large specialized studies that focus on cardiac or neuropathology are lacking. DISCUSSION: There is no convincing clinical evidence of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, and remdesivir use in COVID-19. As evidence of systemic inflammation is rapidly unfolding, there is a dire need to maximize our resources to find the best possible solutions to the current crisis while conclusive evidence from clinical trials emerges.","Sultan, Sherif; Acharya, Yogesh",Vascular,410,9

However, severe adverse outcomes are not recorded in all patients. In this study, we assessed disease outcomes in patients with and without T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of patients with T2DM hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent predictors of demographic and clinical characteristics with mortality, length of hospital stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 18 426 inpatients (median age [interquartile range, IQR]: 61 [17] years; males: 43.3%) were investigated. Patients with T2DM (n = 9213) were compared with a group without diabetes (n = 9213) that were matched using the propensity scores for age and gender.

The independent associates of mortality were older age, male gender, obesity, insulin treatment, low lymphocyte count, and pulmonary involvement on admission. Older age, low lymphocyte values, and pulmonary involvement at baseline were independently associated with longer hospital stay and/or ICU admission.

The challenge posed by these apparently contradictory concepts requires a closer look at the premises that guide our legal thinking and a more integrated theory of the senses and their role in law, as captured by the terms ""legal synaesthesia"" and ""legal semiotics"". It also calls for an inquiry into the mind's functioning generally and how it processes information in the creative process of decision making, linking thoughts and actions as well as facts and fictions. Based on the qualification of ""fake news"" as an oxymoron, this article critically examines the deficiencies in a dichotomous distinction between fact and fiction exemplified by information about the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in an attempt to clarify the principal issues for a global regulatory debate regarding ""fake news"".","Neuwirth, Rostam J",Int J Semiot Law,410,1

In this study, we investigated the effect of anti-TNF-&#945; monoclonal antibodies on the cellular entry mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and increasing the risk of COVID-19 development. We focused on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2)/TNF-&#945; converting enzyme (TACE) ratio. We also investigated the involvement of Notch-1 signaling and its downstream influence on IL-6, myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1(MCL-1) in the anti-TNF-&#945; mode of action and increased the susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection. Surprisingly, anti-TNF-&#945; downregulated ACE2 expression by 0.46-fold and increased TMPRSS2/TACE ratio by 44% in THP-1 macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with rIL-6 also downregulated ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2/TACE ratio by 54%. Interestingly, anti-TNF-&#945; treatment upregulated Notch-1, IL-6, and MCL-1 by 1.3, 1.2, and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased viability and burden of MAP infection in macrophages. Blocking Notch signaling doubled ACE2 expression, decreased TMPRSS2/TACE ratio by 38%, and reduced MAP viability by 56%. In a small group of patients, ACE2 level was significantly lower in the plasma from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on anti-TNF-&#945; treatment compared to healthy control. The data in this critical study demonstrated that through Notch-1/IL-6 signaling, anti-TNF-&#945; agents decreased ACE2 expression and shedding through TMPRSS2/TACE modulation and increased the susceptibility to infection. Overall, this study warns against anti-TNF-&#945; therapy in some patients with underlining inflammatory conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings should impact current guidelines regarding treatment decisions of patients on anti-TNF-&#945; during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Keewan, Esra039; Beg, Shazia; Naser, Saleh A",Front Immunol,410,21

However, due to racial biases and long-standing health inequities, the common method of ranking patients based on impersonal numeric representations of their morbidity is associated with disproportionately pronounced racial disparities. In response, policymakers have issued statements of solidarity. However, translating support into responsive COVID-19 policy is rife with complexity. Triage does not easily lend itself to race-based exceptions. Reordering triage queues based on an individual patient's racial affiliation has been considered but may be divisive and difficult to implement. And while COVID-19 hospital policies may be presented as rigidly focused on saving the most lives, many make exceptions for those deemed worthy by policymakers such as front-line healthcare workers, older physicians, pregnant women and patients with disabilities. These exceptions demonstrate creativity and ingenuity-hallmarks of policymakers' abilities to flexibly respond to urgent societal concerns-which should also be extended to patients of colour. This paper dismantles common arguments against the confrontation of racial inequity within COVID-19 triage protocols, highlights concerns related to existing proposals and proposes a new paradigm to increase equity when allocating scarce COVID-19 resources.","Bruce, Lori; Tallman, Ruth",J. med. ethics,410,21

Objective: To understand whether the transition to remote visits is associated with disparities in patient use of care, diagnostic test ordering, and medication prescribing. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used electronic health records data for all ambulatory cardiology visits at an urban, multisite health system in Los Angeles County, California, during 2 periods: April 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019 (pre-COVID) and April 1 to December 31, 2020 (COVID-era). Statistical analysis was performed from January to February 2021. Exposure: In-person or remote ambulatory cardiology clinic visit at one of 31 during the pre-COVID period or COVID-era period. Main Outcomes and Measures: Comparison of patient characteristics and frequencies of medication ordering and cardiology-specific testing across 4 visit types (pre-COVID in-person (reference), COVID-era in-person, COVID-era video, COVID-era telephone). Results: This study analyzed data from 87â¯182 pre-COVID in-person, 74â¯498 COVID-era in-person, 4720 COVID-era video, and 10â¯381 COVID-era telephone visits. Across visits, 79â¯572 patients were female (45.0%), 127â¯080 patients were non-Hispanic White (71.9%), and the mean (SD) age was 68.1 (17.0) years. Patients accessing COVID-era remote visits were more likely to be Asian, Black, or Hispanic individuals (24â¯934 pre-COVID in-person visits [28.6%] vs 19â¯742 COVID-era in-person visits [26.5%] vs 3633 COVID-era video visits [30.4%] vs 1435 COVID-era telephone visits [35.0%]; P < .001 for all comparisons), have private insurance (34â¯063 pre-COVID in-person visits [39.1%] vs 25â¯474 COVID-era in-person visits [34.2%] vs 2562 COVID-era video visits [54.3%] vs 4264 COVID-era telephone visits [41.1%]; P < .001 for COVID-era in-person vs video and COVID-era in-person vs telephone), and have cardiovascular comorbidities (eg, hypertension: 37â¯166 pre-COVID in-person visits [42.6%] vs 31â¯359 COVID-era in-person visits [42.1%] vs 2006 COVID-era video visits [42.5%] vs 5181 COVID-era telephone visits [49.9%]; P < .001 for COVID-era in-person vs telephone; and heart failure: 14â¯319 pre-COVID in-person visits [16.4%] vs 10â¯488 COVID-era in-person visits [14.1%] vs 1172 COVID-era video visits [24.8%] vs 2674 COVID-era telephone visits [25.8%]; P < .001 for COVID-era in-person vs video and COVID-era in-person vs telephone). After adjusting for patient and visit characteristics and in comparison with pre-COVID in-person visits, during video and telephone visits, clinicians had lower odds of ordering any medication (COVID-era in-person: odds ratio [OR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.60-0.64], COVID-era video: OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.20-0.24]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.13-0.15]) or tests, such as electrocardiograms (COVID-era in-person: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.58-0.62]; COVID-era video: OR, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.04]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.01-0.03]) or echocardiograms (COVID-era in-person: OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.18-1.24]; COVID-era video: OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.42-0.52]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.25-0.31]). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients who were Asian, Black, or Hispanic, had private insurance, and had at least one of several cardiovascular comorbidities used remote cardiovascular care more frequently in the COVID-era period. Clinician ordering of diagnostic testing and medications consistently decreased when comparing pre-COVID vs COVID-era and in-person vs remote visits. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these decreases represent a reduction in the overuse of tests and medications vs an underuse of indicated testing and prescribing.","Yuan, Neal; Pevnick, Joshua M; Botting, Patrick G; Elad, Yaron; Miller, Shaun J; Cheng, Susan; Ebinger, Joseph E",JAMA Netw Open,410,22

This study analyses how public support for such exceptional measures are determined by cognitive and ideological factors known to create and maintain racial biases in the criminal system. Participants were asked to express their level of agreement with the early-release of hypothetical prisoners. Results showed participants to be less favourable to the early-release of Black compared to White prisoners, when they had committed a stereotypically Black crime. As expected, the congruency between the crime stereotypicality and the colour of the prisoner's skin did not emerge for White prisoners. Moreover, the difference between the agreement with the release of the Black vs. the White prisoner when both committed a stereotypically Black crime was higher as the level of endorsement of Meritocracy increased. Contrastingly, Anti-egalitarianism only predicted an overall disagreement with prisoners' early-release.

METHODS: We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%. Lower sensitivity of 88.2% was seen on the same day of symptom development (day 0). CONCLUSIONS: We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of &#8805;80% sensitivity and &#8805;97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use, and independence from existing laboratory structures.

Estimation of case fatality rate (CFR) and determining the associated factors are critical for developing targeted interventions. METHODOLOGY: The state-level adjusted case fatality rate (aCFR) was estimated by dividing the cumulative number of deaths on a given day by the cumulative number confirmed cases 8 days before, which is the average time-lag between diagnosis and death. We conducted fractional regression analysis to determine the predictors of aCFR. RESULTS: As of 13 June 2020, India reported 225 COVID-19 cases per million population (95% CI:224-226); 6.48 deaths per million population (95% CI:6.34-6.61) and an aCFR of 3.88% (95% CI:3.81-3.97) with wide variation between states. High proportion of urban population and population above 60 years were significantly associated with increased aCFR (p=0.08, p=0.05), whereas, high literacy rate and high proportion of women were associated with reduced aCFR (p<0.001, p=0.03). The higher number of cases per million population (p=0.001), prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (p=0.012), cardiovascular diseases (p=0.05), and any cancer (p<0.001) were significantly associated with increased aCFR. The performance of state health systems and proportion of public health expenditure were not associated with aCFR. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographic factors and burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were found to be the predictors of aCFR. Focused strategies that would ensure early identification, testing and effective targeting of non-literate, elderly, urban population and people with comorbidities are critical to control the pandemic and fatalities.","Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Lakshmanan, Jeyaseelan; Sarman, Charishma Jones; Joy, Melvin",J Infect Dev Ctries,410,33

This study used a convenience sampling technique to examine factors associated with misinformation about COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa using an online cross-sectional survey. A link to the online self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1,969 participants through social media platforms and the authors' email networks. Four false statements-informed by results from a pilot study-were included in the survey. The participants' responses were classified as ""Agree,"" ""Neutral,"" and ""Disagree."" A multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Among those who responded to the survey, 19.3% believed that COVID-19 was designed to reduce world population, 22.2% thought the ability to hold your breath for 10 seconds meant that you do not have COVID-19, 27.8% believed drinking hot water flushes down the virus, and 13.9% thought that COVID-19 had little effect on Blacks compared with Whites. An average of 33.7% were unsure whether the 4 false statements were true. Multivariate analysis revealed that those who thought COVID-19 was unlikely to continue in their countries reported higher odds of believing in these 4 false statements. Other significant factors associated with belief in misinformation were age (older adults), employment status (unemployed), gender (female), education (bachelor's degree), and knowledge about the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Strategies to reduce the spread of false information about COVID-19 and other future pandemics should target these subpopulations, especially those with limited education.

Although critical to Macao’s economy, tourism had essentially ceased by March 2020, as the city closed its borders to regional and foreign arrivals. This paper presents the key policy and health measures since Macao’s first coronavirus case in January. The city had recorded no coronavirus cases in the city in early March, but saw a second wave of imported coronavirus cases mostly as residents and non-resident workers returned from overseas. At the request of government, over 10% of Macao’s hotel room inventory had been allocated as quarantine hotels. The ‘top-down’ approach by government meant stringent policy measures consisting of border closures and health advisories were actioned immediately to stem the spread of coronavirus. The economic consequences to the casino industry, which supplies 85% of the government’s total tax revenues, have been dramatic, as casino revenues continue to spiral downwards by over 80% in both February and March. This paper presents Macao’s reaction to the coronavirus in a three-wave analogy.

More specifically, exploring the first stages in the learning process through embedding declarative knowledge utilising both video content and learner profiles, with the purpose to make teaching practice more effectively and efficiently targeted. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative social experimental approach was employed. The sample consisted of 414 students from three post primary schools in Northern Ireland. Students were randomly allocated into both control and experimental video content groups. All participants were made aware of ethical procedures and the nature of the study. Findings Through the application of latent class analysis (LCA), three distinct types of students were classified. Class one (n = 250) students were termed independent learners, class two (n = 88) students were motivated and benefited from video-based learning and class three (n = 52) students demonstrated an inability to apply information because video did not assist in embedding declarative knowledge. Research limitations/implications Implications from this research inform content generation for video-based cooking skills. Practical implications Given the unprecedented move towards online teaching in 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions, there is increasing interest in targeting resources effectively to meet the requirements of all learning groups. This paper fulfils an identified need to study how video impacts on skills development and learning within specific learning typologies. Originality/value This research will be of interest to educationalists in promoting a cost-effective resource in line with constructivist values to streamline and meet the needs of individual learners.","Surgenor, D.; McLaughlin, C.; McMahon-Beattie, U.; Burns, A.",British Food Journal,410,16

Hence, whole-genome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global variability and the development and fine tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers/probes sequences from 13 target regions for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3' end of each primer, the open reading frame inspection was identified for each gene/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country. Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and N genes were observed. The 3' end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR diagnostic tests available at WHO COVID-19 technical guidelines; its impact on the performance and rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated.

However, other under-studied important biases are likely to impact clinical care as well. The goal of this study was to explore the presence of bias against people with physical disability among a heterogeneous group of healthcare workers and trainees and to evaluate the effect of implicit association testing and an educational module on this bias. METHOD: The study was composed of a one-hour web-based survey and educational module. The survey included an explicit disability bias assessment, disability Implicit Association Tests (IATs), demographic collection, and pre- and post- module clinical vignettes of prenatal patient scenarios. In addition to providing counseling to hypothetical patients, participants also indicated their personal preferences on genetic testing and termination. The educational module focused on the principles of patient-centered counseling. RESULTS: The collected data reflects responses from 335 participants. Within this sample, there were both explicit and implicit biases towards individuals with physical disabilities. Prior to the IAT and educational module, when respondents were tasked with providing genetic testing recommendations, implicit biases and personal preferences for genetic testing and termination influenced respondents' clinical recommendations. Importantly, having previous professional experience with individuals with disabilities diminished biased clinical recommendations prior to the intervention. In response to the IAT and educational intervention, the effect of implicit bias and personal preferences on clinical recommendations decreased. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates how bias against a marginalized group exists within the medical community and that personal opinions can impact clinical counseling. Importantly, our findings suggest that there are strategies that can be easily implemented into curricula to address disability bias, including formal educational interventions and the addition of professional experiences into healthcare professional training programs.","Vaimberg, Emma; Demers, Lindsay; Ford, Eric; Sabatello, Maya; Stevens, Blair; Dasgupta, Shoumita",PLoS One,410,1

With the growing numbers of community spread cases worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Like influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted by droplets and direct contact, and COVID-19 has a similar disease presentation to influenza. Here we present a case of influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection in a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man with ESRD on hemodialysis presented for worsening cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The patient first developed a mild fever (37.8 °C) during hemodialysis 3 days prior to presentation and has been experiencing worsening flu-like symptoms, including fever of up to 38.6 °C, non-productive cough, generalized abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and liquid green diarrhea. He lives alone at home with no known sick contacts and denies any recent travel or visits to healthcare facilities other than the local dialysis center. Rapid flu test was positive for influenza A. Procalcitonin was elevated at 5.21 ng/mL with a normal white blood cell (WBC) count. Computed tomography (CT) chest demonstrated multifocal areas of consolidation and extensive mediastinal and hilar adenopathy concerning for pneumonia. He was admitted to the biocontainment unit of Nebraska Medicine for concerns of possible COVID-19 and was started on oseltamivir for influenza and vancomycin/cefepime for the probable bacterial cause of his pneumonia and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal (GI) pathogen panel and Clostridioides difficile toxin assay were negative. On the second day of admission, initial nasopharyngeal swab came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patient received supportive care and resumed bedside hemodialysis in strict isolation, and eventually fully recovered from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a case of co-infection of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis patient. The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection should not be overlooked even when other viruses including influenza can explain the clinical symptoms, especially in high-risk patients.","Jing, Ran; Vunnam, Rama Rao; Schnaubelt, Elizabeth; Vokoun, Chad; Cushman-Vokoun, Allison; Goldner, David; Vunnam, Srinivas Rao",BMC Infect Dis,410,20

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of horses seen 'out-of-hours' with colic by two equine veterinary practices between 2011 and 2013. Case outcomes were categorised as 'critical' or 'not critical'. A critical outcome was defined as requiring medical or surgical hospital treatment, or resulting in euthanasia or death. A non-critical outcome was defined as resolving with simple medical treatment. A hierarchical generalised linear model was used to identify 'red flag' parameters (aspects of signalment, history and presenting clinical signs) associated with critical outcomes. RESULTS: Data were retrieved from 941 cases that presented with colic; 23.9 per cent (n=225/941) were critical. Variables significantly associated with the likelihood of a critical outcome in the final multivariable model were increased heart rate (P<0.001), age of the horse (P=0.013) and abnormal mucous membrane colour (P<0.001).

Expanding COVID-19 testing to include environmental surfaces would ideally be performed with inexpensive swabs that could be transported safely without concern of being a source of new infections. However, CDC-approved clinical-grade sampling supplies and techniques using a synthetic swab are expensive, potentially expose laboratory workers to viable virus and prohibit analysis of the microbiome due to the presence of antibiotics in viral transport media (VTM). To this end, we performed a series of experiments comparing the diagnostic yield using five consumer-grade swabs (including plastic and wood shafts and various head materials including cotton, synthetic, and foam) and one clinical-grade swab for inhibition to RNA. For three of these swabs, we evaluated performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 in twenty intensive care unit (ICU) hospital rooms of patients including COVID-19+ patients. All swabs were placed in 95% ethanol and further evaluated in terms of RNase activity. SARS-CoV-2 was measured both directly from the swab and from the swab eluent. RESULTS: Compared to samples collected in VTM, 95% ethanol demonstrated significant inhibition properties against RNases. When extracting directly from the swab head as opposed to the eluent, RNA recovery was approximately 2-4× higher from all six swab types tested as compared to the clinical standard of testing the eluent from a CDC-approved synthetic (SYN) swab. The limit of detection (LoD) of SARS-CoV-2 from floor samples collected using the consumer-grade plastic (CGp) or research-grade plastic The Microsetta Initiative (TMI) swabs was similar or better than the SYN swab, further suggesting that swab type does not impact RNA recovery as measured by the abundance of SARS-CoV-2. The LoD for TMI was between 0 and 362.5 viral particles, while SYN and CGp were both between 725 and 1450 particles. Lastly microbiome analyses (16S rRNA gene sequencing) of paired samples (nasal and floor from same patient room) collected using different swab types in triplicate indicated that microbial communities were not impacted by swab type, but instead driven by the patient and sample type. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to using a clinical-grade synthetic swab, detection of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples collected from ICU rooms of patients with COVID was similar using consumer-grade swabs, stored in 95% ethanol. The yield was best from the swab head rather than the eluent and the low level of RNase activity and lack of antibiotics in these samples makes it possible to perform concomitant microbiome analyses.

We compare their effectiveness using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure. This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic hybrid protocols.","Mancastroppa, Marco; Castellano, Claudio; Vezzani, Alessandro; Burioni, Raffaella",Nat Commun,410,12

Viral glycoproteins have different receptor affinities and triggering mechanisms. We employed vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a BSL-2 enveloped virus that can incorporate non-native glycoproteins, to examine the entry efficiencies of diverse viral glycoproteins. To compare the glycoprotein-mediated entry efficiencies of VSV glycoprotein (G), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S), Ebola (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP), Lassa (LASV) GP, and Chikungunya (CHIKV) envelope (E) protein, we produced recombinant VSV (rVSV) viruses that produce the five glycoproteins. The rVSV virions encoded a nano luciferase (NLucP) reporter gene fused to a destabilization domain (PEST), which we used in combination with the live-cell substrate EndurazineTM to monitor viral entry kinetics in real time. Our data indicate that rVSV particles with glycoproteins that require more post-internalization priming typically demonstrate delayed entry in comparison to VSV G. In addition to determining the time required for each virus to complete entry, we also used our system to evaluate viral cell surface receptor preferences, monitor fusion, and elucidate endocytosis mechanisms. This system can be rapidly employed to examine diverse viral glycoproteins and their entry requirements.","Lay Mendoza, Maria Fernanda; Acciani, Marissa Danielle; Levit, Courtney Nina; Santa Maria, Christopher; Brindley, Melinda Ann",Viruses,410,16

This paper focuses on increasing accessibility through the development of a video-based, pediatric teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) practice model that was developed in a private practice 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: 'Design thinking' methodology to problem-solving was utilized to innovate the traditional neuropsychology practice model in under-served areas who may have limited financial and healthcare resources. The practice model approach to include a virtual diagnostic clinic with increased patient and provider efficiency was created to enhance accessibility for patients and sustainability for providers. RESULTS: Video-based TeleNP screenings were conducted for 67 children with developmental (i.e., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder) and language disorders, as well as concussion and psychiatric diagnoses. Additional comorbidities were identified in 65.6% of children. Follow-up data approximately 2 months later revealed 98.5% of children were receiving new interventions as a result of the video-based TeleNP assessment. CONCLUSION: Video-based TeleNP benefits the consumer as it can reduce wait times, decrease family financial burden (i.e., travel and parent time off work), expedite referrals for interventions, and provide geographically under-served populations access to providers who are linguistically and culturally responsive. For providers, this model revealed improvements with direct implications for cost-saving, thereby facilitating long-term economic sustainability within a private practice healthcare marketplace.","Salinas, Christine M; Bordes Edgar, Veronica; Berrios Siervo, Gretchen; Bender, Heidi A",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,410,16

The pathology of COVID-19 in children is not known;the proposed pathogenesis for severe cases includes immune-mediated mechanisms or the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on tissues. We describe the autopsy findings in five cases of paediatric COVID-19 and provide mechanistic insight into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Methods Children and adolescents who died with COVID-19 between March 18 and August 15, 2020 were autopsied with a minimally invasive method. Tissue samples from all vital organs were analysed by histology, electron microscopy (EM), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Findings Five patients were included, one male and four female, aged 7 months to 15 years. Two patients had severe diseases before SARS-CoV-2 infection: adrenal carcinoma and Edwards syndrome. Three patients were previously healthy and had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with distinct clinical presentations: myocarditis, colitis, and acute encephalopathy with status epilepticus. Autopsy findings varied amongst patients and included mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia, pulmonary microthrombosis, cerebral oedema with reactive gliosis, myocarditis, intestinal inflammation, and haemophagocytosis. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all patients in lungs, heart and kidneys by at least one method (RT-PCR, IHC or EM), and in endothelial cells from heart and brain in two patients with MIS-C (IHC). In addition, we show for the first time the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain tissue of a child with MIS-C with acute encephalopathy, and in the intestinal tissue of a child with acute colitis. Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 can infect several cell and tissue types in paediatric patients, and the target organ for the clinical manifestation varies amongst individuals. Two major patterns of severe COVID-19 were observed: a primarily pulmonary disease, with severe acute respiratory disease and diffuse alveolar damage, or a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with the involvement of several organs. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in several organs, associated with cellular ultrastructural changes, reinforces the hypothesis that a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on tissues is involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.

We therefore assessed seroprevalence and identified risk factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) seropositivity in this population. METHODS: Between June 22nd and August 15th 2020, HCW from institutions in Northern/Eastern Switzerland were screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We recorded baseline characteristics, non-occupational and occupational risk factors. We used pairwise tests of associations and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Among 4'664 HCW from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR=59, 95%-CI: 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR=2.3, 95%-CI: 1.2-4.2), and male sex (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.1-3.1). Blood group 0 vs. non-0 (aOR=0.5, 95%-CI: 0.3-0.8), active smoking (aOR=0.4, 95%-CI: 0.2-0.7), living with children <12 years (aOR=0.3, 95%-CI: 0.2-0.6), and being a physician (aOR 0.2, 95%-CI: 0.1-0.5) were associated with decreased risk. Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR=2.7, 95%-CI: 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR=1.9, 95%-CI: 1.2-2.9), and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR=2.3, 95%-CI: 1.4-3.8). CONCLUSIONS: Living with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCW. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study.","Kahlert, Christian R; Persi, Raphael; Güsewell, Sabine; Egger, Thomas; Leal-Neto, Onicio B; Sumer, Johannes; Flury, Domenica; Brucher, Angela; Lemmenmeier, Eva; Möller, J Carsten; Rieder, Philip; Stocker, Reto; Vuichard-Gysin, Danielle; Wiggli, Benedikt; Albrich, Werner C; Flury, Baharak Babouee; Besold, Ulrike; Fehr, Jan; Kuster, Stefan P; McGeer, Allison; Risch, Lorenz; Schlegel, Matthias; Friedl, Andrée; Vernazza, Pietro; Kohler, Philipp",Clin. microbiol. infect,410,26

We sought to identify the main conventional and functional echocardiographic parameters associated with LAAT on TEE in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients planned for electrical cardioversion (ECV). This retrospective study included 125 consecutive NVAF patients (71.5±7.8 yrs, 75 males), who underwent TEE at our Institution between April 2016 and January 2020, to exclude LAAT before scheduled ECV. All patients underwent a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) implemented with speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) analysis of left atrial (LA) strain and strain rate (SR) parameters. 28% of patients were diagnosed with LAAT, while 72% without LAAT. Compared to controls, patients with LAAT had significantly higher CHA2DS2-Vasc Score and average E/e' ratio, and significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Moreover, LA-peak positive global atrial strain (GSA+) and LA-SR parameters were significantly reduced in patients with LAAT. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, differently from CHA2DS2-Vasc Score, LVEF (OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.81-0.97, p = 0.01), average E/e' ratio (OR 2.36, 95%CI 1.41-3.98, p = 0.001), and LA-GSA+ (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.36-0-90, p = 0.01) were independently associated with LAAT. LA-GSA+ (optimal cut-off &#8804; 9.1%, AUC 0.95) showed the highest diagnostic performance. Finally, a strong linear correlation of LA peak-to-peak SR with both LA appendage filling (r = 0.86) and emptying (r = 0.83) velocities was demonstrated. TTE implemented with STE analysis of LA mechanics improves thrombotic risk assessment of NVAF patients.","Sonaglioni, Andrea; Lombardo, Michele; Nicolosi, Gian Luigi; Rigamonti, Elisabetta; Anzà, Claudio",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,410,16

We first validate Core&Peel for the general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner, and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover, for the two cancer datasets, Core&Peel detects further eight relevant pathways not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally, we apply Core&Peel and other methods to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts at a pre-clinical level.","Lucchetta, Marta; Pellegrini, Marco",Sci Rep,410,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two COVID-19 patients with solitary pulmonary lesion from three hospitals in China were enrolled from January 18, 2020 to March 18, 2020. The clinical feature and laboratory findings at first visit, as well as characteristics and dynamic evolution of chest CT images were analyzed. Among them, the CT score evaluation was the sum of the lung involvement in five lobes (0-5 points for each lobe, with a total score ranging from 0 to 25). RESULTS: 22 COVID-19 patients (11 males and 11 females, with an average age of 40.7 ± 10.3) developed a solitary pulmonary lesion within 4 days after the onset of symptoms, the peak time of CT score was about 11 days (with a median CT score of 6), and was discharged about 19 days. The peak of CT score was positively correlated with the peak time and the discharge time (p < 0.001, r = 0.793; p < 0.001, r = 0.715). Scan-1 (first visit): 22 cases (100%) showed GGO and one lobe was involved, CT score was 1.0/1.0 (median/IQR). Scan-2 (peak): 15 cases (68%) showed crazy-paving pattern, 19 cases (86%) showed consolidation, and 2.5 lobes were involved, CT score was 6.0/12.0. Scan-3 (before discharge): ten cases (45%) showed linear opacities, none had crazy-paving pattern, and 2.5 lobes were involved, CT score was 6.0/11.0. Scan-4 (after discharge): three cases (19%) showed linear opacities and one lobe was involved, CT score was 2.0/5.0. CONCLUSION: The chest CT features are related to the course of COVID-19 disease, and dynamic chest CT scan are helpful to monitor disease progress and patients' condition. In recovered patients with COVID-19, the positive CT manifestations were found within 4 days, lung involvement peaking at approximately 11 days, and discharged at about 19 days. The patients with more severe the lung injury was, the later the peak time appeared and the longer the recovery time was. Although the lesion was resolved over time, isolation and reexamination were required after discharge.","Zhuang, Yuandi; Lin, Liaoyi; Xu, Xunhua; Xia, Tianyi; Yu, Huili; Fu, Gangze; Yang, Yunjun; Wang, Meihao; Sun, Houzhang",Jpn. j. radiol.

Objectives: We aimed to assess the quality of online MCQs test taken by final medical students after COVID 19 pandemic and to review student’s performance in online assessment. Methods: This study was carried out in the college of medicine, King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia, participants were undergraduate final year medical students who completed their four major clinical courses. Item analysis parameters of the online MCQs test were compared with the item analysis parameters of the paper-based tests. Paper-based tests assessed the cohort of students in semester one before COVID 19 pandemic lockdown. The overall student’s performance on classical, face to face assessment was compared with the performance on an online assessment. Chisquare test was used P values<0:05 considered as statistically significant. Results: In two courses out of four, the test reliability of online MCQs tests improved significantly compared with paper-based tests. Three courses out of four showed significantly increased average discrimination indices among the online MCQs items. The average difficulty indices of all courses increased significantly in online MCQs tests. We observed that out of a maximum raw score of 100, the mean student’s score for online assessment in three courses was significantly higher than that for traditional assessment. Conclusion: we studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on assessment of final year medical students. Online MCQs approved to be more reliable, better discrimination ability, but easier than paper-based examination. The overall student’s performance in theoretical and practical assessment was significantly improved in online assessment.","Hassan, B.; Shati, A. A.; Alamri, A.; Patel, A.; Asseri, A.

Studies have begun examining people's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about COVID-19, but little is known about how these cognitive outcomes differ across racial/ethnic groups. Methods: An online survey was conducted with a convenience sample of adults ages 18 and older in the United States (n = 2,006) in May 2020, about 2 months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Multivariable regression models were used to examine differences in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about COVID-19 across racial/ethnic groups (non-Latinx white, non-Latinx black, non-Latinx of another race, or Latinx). Results: Knowledge tended to be lower among non-Latinx blacks and Latinx participants compared to non-Latinx whites. For example, fewer non-Latinx blacks responded correctly that COVID-19 is not caused by the same virus that causes influenza (adjusted OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.90), and Latinx participants were less likely to respond correctly that people with COVID-19 do not always show symptoms of being sick (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45-0.87). For beliefs and attitudes, non-Latinx blacks (ß = -0.09) and non-Latinx participants of another race (ß = -0.05) reported lower perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 in the future compared to non-Latinx whites, while Latinx participants reported greater perceived stigma of COVID-19 (ß = 0.08) (all p < 0.05). Conclusions: Several differences in cognitive outcomes about COVID-19 exist across racial/ethnic groups, including gaps in knowledge and varied beliefs and attitudes. Results identify modifiable targets for public health programs promoting vaccination and other mitigation behaviors against COVID-19.","Reiter, Paul L; Katz, Mira L",Front Public Health,410,25

Hoyt had the foresight to institute a digital communications platform upon which the College collected data for its clinical programs and conducted many of its meetings. Through internet portals, online communities, and social media it broadcasted news and information to the membership. When the global COVID-19 pandemic struck, the College was able to quickly mobilize its leaders and scientific experts to disseminate credible information, recommend protocols to maintain patient and provider safety in operating room environments, provide a rational scheme of prioritization of urgent surgical operations, and a sensible means of resumption of normal surgical practice. As the financial impact of the outbreak on surgical practice became apparent, the ACS represented the interests of surgeons in the White House, Capitol, federal agencies, and governors' mansions and statehouses. In an interview by Steven Wexner, a member of the ACS Board of Regents, Hoyt described the response of the ACS to an unprecedented threat to the surgical care of patients in the country and the world.

We model the datasets as distributions supported on common data graph that is derived from the affinity matrix computed on the combined data. In such cases where the graph is a discretization of an underlying Riemannian closed manifold, we prove that Diffusion EMD is topologically equivalent to the standard EMD with a geodesic ground distance. Diffusion EMD can be computed in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time and is more accurate than similarly fast algorithms such as tree-based EMDs. We also show Diffusion EMD is fully differentiable, making it amenable to future uses in gradient-descent frameworks such as deep neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate an application of Diffusion EMD to single cell data collected from 210 COVID-19 patient samples at Yale New Haven Hospital. Here, Diffusion EMD can derive distances between patients on the manifold of cells at least two orders of magnitude faster than equally accurate methods. This distance matrix between patients can be embedded into a higher level patient manifold which uncovers structure and heterogeneity in patients. More generally, Diffusion EMD is applicable to all datasets that are massively collected in parallel in many medical and biological systems.","Tong, A.; Huguet, G.; Natik, A.; MacDonald, K.; Kuchroo, M.; Coifman, R.; Wolf, G.; Krishnaswamy, S.",,410,1

The transmission rates of airborne pathogens from patient to dental health care workers are unknown. With the outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza, occasional outbreaks of measles and tuberculosis, and the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, it is important to estimate the risks for dental health care workers. Therefore, the transmission probability of these airborne infectious diseases was estimated via mathematical modeling. The transmission probability was modeled for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, measles virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses per a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation. This equation incorporated the indoor air quality by using carbon dioxide as a proxy and added the respiratory protection rate from medical face masks and N95 respirators. Scenario-specific analyses, uncertainty analyses, and sensitivity analyses were run to produce probability rates. A high transmission probability was characterized by high patient infectiousness, the absence of respiratory protection, and poor indoor air quality. The highest transmission probabilities were estimated for measles virus (100%), coronaviruses (99.4%), influenza virus (89.4%), and M. tuberculosis (84.0%). The low-risk scenario leads to transmission probabilities of 4.5% for measles virus and 0% for the other pathogens. From the sensitivity analysis, it shows that the transmission probability is strongly driven by indoor air quality, followed by patient infectiousness, and the least by respiratory protection from medical face mask use. Airborne infection transmission of pathogens such as measles virus and coronaviruses is likely to occur in the dental practice. The risk magnitude, however, is highly dependent on specific conditions in each dental clinic. Improved indoor air quality by ventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide, is the most important factor that will either strongly increase or decrease the probability of the transmission of a pathogen.","Zemouri, C; Awad, S F; Volgenant, C M C; Crielaard, W; Laheij, A M G A; de Soet, J J",J Dent Res,410,24

This study aimed to elicit and explore the views of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and their ophthalmic care. MethodsBetween April 29th and September 4th 2020, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with thirty-five patients with nAMD taking part in a larger diagnostic accuracy study of home-monitoring tests. Participants were recruited using maximum variation sampling to capture a range of key characteristics including age, gender and time since initial treatment. Transcribed interview data were analysed using a deductive and inductive thematic approach. ResultsThree themes emerged from the analysis: i. access to eye clinic care. ii. COVID-19 mitigating factors and care delivery and iii. social and personal circumstances. Participants reported anxieties about cancelled or delayed appointments, limited communication from clinic-based services about appointments, and the impact of this on their ongoing care. Despite these concerns, there was apprehension about attending appointments due to infection risk and a perception that nAMD patients are a high risk group. Views of those who attended clinics during the study period were, however, positive, with social distancing and infection control measures providing reassurance. ConclusionsThese findings contribute to our understanding about experiences of patients with nAMD during the COVID-19 pandemic and have potential implications for future planning of care services. Innovative approaches may be required to address issues related to access to care, including concerns about delayed or cancelled appointments.

Methods: Providers (n = 93) completed online surveys with quantitative measures and open-ended items targeting their responses and/or reactions to COVID-19, and to the transition to providing services via telehealth. Results: Perceptions of personal risk and rumination around COVID-19 were low, while telehealth was viewed positively by providers. Three major themes emerged regarding the major impacts of COVID-19 on work: 1) the altered nature of interactions between patient/client and provider, 2) changes in provider expectations regarding productivity, and 3) challenges maintaining work-life balance. In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP implementation, three themes emerged: 1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, 2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and 3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth. Conclusions: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, community mental health providers continued to engage with clients and implement EBPs while navigating a number of changes related to the transition to telehealth. This study highlights the need for further work on what supports providers need to effectively engage with clients and deliver EBPs via telehealth and has implications for how telehealth is sustained or de-implemented in response to COVID-19.","Sklar, M.; Reeder, K.; Carandang, K.; Ehrhart, M.

Therefore, it is of crucial importance to study the initial clinical features of patients, to better differentiate between infected and uninfected patients outside Hubei. A total of 116 patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented to two emergency departments in Anhui for the first time between 24 January 2020 and 20 February 2020 were enrolled in the study. The initial clinical data of these patients, such as epidemiological features, symptoms, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected using a standard case report form on admission. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19; the remaining 84 patients were referred to as negative cases.

In a trial of AD patients, the apparent success of treatment with a polysaccharide, GV971, was suggested to result from antiviral action against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) in brain, a pathogen strongly implicated in AD, and that sulphation of GV971, making it fucoidan-like, might increase its putative antiviral action. These data indicate that treatment of AD patients might be very effective using valacyclovir, a conventional antiviral, which inhibits viral replication, together with a fucoidan, which blocks virus entry into cells.","Itzhaki, Ruth F",J Alzheimers Dis,410,21

Neutrophils are the largest population of white blood cells and play a pivotal role in innate immunity. During an infection, neutrophils migrate from circulation to the infection site, contributing to killing pathogens. This mechanism is regulated by chemokines such as IL-8. Moreover, it was shown that neutrophils play an important role in thromboinflammation. Through a diverse repertoire of mechanisms, neutrophils, apart from directly killing pathogens, are able to activate the formation of thrombi. In COVID-19 patients, neutrophil activation promotes neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, platelet aggregation, and cell damage. Furthermore, neutrophils participate in the pathogenesis of endothelitis. Overall, this review summarizes recent progress in research on the pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting the role of the prothrombotic action of neutrophils in NET formation.","Iliadi, Valeria; Konstantinidou, Ina; Aftzoglou, Konstantina; Iliadis, Sergios; Konstantinidis, Theocharis G; Tsigalou, Christina",Int. j. mol. sci.

Potential risk factors for these psychopathological symptoms are problematic social media usage and attachment insecurity. Therefore, this study aimed: (1) to assess emotional-behavioral symptoms, binge eating, problematic social media usage, and attachment representations of adolescents during the pandemic, comparing them with prepandemic similar samples;(2) to investigate relationships among variables, exploring the role of problematic social media usage and insecure attachment as risk factors for more psychopathological symptoms. Participants were 62 community adolescents aged 12-17 years, enrolled through schools, and assessed online through the following measures: Youth Self-Report for emotional-behavioral problems, Binge-Eating Scale for binge eating, Social Media Disorder Scale for problematic social media usage, and the Friends and Family Interview for attachment. The main results were: (1) 9.4% of adolescents showed clinical rates of emotional-behavioral symptoms and 4.8% of binge eating attitudes. The comparison with pre-pandemic samples revealed that pandemic teenagers showed lower internalizing, but higher other problems (e.g., binge drinking, self-destructive behaviors) and more problematic social media usage than pre-pandemic peers. No differences in binge-eating attitudes and attachment were revealed (76% secure classifications). (2) Problematic social media usage was related to more binge eating and emotional-behavioral problems, predicting 5.4% of both delinquent and attention problems. Attachment disorganization predicted 16.5% of internalizing problems, somatic complaints, and social and identity-related problems. In conclusion, confinement did not increase adolescents' internalizing symptoms -i.e., vulnerability to mood disorders of an anxious-depressive type- which even decreased. However, teenagers may have expressed their discomfort through other problems and symptoms of social media disorder. Further studies should explore the role of adolescents' problematic social media usage and attachment insecurity as risk factors for additional psychopathological symptoms.","Muzi, S.; Sanso, A.; Pace, C.

The role of young children in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains largely unknown. In the Netherlands, the first action of loosening the partial lockdown that had been implemented to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission was the reopening of primary schools on 1 May 2020. We subsequently conducted a prospective cohort study among healthcare workers (HCWs) with primary school-attending children versus HCWs without children living at home. We tested each HCW three times for SARS-CoV-2 from May 20 to June 15 2020 at 1-week intervals. In total, 832 nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from 283 HCWs with primary school-attending children living at home and 864 nasopharyngeal swabs from 285 HCWs without children living at home. All nasopharyngeal swabs tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. In our region with a low population density and low SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, reopening of primary schools did not lead to an increase in infections. The results of this study may serve as an example for the implementation of regional strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in countries with large variations in both population density and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.

This research study develops two online training modes—slide-based and virtual world—and assesses them on factors such as knowledge retention, engagement, and attention. Fire safety and emergency evacuation procedures were selected for online training development, focusing on a university community. A Lean Startup methodology was employed to develop training content for virtual and slide-based safety training (SBST). A virtual university building was developed with 15 learning objectives on fire safety. An empirical evaluation of the training modes was conducted with 143 participants. The results validated that a Virtual Safety World (VSW) can provide the same knowledge as SBST but can do so in a more engaging manner. Retention of concepts after a month was higher in VSW participants. The participants’ attention levels, measured by employing qEEG, showed that participants exhibited better-sustained attention while in VSW than in SBST mode.

The kinetic parameters of the SEIR-AQ model were obtained by fitting, and the parameters of the SEIR-AQ model were solved through the Euler method. Furthermore, the effects of different countries’ prevention and control strategies on the number of infections, the proportion of isolation, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries were also simulated. The theoretical analysis showed that measures such as isolation for prevention and control and medical tracking isolation had a significant inhibitory effect on the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, among which stratified treatment and enhanced awareness played a key role in the rapid regression of the peak of COVID-19-infected patients. Conclusion of the Simulation. The SEIR-AQ model can be used to evaluate the development status of the COVID-19 epidemic and has some theoretical value for the prediction of COVID-19.","Yu, Yue Zhou Yuxing Meng Xiangzhong Li Wenfei Xu Yang Hu Manfeng Zhang Jingxiang",Wireless Communications &amp; Mobile Computing (Online),410,27

Recent research seems to raise doubts about whether this requirement is generally fulfilled. Often, replicability of results is defined as repeating a statistically significant result. However, since significance may not imply scientific relevance, dual-criterion study designs that take both aspects into account have been proposed and investigated during the last decade. Originally developed for proof-of-concept trials, the design could be appropriate for phase III trials as well. In fact, a dual-criterion design has been requested for COVID-19 vaccine applications by major health authorities. In this article, replicability of dual-criterion designs is investigated. It turns out that the probability to replicate a significant and relevant result can become as low as 0.5. The replication probability increases if the effect estimator exceeds the minimum relevant effect in the original study by an extra amount.","Rosenkranz, G. K.",Statistics in Medicine,410,1

Protein biomarkers testings require less sample modification process compared to nucleic-acid biomarkers'. However, challenges always are in detecting low-concentration for early-stage diagnosis. Here we present a Rotationally Focused Flow (RFF) method to enhance sensitivity(wavelength shift) of label-free optical sensors by increasing the detection probability of protein-based molecules. The RFF is structured by adding a less-dense fluid to focus the target-fluid in a T-shaped microchannel. It is integrated with label-free silicon microring resonators interacting with biotin-streptavidin. The suggested mechanism has demonstrated 0.19 fM concentration detection along with a significant magnitudes sensitivity enhancement compared to single flow methods. Verified by both CFD simulations and fluorescent flow-experiments, this study provides a promising proof-of-concept platform for next-generation lab-on-a-chip bioanalytics such as ultrafast and early-detection of COVID-19.","Kim, N.; Han, K.; Su, P.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents (n = 963) or their surrogate decision makers had at least 1 ACP conversation with a primary health care practitioner between April 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and made decisions of any changes in code status and hospitalization preferences. METHODS: Health care practitioners conducted ACP conversations proactively with residents or their surrogate decision makers at 15 nursing homes in a metropolitan area of the southwestern United States between April 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020. ACP conversations reviewed code status and goals of care including Do Not Hospitalize (DNH) care preference. Resident age, gender, code status, and DNH choice before and after the ACP conversations were documented. Descriptive data analyses identified significant changes in resident care preferences before and after ACP conversations. RESULTS: Before the most recent ACP discussion, 361 residents were full code status and the rest were Out of Hospital Do Not Resuscitate (DNR). Of the individuals with Out of Hospital DNR, 188 residents also chose DNH. After the ACP conversation, 88 residents opted to change from full code status to Out of Hospital DNR, thereby increasing the percentage of residents with Out of Hospital DNR from 63% to 72%. Almost half of the residents decided to keep or change to the DNH care option after the ACP conversation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Proactive ACP conversations during COVID-19 increased DNH from less than a quarter to almost half among the nursing home residents. Out of Hospital DNR increased by 9%. It is important for all health care practitioners to proactively review ACP with nursing home residents and their surrogate decision makers during a pandemic, thereby ensuring care consistent with personal goals of care and avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations.","Ye, Ping; Fry, Liam; Champion, Jane Dimmitt",J.

Research Design & Methods: The research method is based on a comparative analysis of case studies. To investigate the impact of Covid-19 on small family businesses in Poland, we conducted exploratory studies in 12 entities, based on 29 partially structured interviews with managers of these companies. Findings: The sudden spread of the Covid-19 pandemic around the world took many lives and caused severe restrictions in social and private life, including the business sector. While almost every firm has been affected by the pandemic crisis, small businesses, dominated by family businesses, are particularly vulnerable to it. Our findings show that the Covid-19 crisis affects all companies and presents a completely new challenge that has so far had no precedent. Small family businesses are not prepared for the prolonged state of uncertainty and tension threatening the continuity of their operations, which particularly endangers financial stability and employee maintenance. In responding to the crisis, small family firms cannot refer to previous experience or developed methods and patterns of operation. Implications & Recommendations: Small family businesses must quickly adapt their operations to changing conditions, regardless of their size and industry in which they operate. Covid-19 in small family businesses causes changes in their approach to running the business and family life.

In this study, we examined cancer rehabilitation patient and physician satisfaction with telemedicine visits. We also sought to evaluate the types of provider services that are given during telemedicine visits. OBJECTIVE: To assess overall patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits and explore whether satisfaction varied by contact method (phone or video) and encounter type (new problem, worsening problem, stable/improving problem). DESIGN: Prospective survey study. SETTING: Cancer rehabilitation program at an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Three cancer rehabilitation providers and 155 unique patients participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Provider and patient satisfaction measured by customized surveys. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four encounters with 169 unique patients were scheduled. Of these, 14 were new visits and 170 were follow-up visits. Eighteen encounters (9.8%) were either no shows or rescheduled, making for 166 encounters with 155 unique patients. Patient and provider responses comprised the following: 94.8% of patient responses reported ""quite a bit"" or ""very much"" for the telemedicine visit being a good experience; 63.1% of patient responses reported ""quite a bit"" or ""very much"" for interest in using telemedicine visits in the future; and 83.9% of provider responses reported ""quite a bit"" or ""very much"" for the patient's main problem being addressed by the visit. Providers were more likely to prefer an in-person visit for a new or worsening problem versus a stable/improving problem. The most common services provided were medication prescription/titration and education/counseling. The least common services provided were making of new diagnoses, ordering interventional procedures, and making referrals. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine visits were well received by both patients and providers in a cancer rehabilitation medicine clinic setting. However, in the case of a new or worsening problem, satisfaction declined. These data support that telemedicine visits should be considered essential as part of comprehensive cancer rehabilitation care, especially during a public health crisis.","Chang, Philip J; Jay, Gina M; Kalpakjian, Claire; Andrews, Cody; Smith, Sean",PM &amp; R (Online),410,20

In the central nervous system (CNS), LTP has been recorded at numerous synapses and is a prime candidate mechanism associating activity-dependent plasticity with learning and memory. LTP involves long-lasting increase in synaptic strength with various underlying mechanisms. In the CNS, the predominant type of LTP is believed to be dependent on activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is highly calcium-permeable. However, various forms of NMDAR-independent LTP have been identified in diverse areas of the nervous system. The NMDAR-independent LTP may require activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors (mGluR) or ionotropic receptors other than NMDAR such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#945;7-nAChR), serotonin 5-HT3 receptor or calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR).

Few have looked into the issue that gastrointestinal (GI) procedures may produce an abundance of aerosols. The current process of risk management for clinics is to follow a clinic-specific HVAC formula, which is typically calculated once a year and assumes perfect mixing of the air within the space, to determine how many minutes each procedural room refreshes 99% of its air between procedures when doors are closed. This formula is not designed to fit the complex dynamic of small airborne particle transport and deposition that can potentially carry the virus in clinical conditions. It results in reduced procedure throughput as well as an excess of idle time in clinics that process a large number of short procedures such as outpatient GI centers. We present and tested a new cyber-physical system that continuously monitors airborne particle counts in procedural rooms and also at the same time automatically monitors the procedural rooms' state and flexible endoscope status without interfering with the clinic's workflow. We use our data gathered from over 1500 GI cases in one clinical suite to understand the correlation between air quality and standard procedure types as well as identify the risks involved with any HVAC system in a clinical suite environment. Thanks to this system, we demonstrate that standard GI procedures generate large quantities of aerosols, which can potentially promote viral airborne transmission among patients and healthcare staff. We provide a solution for the clinic to improve procedure turnover times and throughput, as well as to mitigate the risk of airborne transmission of the virus.","Garbey, Marc; Joerger, Guillaume; Furr, Shannon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),410,0

This upheaval required adaptation to both the professional and personal standards of the whole population. What about the level of sexual life during this period of lockdown? Was sexuality at his peak for people confined in couple? Have auto-erotic practices been accentuated for individuals confined without sexual partner? To investigate these issues, we conducted a prospective survey using two online anonymous self-administered questionnaires – one for people living in couples and one for people living alone, without sexual partner. In total, 844 questionnaires were analyzed – 437 for individuals confined in couple and 407 for individuals confined alone – carried out in 554 women and 291 men. Results of this study highlight changes in sexual habits in both couples and those without partners during this period. We also note an impact of the psychological experience link to the situation on sexuality. Whether the confinement is experienced positively or negatively by the subjects, repercussions on sexuality are different. We could have believed, at the beginning of the lockdown, that couples’ sexuality would increase tenfold, and that people confined alone would increase their masturbatory practices but this particular health context has unexpected repercussions on sexuality.","Landry, S.; Chartogne, M.; Landry, A.",Sexologies,410,1

Almost every sector of human-beings and their related activities are severely infected and affected by this COVID-19 pandemic. As days are passing, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic is going to be more severe. The fundamental needs for personal protective equipment (PPEs) are rising drastically all over the world. In India, many non-pharmaceutical companies or organizations such as automobile companies are engaged in producing the PPEs at a very marginal rate. Thus this paper proposes a modeling and optimization framework for sustainable production and waste management (SPWM) decision-making model for COVID-19 medical equipment under uncertainty. To quantify the uncertainties among parameter values, we have taken advantage of the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory. A robust ranking function is presented to obtain a crisp version of it. Furthermore, a novel interactive intuitionistic fuzzy programming approach is developed to solve the proposed SPWM model. An ample opportunity to generate the desired solution sets are also depicted. The performance analysis based on multiple criteria such as savings from baseline, co-efficient of variations, and desirability degrees is also introduced. Practical managerial implications are also discussed based on the significant findings after applying to the real case study data-set. Finally, conclusive remarks and the future research direction are also addressed on behalf of the current contributing study.","Ahmad, Firoz; Ahmad, Shafiq; Zaindin, Mazen",Comput Ind Eng,410,16

Four genes from this module (B4GALNT3, CADM1, DOCK9, and GPR133) are located within the BMD GWAS loci with colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and exhibit altered BMD in mouse knockouts, suggesting that they are causal genetic drivers of BMD in humans.

Based on the analysis of the early COVID-19 banners and the related online comments, this article analyzes the language style patterns of the banners and the mode of banner circulation. The study found that the manner in which the banners are circulated goes beyond a unidirectional path of on-site instant communication. This process is facilitated by social networks and mass media, which, during circulation, twice created a banner upgrade. The upgrades created decontextualization and function extension of the banners, whereas audience feedback triggered an adaptive adjustment of the language style of the banners. This article suggests that the study of the use and spread of banners, especially the early COVID-19 banners, sheds light on the study of mass communication and discourse style, and also how measures to contain pandemics such as COVID-19 can be communicated.","Hongjie, Dong; Minli, Zhou; Che, Dewei; Bodomo, Adams",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),410,16

What factors caused the rapid early pandemic of the COVID-19 in developed countries is the main goal of this study. We collected the main disease indicators and various environmental and economic factors in 61 countries around the world. Our results show that the number of cases is positively correlated with the country's GDP. We further analyzed the factors related to the spread of the disease. They indicate a strong positive correlation between the total patient numbers and the number of airline passengers, with an r value of 0.80. There is also a positive correlation between the number of car ownership and the total patient, with an r value of 0.35. Both the flight passengers and car ownership contribute 66% to the number of total patients. The total death numbers and the number of airline passengers are positively correlated, with an r value of 0.71. A positive correlation between the number of car ownership and the total deaths is with an r value of 0.42. The total contribution of both the flight passengers and car ownership to the number of total deaths is 57%. Our conclusion is that the main cause of the coronavirus pandemic in developed countries is related to the transportation. In other words, the number of travelers determined the early coronavirus pandemic.

METHODS: A multicenter, single-arm, hypothesis-driven trial was planned, according to a phase 2 design, to study the effect of tocilizumab on lethality rates at 14 and 30 days (co-primary endpoints, a priori expected rates being 20 and 35%, respectively). A further prospective cohort of patients, consecutively enrolled after the first cohort was accomplished, was used as a secondary validation dataset. The two cohorts were evaluated jointly in an exploratory multivariable logistic regression model to assess prognostic variables on survival. RESULTS: In the primary intention-to-treat (ITT) phase 2 population, 180/301 (59.8%) subjects received tocilizumab, and 67 deaths were observed overall. Lethality rates were equal to 18.4% (97.5% CI: 13.6-24.0, P = 0.52) and 22.4% (97.5% CI: 17.2-28.3, P < 0.001) at 14 and 30 days, respectively. Lethality rates were lower in the validation dataset, that included 920 patients. No signal of specific drug toxicity was reported. In the exploratory multivariable logistic regression analysis, older age and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio negatively affected survival, while the concurrent use of steroids was associated with greater survival. A statistically significant interaction was found between tocilizumab and respiratory support, suggesting that tocilizumab might be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 days compared with null hypothesis, without significant toxicity. Possibly, this effect could be limited to patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline.

We demonstrated the breadth of early and persistent defects in B cell subsets in moderate/severe COVID-19, including reduced marginal zone-like, memory and transitional B cells, changes we also observed in B cell VHL-deficient mice. This was corroborated by hypoxia-related transcriptional changes in COVID-19 patients, and by similar B cell abnormalities in mice kept in hypoxic conditions, including reduced marginal zone and germinal center B cells.

This cross-sectional study presents an analysis of prospectively gathered data collected at a single tertiary hospital. Sixty-three pregnant women with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) participated in the study. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and blood tests for immunoglobulin G (IgG)-immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. All patients were in the mild or moderate category for COVID-19. Only one placental sample and two of the vaginal secretion samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Except for one, all positive samples were obtained from patients who gave birth by cesarean. All cord blood and amniotic fluid samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Two newborns were screened positive for COVID-19 IgG-IgM within 24 h after delivery, but the RT-PCR tests were negative. A positive RT-PCR result was detected in a neof a mother whose placenta, cord blood, amniotic fluid, and vaginal secretions samples were negative. He died due to pulmonary hemorrhage on the 11th day of life. In conclusion, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can be detectable in the placenta or vaginal secretions of pregnant women. Detection of the virus in the placenta or vaginal secretions may not be associated with neonatal infection. Vaginal delivery may not increase the incidence of neonatal infection, and cesarean may not prevent vertical transmission.

Wolfgang Wodarg and Micheal Yeadon petitioned to withhold emergency use authorization of the BNT162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer, raising concern for female infertility risks but acknowledging the lack of evidence. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration ultimately issued emergency use authorizations, but misinformation claiming that COVID-19 vaccines cause female infertility began circulating on social media, potentially influencing public perception and medical decision making among pregnant patients or those seeking to become pregnant. OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential influence misinformation may have had on public interest in infertility related topics, as analyzed through internet search statistics in the US. METHODS: The Google Trends tool was used to analyze results for the search terms ""infertility,"" ""infertility AND vaccine,"" and ""infertility AND COVID vaccine"" in the US from February 4, 2020 to February 3, 2021. We applied autoregressive integrated moving average models to forecast expected values, comparing them with actual observed values. RESULTS: At peak interest (100), the forecasted relative search volumes interest for the search terms ""infertility,"" ""infertility AND vaccine,"" and ""infertility AND COVID vaccine"" were 45.47 (95% CI, 33.27-57.66; p<0.001), 0.88 (95% CI, 2.87-4.63; p<0.001), and 0.29 (95% CI, -2.25-2.82; p<0.001). The actual relative search volumes at peak searching represented 119.9, 11,251, and 34,900% increases, respectively, when compared with forecasted values. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine misinformation corresponded with increased internet searches for topics related to infertility in the US. Dispelling misinformation and informing patients about the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination may prevent unnecessary vaccine hesitancy or refusal, contributing to successful vaccination efforts.","Sajjadi, Nicholas B; Nowlin, William; Nowlin, Ross; Wenger, David; Beal, John Martin; Vassar, Matt; Hartwell, Micah",J Osteopath Med,410,22

Social distancing measures are essential components of the public health response to influenza pandemics. The objective of these mitigation measures is to reduce transmission, thereby delaying the epidemic peak, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system. We conducted systematic reviews of the evidence base for effectiveness of multiple mitigation measures: isolating ill persons, contact tracing, quarantining exposed persons, school closures, workplace measures/closures, and avoiding crowding. Evidence supporting the effectiveness of these measures was obtained largely from observational studies and simulation studies. Voluntary isolation at home might be a more feasible social distancing measure, and pandemic plans should consider how to facilitate this measure.

This study explored perceived household food waste changes during the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors. A total of 946 survey responses from primary household food purchasers were analyzed. Demographic, COVID-19-related household change, and household food waste data were collected in October 2020. Wilcoxon signed-rank was used to assess differences in perceived food waste. A hierarchical binomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine whether COVID-19-related lifestyle disruptions and food-related behavior changes increased the likelihood of household food waste. A binomial logistic regression was conducted to explore the contribution of different food groups to the likelihood of increased food waste. Perceived food waste, assessed as the estimated percent of food wasted, decreased significantly during the pandemic (z = -7.47, p < 0.001). Food stockpiling was identified as a predictor of increased overall food waste during the pandemic, and wasting fresh vegetables and frozen foods increased the odds of increased food waste. The results indicate the need to provide education and resources related to food stockpiling and the management of specific food groups during periods of disruption to reduce food waste.","Cosgrove, Kelly; Vizcaino, Maricarmen; Wharton, Christopher",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),410,16

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (MPro) has been recognized as a key target for the development of antiviral compounds. Taking advantage of the X-ray crystal complex with reversible covalent inhibitors interacting with the catalytic cysteine 145 (Cys145), we explored flexible docking studies to select alternative compounds able to target this residue as covalent inhibitors. First, docking studies of three known electrophilic compounds led to results consistent with co-crystallized data validating the method for SARS-CoV-2 MPro covalent inhibition. Then, libraries of soft electrophiles (overall 41 757 compounds) were submitted to docking-based virtual screening resulting in the identification of 17 molecules having their electrophilic group close to the Cys145 residue. We also investigated flexible docking studies of a focused approved covalent drugs library including 32 compounds with various electrophilic functional groups. Among them, the calculations resulted in the identification of four compounds, namely dimethylfumarate, fosfomycin, ibrutinib and saxagliptin, able first, to bind to the active site of the protein and second, to form a covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine.","Soulère, Laurent; Barbier, Thibaut; Queneau, Yves",Comput Biol Chem,410,32

Long term outcomes are unknown. This study aims to investigate recovery of loss of smell and the prevalence of parosmia. METHODOLOGY: 6-month follow-up of respondents to an online surgery who self-reported loss of smell at the onset of the CO- VID-19 pandemic in the UK. Information of additional symptoms, recovery of loss of smell and the development of parosmia was collected. RESULTS: 44% of respondents reported at least one other ongoing symptom at 6 months, of which fatigue (n=106) was the most prevalent. There was a significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss where 177 patients stated they had a normal smell of smell while 12 patients reported complete loss of smell. The prevalence of parosmia is 43.1% with median interval of 2.5 months (range 0-6) from the onset of loss of smell. CONCLUSIONS: While many patients recover quickly, some experience long-term deficits with no self-reported improvement at 6 months. Furthermore, there is a high prevalence of parosmia even in those who report at least some recovery of olfactory func- tion. Longer term evaluation of recovery is required.","Hopkins, C; Surda, P; Vaira, L A; Lechien, J R; Safarian, M; Saussez, S; Kumar, N",Rhinology,410,16

The extent of COVID-19 involvement in the central nervous system is not well established, and the presence or the absence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a topic of debate. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present two patients with COVID-19 and concurrent neurological symptoms. Our first patient is a 31-year-old man who had flu-like symptoms due to COVID-19 and later developed an acute-onset severe headache and loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with a Hunt and Hess grade 3 subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Our second patient is a 62-year-old woman who had an ischaemic stroke with massive haemorrhagic conversion requiring a decompressive hemicraniectomy. Both patients' CSF was repeatedly negative on real-time PCR analysis despite concurrent neurological disease. CONCLUSION: Our report shows that patients' CSF may be devoid of viral particles even when they test positive for COVID-19 on a nasal swab. Whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in CSF may depend on the systemic disease severity and the degree of the virus' nervous tissue tropism and should be examined in future studies.","Al Saiegh, Fadi; Ghosh, Ritam; Leibold, Adam; Avery, Michael B; Schmidt, Richard F; Theofanis, Thana; Mouchtouris, Nikolaos; Philipp, Lucas; Peiper, Stephen C; Wang, Zi-Xuan; Rincon, Fred; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula I; Jabbour, Pascal; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Gooch, M Reid",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,410,27

The CRISPR-based EC platform achieved 100% accuracy for detection of viral RNA and showed an excellent correlation with RT-qPCR using 30 clinical saliva samples. The serology EC platform obtained 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, as well as 94% specificity and 82% sensitivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM with 112 clinical plasma samples. These data demonstrate that integration of CRISPR-based RNA detection and serological assays with antifouling nanocomposite-based EC sensors enables performance as good or better than traditional laboratory-based techniques.","Puig, Helena de; Timilsina, Sanjay Sarma; Rainbow, Joshua; Jolly, Pawan; Najjar, Devora; Durr, Nolan; Alter, Galit; Li, Jonathan Z.; Yu, Xu G.; Walt, David R.; Estrela, Pedro; Collins, James J.; Ingber, Donald E.",,410,1

The proposed tests are applied in the full sample case as well as in the framework of random right censoring. We investigate the finite sample performance of the new tests using a comprehensive Monte Carlo study. In both the absence and presence of censoring, it is found that the newly proposed classes of tests outperform competing tests against the majority of the distributions considered. In the cases where censoring is present we consider various censoring distributions. Some remarks on the asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are included. The paper presents another result of independent interest; the test initially proposed in Krit (2014) for use with full samples is amended to allow for testing for the Weibull distribution in the presence of censoring. The techniques developed in the paper are illustrated using two practical examples. In the first, we consider the survival times of patients with a certain type of leukemia. The second example is concerned with the initial remission times of leukemia patients, where the observed remission times are subject to random right censoring.

The objective of this study was to describe the PK/PD relationship of chloroquine and its major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, in a P. vivax volunteer infection study. We analyzed data from 24 healthy subjects who were inoculated with blood-stage P. vivax malaria and administered a standard treatment course of chloroquine. The PK of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine was described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The relationship between plasma and whole blood concentrations of chloroquine and P. vivax parasitemia was characterized by a PK/PD delayed response model, where the equilibration half-lives were 32.7 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 27.4-40.5) for plasma data and 24.1 hours (95% CI 19.0-32.7) for whole blood data. The estimated parasite multiplication rate was 17 folds per 48 hours (95% CI 14-20) and maximum parasite killing rate by chloroquine was 0.213 hour-1 (95% CI 0.196-0.230), translating to a parasite clearance half-life of 4.5 hours (95% CI 4.1-5.0) and a parasite reduction ratio of 400 every 48 hours (95% CI 320-500). This is the first study that characterized the PK/PD relationship between chloroquine plasma and whole blood concentrations and P. vivax clearance using a semimechanistic population PK/PD modeling. This PK/PD model can be used to optimize dosing scenarios and to identify optimal dosing regimens for chloroquine where resistance to chloroquine is increasing.","Abd-Rahman, Azrin N; Marquart, Louise; Gobeau, Nathalie; Kümmel, Anne; Simpson, Julie A; Chalon, Stephan; Möhrle, Jörg J; McCarthy, James S",Clin Pharmacol Ther,410,24

There is no standardized approach for integration with hospitals for outbreak response. Previously, we described collaboration between a hospital and regional facilities. As a component of our COVID-19 Outbreak Response, we describe the impact of virtual daily rounds as an efficient and effective tool for facility outbreak in Central Virginia. Methods: At this facility, 82 (60%) residents were infected. Our team rapidly deployed technology to support staff at the facility. Virtual daily rounds created a systematic approach for patient care. The goals of virtual daily rounds include (1) efficiently facilitating HIPAA-compliant communication between nursing and all licensed independent providers, (2) rapid identification of clinical decline, (3) facilitation of care escalation, (4) facilitating bidirectional transfers, and (5) rapid and efficient identification of patients appropriate for telemedicine pulmonary consultation. Results: The outbreak remained active 6 weeks; 82 of 136 (60%) residents were infected, and 36 (44%) COVID-19 positive residents were seen by telemedicine consultation. Fifty-seven (70%) residents remained in-facility for treatment. Twenty-one residents died (15%); 10 in facility, 11 in hospital. Of those seen in telemedicine consultation, 24 (69%) remained on the treat-in-place protocol with goal-concordant care. These hospitalization and mortality rates are significantly lower than similar outbreaks reported. Discussion and Conclusion: We have since instituted this system at seven other facilities. A model of virtual daily rounding holds promise for decreasing mortality/hospitalization in this vulnerable population through systematically identifying patients most appropriate for telemedicine and cultivating close collaboration between hospitals and nursing homes.","Archbald-Pannone, Laurie; Harris, Drew; Steele, Rebecca; Kaur, Jasveen; Albero, Kim; Mutter, Justin; Cattell-Gordon, David; Rheuban, Karen",Telemed. j. e. health,410,33

In the present study, we investigated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, which plays a major role in susceptibility to viral infections, and the mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: data of allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B and -C and COVID-19 mortality were obtained for 74 countries from the Allele Frequency Net Database and worldometer.info. Association between allele frequency of each HLA and mortality was assessed by linear regression followed by multivariable regression. Subsequently, association of HLA-C*05 to its receptor KIR2DS4fl, expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, and differential mortality to historic pandemics were analyzed. RESULTS: HLA-A*01, -B*07, -B*08, -B*44 and -C*05 were significantly associated with the risk of deaths (adjusted p = 0.040, 0.00081, 0.047, 0.0022, 0.00032, respectively), but only HLA-C*05 remained statistically significant (p = 0.000027) after multivariable regression. A 1% increase in the allele frequency of HLA-C*05 was associated with an increase of 44 deaths/million. Countries with different mortality could be categorized by the distribution of HLA-C*05 and its receptor KIR2DS4fl, which in combination cause NK cell-induced hyperactive immune response. Countries with similar ethnic and/or geographic background responded in a similar pattern to each pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: we demonstrated that allele frequency of HLA-C*05 and the distribution pattern with its receptor KIR2DS4fl strongly correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Host genetic variance of innate immunity may contribute to the difference in mortality among various countries and further investigation using patient samples is warranted.","Sakuraba, Atsushi; Haider, Haider; Sato, Toshiro",Viruses,410,1

One response is to re-partner tazobactam with cefepime, which is easier to protect, being less ß-lactamase labile, and to use a high-dose and prolonged infusion. On this basis, Wockhardt are developing cefepime/tazobactam (WCK 4282) as a 2+2 g q8h combination with a 90-min infusion. METHODS: The activity of cc cefepime/tazobactam was assessed, with other tazobactam combinations as comparators, against 1632 Enterobacterales, 745 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 450 other non-fermenters, as submitted to the UK National Reference Laboratory. These were categorised by carbapenemase-gene detection and interpretive reading of phenotypes, with MICs determined by British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy agar dilution. RESULTS: Although higher breakpoints may be justifiable, based on the pharmacodynamics, the results were reviewed against current cefepime criteria. On this basis, cefepime/tazobactam was broadly active against Enterobacterales with AmpC enzymes and extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs), even when they had ertapenem resistance, suggesting porin loss. At 8+8 mg/L, activity extended to > 90% of Enterobacterales with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemases, although the MICs for KPC producers belonging to the international Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 lineage were higher; metallo-ß-lactamase producers remained resistant. Cefepime/tazobactam was less active than ceftolozane/tazobactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with AmpC de-repression or high-level efflux but achieved wider antipseudomonal coverage than piperacillin/tazobactam. Activity against other non-fermenters was species-specific. CONCLUSION: Overall, cefepime/tazobactam had a spectrum exceeding those of piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam and resembling or exceeding that of carbapenems. Used as a 'new-combination of old-agents' it has genuine potential to be 'carbapenem-sparing'.","Mushtaq, Shazad; Garello, Paolo; Vickers, Anna; Woodford, Neil; Livermore, David M",Int J Antimicrob Agents,410,1

Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4%) patients. 100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. All patients were given antiviral therapy. 19(15.2%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. By February 18, 47(37.6%) patients were discharged and none of patients died. Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16). CONCLUSION: In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom. Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition. Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.","Wang, Ruirui; Pan, Min; Zhang, Xiumei; Han, Mingfeng; Fan, Xiaoyun; Zhao, Fengde; Miao, Manli; Xu, Jing; Guan, Minglong; Deng, Xia; Chen, Xu; Shen, Leilei",Int J Infect Dis,410,1

We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437. FINDINGS: We collected data for 1139 cases and 11â390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62-2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23-1·73) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77-1·15). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37). Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80). The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.

In late 2020, several variants of concern emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), the South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California variants of interest (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. On the basis of our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 coronavirus disease 2019 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021, we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital (Houston, TX) patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency (aggregate of 1.1%) in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence, frequency, and medical impact of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination.","Long, S Wesley; Olsen, Randall J; Christensen, Paul A; Subedi, Sishir; Olson, Robert; Davis, James J; Saavedra, Matthew Ojeda; Yerramilli, Prasanti; Pruitt, Layne; Reppond, Kristina; Shyer, Madison N; Cambric, Jessica; Finkelstein, Ilya J; Gollihar, Jimmy; Musser, James M",Am J Pathol,410,15

Seven male Mongrel dogs received single-fraction 33 Gy SABR. We designed the en-bloc circular target of total PVs and LA posterior wall to avoid the esophagus. The circular box lesion included the LA roof and ridge, low posterior wall, and posterior interatrial septum. At 6 weeks or 4 months post-SABR, electrical isolation of the SABR lesion was confirmed using LA posterior wall pacing, and histopathological review was performed. Electrical isolation of all PVs and the LA posterior wall was achieved in three of five dogs in the 4-month group. There was one target failure and one sudden death at 15 weeks. Although two dogs in the 6-week group failed to achieve electrical lesion isolation, the irradiated atrial myocardium showed diffuse hemorrhage with inflammatory cell infiltration. In successfully isolated 4-month model dogs, we observed transmural fibrotic scarring with extensive fibrosis on irradiated atrial tissue. The findings suggest that this novel circular box-design radiotherapy technique using SABR could be applied to humans after further studies are conducted to confirm safety.","Chang, Ji Hyun; Cha, Myung-Jin; Seo, Jeong-Wook; Kim, Hak Jae; Park, So-Yeon; Kim, Byoung Hyuck; Lee, Euijae; Kim, Moo-Kang; Yoon, Hye-Sun; Oh, Seil",Sci Rep,410,13

It is argued that developing more sensitive, easy to administer, and valid MCI screening tools for use in primary care settings may initiate timely clinical and personal care planning and treatment, enabling early access to programs and services. Including functional competence measures in screening tests makes them more ecologically valid and may help to identify cognitive deficits at an earlier stage. OBJECTIVE: We aim to conduct a preliminary evaluative study comparing the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the BrainFx Screen (referred to as SCREEN hereafter), a novel digital tool designed to assess functional competence and detect early signs of cognitive impairment, with the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment, a validated and highly sensitive tool that detects MCI in the older adult population. We will also investigate the perceived usefulness and integration of the SCREEN into primary care practice to identify demonstrable impacts on clinical workflow and health care providers' (HCP) perceptions of its success as a screening tool. Patients' perceptions of completing the SCREEN and its impact on their quality of life will also be explored. METHODS: This study has a concurrent, mixed methods, prospective, and quasi-experimental design. Participants will be recruited from 5 primary care family health teams (FHTs; defined by multidisciplinary practice and capitated funding) across southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants will include HCPs, patients, care partners, and FHT administrative executives. Patients 55 years and older with no history of diagnoses for MCI, dementia, or Alzheimer disease rostered in one of the FHTs participating in the study will be eligible to participate. Their care partners will help triangulate the qualitative data collected from patients. Participating FHTs will identify an occupational therapist from their site to participate in the study; this HCP will both administer the research protocol and participate in semistructured in-depth interviews and questionnaires. Principal component analysis will be conducted on the SCREEN data to understand the test components better. Tests comparing sensitivity, specificity, and test-retest reliability will assess the validity of SCREEN as a screening tool for MCI. RESULTS: This paper describes the study protocol and its activities to date. Data collection was halted early because of COVID-19 restrictions on research activity, and data analysis is currently in progress. CONCLUSIONS: At the end of the project, we anticipate having an initial comparative evaluation of the SCREEN as a tool for early detection of MCI in primary care older adult patient populations. Resource constraints on this research study limit our ability to conduct a randomized controlled trial; however, the results will assist developers of the SCREEN in determining whether rigorous controlled testing is warranted.

The death toll associated with the pandemic is increasing day by day. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus and its N terminal domain (NTD) of Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) binds to the viral (+) sense RNA and results in virus ribonucleoprotien complex, essential for the virus replication. The N protein is composed of a serine-rich linker region sandwiched between NTD and C terminal (CTD). These terminals play a role in viral entry and its processing post entry. The NTD of SARS-CoV-2 N protein forms orthorhombic crystals and binds to the viral genome. Therefore, there is always a quest to target RNA binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NTD-N-protein which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as potential treatments for is still under debate globally because of some side effects associated with it. This study involves the In silico interactions of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine with the NTD-N-protein of SARS-CoV-2. With the help of various computational methods, we have explored the potential role of both of these antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients by comparing the efficacy of both of the drugs to bind to NTD-N-protein. In our research Hydroxychloroquine exhibited potential inhibitory effects of NTD-N-protein with binding energy -7.28 kcal/mol than Chloroquine (-6.30 kcal/mol) at SARS-CoV-2 receptor recognition of susceptible cells. The outcomes of this research strongly appeal for in vivo trials of Hydroxychloroquine for the patients infected with . Furthermore, the recommended doses of Hydroxychloroquine may reduce the chances of catching to the healthcare workers and staff who are in contact with or delivering direct care to coronavirus patients as long as they have not been diagnosed with . We further hypothesize that the comparative NTD-N-protein -drug docking interactions may help to understand the comparative efficacy of other candidate repurposing drugs until discovery of a proper vaccine.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In patients with known malignancies, in addition to constraints in routine healthcare, the risk of being susceptible to developing severe forms of the disease is of grave concern. While follow-up studies on survivors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2003 outbreak revealed increased susceptibility to infections, tumours and cardiovascular abnormalities, recent studies implicating angiopoietin 2 in induction of inflammatory intussusceptive angiogenesis and diffuse alveolar damage in COVID-19 patients raises the possibility of progression of carcinogenetic processes in patients with known malignancies. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) mediated cellular entry of SARS-Cov2 leads to receptor shedding of ACE-2 and disrupts the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis (RAAS). This augments the pro-inflammatory and proliferative effects of RAAS, while attenuating the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative angiotensin 1-7 /Mas pathway. Angiopoietin-2, a molecule responsible for angiogenesis and cancer progression which corelates with tumour load in certain cancers, is upregulated by angiotensin 2-AT1 Receptor axis. Tumour microenvironment-comprising of various cells, blood vessels and extra cellular matrix which express the RAAS peptides-plays a key role in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. Angiotensin 2 induces the formation of a desmoplastic environment, favouring cancer cell growth. ACE-2 downregulation causes bradykinin accumulation which may exert its proliferative action via mitogen activated protein kinase pathways which has established roles in cancers of breast and kidney. In addition to cytokine storm causing organ damage, acute inflammation in COVID-19 may also cause epithelial mesenchymal transition and heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation, both of which are key mediators in cancer signalling pathways. We hypothesise that SARS-Cov2, by impacting the RAAS and immune system, has the potential to cause tumour cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion and metastasis, thereby increasing the possibility of cancer progression in patients with known malignancies.","Saha, Aritra; Anirvan, Prajna",Ecancermedicalscience,410,1

Both parameters are related to Achilles tendon and Plantar Fascia unloading. The shape of an outsole with a forefoot rocker is described with multiple rocker design parameters. The aim of this research is, to determine the relation between different forefoot rocker radii on peak DF and peak PFM at a self-selected walking speed. METHODS: 10 participants walked in standard shoes and three experimental pairs of shoes with different forefoot rocker radii. Lower extremity kinematics and kinetics were collected while walking on an instrumented treadmill at preferred walking speed and analysed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) (&#945; = .05; post-hoc &#945; = .05/6). RESULTS: Peak value analyses showed significant decreases in peak DF, peak PFM, and peak ankle power generation for the rocker conditions. No relevant significant differences were found in spatio-temporal parameters and total work at the ankle joint. SPM showed a significant decrease (% gait cycle) in DF (40-69 %), PFM (7-15 %; 41-68 %; 69-81 %), ankle power (10-15 %; 32-51 %; 55-64 %; 64-67 %; 72-80 %) and foot-to-horizontal angle (FHA) (0-4 %; 40-62 %; 92-100 %) and an increased shank-to-vertical angle (SVA) (44-84 %) for the rocker conditions. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that rocker shoes with a proximally placed apex significantly reduce DF and PFM during the third rocker compared with control shoes. This effect is mainly explained by a change in the FHA. Smaller radii cause the largest reductions in DF and PFM, so therefore, a uniform standardisation of the forefoot rocker radius is essential.","van Kouwenhove, L; Verkerke, G J; Postema, K; Dekker, R; Hijmans, J M",Gait Posture,410,16

METHODS: Consecutive patients diagnosed with PFis and asymptomatic subjects were enrolled in the present study. Both groups underwent clinical, ultrasound (US), and SWE evaluation. A plantar fascia thickness > 4 mm was considered pathognomonic of PFis. SWE stiffness elasticity (Young's modulus in kPa and shear wave velocity in m/s) was measured 1 cm distally from the calcaneal insertion. Correlations with VAS and the 17-Italian Foot Function Index (17-FFI) were determined. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria for the patient group and were enrolled in the study, and 21 healthy subjects were used as a control group. Statistically significant differences were found for shear wave velocity between the patient and the control group, with SWE findings of 3.8 (5.1; 1.5) m/s and 4.7 (4.07; 7.04) m/s, respectively (p = 0.006). Strong positive correlations were found between the SWE findings and both the pain and the functional scale (VAS: p = 0.001; FFI: p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: SWE allows quantitative assessment of the stiffness of the plantar fascia and can show PFis alterations, increasing the diagnostic performance of B-mode US. In addition, SWE shows a strong correlation with clinical scores, improving patient assessment and follow-up.","Schillizzi, Giuseppe; Alviti, Federica; D039,; Ercole, Chiara; Elia, Daniela; Agostini, Francesco; Mangone, Massimiliano; Paoloni, Marco; Bernetti, Andrea; Pacini, Patrizia; Polti, Giorgia; Minafra, Paolo; Cantisani, Vito",,410,1

Chronic absenteeism due to health concerns was identified as a barrier to academic success. METHODS: The DOE and a public university created Hawaii Keiki: Healthy and Ready to Learn (HK), a program to provide school-based services for 170 Title 1 schools in urban and rural settings and build momentum for statewide collective action. HK has maintained support from public and private entities to address student health. RESULTS: This paper describes 5 years of program development, implementation, and continuing challenges. Most recently in 2020-2021, HK pivoted in the face of school campus closings due to COVID-19 with strategic plans, including telehealth, to move forward in this changed school environment. CONCLUSIONS: The HK program has increased awareness of students' needs and is addressing the imperative to build health services within public schools. The multipronged approach of building awareness of need, providing direct services, educating future care providers, and supporting sound policy development, has an impact that goes beyond any one individual area.","Davis, Katherine Finn; Loos, Joanne R; Boland, Mary G",J. sch. health,410,20

While do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decisions are made in advance in certain medical situations, in particular in the setting of poor prognosis like in advanced oncology, the discussion of DNR in relation to acute medical conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic in this example, might impose ethical dilemmas to the patient and family, healthcare providers (HCPs) including physicians and nurses, and to the institution. The literature on DNR decisions in the more recent pandemics and outbreaks is scarce. DNR was only discussed amid the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, with clear global recommendations. The unprecedented condition of the COVID-19 pandemic leaves healthcare systems worldwide confronting tough decisions. DNR has been implemented in some countries where the healthcare system is limited in capacity to admit, and thus intubating and resuscitating patients when needed is jeopardized. Some countries were forced to adopt a unilateral DNR policy for certain patient groups. Younger age was used as a discriminator in some, while general medical condition with anticipated good outcome was used in others. The ethical challenge of how to balance patient autonomy vs. beneficence, equality vs. equity, is a pressing concern. In the current difficult situation, when cases top 100 million globally and the death toll surges past 2.7 million, difficult decisions are to be made. Societal rather than individual benefits might prevail. Pre-hospital triaging of cases, engagement of other sectors including mental health specialists and religious scholars to support patients, families, and HCPs in the frontline might help in addressing the psychological stress these groups might encounter in addressing DNR in the current situation.","Sultan, Hala; Mansour, Razan; Shamieh, Omar; Al-Tabba039,; Amal,; Al-Hussaini, Maysa",Front Public Health,410,24

As neoadjuvant therapy has become a standard for triple negative and HER2+ EBC, it focusses on luminal EBC. RECENT FINDINGS: Gene expression assays have become standard of care in luminal EBC, at least for patients with node negative disease. Two prospective randomized clinical trials, TAILORx (Oncotype DX) and MINDACT (MammaPrint) have presented additional analyses underlining the clinical utility of the tests. In times of COVID-19, immunohistochemically determined ER, PR, and Ki67 and early Ki67 response to endocrine therapy can be used to safely allocate patients for preoperative endocrine therapy and delay surgeries if resources are scarce. In patients with luminal high-risk disease, adding a CDK 4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib) improves patient outcome already after short-term follow-up. SUMMARY: Determination of recurrence risk will remain important in luminal EBC for optimal therapy decisions. In the future, risk-adapted treatment concepts will include decision making for chemotherapy but also for endocrine-based approaches.","Harbeck, Nadia",Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,410,1

These spillover events underlie the importance of detecting known and novel CoVs circulating in reservoir host species and determining CoV prevalence and distribution, allowing improved prediction of spillover events or where a human-reservoir interface should be closely monitored. To increase the likelihood of detecting all circulating genera and strains, we have modified primers published by Watanabe et al. in 2010 to generate a semi-nested pan-CoV PCR assay. Representatives from the four coronavirus genera (&#945;-CoVs, ß-CoVs, Î³-CoVs and Î´-CoVs) were tested and all of the in-house CoVs were detected using this assay. After comparing both assays, we found that the updated assay reliably detected viruses in all genera of CoVs with high sensitivity, whereas the sensitivity of the original assay was lower. Our updated PCR assay is an important tool to detect, monitor and track CoVs to enhance viral surveillance in reservoir hosts.","Holbrook, Myndi G; Anthony, Simon J; Navarrete-Macias, Isamara; Bestebroer, Theo; Munster, Vincent J; van Doremalen, Neeltje",Viruses,410,16

The pediatric age group comprises only less than 5% of total COVID-19 worldwide, therefore, large studies in this population are unlikely in the immediate future. Hence, we planned to synthesize the current data that will help in a better understanding of COVID-19 in children. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We included studies reporting disease characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients aged less than 19 years. We performed a random-effect meta-analysis to provide pooled estimates of various disease characteristics. RESULTS: 27 studies (4857 patients) fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review, from a total of 883 records. About half of the patients had each of fever and cough, 11% (6-17%) had fast breathing, and 6-13% had gastrointestinal manifestations. Most of the patients had mild to moderate disease, and only 4% had a severe or critical illness. Leukopenia was the commonest reported laboratory abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: Even among the symptomatic COVID-19 cases, severe manifestations are seen in very few children.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct surveillance of influenza and other monitored respiratory conditions and to report on vaccine uptake and effectiveness using nationally representative surveillance data extracted from primary care computerized medical records systems. We also aim to have general practices collect virology and serology specimens and to participate in trials and other interventional research. METHODS: The RCGP RSC network comprises over 1700 general practices in England and Wales. We will extract pseudonymized data twice weekly and are migrating to a system of daily extracts. First, we will collect pseudonymized, routine, coded clinical data for the surveillance of monitored and unexpected conditions; data on vaccine exposure and adverse events of interest; and data on approved research study outcomes. Second, we will provide dashboards to give general practices feedback about levels of care and data quality, as compared to other network practices. We will focus on collecting data on influenza-like illness, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and suspected COVID-19. Third, approximately 300 practices will participate in the 2020-2021 virology and serology surveillance; this will include responsive surveillance and long-term follow-up of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Fourth, member practices will be able to recruit volunteer patients to trials, including early interventions to improve COVID-19 outcomes and point-of-care testing. Lastly, the legal basis for our surveillance with PHE is Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002; other studies require appropriate ethical approval. RESULTS: The RCGP RSC network has tripled in size; there were previously 100 virology practices and 500 practices overall in the network and we now have 322 and 1724, respectively. The Oxford-RCGP Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) secure networks enable the daily analysis of the extended network; currently, 1076 practices are uploaded. We are implementing a central swab distribution system for patients self-swabbing at home in addition to in-practice sampling. We have converted all our primary care coding to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) coding. Throughout spring and summer 2020, the network has continued to collect specimens in preparation for the winter or for any second wave of COVID-19 cases. We have collected 5404 swabs and detected 623 cases of COVID-19 through extended virological sampling, and 19,341 samples have been collected for serology. This shows our preparedness for the winter season. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a groundswell of general practices joining our network. It has also created a permissive environment in which we have developed the capacity and capability of the national primary care surveillance systems and our unique public health institute, the RCGP and University of Oxford collaboration.","de Lusignan, Simon; Lopez Bernal, Jamie; Byford, Rachel; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Ferreira, Filipa; Akinyemi, Oluwafunmi; Andrews, Nick; Campbell, Helen; Dabrera, Gavin; Deeks, Alexandra; Elliot, Alex J; Krajenbrink, Else; Liyanage, Harshana; McGagh, Dylan; Okusi, Cecilia; Parimalanathan, Vaishnavi; Ramsay, Mary; Smith, Gillian; Tripathy, Manasa; Williams, John; Victor, William; Zambon, Maria; Howsam, Gary; Nicholson, Brian David; Tzortziou Brown, Victoria; Butler, Christopher C; Joy, Mark; Hobbs, F D Richard",JMIR Public Health Surveill,410,16

METHODS: We implemented FA-PP for clinical use in the microbiology laboratory in March 2020. We performed a retrospective analysis on a consecutive cohort of adult patient hospitalized in ICUs between March 2020 and May 2020. The respiratory specimens included sputum, blind bronchoalveolar lavage (BBAL) and protected specimen brush (PSB). We performed conventional culture and FA-PP in parallel. RESULTS: We analyzed 147 samples from 92 patients (88% had COVID-19). At least one pathogen was detected in 46% (68/147) of samples by FA-PP, and 39% (57/147) of samples by culture. The overall percent agreement between FA-PP and culture results was 98% (93-100%). Bacteria with semi-quantitative FA-PP results &#8805; 105 copies/mL for PSB, &#8805; 106 copies/mL for BBAL and &#8805; 107 copies/mL for sputa, reached clinically significant thresholds for growth in 90%, 100% and 91% of cultures, respectively. FA-PP detected resistance markers, including mecA/C, blaCTX-M and blaVIM. Median turnaround time was significantly shorter for FA-PP than for culture. CONCLUSIONS: FA-PP may therefore constitute a faster approach to the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia in patients hospitalized in ICUs.","Caméléna, François; Poncin, Thibaut; Dudoignon, Emmanuel; Salmona, Maud; Le Goff, Jérôme; Donay, Jean-Luc; Lafaurie, Matthieu; Darmon, Michael; Azoulay, Elie; Plaud, Benoît; Mebazaa, Alexandre; Depret, François; Jacquier, Hervé; Berçot, Béatrice",Int. j. infect. dis,410,16

There is little comparative data looking for the effect of HA-AKI on mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and a control group of general population suffering from Covid-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HA-AKI development was assessed in a group of stage 3-5 CKD patients and control group without CKD among adult patients hospitalized for Covid-19. The role of AKI development on the outcome (in-hospital mortality and admission to the intensive care unit [ICU]) of patients with and without CKD was compared. RESULTS: Among 621 hospitalized patients (age 60 [IQR:47-73]), women: 44.1%), AKI developed in 32.5% of the patients, as stage 1 in 84.2%, stage 2 in 8.4% and, stage 3 in 7.4%. AKI developed in 48.0 % of CKD patients, whereas in 17.6% of patients without CKD. CKD patients with HA-AKI had the highest mortality rate of 41.1 % compared to 14.3 % of patients with HA-AKI but no CKD (p<0.001). However, patients with AKI+non-CKD had similar rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death rate as patients with CKD without AKI. Adjusted mortality risk of the AKI+non-CKD group (HR: 9.0, 95%CI:1.9-44.2) and AKI+CKD group (HR: 7.9, 95%CI:1.9-33.3) were significantly higher than non-AKI+non-CKD group. CONCLUSION: AKI frequently develops in hospitalized patients due to Covid-19 and is associated with high mortality. HA-AKI has worse outcome whether it develops in patients with or without CKD, but the worst outcome was seen in AKI+CKD patients.","ÖztÜrk, SavaS; Turgutalp, Kenan; Arici, Mustafa; ÇetInkaya, Hakki; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza; Aydin, ZekI; SoypaÇaci, ZekI; Bora, Feyza; Kara, Ekrem; CebecI, Egemen; Özler, Tuba ElIf; DÖlarslan, MÜrSIde Esra; SIpahI, SavaS; Ayar, Yavuz; SahIn, IdrIs; BakirdÖGen, Serkan; Islam, Mahmud; GÖrgÜlÜ, Numan; ÖGÜtmen, MelIke BetÜl; SengÜl, Erkan; GÜngÖr, Özkan; SeyahI, Nurhan; TokgÖz, BÜlent; OdabaS, AlI Riza; Tonbul, HalIl ZekI; Sezer, SIren; Yildiz, AlaattIn; AteS, Kenan",,410,20

The SARS-CoV-2 virus recognizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of human cells through its spike protein. It has been reported that the coronavirus can mildly infect cats, and ferrets, and perhaps dogs while not pigs, mice, chicken and ducks. Differences in viral infectivity among different species or individuals could be due to amino acid differences at key positions of the host proteins that interact with the virus, the immune response, expression levels of host proteins and translation efficiency of the viral proteins among other factors. Here, first we have addressed the importance that sequence variants of different animal species, human individuals and virus isolates have on the interaction between the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Second, we have looked at viral translation efficiency by using the tRNA adaptation index. We find that integration of both interaction energy with ACE2 and translational efficiency explains animal infectivity. Humans are the top species in which SARS-CoV-2 is both efficiently translated as well as optimally interacting with ACE2. We have found some viral mutations that increase affinity for hACE and some hACE2 variants affecting ACE2 stability and virus binding. These variants suggest that different sensitivities to coronavirus infection in humans could arise in some cases from allelic variability affecting ACE2 stability and virus binding.","Delgado Blanco, Javier; Hernandez-Alias, Xavier; Cianferoni, Damiano; Serrano, Luis",PLoS Comput Biol,410,17

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified hospitalized adults with a diagnosis of coronavirus in a large US administrative database, the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample, from January 1, 2016, to December 3, 2017, to study patient demographic characteristics, clinical comorbidities, and outcomes (in-hospital mortality and health care resource utilization) based on the presence or absence of CVD. RESULTS: A total of 21,300 hospitalized adults with a diagnosis of coronavirus in 2016 and 2017 from all across the United States were included in the final analysis; the mean age was 63.6 years, 11,033 (51.8%) were female, and 15,911 (74.7%) had public insurers. Among these hospitalized patients, 11,930 (56.0%) had a diagnosis of CVD. Compared with those without CVD, the patients with CVD were older (70.1 vs 55.4 years) and had higher Charlson comorbidity index scores (2.5 vs 1.6) and Elixhauser comorbidity index scores (4.3 vs 2.4) (all P<.001). After multivariable risk adjustment, patients with CVD had higher mortality than those without CVD (5.3% [632 of 11,930] vs 1.5% [140 of 9370]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.4]; P=.008). The mean length of hospital stay (6.9 vs 6.1 days; P=.003), hospital charges ($78,377 vs $66,538; P=.002), and discharge to nursing home (24.6% [2945 of 11,930] vs 12.9% [1208 of 9370]; P<.001) were higher in those with CVD compared with the patients without CVD. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular disease was present in a notable proportion of hospitalized patients with coronavirus in the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 era in United States and was associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality and health care resource utilization.","Agarwal, Manyoo A; Ziaeian, Boback; Lavie, Carl J; Fonarow, Gregg C",Mayo Clin Proc,410,10

We wanted to describe the clinical course and determine the mortality rate in our institution's intensive care units. Methods: To this end, we performed a retrospective cohort study of 50 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at a large German tertiary university hospital. Clinical features are reported with a focus on ICU interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, prone positioning and extracorporeal organ support. Outcome is presented using a 7-point ordinal scale on day 28 and 60 following ICU admission. Results: The median age was 64 years, 78% were male. LDH and D-Dimers were elevated, and patients were low on Vitamin D. ARDS incidence was 75%, and 43/50 patients needed invasive ventilation. 22/50 patients intermittently needed prone positioning, and 7/50 required ECMO. The interval from onset of the first symptoms to admission to the hospital and to the ICU was shorter in non-survivors than in survivors. By day 60 after ICU admission, 52% of the patients had been discharged. 60-day mortality rate was 32%;37% for ventilated patients, and 42% for those requiring both: ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Conclusions: Early deterioration might be seen as a warning signal for unfavourable outcome. Lung-protective ventilation including prone positioning remain the mainstay of the treatment.","Heim, M.; Lahmer, T.; Rasch, S.; Kriescher, S.; Berg-Johnson, W.; Fuest, K.; Kapfer, B.; Schneider, G.; Spinner, C.

It has been observed that prophylactic measures such as goggle or face shield are unable to offer complete protection against ocular transmission of SRS-CoV-2. Hence, it is hypothesized that topical ocular prophylaxis using biocompatible polymers with reported in-vitro and in-vivo evidence of ACE inhibition and antiviral activity appears to be a promising strategy for preventing ocular transmission of Covid-19 to healthcare workers. They are capable of binding to ACE-2 receptors which may provide highly potential trails to block virus entry to host cells. Further biopolymers imparting antiviral activities greatly improve their protective performance. They not only provide prolong protection but also are safe for long-term use.

Conocer los riesgos para la salud reproductiva es un imperativo para la práctica obstétrica y ginecológica. Esta investigación analiza los riesgos maternos y perinatales asociados a COVID-19, con el objetivo de identificar desafíos que la enfermedad plantea a la práctica de la matronería. MÉTODOS Revisión narrativa. Se consultaron artículos científicos de fuentes primarias indexados en las bases Scielo, Pubmed, Scope, WOS, mediante los siguientes términos de búsqueda: ""embarazo"" ""transmisión vertical"" ""salud materna y perinatal"", ""riesgos maternos y perinatales"" ""lactancia materna"", COVID-19"", ""Coronavirus"". Se realizaron 3 fases de selección. Los tópicos de análisis fueron: Transmisión vertical, Riesgo materno y perinatal, Lactancia materna. RESULTADOS. En mujeres embarazadas las formas severas de COVID-19 se presentan en presencia de enfermedades crónicas. A nivel perinatal el riesgo mayor es el parto prematuro, generalmente por indicación médica y por cesárea. Aunque no hay evidencias de transmisión vertical, tampoco puede descartarse. Los riesgos neonatales se relacionan con el contagio por proximidad y con medidas restrictivas que pueden afectar la lactancia materna y la interacción madre-hija(o). CONCLUSIONES. La COVID-19 aporta varios desafíos para la práctica de la matronería: implementación de métodos de prevención del contagio a la gestante y a su entorno cercano; adecuación de la preparación al parto en caso de positividad; prevención del estrés y desgaste emocional materno desde el inicio de la gestación hasta el postparto; adecuación de cuidados al recién nacido; investigación aplicada en Latinoamérica, y evaluación de nuevos protocolos.","López O, Paulina; Pantoja M, Loreto; Mella G, Maribel; Utreras L, Macarena; Vergara M, Cynthia",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

Consequently, the professional life habits of the surgeons in general have radically changed: the surgeons have been working for about 70% of their working hours in internist support activities for the management of Covid-correlated pneumonia patients.Since then however, many questions have arisen during our daily reflections regarding the need for future planning of our surgery procedures: how much longer can we delay the planning of our selected surgery? Which epidemiological parameters, and other, should we identify in order to start up selected general surgery?For how long can selected surgery be deferred without compromising outcomes and mid to long term mortality in oncological patients in our province, considering also the diagnostic-therapeutic delays in these exceptional months of the Covid era?","Conti, Luigi; Grassi, Carmine; Banchini, Filippo",Acta Biomed,410,20

In this context, the anterior approach becomes an important technique. However, one of the main limitations of this methods is the need for dedicated retractors, which requires larger incisions for its positioning and increases the cost of the procedure. The objective of the present study is to describe a technique for retracting abdominal structures by anterior approaches to the lumbar spine using Steinmann's wires. METHODS: This manuscript consists in a technique description of anterior approach for lumbar spine. RESULTS: Surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spine disease is often necessary when the patients have symptoms refractory to conservative treatments. Many of them will be candidates for surgical treatment due to anterior approach, either for arthrodesis/ALIF or arthroplasty. Small incisions are performed for positioning the modified Langenbeck retractors and the Steinmann wires. These retractors are easily positioned and provide good exposure of the lumbar discs making it possible to implant appropriate cages for restoring the necessary height, lordosis and sagittal balance. CONCLUSION: The technique described is safe, inexpensive and reproducible. Simple and easily accessible instruments are required in most hospital complexes.","Dias Pereira Filho, Aecio Rubens",World neurosurgery (Online),410,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 15 April 2020, together with the German Society of Pathology and the Federal Association of German Pathologists, the German Registry of COVID-19 Autopsies (DeRegCOVID) was launched ( www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de ). Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary cooperation in the field of autopsies in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic is impressively demonstrated by the establishment of DeRegCOVID, the merger of the registry of neuropathology (CNS-COVID19) with DeRegCOVID and the establishment of the autopsy network DEFEAT PANDEMIcs. It gives a strong signal for the necessity, readiness, and expertise to jointly help manage current and future pandemics by autopsy-derived knowledge.","von Stillfried, Saskia; Acker, Till; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Baretton, Gustavo; Bülow, Roman David; Bürrig, Karl-Friedrich; Holtherm, Hans-Ulrich; Jonigk, Danny; Knüchel, Ruth; Majeed, Raphael W; Röhrig, Rainer; Wienströer, Jan; Boor, Peter",Pathologe,410,29

There is lack of coordinated information and knowledge in natural disaster and emergency situations in Zimbabwe. This results in weak collaboration links among the various organizations that respond to emergencies, leading to slow decision making processes and long response times. This negatively affects the affected communities, exacerbating poverty in Zimbabwe. This has been evidenced in the recent catastrophic cyclone Idai where many people were left dead, infrastructure destroyed and some people marooned. To address this, the research seeks to develop an integrated Knowledge Management and ICT framework that aid in coordination and collaboration among the various crisis responders. This will be achieved through a case study approach using Zimbabwe's Civil Protection Unit. PAR within DSRM will be used to gather data from CPU as well as with NGO respondents, traditional leaders and disaster response experts.

AIM: The goal of this perspective is to highlight the existing and future role of wearable and RPM optical technologies in an increasingly at-home healthcare and research environment. APPROACH: First, the specific changes occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare delivery, regulations, and technological innovations related to RPM technologies are reviewed. Then, a review of the current state and potential future impact of optical physiological monitoring in portable and wearable formats is outlined. RESULTS: New efforts from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies are advancing and encouraging at-home, portable, and wearable physiological monitors as a growing part of healthcare delivery. It is hoped that these shifts will assist with disease diagnosis, treatment, management, recovery, and rehabilitation with minimal in-person contact. Some of these trends are likely to persist for years to come. Optical technologies already account for a large portion of RPM platforms, with a good potential for future growth.

They must also motivate members of the public to cooperate with the guidelines, specifically by changing their usual behavior. Policy makers have traditionally adopted a didactic and formalistic stance by conveying dry, statistics-based health information to the public. They have not yet considered the alternative of providing health information in the form of narrative evidence, using stories that address both cognitive and emotional aspects. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to introduce policy makers to the advantages of using narrative evidence to provide health information during a disease outbreak or pandemic such as COVID-19. Throughout human history, authorities have tended to employ apocalyptic narratives during disease outbreaks or pandemics. This viewpoint paper proposes an alternative coping narrative that includes the following components: segmentation; barrier reduction; role models; empathy and support; strengthening self-efficacy, community efficacy, and coping tools; preventing stigmatization of at-risk populations; and communicating uncertainty. It also discusses five conditions for using narrative evidence to produce an effective communication campaign on social media: (1) identifying narratives that reveal the needs, personal experiences, and questions of different subgroups to tailor messaging to produce targeted behavioral change; (2) providing separate and distinct treatment of each information unit or theory that arises on social networks; (3) identifying positive deviants who found creative solutions for stress during the COVID-19 crisis not found by other members of the community; (4) creating different stories of coping; and (5) maintaining a dialogue with population subgroups (eg, skeptical and hesitant groups). The paper concludes by proposing criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of a narrative.","Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat",J Med Internet Res,410,16

Majority of these article were reporting neurological symptoms among patients admitted in different wards along with others general symptoms. None of the study was specifically devoted to study the neurological manifestations and complications in SARS-CoV2 positive patients. The present study concludes that there is a scarcity of good quality research which attempts to establish the role of SARS-CoV2 infection in CNS and its manifestations. However, there are evidences that CNS involvement is present in majority of the patients.

At present, SARS-CoV-2-infected nonhuman primates are considered the gold standard animal model for COVID-19 research. Here, we showed that northern pig-tailed macaques ( Macaca leonina, NPMs) supported SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, compared with rhesus macaques, NPMs showed rapid viral clearance in lung tissues, nose swabs, throat swabs, and rectal swabs, which may be due to higher expression of interferon (IFN)-&#945; in lung tissue. However, the rapid viral clearance was not associated with good outcome. In the second week post infection, NPMs developed persistent or even more severe inflammation and body injury compared with rhesus macaques. These results suggest that viral clearance may have no relationship with COVID-19 progression and SARS-CoV-2-infected NPMs could be considered as a critically ill animal model in COVID-19 research.","Song, Tian-Zhang; Zheng, Hong-Yi; Han, Jian-Bao; Feng, Xiao-Li; Liu, Feng-Liang; Yang, Xiang; Jin, Lin; Luo, Rong-Hua; Tian, Ren-Rong; Liu, Chao; Li, Ming-Hua; Cai, Hou-Rong; Zheng, Yong-Tang",Zool Res,410,12

However, the exact features of antibody responses that govern COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed humoral immune responses in 229 patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. Although high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed, response, measured by anti-S, anti-receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, although sera from 85% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation before 14 d of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se but, rather, with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.","Lucas, Carolina; Klein, Jon; Sundaram, Maria E; Liu, Feimei; Wong, Patrick; Silva, Julio; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Mohanty, Subhasis; Huang, Jiefang; Tokuyama, Maria; Lu, Peiwen; Venkataraman, Arvind; Park, Annsea; Israelow, Benjamin; Vogels, Chantal B F; Muenker, M Catherine; Chang, C-Hong; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Moore, Adam J; Zell, Joseph; Fournier, John B; Wyllie, Anne L; Campbell, Melissa; Lee, Alfred; Chun, Hyung J; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Schulz, Wade L; Farhadian, Shelli; Dela Cruz, Charles; Ring, Aaron M; Shaw, Albert C; Wisnewski, Adam V; Yildirim, Inci; Ko, Albert I; Omer, Saad; Iwasaki, Akiko",Nat. med,410,15

The Tisler reef is a marine protected area located under a ferry 'highway' that connects Norway and Sweden. Cold-water coral reefs are recognised as being important hotspots of both biodiversity and biomass, they function as breeding and nursing grounds for commercially important fish and are essential in providing ecosystem functions. Whilst studies have shown that fishery, ocean warming, and acidification threaten them, the effects of noise pollution on cold-water coral reefs remains unstudied. To study the severity of noise pollution at the Tisler reef, a long-term acoustic recorder was deployed from 19 January 2020 until 26 May 2020. From 15 March COVID-19 lockdown measures stopped passenger vessel traffic between Norway and Sweden. This study found that the overall noise levels were significantly lower after border closure, due to reduced ferry traffic, wind speeds and sea level height. When comparing the median hourly noise levels of before versus after border closure, this study measured a significant reduction in the 63-125 Hz 1/3 octave band noise levels of 8.94 ± 0.88 (MAD) dB during the day (07:00:00-19:59:59) and 1.94 ± 0.11 (MAD) dB during the night (20:00:00-06:59:59). Since there was no ferry traffic during the night, the drop in noise levels at night was likely driven by seasonal changes, i.e. the reduction in wind speed and sea level height when transitioning from winter to spring. Taking into account this seasonal effect, it can be deduced that the COVID-19 border closure reduced the noise levels in the 63-125 Hz 1/3 octave bands at the Tisler reef by 7.0 ± 0.99 (MAD) dB during the day. While the contribution of, and changes in biological, weather-related and geophysical sound sources remain to be assessed in more detail, understanding the extent of anthropogenic noise pollution at the Tisler cold-water coral reef is critical to guide effective management to ensure the long-term health and conservation of its ecosystem functions.","De Clippele, Laurence H.; Risch, Denise",Frontiers in Marine Science,410,20

People exhibited various reactive behaviors to confront with this stressful situation. In Iran, one of the common motives for alcohol consumption is to scape problems and cope with stresses. It has been shown that personality factors influence alcohol consumption, since they are associated with drinking motives. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between temperament and character and alcohol abuse. METHODS: This cross-section study was conducted on 135 alcohol intoxicated patients admitted to emergency room in March 2020 and 255 participants who were randomly selected from public in Shiraz. A questionnaire consisted of TCI (Temperament and character inventory) and several questions about COVID-19 pandemic. It was completed by a trained interviewer using the matched answer technique. Demographic factors were self-reported. RESULTS: Among the alcohol intoxicated group, 117 (86.7%) were males and 18(13.3%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 32.43 ± 10.81 years. Among control group, 99 (38.8%) were males and 156 (61.2%) were females. The mean age of control group was 33.12 ± 14.77 years. Alcohol toxicity was mostly observed among the young males (male/female ratio was 6.45). According to temperament and character index, mean scores of novelty seeking, harm avoidant, and self-transcendence were higher in the alcohol toxicity group than normal population (P < 0.01). Mean scores of reward dependent, cooperativeness, and self-directedness were higher in normal population than the alcohol toxicity group (P < 0.001). The mean score of persistence was not significantly different between methanol intoxicated and normal population groups (P = 0.718). CONCLUSION: Alcohol intoxicated patients had higher scores of novelty-seeking and self-transcendence and lower scores of reward-dependency scores, cooperativeness and self-directedness. These scores are associated with higher likelihood of personality disorders.","Estedlal, Ali Reza; Mani, Arash; Vardanjani, Hossein Molavi; Kamali, Mahsa; Zarei, Leila; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri",BMC Psychiatry,410,16

These outcomes can range from no apparent impact all the way to spontaneous abortion or fetal infection with long term developmental consequences. While some pathogens have developed mechanisms to cross the placenta and directly infect the fetus, other pathogens lead to an upregulation in maternal or placental inflammation that can indirectly cause harm. The placenta is a temporary, yet critical organ that serves multiple important functions during gestation including facilitation of fetal nutrition, oxygenation, and prevention of fetal infection in utero. Here, we review trophoblast cell immunology and the molecular mechanisms utilized to protect the fetus from infection.

During initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic patients present with impaired type I/III IFN-mediated antiviral responses. Interestingly, IFNs regulate the cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on epithelial and endothelial cells. As reported recently, critically ill COVID-19 patients show genetic polymorphisms in one IFN receptor gene (IFNRA2) and in a gene locus near the Janus kinase (JAK) TYK2, which is key for IFN, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 signaling, and T helper (Th) 1/Th17 cell-mediated antiviral immune responses. In the advanced stage of the disease, critically ill COVID-19 patients develop a cytokine storm where many inflammatory mediators using the JAK/STAT signaling pathway such as IL-6, IFN-Î³, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or IL-2, and chemokines result in an influx of macrophages and neutrophils damaging the lung tissue. The knowledge on the cytokine and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in severe COVID-19 disease explains the promising first results with JAK inhibitors like baricitinib, which not only dampen the inflammation but in the case of baricitinib also affect virus replication and endocytosis in target cells. Here, we summarize the current immunological associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection with cytokine signaling, the JAK/STAT pathway, and the current clinical stage of JAK inhibitors for improving severe COVID-19 disease.","Solimani, Farzan; Meier, Katharina; Ghoreschi, Kamran",Eur J Immunol,410,26

An increasing number of small studies describing aspergillosis in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory distress are being reported, but comprehensive data is lacking. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors and impact of invasive fungal disease in adult COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory distress. METHODS: An evaluation of a national, multi-centre, prospective cohort evaluation of an enhanced testing strategy to diagnose invasive fungal disease in COVID-19 intensive care patients. Results were used to generate a mechanism to define aspergillosis in future COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-five adults (median age: 57, M/F: 2·2/1) were screened. The incidence was 26.7% (14.1% aspergillosis, 12·6% yeast infections). The overall mortality rate was 38%; 53% and 31% in patients with and without fungal disease, respectively (P: 0.0387). The mortality rate was reduced by the use of antifungal therapy (Mortality: 38·5% in patients receiving therapy versus 90% in patients not receiving therapy (P: 0.008). The use of corticosteroids (P: 0.007) and history of chronic respiratory disease (P: 0.05) increased the likelihood of aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal disease occurs frequently in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. The survival benefit observed in patients receiving antifungal therapy implies that the proposed diagnostic and defining criteria are appropriate. Screening using a strategic diagnostic approach and antifungal prophylaxis of patients with risk factors will likely enhance the management of COVID-19 patients.","White, P Lewis; Dhillon, Rishi; Cordey, Alan; Hughes, Harriet; Faggian, Federica; Soni, Shuchita; Pandey, Manish; Whitaker, Harriet; May, Alex; Morgan, Matt; Wise, Matthew P; Healy, Brendan; Blyth, Ian; Price, Jessica S; Vale, Lorna; Posso, Raquel; Kronda, Joanna; Blackwood, Adam; Rafferty, Hannah; Moffitt, Amy; Tsitsopoulou, Alexandra; Gaur, Soma; Holmes, Tom; Backx, Matthijs",Clin. infect. dis,410,1

Therefore, a descriptive study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/COVID-19 infection in transplant recipients and patients on the waiting list was conducted. The data sources were the information systems of the Instituto Nacional de Salud of Colombia: National Donation and Transplant Information System, the National Public Health Surveillance System, and the National COVID-19 Data Repository. Characteristics of the patients who tested positive were analyzed, and the mortality rate was determined. An Real Time-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 was performed in 7% of the transplant recipients included in this study, and 14.8% of those recipients tested positive. Among patients on the waiting list, 15.2% were tested, and 16.7% showed positive results. Overall, 1% (84/8108) of the transplant recipients and 2.5% (74/2926) of patients on the waiting list were infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.

These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","Abrams, Steven; Wambua, James; Santermans, Eva; Willem, Lander; Kuylen, Elise; Coletti, Pietro; Libin, Pieter; Faes, Christel; Petrof, Oana; Herzog, Sereina A; Beutels, Philippe; Hens, Niel",Epidemics,410,16

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated 2,731 participants without type 2 diabetes recruited between 2008 and 2013 in the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study (Guangzhou, China). Case subjects with type 2 diabetes were identified with clinical and biochemical information collected at follow-up visits. Using stool samples collected during the follow-up in the subset (n = 1,591), 16S rRNA profiling was conducted. Using multivariable-adjusted Poisson or linear regression, we examined associations of erythrocyte n-6 PUFA biomarkers with incident type 2 diabetes and diversity and composition of gut microbiota. RESULTS: Over 6.2 years of follow-up, 276 case subjects with type 2 diabetes were identified (risk 0.10). Higher levels of erythrocyte Î³-linolenic acid (GLA), but not linoleic or arachidonic acid, were associated with higher type 2 diabetes incidence. Comparing the top to the bottom quartile groups of GLA levels, relative risk was 1.72 (95% CI 1.21, 2.44) adjusted for potential confounders. Baseline GLA was inversely associated with gut microbial richness and diversity (&#945;-diversity, both P < 0.05) during follow-up and significantly associated with microbiota ß-diversity (P = 0.002). &#945;-Diversity acted as a potential mediator in the association between GLA and type 2 diabetes (P < 0.05). Seven genera (Butyrivibrio, Blautia, Oscillospira, Odoribacter, S24-7 other, Rikenellaceae other, and Clostridiales other) were enriched in quartile 1 of GLA and in participants without type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Relative concentrations of erythrocyte GLA were positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population and also with gut microbial profiles.

However, well-done systematic reviews are expensive, time-demanding, and labor-intensive. Here, we propose an automatic document classification approach to significantly reduce the effort in reviewing documents. Methods: We first describe a manual document classification procedure that is used to curate a pertinent training dataset and then propose three classifiers: a keyword-guided method, a cluster analysis-based refined method, and a random forest approach that utilizes a large set of feature tokens. As an example, this approach is used to identify documents studying female sex workers that are assumed to contain content relevant to either HIV or violence. We compare the performance of the three classifiers by cross-validation and conduct a sensitivity analysis on the portion of data utilized in training the model. Results: The random forest approach provides the highest area under the curve (AUC) for both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision/recall (PR). Analyses of precision and recall suggest that random forest could facilitate manually reviewing 20\% of the articles while containing 80\% of the relevant cases. Finally, we found a good classifier could be obtained by using a relatively small training sample size. Conclusions: In sum, the automated procedure of document classification presented here could improve both the precision and efficiency of systematic reviews, as well as facilitating live reviews, where reviews are updated regularly.","Li, Xiaoxiao; Al-Zaidy, Rabah; Zhang, Amy; Baral, Stefan; Bao, Le; Giles, C.

Ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV), in particular, has been associated with a rare but fatal systemic disease. In recent months, it has become apparent that both minks and ferrets are susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus and the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Several mink farms have experienced SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and experimental models have demonstrated susceptibility of ferrets to SARS-CoV-2. The potential for pet ferrets to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, however, remains elusive. During the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, it was also apparent that ferrets were susceptible to SARS-CoV and could be utilized in vaccine development. From a comparative standpoint, understanding the relationships between different infections and disease pathogenesis in the animal superfamily Musteloidea may help elucidate viral infection and transmission mechanisms, as well as treatment and prevention strategies for coronaviruses.","Stout, Alison E; Guo, Qinghua; Millet, Jean K; de Matos, Ricardo; Whittaker, Gary R",mBio (Online),410,1

Furthermore, no clear recommendation was made for patients with a previous COVID-19 infection and a favorable outcome who were seeking bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the risks of specific complications for patients with previous COVID-19 infection who were admitted for bariatric surgery. SETTING: Eight high-volume private centers from 5 countries. METHODS: All patients with morbid obesity and previous COVID-19 infection admitted for bariatric surgery were included in the current study. Patients were enrolled from 8 centers and 5 countries, and their electronic health data were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome was to identify early (<30 d) specific complications related to COVID-19 infection following bariatric surgery, and the secondary outcome was to analyze additional factors from work-ups that could prevent complications. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a mean age of 40 years (range, 21-68 yr) and a mean body mass index of 44.3 kg/m2 (±7.4 kg/m2) with previous COVID-19 infection underwent different bariatric procedures: 23 cases of sleeve (65.7 %), 7 cases of bypass, and 5 other cases. The symptomatology of the previous COVID-19 infection varied: 15 patients had no symptoms, 12 had fever and respiratory signs, 5 had only fever, 2 had digestive symptoms, and 1 had isolated respiratory signs. Only 5 patients (14.2 %) were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection, for a mean period of 8.8 days (range, 6-15 d). One patient was admitted to an intensive care unit and needed invasive mechanical ventilation. The mean interval time from COVID-19 infection to bariatric surgery was 11.3 weeks (3-34 wk). The mean hospital stay was 1.7 days (±1 d), and all patients were clinically evaluated 1 month following the bariatric procedure. There were 2 readmissions and 1 case of complication: that case was of a gastric leak treated with laparoscopic drainage and a repeated pigtail drain, with a favorable outcome. No cases of other specific complications or mortality were recorded. CONCLUSION: Minor and moderate COVID-19 infections, especially the forms not complicated with invasive mechanical ventilation, should not preclude the indication for bariatric surgery. In our experience, a prior COVID-19 infection does not induce additional specific complications following bariatric surgery.","Nedelcu, Marius; Marx, Ludovic; Lutfi, Rami Edward; Vilallonga, Ramon; Diaconu, Victor; Aboudi, Shadi; Cirera de Tudela, Arturo; Ferrer, José Vicente; Ramirez, Jose; Noel, Patrick; Nedelcu, Anamaria; Carandina, Sergio",Surg. obes. relat. dis,410,16

However, there have been no direct comparisons of AKI in hospitalized patients with and without COVID-19 that would reveal whether there are aspects of AKI risk, course, and outcomes unique to this infection. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, we evaluated AKI incidence, risk factors, and outcomes for 3345 adults with COVID-19 and 1265 without COVID-19 who were hospitalized in a large New York City health system and compared them with a historical cohort of 9859 individuals hospitalized a year earlier in the same health system. We also developed a model to identify predictors of stage 2 or 3 AKI in our COVID-19. RESULTS: We found higher AKI incidence among patients with COVID-19 compared with the historical cohort (56.9% versus 25.1%, respectively). Patients with AKI and COVID-19 were more likely than those without COVID-19 to require RRT and were less likely to recover kidney function. Development of AKI was significantly associated with male sex, Black race, and older age (>50 years). Male sex and age >50 years associated with the composite outcome of RRT or mortality, regardless of COVID-19 status. Factors that were predictive of stage 2 or 3 AKI included initial respiratory rate, white blood cell count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase level. CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a higher incidence of severe AKI compared with controls. Vital signs at admission and laboratory data may be useful for risk stratification to predict severe AKI. Although male sex, Black race, and older age associated with development of AKI, these associations were not unique to COVID-19.","Fisher, Molly; Neugarten, Joel; Bellin, Eran; Yunes, Milagros; Stahl, Lindsay; Johns, Tanya S; Abramowitz, Matthew K; Levy, Rebecca; Kumar, Neelja; Mokrzycki, Michele H; Coco, Maria; Dominguez, Mary; Prudhvi, Kalyan; Golestaneh, Ladan",J Am Soc Nephrol,410,20

The false-negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 caused delayed diagnosis of COVID-19, which hindered the prevention and control of the pandemic. The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in negative nasopharyngeal swabs cases has rarely been addressed previously. This study evaluated two clusters of COVID-19 in six patients, four of whom (66.7%) tested negative for RNA of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. All epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. The first cluster was a nosocomial infection of four health care providers in early January. One case resulted in a sequential familial cluster of infection. All patients either self-quarantined at home or were admitted to hospital for isolated treatment. All recovered and were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG- and/or IgM-positive (100%) for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 at the recovery stage. Our study provides a cautionary warning that negative results for nasopharyngeal swabs of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase the risk of nosocomial infection among health care providers. Serologic detection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM is an important test in the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Cao, Guoqing; Tang, Shaotao; Yang, Dehua; Shi, Wenjia; Wang, Xiaorong; Wang, Hua; Li, Chen; Wei, Jia; Ma, Ling",Jpn J Infect Dis,410,20

Data Sources: A MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE (January 1, 1985, to June 19, 2020) literature search was performed using the terms ferric maltol, accrufer, feraccru, iron maltol, ferric trimaltol, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic kidney disease. Additional data sources included prescribing information, abstracts, and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry. Study Selection/Data Extraction: English language literature evaluating FM pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety in the treatment of IDA were reviewed. Data Synthesis: FM is a ferric, non-salt-based oral iron formulation demonstrating improved tolerance in patients with previous intolerance to other iron formulations. Phase 3 trials demonstrated significant improvements in anemia and serum iron parameters in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Common adverse effects were gastrointestinal intolerance. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: FM is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to oral iron salts for patients with IBD or CKD and IDA. Emerging data suggest that FM is noninferior to intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose in patients with IBD and IDA. Prior to selecting FM over IV iron products, consideration should be given to time to normalization of Hb, ease of administration, cost, and tolerability. Conclusion: FM is a relatively safe, effective oral iron therapy that may be better tolerated than other oral iron formulations. FM may be an effective alternative to IV iron in patients with IBD.","Khoury, Adonice; Pagan, Kaley A; Farland, Michelle Z",Ann Pharmacother,410,16

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the receptor for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been shown to protect against severe acute lung failure. Here, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 reduced the mRNA expression of ACE2 and type I interferons in primary cells of lung bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from naïve rhesus macaques. The expression levels of ACE2 and type I interferons were also found to be correlated with each other, consistent with the recent finding that ACE2 is an interferon-inducible gene. Furthermore, induction of ACE2 and type I interferons by poly I:C, an interferon inducer, was suppressed by S1 protein in primary cells of BAL. These observations suggest that the downregulation of ACE2 and type I interferons induced by S1 protein may directly contribute to SARS-CoV-2-associated lung diseases.","Sui, Yongjun; Li, Jianping; Venzon, David J; Berzofsky, Jay A",Front Immunol,410,4

Physical symptoms were reported more frequently. Persistent (> 30 days) absence from school doubled between study entry and end, from 22 to 47%. Enduring mental ill-health and disengagement from education/employment were associated with psychosocial risk factors rather than assault characteristics. Qualitative data suggested inter-relationships between mental ill-health, physical health problems and disengagement from school, and poor understanding from schools regarding how to support young people post-assault. Baseline levels of smoking, alcohol and ever drug use were high and increased during the study period (only significantly for alcohol use). CONCLUSION: Adolescents presenting after sexual assault have high levels of vulnerability over a year post-assault. Many remain at risk for mental health disorders, highlighting the need for specialist intervention and ongoing support. A key concern for young people is disruption to their education. Multi-faceted support is needed to prevent social exclusion and further widening of health inequalities in this population, and to support young people in their immediate and long-term recovery.","Clarke, Venetia; Goddard, Andrea; Wellings, Kaye; Hirve, Raeena; Casanovas, Marta; Bewley, Susan; Viner, Russell; Kramer, Tami; Khadr, Sophie",Soc. psychiatr. psychiatr. epidemiol,410,30

The diagnosis of an active infection is based on the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab specimen. The aim of the current analysis was to assess the usefulness of the rapid serological tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The rapid serological tests detecting IgG/IgM antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were voluntarily performed in asymptomatic employees of 2 companies. The examination was conducted at the date and time selected online by the study participants. The testing team consisted of 2 nurses collecting the samples and 1 doctor who interpreted the results. Each positive rapid test result was verified by an RT-PCR examination from a nasopharyngeal swab. The testing kits named Vazyme: 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold-Based) were provided by the employer along with the manual and certificates. RESULTS: The overall interest in testing among employees was below the employer's expectations and reached 30% and 20% in each of the 2 companies, respectively. A total of 516 participants were included in the analysis. Ten positive results of the rapid tests were documented, including 7 for IgM and 3 for IgG antibodies. No positive result was confirmed by the detection of the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR examination. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, the authors demonstrated the uselessness of rapid serological tests performed in asymptomatic volunteers for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Our objective was to identify from the international literature the symptoms most commonly experienced by older adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. This systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE between 1 December 2019 and 13 April 2020. The methodological quality analysis used a method dedicated to case series and case reports. Of the 260 articles initially identiï¬ed, only two studies were ultimately included in the qualitative analysis. The mean age was relatively low, between 71 and 74 years on average. COVID-19 symptoms were as follows: fever, dry cough, dyspnoea, asthenia, anorexia, chest tightness, diarrhoea and, to a lesser extent, myalgia, pharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Lymphopenia was noted from complete blood counts. In conclusion, this systematic review of the international literature reveals a lack of data about the semiology of COVID-19 in older adults, especially in very elderly frail people, who are normally considered to constitute the geriatric population. The national survey conducted by the Société Française de Gériatrie et Gérontologie will help bridge this semiological gap.","Sacco, Guillaume; Brière, Olivier; Asfar, Marine; Guérin, Olivier; Berrut, Gilles; Annweiler, Cédric",Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil,410,18

For the management of the public health emergencies, all parties' cooperation is the key to preventing and controlling the emergencies. Based on the assumption of bounded rationality, we formulate a tripartite evolutionary game model, involving the local government, the enterprises, and the public, for the public health emergency, e.g., COVID-19. The evolutionary stable strategies under different conditions of the tripartite evolutionary game are explored, and the effect from different factors on the decision-makings of participants for public health emergencies is also analyzed. Numerical analysis results show that formulating reasonable subsidy measures, encouraging the participation of the public, and enforcing the punishment to enterprises for their negative behaviors can prompt three parties to cooperate in fighting against the epidemic. Our work enriches an understanding of the governance for the public health emergency and provides theoretical support for the local government and related participants to make proper decisions in public health emergencies.

Over 24% of the respondents reported having experienced suicidal thoughts since the start of the pandemic. Almost 16% drank alcohol in a risky or harmful way. The average value of perceived stress indicated its high and very high intensity. Over 20% had symptoms of anxiety disorders, and almost 19% had anxiety and depression symptoms. It means that almost 40% of the respondents probably have mental disorders. More women, younger people, and those with disorders prior to the onset of the pandemic were among those who manifested these disorders. They also used passive and avoidance stress coping strategies more frequently. In conclusion, the second wave of the pandemic negatively affected the mental health of the respondents.

The accuracy of molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 has been assessed numerous times, usually in reference to a gold standard diagnosis. One major disadvantage of that approach is the possibility of error due to inaccuracy of the gold standard, which is especially problematic for evaluating testing in a real-world surveillance context. We used an alternative approach known as Bayesian latent class modeling (BLCM), which circumvents the need to designate a gold standard by simultaneously estimating the accuracy of multiple tests. We applied this technique to a collection of 1,716 tests of three types applied to 853 individuals on a university campus during a one-week period in October 2020. We found that reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of saliva samples performed at a campus facility had higher sensitivity (median: 0.923; 95% credible interval: 0.732-0.996) than RT-PCR testing of nasal samples performed at a commercial facility (median: 0.859; 95% CrI: 0.547-0.994). The reverse was true for specificity, although the specificity of saliva testing was still very high (median: 0.993; 95% CrI: 0.983-0.999). An antigen test was less sensitive and specific than both of the RT-PCR tests. These results suggest that RT-PCR testing of saliva samples at a campus facility can be an effective basis for surveillance screening to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a university setting.","Perkins, Alex; Stephens, Melissa; Barrios, Wendy Alvarez; Cavany, Sean M.; Rulli, Liz; Pfrender, Michael E.",,410,27

Currently, no specific drug combination has consistently demonstrated an association with mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of associations observed between the different in-hospital treatments administered to a series of 238 patients admitted for COVID-19 and their relationship with mortality. METHODS: The electronic medical records of patients that discharged or died from COVID-19 in the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) between March 16 and April 10, 2020 were analysed. From these records, information was obtained on sex, age, comorbidities at admission, clinical information, analytical parameters, imaging tests and empirical treatments used. The outcome variable was the in-hospital mortality. To estimate the associations between the different therapeutic alternatives and the risk of mortality, hazard ratios adjusted for age, sex, previous pathologies and severity at discharge were estimated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: The most frequently used combination of drugs was low molecular weight heparins, hydroxychloroquine, and ritonavir/lopinavir. None of the analysed treatments showed independent association with mortality. The drugs that showed a greater inverse association with mortality were tocilizumab and corticoids. CONCLUSIONS: The observed association patterns are consistent with previous literature. It seems necessary to design randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluate the possible protector effect of tocilizumab and corticoids in the risk of mortality for some subgroups of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Valero-Ubierna, María Del Carmen; R-delAmo, Juan Luis; Fernández-García, Miguel Ángel; Martínez-Diz, Silvia; Tahery-Mahmoud, Arezu; Rodríguez-Camacho, Marta; Gámiz-Molina, Ana Belén; Barba-Gyengo, Nicolás; Gámez-Baeza, Pablo; Cabrero-Rodríguez, Celia; Guirado-Ruiz, Pedro Antonio; Martín-Romero, Divina Tatiana; Láinez-Ramos-Bossini, Antonio Jesús; Sánchez-Pérez, María Rosa; Mancera-Romero, José; García-Martín, Miguel; Martín-delosReyes, Luis Miguel; Martínez-Ruiz, Virginia; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),410,24

High hopes that had initially been placed on antiviral drugs like remdesivir have so far not been fulfilled. While individual case reports provide striking evidence for the clinical efficacy of remdesivir in the right clinical settings, major trials failed to demonstrate this. Here, we highlight and discuss the key findings of these studies and underlying reasons for their failure. We elaborate on how such shortcomings should be prevented in future clinical trials and pandemics. We suggest in conclusion that any novel antiviral agent that enters human trials should first be tested in a post-exposure setting to provide rapid and solid evidence for its clinical efficacy before initiating further time-consuming and costly clinical trials for more advanced disease. In the COVID-19 pandemic this might have established remdesivir early on as an efficient antiviral agent at a more suitable disease stage which would have saved many lives, in particular in large outbreaks within residential care homes.","Dölken, Lars; Stich, August; Spinner, Christoph D",Viruses,410,16

In response to the first few reported cases of COVID-19, the government of Ghana implemented comprehensive social and public health interventions aimed at containing the disease, albeit its effect on medical education is less clear. Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 has brought changes that may impact the plan of career progression for both students and faculty. Hitherto, medical education had students getting into contact with patients and faculty in a facility setting. Their physical presence in both in-and outpatients' settings has been a tradition of early clinical immersion experiences and the clerkship curriculum. Rotating between departments makes the students potential vectors and victims for COVID-19. COVID-19 has the potential to affect students throughout the educational process. The pandemic has led to a complete paradigm shift in the mode of instruction in a clinical care setting. Inperson training has either been reduced or cancelled in favour of virtual forms of pedagogy. The clinics have also seen a reduction in a variety of surgical and medical cases. This situation may result in potential gaps in their training. Outpatient clinics have transitioned mainly to telemedicine, thus minimizing students' exposure to clinic encounters.

Cytokine storm is linked to the severity and decreasing the survival among infected patients by COVID-19. The serum levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) have been correlated to mortality in COVID-19 cases and could be used as indicator of mortality in COVID-19 cases. The aim of this study was to determine levels of IL-6 and assess its usefulness as indicator of mortality among COVID-19 patients from Mexico. METHODS: A cohort study among 38 adults (28 men, 10 women) was carried out in the Regional High Specialty Hospital of the Yucatan Peninsula in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Demographic and clinical biochemistry data were collected. The serum levels of IL-6 were measured in each patient by specific immunoassays. RESULTS: High frequency of mortality (36.84%) was found in the sample. The average age of individuals that non-survive was significantly higher (59.71 ± 13.83 years) than the survival group (43.29 ± 11.80 years). Serum levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in patients that did not survive. A correlation between IL-6 levels with lymphocyte count, LDH, CRP and procaciltonin was found. The optimal cutoff value of IL-6 was 30.95 pg/mL with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that level of IL-6 is an indicator of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Mexico.","Avila-Nava, Azalia; Cortes-Telles, Arturo; Torres-Erazo, Darwin; López-Romero, Stephanie; Chim Aké, Rodolfo; Gutiérrez Solis, Ana Ligia",Cytokine,410,20

This study aims to measure prevalent depressive symptoms and its associates among older adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out among 1032 older Bangladeshi adults, aged 60 years and above, through telephone interviews in October 2020. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on participants' socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and COVID-19-related information. Meanwhile, depressive symptoms were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Two-in-five participants showed depressive symptoms on the GDS-15 scale. Poor socioeconomic characteristic such as low family income, dependency on the family for living, recipient of financial support during the pandemic was associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms. Participants with pre-existing medical conditions had 91% higher odds of depressive symptoms.

In South Africa, the flagship National Department of Health MomConnect program was launched in 2014 to strengthen the quality of maternal and child health (MCH) services and improve mortality outcomes. MomConnect was rapidly rolled out with a limited understanding of how and why the program was expected to work even though studies had shown the effectiveness of the MomConnect program in improving the uptake of MCH services. This study aimed to unearth the initial program theory of the MomConnect program based on explicit and implicit assumptions of how the program was organized and expected to work. METHODS: We conducted a document analysis using design- and implementation-related documents of the MomConnect program guided by the principles of Theory of Change (ToC) and Realist Evaluation (RE). Content and thematic analysis approaches were deductively applied to analyze the documents toward constructing ToC and RE-informed models. Abductive thinking and retroduction were further applied to the realist-informed approach to link program context, mechanisms, and outcomes to construct the initial program theory. RESULTS: ToC and RE-informed models illustrated how the MomConnect program was organized and expected to work. The process of constructing the ToC provided the platform for the development of the initial program theory, which identified three critical elements: (1) the central modalities of the MomConnect program; (2) the intended outcomes; and (3) the tentative causal links indicating, in a stepwise manner of, how the outcomes were intended to be achieved. The RE approach 'enhanced' the causal links by identifying relevant programmatic contexts and linking the postulated mechanisms of action (empowerment, encouragement, motivation, and knowledge acquisition) to program outcomes. CONCLUSION: The application of ToC and RE provided an explicitly cumulative approach to knowledge generation in unveiling the initial program theory of MomConnect rather than delivering answers to questions of program effectiveness.","M Kabongo, Eveline; Mukumbang, Ferdinand C; Delobelle, Peter; Nicol, Edward",BMC Med Res Methodol,410,24

There are multiple reports of prolonged viral shedding in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 but the presence of viral RNA on a test does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. The duration of quarantine required after clinical recovery to definitively prevent transmission is therefore uncertain. In addition, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may occur, and infectivity may be highest early after onset of symptoms, meaning that contact tracing, isolation of exposed individuals and social distancing are essential public health measures to prevent further spread.

METHODS: This was prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded, crossover simulation trial. Thirty-five medical students after an advanced cardiovascular life support course, which included performing 2-min continuous chest compression scenarios using three methods: (A) manual chest compression (CC), (B) compression with CPRMeter, (C) compression with LifeLine ARM device. During resuscitation they are wearing full personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures. RESULTS: The median chest compression depth using manual CC, CPRMeter and LifeLine ARM varied and amounted to 40 (38-45) vs. 45 (40-50) vs. 51 (50-52) mm, respectively (p = 0.002). The median chest compression rate was 109 (IQR; 102-131) compressions per minute (CPM) for manual CC, 107 (105-127) CPM for CPRMeter, and 102 (101-102) CPM for LifeLine ARM (p = 0.027). The percentage of correct chest recoil was the highest for LifeLine ARM - 100% (95-100), 80% (60-90) in CPRMeter group, and the lowest for manual CC - 29% (26-48). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this simulation trial, automated chest compression devices (ACCD) should be used for chest compression of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. In the absence of ACCD, it seems reasonable to change the cardiopulmonary resuscitation algorithm (in the context of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19) by reducing the duration of the cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle from the current 2-min to 1-min cycles due to a statistically significant reduction in the quality of chest compressions among rescuers wearing PPE AGP.","Malysz, Marek; Dabrowski, Marek; Böttiger, Bernd W; Smereka, Jacek; Kulak, Klaudia; Szarpak, Agnieszka; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Ladny, Jerzy R; Ruetzler, Kurt; Szarpak, Lukasz",Cardiol J,410,21

These psychological issues can even be experienced by patients who were asymptomatic or had mild to moderate symptoms, potentially impacting their quality of life. METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective observational study to analyse the psychological impact of COVID-19 in recovered patients who presented as prospective convalescent plasma (CP) donors. An interview for the psychological assessment of the prospective donors was carried out. Depression and anxiety in the participants were assessed by HAM-A, and HAM-D scores and Quality of Life were assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF scale. RESULTS: A total of 51 prospective donors were assessed, with a mean age of 34.37 (±9.08) years, with the majority being males (46). No clinically significant depression and anxiety were found on the basis of HAM-D and HAM-A scores. The worst affected quality of life parameter, based on the WHOQOL-BREF scale, was physical quality of life followed by environmental, psychological, and social relationships. Moreover, due to infection, social stigma was experienced by 49.02% of the donors, while 21.97% had anxiety related to convalescent plasma donation as a common livid experience. CONCLUSION: Poor quality of life and social stigma during the recovery phase is prevalent in COVID-19 recovered patients, for which formulation of holistic support strategies are the need of the hour.","Maheshwari, A; Varshney, M; Gupta, K; Bajpai, M",Transfus. clin. biol,410,20

Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, the cardiovascular system is extensively affected at multiple levels. Due to the unprecedented consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ARTERY society decided to launch the Covid-19 effects on ARTErial StIffness and vascular AgeiNg (CARTESIAN) study - the first international multicentre study into the effects of COVID-19 on non-invasive biomarkers of vascular ageing. The main study objective is to evaluate the presence of Early Vascular Ageing (EVA) 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 infection. Secondary objectives are to study the effect of COVID-19 disease severity on EVA, to investigate the role of psychosocial factors in COVID-19 induced EVA, and to investigate the potential modifying effect of comorbidities and chronic treatments. In the CARTESIAN study, a broad array of cardiovascular measurements, including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, central blood pressure, carotid ultrasound, brachial flow-mediated dilatation, will be performed. To date, 43 centres from 21 countries have agreed to participate, with an expected study population of &gt;2500 individuals. To our knowledge, CARTESIAN will be the first study to provide insight into the relationship between COVID-19, its severity, and early vascular ageing in a large cohort, potentially enabling future care and diagnostics to be more focused on the most vulnerable.

METHODS: One hundred and eighty-five patients (87 men, 98 women; mean age, 48.7 years), who underwent RT-PCR sampling and high-resolution CT examination in our hospital between March 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020, and got a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease via initial or follow-up RT-PCR test, were included in the study. We comprehensively analyzed the most common and relatively rare CT imaging features (e.g., distribution pattern, density of the lesions, additional CT signs) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (20.6%) had no evidence of pneumonia on their initial high-resolution CT images. Among 147 patients (79.4%) who had parenchymal infiltration consistent with pneumonia, 10 (6.8%) had a negative baseline RT-PCR test, and positivity was detected as a result of repeated tests. Most of the patients had multifocal (89.1%) and bilateral (86.4%) lesions. The most common location, right lower lobe, was affected in 87.8% of the patients. Lesions were distributed predominantly at peripheral (87.1%) and posterior (46.3%) areas of lung parenchyma. Most of the patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) (82.3%) followed by GGO with consolidation (32.7%) and crazy paving pattern (21.8%). Pure consolidation, solid nodules, halo sign, reverse halo sign, vascular enlargement, subpleural line, air-bronchogram, and bronchiectasis were the other findings observed in at least 15% of the cases. Halo sign, acinar nodules, air-bubble sign, pleural thickening and effusion, mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy were seen rarely (2%-12.9%). Pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, cavitation, and tree-in-bud pattern were not detected in our study group. CONCLUSION: Multifocal and bilateral GGO infiltration predominantly distributed in peripheral, posterior, and lower lung areas was the most common infiltration pattern.","Çinkooglu, Akin; Hepdurgun, Cenk; Bayraktaroglu, Selen; Ceylan, Naim; Savas, Recep",Diagn. interv. radiol,410,1

Based on sparse research, our institution developed a protocol for ordering labs for this patient population, including routine admission labs in addition to eight COVID-19 specific daily labs. The study goal is to determine if COVID-19 specific admission labs have any prognostic value beyond that provided by routine admission labs and vitals, and costs of labs with no prognostic value. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed adult patients admitted with COVID-19 from 3/2020 to 7/2020. Outcomes were mortality, ICU stay and length of hospitalization. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to determine if COVID-19 specific admission labs have any prognostic value beyond that provided by vitals and routine admission labs. COVID-19 specific labs were d-Dimer, fibrinogen, ferritin, LDH, CK, pro-BNP, troponin and CRP. Multivariable models included all routine admission labs and vitals. COVID-19 specific admission labs were included in the multivariable models if the p-value was <0.05 in the univariable analysis. RESULTS 331 patients met study criteria, inpatient mortality was 13.0%, 52.4% of patients required ICU stays and the average length of hospitalization was 8.9 days. COVID-19 specific labs showed no additional prognostic value for mortality. CRP, LDH and d-Dimer provided additional prognostic information for ICU stay. CRP&#8805;100mg/dL and LDH&#8805;900U/L were associated with increased length of hospitalization. CONCLUSION Only 3 of 8 admission COVID-19 specific labs recommended by our institution's protocol had additional prognostic value beyond that provided by routine labs and vitals. The total cost of non-prognostic COVID-19 specific labs during the study period was $75,874.","Moore, Carlton; Alavian, Naseem; Stern, Elizabeth; Sasaki-Adams, James; Inigo, Joe Danica",Hospital practice (1995),410,33

We surveyed residents from a national sample of internal medicine (IM) residency programs to describe their experiences with the transition to virtual morning report (MR), a highly valued core educational conference. OBJECTIVE: Assess resident views about virtual MR content and teaching strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Anonymous, web-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: Residents from 14 academically affiliated IM residency programs. MAIN MEASURES: The 25-item survey on virtual MR included questions on demographics; frequency and reason for attending; opinions on who should attend and teach; how the virtual format affects the learning environment; how virtual MR compares to in-person MR with regard to participation, engagement, and overall education; and whether virtual MR should continue after in-person conferences can safely resume. The survey included a combination of Likert-style, multiple option, and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Six hundred fifteen residents (35%) completed the survey, with a balanced sample of interns (39%), second-year (31%), and third-year (30%) residents. When comparing their overall assessment of in-person and virtual MR formats, 42% of residents preferred in-person, 18% preferred virtual, and 40% felt they were equivalent. Most respondents endorsed better peer-engagement, camaraderie, and group participation with in-person MR. Chat boxes, video participation, audience response systems, and smart boards/tablets enhanced respondents' educational experience during virtual MR. Most respondents (72%) felt that the option of virtual MR should continue when it is safe to resume in-person conferences. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual MR was a valued alternative to traditional in-person MR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents feel that the virtual platform offers unique educational benefits independent of and in conjunction with in-person conferences. Residents support the integration of a virtual platform into the delivery of MR in the future.","Albert, Tyler J; Bradley, Joel; Starks, Helene; Redinger, Jeff; Arundel, Cherinne; Beard, Albertine; Caputo, Laura; Chun, Jonathan; Gunderson, Craig G; Heppe, Dan; Jagannath, Anand; Kent, Kyle; Krug, Michael; Laudate, James; Palaniappan, Vignesh; Pensiero, Amanda; Sargsyan, Zaven; Sladek, Emily; Tuck, Matthew; Cornia, Paul B",J. gen. intern. med,410,5

In many of them, one of the major challenges is represented by the large presence of cultural heritage being in a state of degradation, abandonment and underutilization, which determines waste conditions not only at physical/spatial level but also at economic level (the presence of subsistence economies) and at a social and cultural level (marginalization phenomena and high rates of unemployment). The perspective of circular economy allows rethinking these waste conditions as an opportunity to reactivate virtuous circuits capable of promoting sustainable development focused on human needs. In this perspective, the paper aims to demonstrate both the importance of participatory approaches in guiding circular and human-centred regeneration processes and of identifying evaluation tools capable of integrating the human and ecological dimension with the economic one. With this aim, a circular methodology is proposed and experimented with in Ercolano (Italy) and in the Bronx (New York), in which the adoption of a participatory approach was central in all phases of regeneration processes, from the identification and analysis of vulnerabilities and waste conditions to the definition of a strategy capable of transforming these limitations into opportunities. A first result is the elaboration of a framework of “Human-Centred Indicators” to monitor and support the adoption of the circular economy strategy toward implementing the “human-centred city”.","Bosone, Martina Ciampa Francesca",Sustainability,410,1

COVID-19 is affecting everyone in the globe and mask wearing is one of the few precautions against it. To quantify people's perception of mask effectiveness and to prevent the spread of COVID-19 for small areas, we use Understanding America Study's (UAS) survey data on COVID-19 as our primary data source. Our data analysis shows that direct survey-weighted estimates for small areas could be highly unreliable. In this paper we develop a synthetic estimation method to estimate proportions of mask effectiveness for small areas using a logistic model that combines information from multiple data sources. We select our working model using an extensive data analysis facilitated by a new variable selection criterion for survey data and benchmarking ratios. We propose a Jackknife method to estimate variance of our proposed estimator. From our data analysis. it is evident that our proposed synthetic method outperforms direct survey-weighted estimator with respect to commonly used evaluation measures.","Sen, Aditi; student, Partha Lahiri PhD; Mathematics, Applied; Statistics,; Computation, Scientific; Maryland, University of; Park, College; USA,; Director,; Professor,; Methodology, The Joint Program in Survey; Mathematics, Department of",,410,24

Whether maternal infection causes changes in the transfer of immunity to infants remains unclear. Maternal infections have previously been associated with compromised placental antibody transfer, but the mechanism underlying this compromised transfer is not established. Here, we used systems serology to characterize the Fc profile of influenza-, pertussis-, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transferred across the placenta. Influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies were actively transferred. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer was significantly reduced compared to influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and cord titers and functional activity were lower than in maternal plasma. This effect was only observed in third-trimester infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to altered SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profiles and was partially rescued by infection-induced increases in IgG and increased FCGR3A placental expression. These results point to unexpected compensatory mechanisms to boost immunity in neonates, providing insights for maternal vaccine design.","Atyeo, Caroline; Pullen, Krista M; Bordt, Evan A; Fischinger, Stephanie; Burke, John; Michell, Ashlin; Slein, Matthew D; Loos, Carolin; Shook, Lydia L; Boatin, Adeline A; Yockey, Laura J; Pepin, David; Meinsohn, Marie-Charlotte; Nguyen, Ngoc Minh Phuong; Chauvin, Maeva; Roberts, Drucilla; Goldfarb, Ilona T; Matute, Juan D; James, Kaitlyn E; Yonker, Lael M; Bebell, Lisa M; Kaimal, Anjali J; Gray, Kathryn J; Lauffenburger, Douglas; Edlow, Andrea G; Alter, Galit",Cell,410,16

METHODS: The survey was conducted in the European Hip Society (EHS) and the European Knee Associates (EKA). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple choice, ranked). Four topics were addressed: (1) origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions); (2) potential disruption of arthroplasty surgeries (12 questions); (3) influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular arthroplasty surgeon (four questions); (4) a matrix provided 14 different arthroplasty surgeries and the participant was asked to state whether dedicated surgery was stopped, delayed or cancelled. RESULTS: Two-hundred and seventy-two surgeons (217 EHS, 55 EKA) from 40 different countries participated. Of the respondents, 25.7% stated that all surgeries were cancelled in their departments, while 68.4% responded that elective inpatient procedures were no longer being performed.

An immediately qualifying strategy would be to use existing powerful drugs from various virus treatments. The strategy in virtual screening of antiviral databases for possible therapeutic effect would be to identify promising drug molecules, as there is currently no vaccine or treatment approved against COVID-19. Targeting the main protease (pdb id: 6LU7) is gaining importance in anti-CoV drug design. In this conceptual context, an attempt has been made to suggest an in silico computational relationship between US-FDA approved drugs, plant-derived natural drugs, and Coronavirus main protease (6LU7) protein. The evaluation of results was made based on Glide (Schrödinger) dock score. Out of 62 screened compounds, the best docking scores with the targets were found for compounds: lopinavir, amodiaquine, and theaflavin digallate (TFDG). Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study was also performed for 20 ns to confirm the stability behaviour of the main protease and inhibitor complexes. The MD simulation study validated the stability of three compounds in the protein binding pocket as potent binders.","Peele, K Abraham; Chandrasai, P; Srihansa, T; Krupanidhi, S; Sai, A Vijaya; Babu, D John; Indira, M; Reddy, A Ranganadha; Venkateswarulu, T C",Inform Med Unlocked,410,1

Design, Setting, and Participants: In a prospective uncontrolled cohort study, survivors of COVID-19 who had been hospitalized in a university hospital in France between March 1 and May 29, 2020, underwent a telephone assessment 4 months after discharge, between July 15 and September 18, 2020. Patients with relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. Exposures: Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. Results: Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (n = 130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]). The median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score (n = 145) was 25 (interquartile range, 25.0-75.0) for the subscale ""role limited owing to physical problems"" (possible range, 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). Computed tomographic lung-scan abnormalities were found in 108 of 171 patients (63%), mainly subtle ground-glass opacities. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 33 of 171 patients (19%), involving less than 25% of parenchyma in all but 1 patient. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 19 of 49 survivors (39%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Among 94 former ICU patients, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms were observed in 23%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 50% in 8 of 83 ICU patients (10%). New-onset chronic kidney disease was observed in 2 ICU patients. Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). Conclusions and Relevance: Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand longer-term outcomes and whether these findings reflect associations with the disease.","Morin, Luc; Savale, Laurent; Pham, Tài; Colle, Romain; Figueiredo, Samy; Harrois, Anatole; Gasnier, Matthieu; Lecoq, Anne-Lise; Meyrignac, Olivier; Noel, Nicolas; Baudry, Elodie; Bellin, Marie-France; Beurnier, Antoine; Choucha, Walid; Corruble, Emmanuelle; Dortet, Laurent; Hardy-Leger, Isabelle; Radiguer, François; Sportouch, Sabine; Verny, Christiane; Wyplosz, Benjamin; Zaidan, Mohamad; Becquemont, Laurent; Montani, David; Monnet, Xavier",JAMA,410,6

The current study aimed to identify the challenges faced by Israeli Air Force (IAF) career personnel. Method: A survey was conducted on 550 participants during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. The participants completed a questionnaire that dealt with unique challenges (personal, family, and command). Results: Of 550 respondents, 54% reported low mood and irritability, 44% reported a constant feeling of anxiety, and 29% reported having sleep problems. Most of them (66%) were mainly concerned about infecting their family. The shift from normal work conditions to an unfamiliar capsule configuration concerned 58% of respondents. Functional continuity concerned 55% of respondents. Managing subordinates concerned 50% of the participants. Of the three types of challenges analyzed (personal, family, and command), the command challenge was the only one where the personal variables (military role, rank, and marital status) made no difference. Finally, about 30% of all respondents reported they needed professional support in dealing with the new circumstances. Their preferred platform was an easily accessible hotline. Conclusions: Life under the COVID-19 threat increased stress factors in the military career population. While reporting greater challenges and higher levels of stress, most of the respondents preferred a brief, focused consultation adjusted to the situation rather than conventional psychological help.

The ongoing threat to global public health and the need for novel therapeutic countermeasures have driven the development of animal models that can reproducibly replicate the pathology associated with MERS-CoV in human infections. The inability of MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of mice, hamsters, and ferrets stymied initial attempts to generate small animal models. Identification of human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (hDPP4) as the receptor for MERS-CoV infection opened the door for genetic engineering of mice. Precise molecular engineering of mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology maintained inherent expression profiles, and limited MERS-CoV susceptibility to tissues that naturally express mDPP4, notably the lower respiratory tract wherein MERS-CoV elicits severe pulmonary pathology. Here, we describe the generation of the 288-330+/+ MERS-CoV mouse model in which mice were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by modifying two amino acids on mDPP4 (A288 and T330), and the use of adaptive evolution to generate novel MERS-CoV isolates that cause fatal respiratory disease. The 288-330+/+ mice are currently being used to evaluate novel drug, antibody, and vaccine therapeutic countermeasures for MERS-CoV. The chapter starts with a historical perspective on the emergence of MERS-CoV and animal models evaluated for MERS-CoV pathogenesis, and then outlines the development of the 288-330+/+ mouse model, assays for assessing a MERS-CoV pulmonary infection in a mouse model, and describes some of the challenges associated with using genetically engineered mice.","Leist, Sarah R; Cockrell, Adam S",Methods Mol Biol,410,16

We collate and review evidence for tetrandrine's putative mechanism of action in viral infection, specifically its recently discovered antagonism of the two-pore channel 2 (TPC2). While tetrandrine's particular history of use provides a very limited pharmacological dataset, there is a suggestion from the available evidence that it could be effective at doses used in clinical practice.

The transition to a virtual format has been challenging for case-based teaching sessions, which involve substantial audience participation. We developed a faculty development workshop aimed at teaching health professions educators how to use various interactive virtual tools within videoconferencing platforms to facilitate virtual case-based sessions. Methods: Two 90-minute workshops were piloted as a faculty development initiative. The facilitators demonstrated interactive teaching tools that could be used within virtual case-based sessions. Then, participants discussed how to incorporate these tools into case-based teaching sessions of different class sizes in small-group breakout sessions. Participants completed an online survey following each workshop to evaluate the sessions. Results: A total of 18 and 26 subjects participated in the first and second workshops, respectively. Survey response rates were 100% (n = 18) and 65% (n = 17) for the first and second workshops, respectively. Both groups provided overall high ratings and reported that the workshop was clear, organized, and relevant. Participants were more familiar and comfortable with the use of various interactive tools for online teaching. Discussion: Distance online teaching will be increasingly required for an undetermined time. Faculty development efforts are crucial to facilitate effective interactive teaching sessions that engage learners and maximize learning.

Additionally, we also conducted a comparability analysis of risk factors across 17 studies. We found evidence supporting a total of 60 predictors for disease severity, of which seven were deemed of high consistency, 40 of medium and 13 of low. Among the factors with high consistency of association, we found age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, albumin, body temperature, SOFA score and diabetes.

The objective was to explore what is known about the roles and services performed by frontline pharmacists during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. A scoping review was conducted of frontline pharmacists’ roles and services during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. A medical librarian conducted comprehensive searches in five bibliographic databases—MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection for articles published between December 2019 and December 2020. The initial search retrieved 3269 articles. After removing duplicates, 1196 articles titles and abstracts were screened, 281 full texts were reviewed for eligibility, and 63 articles were included. This scoping review presents a conceptual framework model of the different layers made visible by COVID-19 of pharmacist roles in public health, information, and medication management. It is theorized that there is an invisible layer of change representing evolving professional role identity that may influence permanent role change following the pandemic. Thus, the pharmacy profession needs to build upon the lessons and experiences of this global pandemic and not let the momentum of the visible and invisible changes go to waste.","Watson, Kaitlyn E.; Schindel, Theresa J.; Barsoum, Marina E.; Kung, Janice Y.",Pharmacy,410,22

It is characterized by airway and respiratory problems, cardiovascular collapse, mucosal inflammation, and other complications, all severe symptoms that can cause death. IgE-dependent anaphylaxis involves mast cells (MCs) which are the main sources of biologically active mediators that contribute to the pathological and lethal phenomena that can occur in anaphylaxis. Antibody-mediated anaphylaxis can follow multiple pathways such as that mediated by MCs carrying the FcÎµRI receptor, which can be activated by very small amounts of antigen including a vaccine antigen and trigger an anaphylactic reaction. In addition, anaphylaxis can also be provoked by high concentrations of IgG antibodies that bind to the FcÎ³R receptor present on basophils, neutrophils, macrophages and MCs. For this reason, the IgG concentration should be kept under control in vaccinations. Activation of MCs is a major cause of anaphylaxis, which requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. MCs are activated through the antigen binding and cross-linking of IgE with release of mediators such as histamine, proteases, prostaglandins, leukotrienes and inflammatory cytokines. The release of these compounds causes nausea, vomiting, hives, wheezing, flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, laryngeal edema, and cardiovascular collapse. mRNA and viral vector vaccines have been cleared by the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generating hope of prevention and cure for COVID-19 around the world. Scientists advise against giving the vaccine to individuals who have had a previous history of anaphylaxis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises people with a previous history of any immediate allergic reaction to remain under observation for approximately 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. To date, vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection have not raised major concerns of severe allergic reactions, although, in some cases, pain and redness at the injection site and fever have occurred after administration of the vaccine. These reactions occur in the first 24-48 hours after vaccination. It has been reported that probable forms of anaphylaxis could also occur, especially in women approximately 40 years of age. But after tens of millions of vaccinations, only a few patients had this severe reaction with a low incidence. Anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions can also occur to any component of the vaccine including polysorbates and polyethylene glycol. To date, there is no precise information on allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals with MCs and complement with higher activation than others may be at greater allergic risk. Moreover, the reactions called anaphylactoids, are those not mediated by IgE because they do not involve this antibody and can also occur in COVID-19 vaccination. These not-IgE-mediated reactions occur through direct activation of MCs and complement with tryptase production, but to a lesser extent than IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. However, at the moment it is not known exactly which component of the vaccine causes the allergic reaction and which vaccine causes the most side effects, including anaphylaxis. Thus, individuals who have a known allergy to any component of the vaccine should not be vaccinated. However, should an anaphylactic reaction occur, this requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. In conclusion, the purpose of this editorial is to encourage the population to be vaccinated in order to extinguish this global pandemic that is afflicting the world population, and to reassure individuals that anaphylactic reactions do not occur with a higher incidence than other vaccinations.","Bellomo, R G; Gallenga, C E; Caraffa, Al; Tetè, G; Ronconi, G; Conti, P",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,410,23

At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with this disease are only supportive. It is well known that zinc (Zn) possesses a variety of direct and indirect antiviral properties, which are realized through different mechanisms. Administration of Zn supplement has a potential to enhance antiviral immunity, both innate and humoral, and to restore depleted immune cell function or to improve normal immune cell function, in particular in immunocompromised or elderly patients. Zn may also act in a synergistic manner when co-administered with the standard antiviral therapy, as was demonstrated in patients with hepatitis C, HIV, and SARS-CoV-1. Effectiveness of Zn against a number of viral species is mainly realized through the physical processes, such as virus attachment, infection, and uncoating. Zn may also protect or stabilize the cell membrane which could contribute to blocking of the virus entry into the cell. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that Zn may inhibit viral replication by alteration of the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in rhinoviruses, HCV, and influenza virus, and diminish the RNA-synthesizing activity of nidoviruses, for which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that Zn supplementation may be of potential benefit for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.","Kumar, Amit; Kubota, Yuichi; Chernov, Mikhail; Kasuya, Hidetoshi",Med Hypotheses,410,1

Psychological strengths will play an important role in struggling with the global novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present study tested a model concerning the relationship between resilience, hope, and subjective happiness using structural equation modeling to identify the mediating role of fear of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a convenience sample of 971 Turkish individuals (aged 18 to 74 years) from 75 of 81 cities in Turkey. The survey included the Subjective Happiness Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, and the Dispositional Hope Scale, and data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The SEM demonstrated an association between resilience-hope and subjective happiness was mediated by fear of COVID-19 (CMIN/df = 2.664, CFI = 0.994, NFI = 0.984, TLI = 0.984, GFI = 0.994, RMSEA = 0.044, SRMR = 0.024, AIC = 81.334, ECVI = 0.084). Resilience had a direct effect and an indirect effect on subjective happiness via fear of COVID-19. Hope also had a direct effect and an indirect effect on subjective happiness via fear of COVID-19. Consequently, in the fight against COVID-19, individuals who are resistant to stress and have a belief that they can find a way to cope can help prevent the fear of COVID-19 and so enhance good mental health.","Satici, Seydi Ahmet; Kayis, Ahmet Rifat; Satici, Begum; Griffiths, Mark D; Can, Gurhan",Int J Ment Health Addict,410,24

We used small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering combined with computational techniques to study the mechanism of interaction of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with hISG15. We showed that hISG15 undergoes a transition from an extended to a compact state after binding to PLpro, a conformation that has not been previously observed in complexes of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with ISG15 from other species. Furthermore, computational analysis showed significant conformational flexibility in the ISG15 N-terminal domain, suggesting that it is weakly bound to PLpro and supports a binding mechanism that is dominated by the C-terminal ISG15 domain.

The study uses a visual analytics approach for detecting changes in water use patterns in the period from January 2018 to April 2020 for the case of a regional European city (Wrocław, Poland). The results of the study showed that the total water consumption in April 2020 did not change significantly, therefore, it did not impact available water resources in the water supply system. However, the amount of used water in different water intake points changed comparing to the previous month mostly in housing buildings (+13.2%), commercial objects (–17.2%), and education facilities (–38.1%). The relatively similar structure of groups of users within the city is a favorable fac-tor, as it results in stable water consumption in each urban district, which is beneficial from the point of view of the urban water supply system.

It will continue to be important to collect data and study different populations to learn more about how children are affected by the disease, particularly as we head back to school in different forms this fall.

METHODS: The study was performed in Wuxi, eastern China between 21 September 2020 and 17 October 2020. Parents of children aged &lt;18 years and HCWs were recruited from the selected immunization clinics. Vaccine hesitancy was assessed using the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) vaccine hesitancy survey (VHS) by summing the total score for 10 items (maximum 50 points). RESULTS: A total of 3009 parents and 86 HCWs were included in the analysis. The category A VHS scores were significantly higher than the category B VHS scores (p = 0.000). Overall, 59.3% and 52.4% of parents reported willingness to avail COVID-19 and influenza vaccination for their children, respectively;51.2% of the HCWs wanted to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Parental category B VHS scores were associated with HCW category B VHS scores (r = 0.928, p = 0.008).

Methods: We further subdivided patients depending on the noninvasive respiratory support used during hospitalization. Results: In those patients who died, we found significant older age and higher multimorbidity and higher values of serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. Among patients who were submitted to bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP), those who died had a significant shorter number of days in overall length of stay and lower values of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) compared to those who survived.

They are prone to acquiring the infection and are threatened by high mortality rates in case of infection. However, HD patients were not included in the efficacy trials of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Such efficacy data would have been critical because HD patients show decreased responses against various other vaccines and this could translate to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as well. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study that contained a group of 81 HD patients and 80 healthy controls. All of them had been vaccinated with the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA vaccine (two doses, as per the manufacturer's recommendation). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody response was measured for all participants 21 days after the second dose. The groups were compared using univariate quantile regressions and a multivariate analysis. The adverse events (AEs) of the vaccination were assessed via a questionnaire. Finally, a correlation between the HBs-Antibody response and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in the HD patients was established. RESULTS: The HD patients had significantly lower Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titres than the control patients 21 days after vaccination (median was 171 U/ml for dialysis patients and 2,500 U/ml for the controls). Further, the HD group presented less AEs than the control group. No correlation was found between the antibody response to previous Hepatitis B vaccination and that of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: HD patients present highly diminished SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titres compared to a cohort of controls. Therefore, they could be much less protected by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations than expected. Further studies to test alternative vaccination schemes should be considered.","Simon, Benedikt; Rubey, Harald; Treipl, Andreas; Gromann, Martin; Hemedi, Boris; Zehetmayer, Sonja; Kirsch, Bernhard",Nephrol. dial. transplant,410,20

However, the differences regarding the training loads and implementation between synchronous and asynchronous types are not yet known. The purpose of this study was to compare the implementation and training load between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs in individuals with spinal cord injury. METHODS: Forty individuals with spinal cord injury were recruited and stratified into tetraplegia and paraplegia groups. All subjects performed 3 weeks of both the synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercise programs, after two weeks of familiarization with the exercises, remote connection tools and methods to record information. The primary outcomes were training load (average daily workload and average and total weekly training load) and implementation (adherence and successful exercise recording). Demographic characteristics were obtained from participants' electronic medical records. RESULTS: Weekly mean workload, total workload, adherence and successful exercise recording presented significantly higher values in the synchronous compared to asynchronous tele-exercises. Average daily workload did not present significant differences between the tele-exercises. DISCUSSION: The training load for each training session presented no differences between synchronous and asynchronous tele-exercises. Both adherence and successful data recording showed more favourable implementation values for synchronous training, thus allowing greater weekly training loads (total and average).","Costa, Rodrigo Rodrigues Gomes; Dorneles, Jefferson R; Veloso, João Hcl; Gonçalves, Carlos Wp; Neto, Frederico Ribeiro",J Telemed Telecare,410,24

It is unclear if antibody effector functions alone could protect against SARS-CoV-2. Here we isolated CV3-13, a non-neutralizing antibody from a convalescent individual with potent Fc-mediated effector functions that targeted the N- terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike. The cryo-EM structure of CV3-13 in complex with SAR-CoV-2 spike revealed that the antibody bound from a distinct angle of approach to a novel NTD epitope that partially overlapped with a frequently mutated NTD supersite in SARS-CoV-2 variants. While CV3-13 did not alter the replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model, an Fc-enhanced CV3-13 significantly delayed neuroinvasion and death in prophylactic settings. Thus, we demonstrate that efficient Fc-mediated effector functions can contribute to the in vivo efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies in the absence of neutralization.","Beaudoin-Bussieres, Guillaume; Chen, Yaozong; Ullah, Irfan; Prevost, Jeremie; Tolbert, William D; Symmes, Kelly; Ding, Shilei; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Gong, Shang Yu; Tauzin, Alexandra; Gasser, Romain; Chatterjee, Debashree; Vezina, Dani; Goyette, Guillaume; Richard, Jonathan; Zhou, Fei; Stamatatos, Leonidas; McGuire, Andrew T; Charest, Hugues; Roger, Michel; Pozharski, Edwin; Kumar, Priti; Mothes, Walther; Uchil, Pradeep D; Pazgier, Marzena; Finzi, Andres",,410,0

However, while such concerns may have been amplified by the pandemic, they preceded Covid-19 and were well documented before 2020. Indeed, in past years the U.S. Congress held several hearings addressing potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. drug supply chain, in part due to the increasing dependency on China as a dominant supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and some finished pharmaceutical products. These vulnerabilities go well beyond health policy and constitute a national security concern.

While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases, individuals present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage. Infected individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell loss. To that end, less is known about how the virus may impact different organ systems. The SARS-CoV2 virus, which is responsible for COVID19, is highly similar to SARS-CoV. Both viruses have evolved an ability to enter host cells through direct interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 protein at the surface of many cells. Published findings indicate that SARS-CoV can enter the human nervous system with evidence from both postmortem brains and detection in cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals. Here, we consider the ability of SARS-CoV2 to enter and infect the human nervous system based on the strong expression of the ACE2 target throughout the brain. Moreover, we predict that nicotine exposure through various kinds of smoking (cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, or vape) can increase the risk for COVID19 neuroinfection based on known functional interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2. We advocate for higher surveillance and analysis of neurocomplications in infected cases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The COVID19 epidemic has spurred a global public health crisis. While many of the cases requiring hospitalization and intensive medical care center on cardiorespiratory treatment, a growing number of cases present neurological symptoms. Viral entry into the brain now appears a strong possibility with deleterious consequences and an urgent need for addressing.","Kabbani, Nadine; Olds, James L",Mol Pharmacol,410,16

Surgical excision is usually considered as the first-line treatment. However, linear scars arising after excision for EC remain a cosmetic problem. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of EC removal assisted with CO2 laser fenestration. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with EC and treated with CO2 laser fenestration, content extrusion, and removal of the cyst wall between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, were included in this study. After a follow-up period ranging from 6 to 27 months, scarring, recurrence, complications, and satisfaction were assessed and analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-three of the 47 patients have been cured by a single operation. The recurrence rate was 8.5%, which was not significantly correlated with tumor sizes or locations. 46.8% of the patients had no obvious scar after treatment. No infections or complications were observed in any of these cases. 89.4% of the patients were satisfied with the effectiveness of the treatment, while 95.7% and 87.2% were satisfied with the comfort and the cosmetic results, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CO2 laser fenestration-assisted removal procedure is effective for the treatment of ECs with good aesthetic outcome.","Liu, Dehua; Zhou, Eray Yihui; Chen, Dian; Tuan, Hsiaohan; Zhao, Yi",,410,24

Special emphasis has been given to discuss guidelines for handling different prosthodontic procedures and implications of this pandemic on prosthodontic practice, education and research. Materials and methods: Relevant literature pertaining to COVID-19 and dentistry was scrutinized on electronic search engines including PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane. Guidelines given by various organizations, institutions, national and international regulatory bodies and Indian Prosthodontic Society were also consulted to gather information pertaining to the objectives of our review. Results: and observations: A total of 160 articles including cross-sectional studies, in vitro study, narrative reviews, letters to the editor and opinions were found to be relevant in accordance with our search strategy. Documented literature revealed that Covid-19 pandemic has culminated in serious clinical, financial and psychological implications in the field of dentistry. Certain steps such as adoption of teledentistry, judicious use of protective equipment, use of rubber dams, pre-procedural rinses have been suggested unanimously. However, there is a dearth of evidence-based recommendations in literature. Data regarding consequences of delaying prosthodontic procedures and patients' perspectives is also sparse. Conclusion: The COVID-19 necessitates the need to adopt a balanced approach while treating patients and safeguarding the dental professionals at the same time. Risk-benefit ratio has to be assessed along with stringent following of guidelines and disinfection protocols to combat this unprecedented situation.","Pruthi, Gunjan; Parkash, Hari; Vijaya Bharathi, P; Jain, Radhika; Gupta, Arpit; Rai, Sachin",,410,10

Government-imposed restrictive measures continue with undetermined effects on physical and mental health.AimsTo compare child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) referrals over 11 months (January–November) in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and examine any impact the different phases of the COVID-19 restrictions might have on referral rates.MethodMonthly CAMHS Health Service Executive data were examined, covering a catchment population of 260 560 or 12.7% of all youth (age group 0–18 years) in Ireland. The total number of urgent and routine referrals, appointments offered, rates of non-attendances and discharge outcome are presented.ResultsThere was a significant drop in referrals in 2020, compared with prior years (χ2 = 10.3, d.f. = 2, P = 0.006). Referrals in 2020 dropped from March to May by 11% and from June to August by 10.3%. From September, both routine and urgent referrals increased by 50% compared with previous years (2018/2019), with the highest increase in November 2020 (180%). Clinic activity also increased from September, with double the number of out-patient appointments offered, compared with previous years (χ2 = 5171.72, d.f. = 3, P &lt; 0.001) and lower (6.6%) rates of non-attendance (χ2 = 868.35, d.f. = 3, P &lt; 0.001).ConclusionsIn 2020, following an initial decline, referrals to CAMHS increased consistently from September. Such unprecedented increase in referrals places further strain on services that are already underresourced and underfunded, with the likelihood of increased waiting lists post COVID-19. It is envisaged that once the pandemic is over, resources will be even more constrained, and CAMHS will be urgently in need of additional ring-fenced funding.","McNicholas, Fiona Kelleher Ian Hedderman Elma Lynch Fionnuala Healy Elaine Thornton Therese Barry Edwina Kelly Lisa McDonald James Holmes Keith Kavanagh Glenda Migone Maria",BJPsych Open,410,23

Methods: Severe COVID-19 patients with self-reported SLS were recruited at hospitalization discharge. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected. The Sino-nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) was used to evaluate rhinological complaints. Subjective olfactory and gustatory functions were assessed with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES). Objective SLS was evaluated using psychophysical tests. Potential associations between olfactory evaluation and the clinical outcomes (duration of hospitalization; admission biology; one month serology (IgG), and chest computed tomography findings) were studied. Results: Forty-seven patients completed the study (25 females). Subjectively, eighteen (38.3%) individuals self-reported subjective partial or total SLS. Among them, only three and four were anosmic and hyposmic, respectively (38.9%). Considering the objective evaluation in the entire cohort, the prevalence of SLS was 21.3%. Elderly patients and those with diabetes had lower objective olfactory evaluation results than young and non-diabetic individuals. Conclusion: The prevalence of SLS in severe COVID-19 patients appears to be lower than previously estimated in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 forms. Future comparative studies are needed to explore the predictive value of SLS for COVID-19 severity.","Lechien, Jerome R.; Ducarme, Morgane; Place, Sammy; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M.; Khalife, Mohamad; De Riu, Giacomo; Vaira, Luigi Angelo; de Terwangne, Christophe; Machayekhi, Shahram; Marchant, Arnaud; Journe, Fabrice; Saussez, Sven",Pathogens,410,24

The parameters for the proposed control charts are obtained using in-control average run length (ARL) at specified shape parametric values for different specified average run lengths. The out-of-control ARL of the proposed gamma control chart using GMDS sampling is explored using simulation for various shift size changes in scale parameters to study the performance of the control chart. The proposed gamma control chart performs better than the existing multiple dependent state sampling (MDS) based on gamma distribution and traditional Shewhart control charts in terms of average run lengths. A case study with real-life data from ICU intake to death caused by COVID-19 has been incorporated for the realistic handling of the proposed control chart design.","Aslam, Muhammad; Rao, G Srinivasa; Saleem, Muhammad; Sherwani, Rehan Ahmad Khan; Jun, Chi-Hyuck",Comput Math Methods Med,410,16

We utilize an Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) device to provide an effective method for mobile phone disinfection and survey HCPs about infection risk. METHODS: Environmental swabs were used to culture HCPs' personal mobile phone surfaces. Four cultures were obtained per phone: before and after the UV-C device's 30-second disinfecting cycle, at the beginning and end of a 12-hour shift. Surveys were administered to participants pre- and poststudy. RESULTS: Total bacterial colony forming units were reduced by 90.5% (Pâ¯=â¯.006) after one UV-C disinfection cycle, and by 99.9% (Pâ¯=â¯.004) after 2 cycles. Total pathogenic bacterial colony forming units were decreased by 98.2% (Pâ¯=â¯.038) after one and >99.99% (Pâ¯=â¯.037) after 2 disinfection cycles. All survey respondents were willing to use the UV-C device daily to weekly, finding it convenient and beneficial. DISCUSSION: This novel UV-C disinfecting device is effective in reducing pathogenic bacteria on mobile phones. HCPs would frequently use a phone disinfecting device to reduce infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a standardized approach to phone disinfection may be valuable in preventing healthcare-associated infections.","Malhotra, Sanchi; Wlodarczyk, Jordan; Kuo, Christopher; Ngo, Catherine; Glucoft, Marisa; Sumulong, Ivan; Smit, Michael A; Bender, Jeffrey M",Am J Infect Control,410,25

We test a method to reduce the workload of these assays, and measure reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens to human serum samples collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe apply Bayesian hierarchical modelling to ELISA measurements of human serum samples against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV antigens. ResultsInflection titers for SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (S1S2), spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and nucleoprotein (N) inferred from three spread-out dilutions correlated with those inferred from eight consecutive dilutions with an R2 value of 0.97 or higher. We confirm existing findings showing a small proportion of pre-pandemic human serum samples contain cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S1S2 and N, and that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases serum reactivity to the beta-HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 S1S2. ConclusionsIn serial dilution assays, large savings in resources and/or increases in throughput can be achieved by reducing the number of dilutions measured and using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to infer inflection or endpoint titers.

METHODS: Data regarding provisional death counts and estimates of excess deaths for COVID-19 according to state and territory were downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics website. Reporting included the six-month-long period of March 1 - August 31, 2020. Excess mortality rates were calculated as the number of excess deaths per 100,000 persons in each state population using 2019 US Census Bureau data. Mean values for state and territorial NHSPI domain indices were compared to state and territorial rates of COVID-19-related excess mortality using multiple linear regression, including analysis of variance. Correlations between the 51 state and territorial NHSPI values and corresponding COVID-19 excess mortality rates were calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: These calculations revealed a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.02 and 0.25) and poor correlation (P = .16 and .08) among values for the overall NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico.There was also a high degree of variance (adjusted r square = 0.001 and 0.03) and poor correlation (P values ranging from .09 to .94) for values for the six individual domains of the NHSPI as compared to low and high estimates of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico. CONCLUSION: The NHSPI does not appear to be a valid predictor of excess COVID-19 mortality rates for 50 US states and Puerto Rico during the first six months of the pandemic.","Keim, Mark E; Lovallo, Alex P",Prehosp Disaster Med,410,22

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complete clinical and imaging data of 114 confirmed COVID-19 patients treated in Xiaogan Hospital were analysed retrospectively. Data were gathered regarding the presence of chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities; the distribution, morphology, density, location, and stage of abnormal shadows on chest CT; and observing the correlation between the severity of chest infection and lymphocyte ratio and blood oxygen saturation (SPO2) in patients. RESULTS: Chest CT revealed abnormal lung shadows in 110 patients. Regarding lesion distribution, multi-lobe lesions in both lungs were present in most patients (80 cases; 72.7%). Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO2 and lymphocyte numbers (p<0.05), with r-values of -0.446 and -0.780, respectively. CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.","Wang, K; Kang, S; Tian, R; Zhang, X; Wang, Y",Clin Radiol,410,30

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation with B3LYP functional employing 6-311+G(d,p) basis set was used to calculate quantum chemical descriptors. Topological, physicochemical and thermodynamic parameters were calculated using ChemOffice software. The dataset was divided randomly into training and test sets consisting of 32 and 8 compounds, respectively. In attempt to explore the structural requirements for bioactives molecules with significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, we have built valid and robust statistics models using QSAR approach. Hundred linear pentavariate and quadrivariate models were established by changing training set compounds and further applied in test set to calculate predicted IC50 values of compounds. Both built models were individually validated internally as well as externally along with Y-Randomization according to the OECD principles for the validation of QSAR model and the model acceptance criteria of Golbraikh and Tropsha's. Model 34 is chosen with higher values of R2, R2 test and Q2cv (R2 = 0.838, R2 test= 0.735, Q2 cv = 0.757). It is very important to notice that anti-SARS-CoV main protease of these compounds appear to be mainly governed by five descriptors, i.e. highest occupied molecular orbital energy (EHOMO), energy of molecular orbital below HOMO energy (EHOMO-1), Balaban index (BI), bond length between the two sulfur atoms (S1S2) and bond length between sulfur atom and benzene ring (S2Bnz). Here the possible action mechanism of these compounds was analyzed and discussed, in particular, important structural requirements for great SARS-CoV main protease inhibitor will be by substituting disulfides with smaller size electron withdrawing groups. Based on the best proposed QSAR model, some new compounds with higher SARS-CoV inhibitors activities have been designed.

DESIGN: Time series study of high income countries. SETTING: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States. PARTICIPANTS: Mortality data from the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series of the Human Mortality Database for 2016-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Covid-19 pandemic and associated policy measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly excess deaths (observed deaths versus expected deaths predicted by model) in 2020, by sex and age (0-14, 15-64, 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years), estimated using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model that accounts for temporal trends and seasonal variability in mortality. RESULTS: An estimated 979 000 (95% confidence interval 954 000 to 1 001 000) excess deaths occurred in 2020 in the 29 high income countries analysed. All countries had excess deaths in 2020, except New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. The five countries with the highest absolute number of excess deaths were the US (458 000, 454 000 to 461 000), Italy (89 100, 87 500 to 90 700), England and Wales (85 400, 83 900 to 86 800), Spain (84 100, 82 800 to 85 300), and Poland (60 100, 58 800 to 61 300). New Zealand had lower overall mortality than expected (-2500, -2900 to -2100). In many countries, the estimated number of excess deaths substantially exceeded the number of reported deaths from covid-19. The highest excess death rates (per 100 000) in men were in Lithuania (285, 259 to 311), Poland (191, 184 to 197), Spain (179, 174 to 184), Hungary (174, 161 to 188), and Italy (168, 163 to 173); the highest rates in women were in Lithuania (210, 185 to 234), Spain (180, 175 to 185), Hungary (169, 156 to 182), Slovenia (158, 132 to 184), and Belgium (151, 141 to 162). Little evidence was found of subsequent compensatory reductions following excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Approximately one million excess deaths occurred in 2020 in these 29 high income countries. Age standardised excess death rates were higher in men than women in almost all countries. Excess deaths substantially exceeded reported deaths from covid-19 in many countries, indicating that determining the full impact of the pandemic on mortality requires assessment of excess deaths. Many countries had lower deaths than expected in children <15 years.

The good news is that interventions to be tested are not in short supply. Unfortunately, the human and material resources needed to conduct these trials are finite. It is essential that trials be robust and meet enrollment targets and that lower-quality studies not be permitted to displace higher-quality studies, delaying answers to critical questions. Yet, with few exceptions, existing research review bodies and processes are not designed to ensure these conditions are satisfied. To meet this challenge, we offer guidance for research institutions about how to ethically consolidate and prioritize COVID-19 clinical trials, while recognizing that consolidation and prioritization should also take place upstream (among manufacturers and funders) and at a higher level (e.g. nationally). In our proposed three-stage process, trials must first meet threshold criteria. Those that do are evaluated in a second stage to determine whether the institution has sufficient capacity to support all proposed trials. If it does not, the third stage entails evaluating studies against two additional sets of comparative prioritization criteria: those specific to the study and those that aim to advance diversification of an institution's research portfolio. To implement these criteria fairly, we propose that research institutions form COVID-19 research prioritization committees. We briefly discuss some important attributes of these committees, drawing on the authors' experiences at our respective institutions. Although we focus on clinical trials of COVID-19 therapeutics, our guidance should prove useful for other kinds of COVID-19 research, as well as non-pandemic research, which can raise similar challenges due to the scarcity of research resources.","Meyer, Michelle N; Gelinas, Luke; Bierer, Barbara E; Hull, Sara Chandros; Joffe, Steven; Magnus, David; Mohapatra, Seema; Sharp, Richard R; Spector-Bagdady, Kayte; Sugarman, Jeremy; Wilfond, Benjamin S; Lynch, Holly Fernandez",Clin Trials,410,16

Methods: A real-time internet-based survey endorsed by the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiologists (AEPC) Working Groups for Cardiac Imaging and Cardiovascular Intensive Care. Inclusion criteria was children 0-18 years admitted to hospital between February 1 and June 6, 2020 with diagnosis of an inflammatory syndrome and acute cardiovascular complications. Results: A total of 286 children from 55 centers in 17 European countries were included. The median age was 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-12.4 years) and 67% were males. The most common cardiovascular complications were shock, cardiac arrhythmias, pericardial effusion and coronary artery dilatation. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was present in over half of the patients and a vast majority of children had raised cardiac troponin (cTnT) when checked. The biochemical markers of inflammation were raised in majority of patients on admission: elevated CRP, serum ferritin, procalcitonin, NT-proBNP, IL-6 level and D-dimers. There was a statistically significant correlation between degree of elevation in cardiac and biochemical parameters and need for intensive care support (p <0.05). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 33.6% while IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in 15.7% and IgG 43.6 % cases, respectively when checked. One child died in the study cohort. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement is common in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid-19 pandemic. A majority of children have significantly raised levels of NT pro-BNP, ferritin, D-dimers and cardiac troponin in addition to high CRP and procalcitonin levels. Compared to adults with Covid-19, mortality in children with MIS-C is uncommon despite multi-system involvement, very elevated inflammatory markers and need for intensive care support.","Valverde, Israel; Singh, Yogen; Sanchez-de-Toledo, Joan; Theocharis, Paraskevi; Chikermane, Ashish; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Kucinska, Beata; Mannarino, Savina; Tamariz-Martel, Amalia; Gutierrez-Larraya, Federico; Soda, Giridhar; Vandekerckhove, Kristof; Gonzalez Barlatey, Francisco; McMahon, Colin Joseph; Marcora, Simona Anna; Pace Napoleone, Carlo; Duong, Phuoc; Tuo, Giulia; Deri, Antigoni; Nepali, Gauri; Ilina, Maria; Ciliberti, Paolo; Miller, Owen",Circulation,410,24

In this study, we aim to determine the rate of undetected infection in HCWs, a potential source of nosocomial infection. METHODS: Serological screening for IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out among HCWs from four different hospitals in Madrid, Spain, from 6 April to 25 April 2020; HCWs with a previous diagnosis of infection based on real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay performed after presenting compatible symptoms were excluded. Prevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies was calculated among HCWs to obtain the rate of COVID-19 presence of antibodies in each hospital. RESULTS: Of the 7121 HCWs studied, 6344 (89.09%) had not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19. A total of 5995 HCWs finally participated in the study, resulting in a participation rate of 94.49%.

AimsAscertain changes across settings in healthcare service presentations with self-harm during Waves 1 and 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodE-cohort study using individual-level linked routine healthcare data from Wales, UK, 2016-March 2021. We measured weekly proportion of self-harm contacts and people who self-harmed in contact with general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We modelled weekly trends using linear regression and generalised estimated equations, quantifying time differences using difference-in-difference (DiD). ResultsWe included 3,552,210 Welsh residents aged [≥]10 years. Counts of self-harm presentations across settings was at a minimum at the start of stay-at-home restrictions during both waves and recovered compared to previous years in 3-5 months. Those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in GP compared to other settings and previous years - mean rate of OR=1.2, although actual numbers fell. The proportion of self-harm ED contacts admitted to hospital dropped from June 2020 (1.9 [1.5-2.3] pp/month). Self-harm and COVID-19 infection had a bidirectional effect - self-harm history had OR=1.4 [1.2-1.6] and incidence had DiD=1.1 [0.8-1.4]. ConclusionsThose that self-harmed and sought help during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially encountered stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly in Wave 2, while in Wave 1 they preferentially presented to GP. Reductions in contacts likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services. Relevance statementThis study provides novel findings on how the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to curb its spread affected self-harm healthcare service presentations. To our knowledge no other population-based studies in the UK have linked routinely collected general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admission data covering Waves 1 and 2 of the pandemic. Reductions in presentations with self-harm during the pandemic may be the result of those not requiring ED care or hospitalisation avoiding seeking help during the pandemic as often as before. Those that did seek help potentially encountered more stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly during Wave 2. This likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services. Measures should be put in place to ensure that those who self-harm receive appropriate assessment and intervention.","Banos, Marcos del Pozo; Lee, Sze Chim; Friedmann, Yasmin; Akbari, Ashley; Tobari, Fatemeh; Lloyd, Keith R; Lyons, Ronan A; John, Ann",,410,17

Design: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE). A retrospective analysis of patients treated with TCZ matched using propensity score to patients treated with Standard Of Care (SOC) was conducted. Setting: The study was conducted at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, from March 14, 2020 to March 27, 2020. Participants: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our institution at the time of TCZ availability. Interventions: TCZ was administered to 21 patients. The first administration was 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg per dose) of Tocilizumab intravenously, repeated after 12 h if no side effects were reported after the first dose. Main Outcomes and Measures: ICU admission and 7-day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. Results: There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years). Using propensity scores, the 21 patients who received TCZ were matched to 21 patients who received SOC (a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and prophylactic dose of low weight heparin). No adverse event was detected following TCZ administration. This study found that treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect ICU admission (OR 0.11; 95% CI between 0.00 and 3.38; p = 0.22) or 7-day mortality rate (OR 0.78; 95% CI between 0.06 and 9.34; p = 0.84) when compared with SOC. Analysis of laboratory measures showed significant interactions between time and treatment regarding C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets and international normalized ratio (INR) levels. Variation in lymphocytes count was observed over time, irrespective of treatment. Conclusions: TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients. Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Colaneri, Marta; Bogliolo, Laura; Valsecchi, Pietro; Sacchi, Paolo; Zuccaro, Valentina; Brandolino, Fabio; Montecucco, Carlomaurizio; Mojoli, Francesco; Giusti, Emanuele Maria; Bruno, Raffaele",Microorg.,410,24

Using the panel data of 30 regions in China from 2006 to 2016, this paper uses the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator to analyze the impact of inclusive finance on public health. The results show that inclusive finance has a significant positive effect on public health. The performance of the eastern region is significantly better than that of the central and western regions. When we consider the combined effect of environmental regulation, the improvement effect of inclusive finance on public health is still significant, and the coefficient increases in the eastern region. Similarly, there is also a significant improvement effect in the central and western regions. Our findings reveal that environmental regulation promotes the beneficial effect of inclusive finance.

METHODS: Participants were consented to answer a physician-administered questionnaire following Ramadan 2020. Impact of COVID-19 on the decision of fasting, intentions to fast and duration of Ramadan and Shawal fasting, hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia events were assessed. Specific analysis comparing age categories of <65 years and &#8805;65 years were performed. RESULTS: Among the 5865 participants, 22.5% were &#8805;65 years old. Concern for COVID-19 affected fasting decision for 7.6% (&#8805;65 years) vs 5.4% (<65 years). More participants &#8805;65 years old did not fast (28.8% vs 12.7%, <65 years). Of the 83.6%, participants fulfilling Ramadan-fasting, 94.8% fasted &#8805;15 days and 12.6% had to break fast due to diabetes-related illness. The average number of days fasting within and post-Ramadan were 27 and 6 days respectively, regardless of age. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia occurred in 15.7% and 16.3% of participants respectively, with 6.5% and 7.4% requiring hospital care respectively. SMBG was performed in 73.8% of participants and 43.5% received Ramadan-focused education. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, universally high rates of Ramadan-fasting were observed regardless of fasting risk level. Glycemic complications occurred frequently with older adults requiring higher rates of acute hospital care. Risk stratification is essential followed by pre-Ramadan interventions, Ramadan-focused diabetes education and self-monitoring to reduce and prevent complications, with particular emphasis in older adults.","Hassanein, Mohamed; Hussein, Zanariah; Shaltout, Inass; Wan Seman, Wan Juani; Tong, Chin Voon; Mohd Noor, Nurain; Buyukbese, Mehmet Akif; El Tony, Lobna; Shaker, Gamal Mohamed; Alamoudi, Reem M; Hafidh, Khadija; Fariduddin, M; Batais, Mohammed A; Shaikh, Shehla; Malek, Pr Rachid; Alabbood, Majid; Sahay, Rakesh; Alshenqete, Abdulwadod M; Yakoob Ahmedani, Muhammad",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,410,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was sent to 71 pathology laboratories from 21 European countries. The questionnaire requested information concerning the organization of biosafety, the clinical and molecular pathology, the biobanking, the workload, the associated research into COVID-19, and the organization of education and training during the COVID-19 crisis, from 15 March to 31 May 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned from 53/71 (75%) laboratories from 18 European countries. The biosafety procedures were heterogeneous. The workload in clinical and molecular pathology decreased dramatically by 31% (range, 3%-55%) and 26% (range, 7%-62%), respectively. According to the professional category, between 28% and 41% of the staff members were not present in the laboratories but did teleworking.

More than one-third of COVID-19 patients report neurological symptoms and cases of neurological diseases are increasingly accumulating. The aim of this systematic review was to characterize all - to date - reported cases with COVID-19 related myelopathy. Methods×Eighteen papers were included in this review. Patients of all ages could be affected, although there is a predilection for middle-aged people. Results×There were no significant co-morbidities or immunodeficiencies in the affected patients. COVID-19 related myelopathy started roughly within the first month after COVID-19 onset, either concomitantly with COVID-19 symptoms or within 10 days after their remission. The vast majority of cases fulfilled our criteria for postinfectious transverse myelitis. However, some cases were considered to have had parainfectious or infectious myelitis or, in one case, vascular myelopathy. Motor, sensory and bowel and/or bladder symptoms predominated the clinical presentation of myelopathies, explained mainly by centrally localized and longitudinally extensive lesions within the cervical and/or thoracic segments of the spinal cord. Occasionally lesions were complicated by necrosis and hemorrhages. Treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange was offered mostly a mild to marked improvement within a period of some weeks. Conclusions× Considering the imminent arrival of new vaccines against COVID-19 pandemic, and their potential risk for postvaccination transverse myelitis, this characterization of COVID-19 related myelopathy is of utmost importance.","Artemiadis, Artemios; Liampas, Andreas; Hadjigeorgiou, Loizos; Zis, Panagiotis",Neurol Res,410,1

Because of time restraints, the online format may be ideal for providing foundational review material in clinical courses, but the effectiveness of the online format for review purposes in this setting has not been adequately investigated. This project compared student learning and satisfaction delivered by two different methods in a special populations course for third-year doctor of chiropractic students. The two methods of delivery were: 1) a face-to-face lecture (F2FL) on pediatric spinal anatomy, and 2) an online learning module (OLM) covering the same material. Methods This study was approved by the institutional IRB. A cohort comparison, mixed methods study design compared student learning and satisfaction of a pediatric spinal anatomy review delivered through a F2FL (n=22) and OLM (n=18) in two successive 2019 (pre-COVID) course offerings. Previously validated pre- and post-tests for the material were given to the students one week prior and one week following the intervention (either F2FL or week-long availability of the OLM). An instructor not affiliated with the course completed a ?Similarity of Material Assessment? that evaluated the similarity of content in each method of delivery. Identical tests were given to each group. In addition, a survey assessing the method of delivery, comfort with technology, and preference of F2FL vs. OLM of review material, was completed by both groups immediately following administration of the post-test. Differences between pre-and post-test results were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA with F2FL and OLM as groups and pre-and post-test results as repeated measures. Results The content presented to the F2FL and OLM groups was judged to be the same by the independent instructor. Testing results showed an improvement with both groups from pre- to post-test [F2FL 54.6%, p&lt;0.0001 vs. OLM 48.9%, p&lt;0.0001 (OLM 52.35%, p&lt;0.0001 with one dramatic outlier removed)], with no significant difference between test results between the F2FL and OLM groups [p=0.53 (p=0.82 with outlier removed)]. The survey showed: 83.3% of OLM students felt the online method was effective and 88.9% would prefer the material to be presented online;80% of the F2F group thought the lecture was engaging/effective and 60% would have preferred to have the material presented online. Conclusions The OLM was found to be as effective as the F2FL for the content assessed, and students were highly satisfied with the online method of instruction of the anatomy review material. This strategy could potentially be applied to provide additional review materials fundamental to other clinical courses. The OLM method allows for the material to be developed and given by content experts while also freeing valuable in-class time to be used for more experiential learning in clinical courses.","Cramer, Gregory Grieve Thomas Madigan Dana Pocius Judith Olsen Christopher Faydenko Jocelyn",The FASEB Journal,410,1

419195,419195,419195,COVID-19 pandemic: a sentiment analysis,17.952433,4.863508,2020,"BACKGROUND: Young adults' drinking habits commonly exceed recommendations for low-risk drinking, which may have a negative effect on their mental, social, and physical health. As smartphones are highly accessible to young adults, mobile apps could be used to support young adults to develop low-risk drinking habits and improve their general health. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Boozebuster, a self-guided mobile app based on healthy lifestyle-related components that aim to develop and maintain low-risk drinking habits among young adults. METHODS: This two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will investigate whether a 6-week self-guided mobile intervention (Boozebuster) targeting drinking behavior is more effective than a minimal intervention consisting of an educational website on alcohol use and its consequences for young adults. We will recruit 506 young adults (aged 18-30 years) from the Netherlands via an open recruitment strategy by using an open access website. All outcomes will be self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10 g ethanol per standard drink) per month (timeline follow-back [TLFB]). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale), readiness to change (Readiness to Change Questionnaire), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), trauma and COVID-19-related trauma (Short-Form Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), impulsivity (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale), study or work performance (Individual Work Performance Questionnaire), and treatment adherence. Baseline (T0), 6-week postbaseline (T1), and 3-month postbaseline (T2) assessments will be conducted and analyzed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle using multilevel mixed modeling analyses. RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2020. We received 933 registrations via our study information website; 506 participants have completed the T0 assessment, 336 participants have completed the T1 assessment, and 308 participants have completed the T2 assessment as of May 2021. The study is still in progress, and results will be reported in 2021 and 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided mobile interventions based on a lifestyle approach might be an attractive approach for young adults due to their preference on self-reliance, healthy living, and increased perceived anonymity. Such interventions are yet understudied, and it is known that interventions addressing solely problem drinking are less appealing to young adults. We hypothesize that the Boozebuster mobile app will effectively reduce drinking levels compared to an alcohol educational website (control condition). If effective, our intervention could be an inexpensive and scalable public health intervention to improve drinking habits in young adults.

Computational methods have been applied to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in five different countries (Ireland, Germany, UK, South Korea and Iceland) using their reported daily infection data. A Gaussian convolution smoothing function constructed a continuous epidemic line profile that was segmented into longitudinal time series of mathematically fitted individual logistic curves. The time series of fitted curves allowed comparison of disease progression with differences in decreasing daily infection numbers following the epidemic peak being of specific interest. A positive relationship between the rate of declining infections and countries with comprehensive COVID-19 testing regimes existed. Insight into different rates of decline infection numbers following the wave peak was also possible which could be a useful tool to guide the reopening of societies. In contrast, extended epidemic timeframes were recorded for those least prepared for large-scale testing and contact tracing. As many countries continue to struggle to implement population wide testing it is prudent to explore additional measures that could be employed. Comparative analysis of healthcare worker (HCW) infection data from Ireland shows it closely related to that of the entire population with respect to trends of daily infection numbers and growth rates over a 57-day period. With 31.6% of all test-confirmed infections in healthcare workers (all employees of healthcare facilities), they represent a concentrated 3% subset of the national population which if exhaustively tested (regardless of symptom status) could provide valuable information on disease progression in the entire population (or set). Mathematically, national population and HCWs can be viewed as a set and subset with significant influences on each other, with solidarity between both an essential ingredient for ending this crisis.","Wu, Dan; Mac Aonghusa, Pól; O039,; Shea, Donal F",PLoS One,410,16

To date, however, no known study has examined the prevalence, risk and protective factors of psychiatric conditions among US military veterans who survived COVID-19. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 2019 to 2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 US veterans. Prepandemic and 1-year peripandemic risk and protective factors associated with positive screens for peripandemic internalising (major depressive, generalised anxiety and/or posttraumatic stress disorders) and externalising psychiatric disorders (alcohol and/or drug use disorders) and suicidal ideation were examined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 233 veterans (8.6%) reported having been infected with COVID-19. Relative to veterans who were not infected, veterans who were infected were more likely to screen positive for internalising disorders (20.5% vs 13.9%, p=0.005), externalising disorders (23.2% vs 14.8%, p=0.001) and current suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 7.6%, p=0.015) at peripandemic. Multivariable analyses revealed that greater prepandemic psychiatric symptom severity and COVID-related stressors were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic internalising disorders, while prepandemic trauma burden was protective. Prepandemic suicidal ideation, greater loneliness and lower household income were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic suicidal ideation, whereas prepandemic community integration was protective. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation are prevalent in veterans who have survived COVID-19. Veterans with greater prepandemic psychiatric and substance use problems, COVID-related stressors and fewer psychosocial resources may be at increased risk of these outcomes.","Na, Peter; Tsai, J; Harpaz-Rotem, I; Pietrzak, R",,410,17

Of the 19 selected articles, there were 12 expert opinion articles, two literature reviews, two prospective cohort studies, one retrospective cohort study, one descriptive study and one pooled meta-analysis that comment on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical wellbeing (16 articles), psychosocial wellbeing (15 articles) and financial wellbeing of cancer survivors (3 articles). CONCLUSIONS: Limited definitive evidence exists regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer survivors. Currently available literature provides preliminary indications of wide-ranging impacts of the pandemic on cancer survivors with respect to the requirement to adapt to new means of healthcare delivery as well as their physical, psychosocial and economic wellbeing. The pandemic has left survivors dealing with the consequences of rigorous cancer treatment in the context of new challenges related to social isolation, financial hardship and uncertainty with respect to their ongoing care. Additional rigorously designed research initiatives are required to elucidate the impact of the pandemic on cancer survivors.","Jammu, Anish Singh; Chasen, Martin Robert; Lofters, Aisha Kamilah; Bhargava, Ravi",Support. care cancer,410,1

However, these variants may account for a limited proportion of phenotype variability attributable to the genome. Using genome-wide common variation, we measured the narrow-sense heritability [ h SNP 2 ] of 7 pharmacodynamic and 5 pharmacokinetic phenotypes across 3 cardiovascular drugs, 2 antibiotics, and 3 immunosuppressants. We used a Bayesian Hierarchical Mixed Model, BayesR, to model the distribution of genome-wide variant effect sizes for each drug phenotype as a mixture of 4 normal distributions of fixed variance (0, 0.01%, 0.1% and 1% of the total additive genetic variance). This model allowed us to parse h SNP 2 into bins representing contributions of no-, small-, moderate- and large-effect size variants respectively. For the 12 phenotypes, a median of 969 (range 235-6,304) unique individuals of European ancestry and a median of 1,201,626 (range 777,427-1,514,275) variants were included in our analyses. The number of variants contributing to h SNP 2 ranged from 2,791 to 5,356 (median 3,347). Estimates for h SNP 2 ranged from 0.05 (ACE-inhibitor induced cough) to 0.59 (gentamicin concentration). Small- and moderate-effect variants contributed a majority to h SNP 2 for every phenotype (range 61-95%). We conclude that drug outcome phenotypes are highly polygenic. Thus, larger genome-wide association studies of drug phenotypes are needed both to discover novel variants and to determine how genome-wide approaches may improve clinical prediction of drug outcomes.","Muhammad, Ayesha; Aka, Ida T; Birdwell, Kelly A; Gordon, Adam S; Roden, Dan M; Wei, Wei-Qi; Mosley, Jonathan D; Van Driest, Sara L",Clin. pharmacol. ther,410,16

Conjunctivitis is also reported in a small number of cases. We evaluated ocular symptoms and ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in a group of patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Fifty-six patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited as subjects. Relevant medical histories were obtained from the electronic medical record system. Ocular history and ocular symptoms data were obtained by communicating directly with the subjects. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Salisbury Eye Evaluation Questionnaire (SEEQ) were used to assess the anterior ocular surface condition before and after the onset of disease. RESULTS: Patients classified as severe COVID-19 cases were more likely to have hypertension compared to mild cases (p = 0.035). Of the 56 subjects, thirteen patients (23%) were infected in Wuhan, 32 patients (57%) were community-infected, 10 patients (18%) were unknown origin, 1 (2%) was a physician likely infected by a confirmed patient. Three patients wore face mask with precaution when contacting the confirmed patients. Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset. The differences in mean scores of OSDI questionnaire and SEEQ between before and after onset of COVID-19 were all significant (p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Ocular symptoms are relatively common in COVID-19 disease and may appear just before the onset of respiratory symptoms.

African countries have used different national reporting systems to publicly share data. Analyzing the content, format, and frequency of these systems could elucidate lessons for future pandemics. MethodsWe examined national COVID-19 reporting practices across 54 African countries through 2020. Reporting systems were compared by type of report, frequency, and data content. We also compared reporting of metrics such as a patient demographics and co-morbidities, healthcare capacity, and diagnostic testing. We further evaluated regional and country-specific reporting practices in Cameroon, Egypt, Kenya, Senegal, and South Africa as examples from different sub-regions. ResultsNational COVID-19 reporting systems were identified in 53/54 (98.1%) countries in 2020. Reporting systems were diverse and could be categorized into social media postings, websites, press releases, situation reports, and online dashboards. Of countries with reporting systems, 36/53 (67.9%) had recurrent situation reports and/or online dashboards which provided the highest quality of data. ConclusionsAfrican countries created diverse reporting systems to share COVID-19 data. Many countries used routinely updated situation reports or online dashboards. However, few countries reported patient demographics, co-morbidities, diagnostic testing practices, and healthcare capacity. Including these metrics as well as improving standardization and accessibility of data reporting systems could augment research and decision-making, as well as increase public awareness and transparency for national governments.","Judson, Seth D; Torimiro, Judith; Pigott, David M; Maima, Apollo; Mostafa, Ahmed; Samy, Ahmed; Rabinowitz, Peter; Njabo, Kevin",,410,23

In Italy, substantial cuts in funding have drastically reduced the resources of the National Health Service (NHS) and contributed to the expansion of the private health sector which, unlike the public health system, does not have the capacity to deal with a health emergency such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this article is to show how the privatization of the NHS contributed to making Italy more vulnerable and unprepared to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The available capacity and resources in the public and private emergency services systems in Italy are compared, including a focus on the numbers of hospital staff, hospitals, and hospital beds. The reduced funding and subsequent shortfalls in services in the NHS are reasons why extreme measures were needed to increase these resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. A public NHS in Italy would be better prepared for future health emergencies. The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic can help to inform future health systems strategies, to halt the current financial decline and performance loss of national health systems, and to enable better preparation for future health emergencies.","Buzelli, Maria Luisa; Boyce, Tammy",Int J Health Serv,410,1

Here we compare the effectiveness of two full-length Spike protein-encoding mRNA vaccines from Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) in the Mayo Clinic Health System over time from January to July 2021, during which either the Alpha or Delta variant was highly prevalent. We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25,589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81-90.6%; BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69-81%) and COVID-19 associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81-97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73-93%). In July, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81%, 95% CI: 33-96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24-93.9%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI: 58-87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13-62%), with a more pronounced reduction for BNT162b2. Notably, the Delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July whereas the Alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62). Our observational study highlights that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly protect against infection and severe disease, further evaluation of mechanisms underlying differences in their effectiveness such as dosing regimens and vaccine composition are warranted.","Puranik, Arjun; Lenehan, Patrick J; Silvert, Eli; Niesen, Michiel JM; Corchado-Garcia, Juan; O'Horo, John C; Virk, Abinash; Swift, Melanie D; Halamka, John; Badley, Andrew D; Venkatakrishnan, AJ; Soundararajan, Venky",,410,26

A state of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), along with pulmonary embolism and/or deep vein thrombosis, has been observed in critically ill ICU patients. Autopsy reports of COVID-19 patients demonstrated microthrombi in lungs and in other organs, as well as marked inflammatory changes, characteristic clinicopathological features that exacerbate disease severity. Vitamin D supplementation was recommended by many clinicians across the globe to improve clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients, mainly because of its immunomodulatory roles on immune cells. Furthermore, vitamin D and its associated molecules are also known to directly or indirectly regulate various thrombotic pathways. We propose that vitamin D supplementation not only attenuates the risk of Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) but it also may have a role in reducing coagulation abnormalities in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The overarching goal of this review is to discuss the effects of vitamin D on coagulation pathways and other intertwined processes leading to thrombosis. Many clinical trials are currently investigating the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection. However, randomized placebo control clinical trials are also necessary to ascertain the effect of vitamin D supplementation on reducing the risk of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.","Sengupta, Tanusree; Majumder, Rinku; Majumder, Samarpan",Mol. cell. biochem,410,30

To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs.

Their application in general settings, such as automated border gates using ePassports or at entrances to buildings or rooms, has become popular as well. Regrettably, where current biometry scanning technologies are reliably suitable for single‐user devices, when hundreds or thousands of people need to be processed, shortcomings emerge. The requirement of physically coming to a halt during scanning poses a limitation to the throughput of the people processed. Additionally, since most of these systems require physical contact, hygienic concerns need to be considered, especially with contagious pandemics such as COVID‐19. In this article, we present a solution to the issue of limited throughput and hygienic concerns by developing a biometric system that allows identification on the fly. Using the experimental setup of our design, we demonstrate that hand‐related biometrics can be acquired on the fly. Furthermore, using a random decision forest classifier and our house‐collected database containing over 560 unique images, we inaugurated that the system is a viable solution for biometric identification on the fly.

(Aim) This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LPV/RTV in COVID-19 patients in the published research. (Methods) A protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Articles were selected for review from 8 electronic databases. This review evaluated the effects of LPV/RTV alone or in combination with standard care ± interferons/antiviral treatments compared to other therapies, regarding duration of hospital stay, risk of progressing to invasive mechanical, time to virological cure and body temperature normalization, cough relief, radiological progression, mortality and safety. (Results) A consensus was reached to select 32 articles for full-text screening; only 14 articles comprising 9036 patients were included in this study; and eight of these were included for meta-analysis. Most of these studies did not report positive clinical outcomes with LPV/RTV treatment. In terms of virological cure, three studies reported less time in days to achieve a virological cure for LPV/RTV arm relative to no antiviral treatment (-0.81 day; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.44 to 2.81; p = 0.007, I2 = 80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (p = 0.66). When comparing the LPV/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm, but not statically significant (p = 0.09). In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief, no favorable effects of LPV/RTV versus umifenovir were observed. The largest trials (RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY) have shown that LPV/RTV failed to reduce mortality, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation or hospitalization duration. Adverse events were reported most frequently for LPV/RTV (n = 84) relative to other antivirals and no antiviral treatments. (Conclusions) This review did not reveal any significant advantage in efficacy of LPV/RTV for the treatment of COVID-19 over standard care, no antivirals or other antiviral treatments. This result might not reflect the actual evidence.","Alhumaid, Saad; Mutair, Abbas Al; Alawi, Zainab Al; Alhmeed, Naif; Zaidi, Abdul Rehman Zia; Tobaiqy, Mansour",,410,6

However, little is known of whether other non-glucose molecules, besides vitamin C, interfere with glucometry. Therefore, we sought to determine whether other antioxidants might behave like vitamin C in causing falsely elevated blood glucose levels, potentially exposing patients to glycemic mismanagement by being administered harmful doses of glucose-lowering drugs. To determine whether various antioxidants can be detected by seven commercial glucose meters, human blood samples were spiked with various antioxidants ex vivo and their effect on the glucose results were assessed by Parkes error grid analysis. Several of the glucose meters demonstrated a positive bias in the glucose measurement of blood samples spiked with vitamin C, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione. With the most interference-sensitive glucose meter, non-blood solutions of 1 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, cysteine, vitamin C, dihydrolipoate, and dithiothreitol mimicked the results seen on that glucose meter for 0.7, 1.0, 1.2, 2.6, 3.7 and 5.5 mmol/L glucose solutions, respectively. Glucose meter users should be alerted that some of these devices might produce spurious glucose results not only in patients on vitamin C therapy but also in those being administered other antioxidants. As discussed herein, the clinical relevance of the data is immediate in view of the current use of antioxidant therapies for disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and coronavirus disease 2019.","Grzych, Guillaume; Pekar, Jean-David; Chevalier-Curt, Marie Joncquel; Decoin, Raphaël; Vergriete, Pauline; Henry, Héloïse; Odou, Pascal; Maboudou, Patrice; Brousseau, Thierry; Vamecq, Joseph",Clin Biochem,410,20

The nonstructural protein nsp5, also called 3C-like protease, is responsible for processing viral polyprotein precursors in coronavirus (CoV) replication. Previous studies have shown that PDCoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 to disrupt interferon (IFN) production and signaling, respectively. Whether PDCoV nsp5 also cleaves IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), IFN-induced antiviral effector molecules, remains unclear. In this study, we screened 14 classical ISGs and found that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved the porcine mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (pDCP1A) through its protease activity. Similar cleavage of endogenous pDCP1A was also observed in PDCoV-infected cells. PDCoV nsp5 cleaved pDCP1A at glutamine 343 (Q343), and the cleaved pDCP1A fragments, pDCP1A1-343 and pDCP1A344-580, were unable to inhibit PDCoV infection. Mutant pDCP1A-Q343A, which resists nsp5-mediated cleavage, exhibited a stronger ability to inhibit PDCoV infection than wild-type pDCP1A. Interestingly, the Q343 cleavage site is highly conserved in DCP1A homologs from other mammalian species. Further analyses demonstrated that nsp5 encoded by seven tested CoVs that can infect human or pig also cleaved pDCP1A and human DCP1A, suggesting that DCP1A may be the common target for cleavage by nsp5 of mammalian CoVs.IMPORTANCE Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) induction through IFN signaling is important to create an antiviral state and usually directly inhibits virus infection. The present study first demonstrated that PDCoV nsp5 can cleave mRNA-decapping enzyme 1a (DCP1A) to attenuate its antiviral activity. Furthermore, cleaving DCP1A is a common characteristic of nsp5 proteins from different coronaviruses (CoVs), which represents a common immune evasion mechanism of CoVs. Previous evidence showed that CoV nsp5 cleaves the NF-&#954;B essential modulator and signal transducer and activator of transcription 2. Taken together, CoV nsp5 is a potent IFN antagonist because it can simultaneously target different aspects of the host IFN system, including IFN production and signaling and effector molecules.","Zhu, Xinyu; Chen, Jiyao; Tian, Liyuan; Zhou, Yanrong; Xu, Shangen; Long, Siwen; Wang, Dang; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo",J. virol,410,28

Due to its rapid rate of progression and invasive nature, ATC poses significant risks of morbidity and mortality. The cornerstone in the management of ATC remains a prompt diagnosis of the disease and timely management of complications depending on the stage of disease. Surgery continues to offer a higher chance of a cure, although not all patients are candidates for surgical management. Patients with advanced disease may be considered for palliative surgery to reduce morbidity and complications from advanced disease. With the advent of new molecular testing and improved methods of diagnosis, novel therapeutic targets have been identified. Systemic therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy) as well as novel immunotherapy have shown some promise in patients with targetable genetic mutations. Patients should therefore have molecular testing of their tumor-if it is unresectable-and be tested for mutations that are targetable. Mutation-targeted therapy may be effective and may result in a significant response to allow surgical intervention for exceptional responders. Overall, patients who receive all three modalities of therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy) have the highest overall survival.","Alobuia, Wilson; Gillis, Andrea; Kebebew, Electron",Curr Treat Options Oncol,410,16

This study aims to evaluate the effect of these measures on paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of acute metabolic complications and shortages in insulin and glucose measuring supplies. It also evaluates the caregivers' perceptions of the use of telemedicine during the lockdown. METHODS: This is a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. It was completed using Google forms and patients/caregivers were asked to consent if they agreed to answer. RESULTS: 235 patients/families participated in the study. The mean age of the patients was 10.8 years ± 3.9 years (N = 229). Twenty-four children (10.2%) needed to visit the emergency department during the lockdown period which lasted for 10 weeks. Of these, eight (3.4%) were hospitalized due to acute metabolic complications. Families (58.3%) faced insulin shortages and 14% had to ration insulin, i.e., decrease the dose, during the lockdown. Glucose monitoring strips were rationed by 43.4% of families leading to more frequent low/high glucose readings in 75.5% of children of these families. Telemedicine using phones and social media applications was utilized for communication with healthcare professionals and continuing medical care. Most of the participants (85.5%) described it as a smooth and positive experience. CONCLUSIONS: The extreme lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic caused insulin and glucose measuring equipment shortages in children with diabetes in Jordan.

Therefore, clarifying the effects of this infection on the cardiovascular system is of importance in terms of the clinical course of the disease. The increases in cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 have been associated with poor prognosis and mortality. However, there are no specific laboratory markers yet to assess the severity of the disease. In this context, the combination of available biomarkers is needed to better define the clinical course of this disease. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) has become a remarkable marker in recent years as a result of the correlation of increasing levels in cardiovascular diseases with clinical, hemodynamic, echocardiographic parameters and its relation with mortality or re-hospitalization due to heart failure.

Knowledge about how people coped with “soft-touch” restrictions can inform urban spatial planning strategies that enhance resilience against future pandemics. We analyzed data from an online place-based survey on 2845 places across Sweden that respondents abstained from visiting, visited with similar frequency, or visited more frequently in spring 2020 as compared to before the pandemic. In spatial logistic regression models, we relate geographical and sociodemographic properties of places (fields, forests, water, residential population density and daytime population density) to self-perceived changes in wellbeing from visiting the given place less or more often, respectively. Abstaining from visiting places with natural features located in areas of high residential density was associated with a self-perceived negative influence on wellbeing. Yet, fields, forests and water were strongly associated with places people claimed wellbeing benefits from during pandemic restrictions. The further a visited place was from the respondent’s home, the more likely it was to have a positive wellbeing influence. As an illustrative case, we map our models onto the landscape of Stockholm, showing that some neighborhoods are likely more resilient than others when coping with pandemic restrictions. Both the most and least resilient neighborhoods span the socio-economic spectrum. Urban planning will do well to enable equitable, easy access to natural settings by foot or bike, to increase pandemic preparedness as well as support climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection.","Samuelsson, Karl Barthel Stephan Giusti Matteo Hartig Terry",Landscape and Urban Planning,410,16

A random-effects model was applied to calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. Seven RCTs involving 6250 patients were included, of which the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial comprised nearly 78% of all included subjects. Results showed that corticosteroids were associated with a decreased all-cause mortality (27.3 vs. 31.1%; RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73-0.99; P = 0.04; low-certainty evidence). Trial sequential analysis suggested that more trials were still required to confirm the results. However, such survival benefit was absent if RECOVERY trial was excluded (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.65-1.06; P = 0.13). Furthermore, corticosteroids decreased the occurrence of composite disease progression (30.6 vs. 33.3%; RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.64-0.92; P = 0.005), but not increased the incidence of serious adverse events (3.5 vs. 3.4%; RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.39-3.43; P = 0.79).","Ma, Shaolei; Xu, Changsheng; Liu, Shijiang; Sun, Xiaodi; Li, Renqi; Mao, Mingjie; Feng, Shanwu; Wang, Xian",Signal Transduct Target Ther,410,24

Results: we found that all face covers without an outlet valve reduce the front flow through by at least 63% and perhaps as high as 86% if the unfiltered cough jet distance was resolved to the anticipated maximum distance of 2-3 m. However, surgical and handmade masks, and face shields, generate significant leakage jets that may present major hazards.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical and dental students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Four hundred and twenty students who attended anatomy classes during COVID-19 outbreak in Greece, were asked to fill in a questionnaire of 22 questions evaluating the formats of the different courses provided. Each student was asked to complete the questionnaire anonymously via the Google Forms® platform. A total of 200 students participated. During the lockdown, 59.5% of students attended all online anatomy lectures compared to 44.5% in the pre-pandemic year. Overall, the higher percentage of 73.5% was satisfied with the traditional anatomy teaching, instead of 56% which were satisfied with the effectiveness of online anatomy lectures. Asking whether any remote educational method can partially or completely replace the traditional anatomy teaching, the majority of students replied ""no"" for all the three remote modalities. The traditional anatomy teaching remains the most preferred and effective teaching modality. The students ranked online anatomy lectures and pre-recorded anatomy lectures in second place in terms of effectiveness and preference. The development of remote learning methods has increased students' active participation in anatomy lessons, but significantly negatively affected the students' performance at exams. Remote learning cannot replace the traditional anatomy teaching method, but online lectures could be incorporated into anatomy curricula as an additional tool.","Totlis, Trifon; Tishukov, Maksim; Piagkou, Maria; Kostares, Michael; Natsis, Konstantinos",,410,24

Due to the stay-at-home mandate and practice of physical distancing, nearly all preventive care measures have been halted, including colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The health consequences of this temporary suspension are of great concern, particularly for underserved populations, who experience substantial CRC-related disparities. In this Commentary, we describe challenges and opportunities to deliver COVID-adapted CRC screening to medically underserved populations receiving care in community health centers (CHC). This perspective is based on key informant interviews with CHC medical directors, teleconference discussions, and strategic planning assessments. To address the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we identify two broad calls to action: 1) Invest in CHCs now; and 2) Support equitable and adaptable telehealth solutions now and in the future. We also recommend four CRC-specific calls to action: Establish COVID-adapted best practices to implement mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) programs; Implement grassroots advocacy to identify community gastroenterologists who commit to performing colonoscopies for CHC patients; Assess cancer prevention priorities among individuals in underserved communities; and Assess regional CRC screening and follow-up barriers and solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic may further exacerbate existing CRC screening disparities in underserved individuals. This will likely lead to delayed diagnosis, a shift to later stage disease, and increased CRC deaths. To prevent this from happening, we call for timely action and a commitment to address the current extraordinary CRC screening challenges for vulnerable populations.","Nodora, Jesse N; Gupta, Samir; Howard, Nicole; Motadel, Kelly; Propst, Tobe; Rodriguez, Javier; Schultz, James; Velasquez, Sharon; Castañeda, Sheila F; Rabin, Borsika; Martínez, María Elena",J. natl. cancer inst,410,16

Internationally, governments are enforcing measures such as travel bans, quarantine, isolation, and social distancing leading to an extended period of time at home. This has resulted in reductions in physical activity and changes in dietary intakes that have the potential to accelerate sarcopenia, a deterioration of muscle mass and function (more likely in older populations), as well as increases in body fat. These changes in body composition are associated with a number of chronic, lifestyle diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, osteoporosis, frailty, cognitive decline, and depression. Furthermore, CVD, diabetes, and elevated body fat are associated with greater risk of COVID-19 infection and more severe symptomology, underscoring the importance of avoiding the development of such morbidities. Here we review mechanisms of sarcopenia and their relation to the current data on the effects of COVID-19 confinement on physical activity, dietary habits, sleep, and stress as well as extended bed rest due to COVID-19 hospitalization. The potential of these factors to lead to an increased likelihood of muscle loss and chronic disease will be discussed. By offering a number of home-based strategies including resistance exercise, higher protein intakes and supplementation, we can potentially guide public health authorities to avoid a lifestyle disease and rehabilitation crisis post-COVID-19. Such strategies may also serve as useful preventative measures for reducing the likelihood of sarcopenia in general and in the event of future periods of isolation.","Kirwan, Richard; McCullough, Deaglan; Butler, Tom; Perez de Heredia, Fatima; Davies, Ian G; Stewart, Claire",Geroscience,410,29

The purpose of this pandemic disaster practice improvement project was to measure changes in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in adult acute respiratory distress or adult respiratory distress syndrome, who are awake, alert, spontaneously breathing, and nonintubated. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who were coronavirus disease 2019 positive in the emergency department from March 30, 2020 to April 30, 2020 was conducted for patients with a room air pulse oximetry <90% and a preprone position pulse oximetry &#8804;94% who tolerated prone positioning for at least 30 minutes. The primary outcome was the change in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning, measured on room air, with supplemental oxygen, and approximately 30 minutes after initiating prone positioning. Median and mean differences were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t-test. RESULTS: Of the 440 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 31 met inclusion criteria. Median pulse oximetry increased as 83% (interquartile range, 75%-86%) on room air, 90% (interquartile range, 89%-93%) with supplemental oxygen, and 96% (interquartile range, 94%-98%) with prone positioning (z = -4.48, P < .001).

Hypoxia affects histone modifications by altering the activities of histone-modifying enzymes and the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) isoforms. Synthetic hypoxia mimetics promote a similar response, but how accurately the hypoxia mimetics replicate the effects of limited oxygen availability on the levels of histone PTMs is uncertain. Here we report studies on the profiling of the global changes to PTMs on intact histones in response to hypoxia/hypoxia-related stresses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We demonstrate that intact protein LC-MS profiling is a relatively simple and robust method for investigating potential effects of drugs on histone modifications. The results provide insights into the profiles of PTMs associated with hypoxia and inform on the extent to which hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics cause similar changes to histones. These findings imply chemically-induced hypoxia does not completely replicate the substantial effects of physiological hypoxia on histone PTMs, highlighting that caution should be used in interpreting data from their use.","Hsu, Kuo-Feng; Wilkins, Sarah E; Hopkinson, Richard J; Sekirnik, Rok; Flashman, Emily; Kawamura, Akane; McCullagh, James S O; Walport, Louise J; Schofield, Christopher J",Epigenetics,410,20

This study aimed to explore the role of companion animals and attachment to pets in the context of the pandemic. We used longitudinal quantitative survey data collected prior to and during the pandemic to assess the role of pets in predicting adolescent loneliness. Pet ownership was not a significant predictor of loneliness before the pandemic, but did predict higher levels of loneliness during COVID-19 as well as higher increases in loneliness from before to during the pandemic. Dog ownership predicted lower levels of loneliness prior to, but not during the pandemic, and dog owners were significantly more attached to their pets than non-dog pet owners. Adolescents with pets reported spending more time with their pets during the pandemic, and frequently reported pet interactions as a strategy for coping with stress. Overall, the results from this study did not support the presence of a buffering effect of companion animals on loneliness for adolescents and indicate complexity in the relationships between pet ownership, attachment, loneliness, and coping with stress.

We assessed the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in patients with SLE and RA and patient behavior, disease-related symptoms, and mental health. METHODS: More than 900 participants were included: 405 patients with RA or SLE (CRD-patients) and 513 blood donors. All participants had blood SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies measured (sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 99.5%) and answered a questionnaire concerning behavior, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-9). The CRD patients were further asked about physical activity, adherence to medication, and disease-related symptoms. RESULTS: CRD-patients had a significant lower seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n=1/365, 0.3%) compared to blood donors (n=10/513, 1.9%) (p=0.03). Almost 60% of patients were unable to exercise as usual, increased pain was experienced by 34% of patients and increased disease activity by 24%. Almost 10% of patients reduced or discontinued their immunosuppressive treatments at their own initiative. Symptoms of moderate depression were present in 19% of patients compared to 6,8% blood donors (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low seroprevalence in patients with CRDs indicates successful mitigation of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, this appears to occur at the expense of physical activity, experience of increased pain, disease activity, and symptoms of depression. There is a need for care providers to be aware of these negative side-effects and for further studies to investigate the possible long-term consequences.","Ammitzbøll, Christian; Andersen, Jakob Bøgh; Vils, Signe Risbøl; Mistegaard, Clara Elbaek; Mikkelsen, Susan; Erikstrup, Christian; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Hauge, Ellen-Margrethe; Troldborg, Anne",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),410,21

A 34-question survey was developed and distributed electronically to allied health professionals through listservs of professional organizations and social media groups. A total of 921 responses from allied health professionals in a variety of work settings were analyzed. The majority of allied health professionals had access to medical-grade PPE and agreed with their clinics decisions to stay open or closed. Private practices appeared to be the most negatively impacted with regards to employment in the form of pay reductions, furloughs, lay-offs, or the requirement of using paid time off. Importantly, 86% of all respondents, irrespective of employment status, reported feeling stressed with regards to changes in their work environment and transmission of the virus. However, levels of stress were dependent upon access to PPE and mental health resources. Specifically, those with access to mental health support reported lower stress levels than those without such access.

However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the URT microbiome between SARS-CoV-2-infected and -uninfected adults and to examine the association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with the URT microbiome during COVID-19. METHODS: We characterized the URT microbiome using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing in 59 adults (38 with confirmed, symptomatic, mild to moderate COVID-19 and 21 asymptomatic, uninfected controls). In those with COVID-19, we measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We then examined the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection status and its viral load with the âº-diversity, ß-diversity, and abundance of bacterial taxa of the URT microbiome. Our main models were all adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: The observed species index was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected than in -uninfected adults (ß linear regression coefficient = 7.53; 95% CI, 0.17-14.89; P = .045).

This study describes the creation of a remote COVID-19 rehabilitation assessment tool to allow timely triage, assessment and management. It hypotheses those with post-COVID-19 syndrome, potentially without laboratory confirmation and irrespective of initial disease severity, will have significant rehabilitation needs. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of consecutive patients referred by general practitioners (April-November 2020). Primary outcomes were presence/absence of anticipated sequelae. Binary logistic regression was used to test association between acute presentation and post-COVID-19 symptomatology. RESULTS: 155 patients (n=127 men, n=28 women, median age 39 years, median 13 weeks post-illness) were assessed using the tool. Acute symptoms were most commonly shortness of breath (SOB) (74.2%), fever (73.5%), fatigue (70.3%) and cough (64.5%); and post-acutely, SOB (76.7%), fatigue (70.3%), cough (57.4%) and anxiety/mood disturbance (39.4%). Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were 69% and 63% less likely to have anxiety/mood disturbance and pain, respectively, at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation assessment should be offered to all patients suffering post-COVID-19 symptoms, not only those with laboratory confirmation and considered independently from acute illness severity.

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have recently shown excellent performance in PLI prediction. However, the performance is highly dependent on protein and ligand features utilized for the DNN model. Moreover, in current models, the deciphering of how protein features determine the underlying principles that govern PLI is not trivial. In this work, we developed a DNN framework named SSnet that utilizes secondary structure information of proteins extracted as the curvature and torsion of the protein backbone to predict PLI. We demonstrate the performance of SSnet by comparing against a variety of currently popular machine and non-Machine Learning (ML) models using various metrics. We visualize the intermediate layers of SSnet to show a potential latent space for proteins, in particular to extract structural elements in a protein that the model finds influential for ligand binding, which is one of the key features of SSnet. We observed in our study that SSnet learns information about locations in a protein where a ligand can bind, including binding sites, allosteric sites and cryptic sites, regardless of the conformation used. We further observed that SSnet is not biased to any specific molecular interaction and extracts the protein fold information critical for PLI prediction. Our work forms an important gateway to the general exploration of secondary structure-based Deep Learning (DL), which is not just confined to protein-ligand interactions, and as such will have a large impact on protein research, while being readily accessible for de novo drug designers as a standalone package.","Verma, Niraj; Qu, Xingming; Trozzi, Francesco; Elsaied, Mohamed; Karki, Nischal; Tao, Yunwen; Zoltowski, Brian; Larson, Eric C; Kraka, Elfi",Int. j. mol. sci.

442252,442252,442252,Special issue: An occupational perspective on COVID-19,17.67153,4.924232,2020,"Introduction: Approximately 1% of the world population has now been infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With cases still rising and vaccines just beginning to rollout, we are still several months away from seeing reductions in daily case numbers, hospitalisations, and mortality. Therefore, there is a still an urgent need to control the disease spread by repurposing existing therapeutics. Owing to antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and cardioprotective actions, statin therapy has been considered as a plausible approach to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Material and methods: We carried out a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of statins on 3 COVID-19 outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, tracheal intubation, and death. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases using keywords related to our aims up to November 2, 2020. All published observational studies and randomised clinical trials on COVID-19 and statins were retrieved. Statistical analysis with random effects modelling was performed using STATA16 software. Results: The final selected studies (n = 24 studies;32,715 patients) showed significant reductions in ICU admission (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.58–1.06;n = 10;I² = 58.5%) and death (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55–0.88;n = 21;I² = 82.5%) outcomes, with no significant effect on tracheal intubation (OR = 0.79;95% CI: 0.57–1.11;n = 7;I² = 89.0%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggested that death was reduced further by in-hospital application of stains (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22–0.73, n = 3;I² = 82.5%), compared with pre-hospital use (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60–0.98, n = 18;I² = 81.8%). Conclusions: These findings call attention to the need for systematic clinical studies to assess both pre- and in-hospital use of statins as a potential means of reducing COVID-19 disease severity, particularly in terms of reduction of ICU admission and total mortality reduction.

In this work, we explored genomic drivers of contagion in Chile. We sequenced 3443 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected between January and July 2021, where the Gamma (P.1), Lambda (C.37), Alpha (B.1.1.7), B.1.1.348, and B.1.1 lineages were predominant. Using a Bayesian model tailored for limited genomic surveillance, we found that Lambda and Gamma variants' reproduction numbers were about 5% and 16% larger than Alpha's, respectively. We observed an overabundance of mutations in the Spike gene, strongly correlated with the variant's transmissibility. Furthermore, the variants' mutational signatures featured a breakpoint concurrent with the beginning of vaccination (mostly CoronaVac, an inactivated virus vaccine), indicating an additional putative selective pressure. Thus, our work provides a reliable method for quantifying novel variants' transmissibility under subsampling (as newly-reported Delta, B.1.617.2) and highlights the importance of continuous genomic surveillance.","Or'ostica, Karen Y.; Contreras, Sebastian; Mohr, Sebastian B.; Dehning, Jonas; Bauer, Simon; Medina-Ortiz, David; Iftekhar, Emil N.; Mujica, Karen; Covarrubias, Paulo C.; Ulloa, Soledad; Castillo, Andr'es E.; Verdugo, Ricardo A.; Fern'andez, Jorge; Olivera-Nappa, 'Alvaro; Priesemann, Viola",,410,1

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that a more targeted set of interventions focusing on preventing severe COVID-19, rather than SARS-2-CoV transmission, would be less disruptive to society. To identify these, it would be helpful to better understand how the infecting dose of SARS-CoV-2 and its route of infection and influence clinical outcome, immunological protection and likelihood of onward transmission. PROPOSAL: We suggest that carefully controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies involving intranasal and oral administration of progressively increasing doses of SARS-CoV-2, starting with low levels, to healthy young adult volunteers may be the most expeditious and definitive way to answer these questions. Such studies would differ in objective from CHIM proposals designed to expedite vaccine development, although the latter might be adapted to address some of the questions raised here. IMPLICATIONS: Results from the studies proposed here could help elucidate the relationship of infection to COVID-19 and thereby provide a scientific basis for more targeted and sustainable application of public health control measures, and inform the design of improved immunotherapeutics and more targeted vaccine development.","Hausdorff, William P; Flores, Jorge",Int. j. infect. dis,410,1

Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number R0 (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R0 will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics. This provides an additional motivation for investigating both the importance and relative duration of asymptomatic transmission.","Park, Sang Woo; Cornforth, Daniel M; Dushoff, Jonathan; Weitz, Joshua S",Epidemics,410,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All CT angiogram (CTA) and venous duplex extremity ultrasound (US) examinations performed on 192 consecutively documented cases of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed at a multi-centered healthcare system. Clinical characteristics and patient outcomes were evaluated and compared between two groups based on the presence or absence of acute thromboembolic events. RESULTS: Of the 16,264 patients tested for COVID-19, 3727 (23%) were positive. Out of those, 192 patients underwent 245 vascular imaging studies including chest CTA (86), venous duplex ultrasound (134), and CTA head and neck (25). Among those who underwent imaging, 49 (26%) demonstrated acute thromboembolic events which included 13/86 (15%) with PE, 34/134 (25%) with DVT, and 6/25 (24%) with CVA. One patient had positive results on all 3 examinations, and 2 patients had positive results on both chest CTA and venous duplex US. Males were more likely to have a thromboembolic event than females (33/103 (34%) vs. 14/89 (16%), p = 0.009). No significant difference was observed with respect to age, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, malignancy history, diabetes, or dialysis. CONCLUSION: Approximately 26% of COVID-19 patients with positive testing who underwent vascular imaging with CTA or venous duplex ultrasound had thromboembolic events including PE, DVT, and CVA.

There has been a very limited number of studies pertaining to the oral lesions in Arab population suffering from SLE in Asir region. Hence, it became utmost important to study epidemiological data of oral mucosal lesions in SLE patients. Distribution of oral lesions in SLE patients could also be helpful in better management of oral complications. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between SLEDAI score and the degree of micronuclei (MN) formation using BMCA. Materials and Methods: After thorough oral examination of adult Saudi SLE patients of Asir hospital and that of healthy control subjects, the subjects underwent BMCA from normal unaffected bilateral buccal mucosae. Results: Pearson's correlation test showed that MN count did not significantly correlate with either disease activity or duration of SLE. Conclusions: Controlled state SLE does not lead to a significant increase in MN formation. Thus, the occurrence of premalignant lesions in the oral cavity could be minimized using proper management protocols.","Assiri, Khalil; Hameed, Mohammad Shahul; Dawasaz, Ali Azhar; Alamoudi, Eman; Asiri, Alhussain Mohammad; Hitesh, Vij; Ajmal, Muhammed",Indian J Dermatol,410,17

This has generated the inclusion of several disciplines and tools that allow for analyzing the dissemination of infectious diseases. The aim of this manuscript is to model the spreading of a disease in a population that is registered in a database. From this database, we obtain an edge-weighted graph. The spreading was modeled with the classic SIR model. The model proposed with edge-weighted graph allows for identifying the most important variables in the dissemination of epidemics. Moreover, a deterministic approximation is provided. With database COVID-19 from a city in Chile, we analyzed our model with relationship variables between people. We obtained a graph with 3866 vertices and 6,841,470 edges. We fitted the curve of the real data and we have done some simulations on the obtained graph. Our model is adjusted to the spread of the disease. The model proposed with edge-weighted graph allows for identifying the most important variables in the dissemination of epidemics, in this case with real data of COVID-19.

In addition, we establish a nonasymptotic theory concerning noisy function fitting for nonparametric least squares and least squares based on Picard iterations. Our results on the metric entropy provide answers to""how do the degree of smoothness and the""size""of a class of ODEs affect the""size""of the associated class of solutions?""We establish a general upper bound on the covering number of solution classes associated with the higher order Picard type ODEs, $y^{\left(m\right)}\left(x\right)=f\left(x,\,y\left(x\right),\,y^{'}\left(x\right),\,...,y^{\left(m-1\right)}\left(x\right)\right)$. This result implies, the covering number of the underlying solution class is (basically) bounded from above by the covering number of the class $\mathcal{F}$ that $f$ ranges over. This general bound (basically) yields a sharp scaling when $f$ is parameterized by a $K-$dimensional vector of coefficients belonging to a ball and the noisy recovery is essentially no more difficult than estimating a $K-$dimensional element in the ball. For $m=1$, when $\mathcal{F}$ is an infinitely dimensional smooth class, the solution class ends up with derivatives whose magnitude grows factorially fast --""a curse of smoothness"". We introduce a new notion called the""critical smoothness parameter""to derive an upper bound on the covering number of the solution class. When the sample size is large relative to the degree of smoothness, the rate of convergence associated with the noisy recovery problem obtained by applying this""critical smoothness parameter""based approach improves the rate obtained by applying the general upper bound on the covering number (and vice versa).","Zhu, Ying; Mirzaei, Mozhgan",,410,16

Serum glycoprotein, a C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), is a key regulator (inhibitor) of serine proteases of all the above-mentioned pathways. Recently, an autotransporter protein, virulence-associated gene 8 (Vag8), produced by the whooping cough pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, was shown to bind to C1-INH and interfere with its function. Here, we present the structure of the Vag8-C1-INH complex determined using cryo-electron microscopy at a 3.6-Å resolution. The structure shows a unique mechanism of C1-INH inhibition not employed by other pathogens, where Vag8 sequesters the reactive center loop of C1-INH, preventing its interaction with the target proteases.IMPORTANCE The structure of a 10-kDa protein complex is one of the smallest to be determined using cryo-electron microscopy at high resolution. The structure reveals that C1-INH is sequestered in an inactivated state by burial of the reactive center loop in Vag8. By so doing, the bacterium is able to simultaneously perturb the many pathways regulated by C1-INH. Virulence mechanisms such as the one described here assume more importance given the emerging evidence about dysregulation of contact activation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis leading to COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dhillon, Arun; Deme, Justin C; Furlong, Emily; Roem, Dorina; Jongerius, Ilse; Johnson, Steven; Lea, Susan M",mBio (Online),410,16

However, reports of hemolysis call for caution in using these pumps, especially in neonatology and in pediatric intensive care. Cavitation can be a cause of blood damage. The aim of our study was to obtain information about the cavitation conditions and to provide the safest operating range of centrifugal pumps. A series of tests were undertaken to determine the points at which pump performance decreases 3% and gas bubbles start to appear downstream of the pump. Two pumps were tested; pump R with a closed impeller and pump S with a semiopen impeller. The performance tests demonstrated that pump S has an optimal region narrower than pump R and it is shifted to the higher flows. When the pump performance started to decrease, the inlet pressure varies but close to -150 mmHg in the test with low gas content and higher than -100 mmHg in the tests with increased gas content. The same trend was observed at the points of development of massive gas emboli. Importantly, small packages of bubbles downstream of the pump were registered at relatively high inlet pressures. The gaseous cavitation in centrifugal pumps is a phenomenon that appears with decreasing inlet pump pressures. There are a few ways to increase inlet pump pressures: (1) positioning the pump as low as possible in relation to the patient; (2) selecting appropriate sized venous cannulas and their careful positioning; and (3) controlling patient's volume status.","Ganushchak, Yuri M; Körver, Erik Pj; Maessen, Jos G",Perfusion,410,11

The present study examined the willingness of primary and secondary school teachers, bank employees, and university instructors in southern Ethiopia to take a Covid-19 vaccine and the factors associated with their willingness. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study design was used with a quantitative research approach. Primary data were gathered mainly through the use of a survey research method in which a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected research participants in Wolaita Sodo town. Data analysis was conducted using statistical techniques, including percentages, frequency distributions, and logistic regression analysis. Results: Research participants generally had a low (46.1%) willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason for most (37%) respondents' hesitancy to take the vaccine is found to be the concern over the safety and/or the side effects of the vaccine (37%), followed by doubt about the vaccine's effectiveness (20.7%), and lack of adequate information (12.7%). Moreover, 38.9% of survey participants revealed that they would like to take a COVID-19 vaccine other than AstraZeneca whereas 61.1% of respondents replied that they do not want to take any kind of COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, respondents' willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine is significantly associated with attitude towards the vaccine (OR = 2.830;95% CI = 1.834-4.368), belief that Covid-19 exists in the study area (OR = 0.221;95% CI = 0.083-0.589), the perception that prevalence and death rate reports of the government are real (OR = 0.365;95% CI = 0.197-0.676), status of chronic diseases (OR = 2.883;95%CI = 1.039-7.999), and having a close relative/friend ever infected by COVID-19 (OR = 2.602;95% CI = 1.117-6.063). Conclusion: The findings of the research demonstrated that there is generally low willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine among university instructors, bank employees, and primary and secondary school teachers in southern Ethiopia. Therefore, the federal ministry of health, Ethiopian food and drug controlling agency, the media, and all other concerned organizations should create increased awareness about the safety/side effects issues and the need to take the vaccine.","Zewude, B.; Habtegiorgis, T.",Pragmatic &amp; Observational Research,410,30

Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays recommended by the World Health Organization are being used by clinical and public health laboratories and typically target regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) coding region. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. This study aimed to clarify the clinical performances of the primer/probe sets designed by US CDC and Charité/Berlin to help clinical laboratories in assay selection for SARS-CoV-2 routine detection. METHODS: We compared the clinical performances of the recommended primer/probe sets using one hundred nasopharyngeal swab specimens from patients who were clinically diagnosed with COVID-19. An additional 30 ""pre-intervention screening"" samples from patients who were not suspected of COVID-19 were also included in this study. We also performed sequence alignment between 31064 European SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern genomes and the recommended primer/probe sets. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates substantial differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection sensitivity among the primer/probe sets recommended by the World Health Organization especially for low-level viral loads. The alignment of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences reveals that the genetic diversity remains relatively low at the primer/probe binding sites. However, multiple nucleotide mismatches might contribute to false negatives. CONCLUSION: An understanding of the limitations depending on the targeted genes and primer/probe sets may influence the selection of molecular detection assays by clinical laboratories.","Anantharajah, Ahalieyah; Helaers, Raphaël; Defour, Jean-Philippe; Olive, Nathalie; Kabera, Florence; Croonen, Luc; Deldime, Françoise; Vaerman, Jean-Luc; Barbée, Cindy; Bodéus, Monique; Scohy, Anais; Verroken, Alexia; Rodriguez-Villalobos, Hector; Kabamba-Mukadi, Benoît",J Virol Methods,410,25

Quantifying the changes of pollutant emissions due to COVID-19 and associated governmental control measures is crucial to understand its impacts on economy, air pollution, and society. We used the WRF-GC model and the tropospheric NO2 column observations retrieved by the TROPOMI instrument to derive the top-down NOx emission change estimation between the three periods: P1 (January 1st to January 22nd, 2020), P2 (January 23rd, Wuhan lockdown, to February 9th, 2020), and P3 (February 10th, back-to-work day, to March 12th, 2020). We found that NOx emissions in East China averaged during P2 decreased by 50% compared to those averaged during P1. The NOx emissions averaged during P3 increased by 26% compared to those during P2. Most provinces in East China gradually regained some of their NOx emissions after February 10, the official back-to-work day, but NOx emissions in most provinces have not yet to return to their previous levels in early January. NOx emissions in Wuhan, the first epicenter of COVID-19, had no sign of emission recovering by March 12. A few provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shanxi, have recovered fast, with their averaged NOx emissions during P3 almost back to pre-lockdown levels.","Zhang, Ruixiong; Zhang, Yuzhong; Lin, Haipeng; Feng, Xu; Fu, Tzung-May; Wang, Yuhang",Atmosphere,410,16

With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care. In this comprehensive review, we analyze currently adopted advanced technologies and their concurrent use in the development of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Datta, Manali; Singh, Desh Deepak; Naqvi, Afsar R",Int Rev Immunol,410,23

As healthcare systems evolve in the face of COVID-19, the use of telehealth platforms has expanded. We present the results of a large survey of patient perspectives on the role of telehealth in the care of spine clinic patients. METHODS: All patients at the spine clinic of a large, tertiary, academic medical center were surveyed at their clinic visit from 5/30/20-6/30/20. All responses were anonymous and results were analyzed with standard statistical techniques. RESULTS: 176 surveys were returned and 164 were entirely completed. 56.8% of patients were new while 24.4% were post-operative follow-up visits. 54.9% had lumbar symptoms. 85% had pain while more than half also reported weakness. 58% traveled greater than twenty-five miles for their appointment. 96% had transportation readily available. Of all respondents, only 15.3% preferred the appointment via video telehealth while 4% had no preference between in-person appointment or virtual visit. Preference for telehealth appointment was not associated with factors such as new or established in the practice, spinal region of symptoms, pain, weakness, comfort with technology, age or duration of symptoms. There was a significant difference between how far the patient traveled for the clinic appointment and their preference for a telehealth appointment, with patients traveling further distances favoring telehealth (p=0.04). This effect remained significant when stratifying based on 25 miles (p=0.03) or 50 miles (p=0.03) but not when stratifying based on 100 miles (p=0.32). However, the sample size of patients traveling >100 miles was small, limiting any inference regarding that subgroup. Access to transportation was associated with preference for telehealth (88.89% vs. 97.18%, p=0.08) but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Most spine patients prefer in-person clinic appointments to virtual appointments. These preferences should be considered when arranging patient encounters.","Maurer, Robert K; Hallan, David; Maurer, Timothy C; Lee, Charles; Kelleher, John P",J. neurosurg. sci,410,1

However, information about critically ill patients with COVID-19 is still limited. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and figure out the risk factors of mortality. METHODS: We extracted data retrospectively regarding 733 critically ill adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 19 hospitals in China through January 1 to February 29, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: Of the 733 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 65 (56-73) years and 256 (34.9%) were female. Among these patients, the median (IQR) APACHE II score was 10 (7 to 14) and 28-day mortality was 53.8%. Respiratory failure was the most common organ failure (597 [81.5%]), followed by shock (20%), thrombocytopenia (18.8%), central nervous system (8.6%) and renal dysfunction (8%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that older age, malignancies, high APACHE II score, high D-dimer level, low PaO2/FiO2 level, high creatinine level, high hscTnI level and low albumin level were independent risk factors of 28-day mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In this case series of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were admitted into the ICU, more than half patients died at day 28.

Over 1.8 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the US until December 2020, and around 0.2% submitted AE reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This study aimed to evaluate the AEs following immunization (AEFIs) and analyze the potential associations based on the information from the VAERS database. Methods: We searched the VAERS database recorded AEFIs after COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. After data mapping, we summarized demographic and clinical features of reported cases. Fisher exact test was used to comparing the clinical characteristics among AE groups with an anaphylactic response, concerning neurological disorders and death. Results: VAERS reported 3,908 AEFIs of COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. Most (79.68%) were reported after the first dose of the vaccine. Among the reported cases, we found that general disorders (48.80%), nervous system disorders (46.39%), and gastrointestinal disorders (25.54%) were the most common AEFIs. The allergy history was more frequent in vaccine recipients with anaphylactic reactions than those without (64.91% vs. 49.62%, OR = 1.88, P <0.017). History of anxiety or depression was more common in subjects reporting severe neurological AEFIs than those reporting other AEFIs (18.37% vs. 7.85%, OR = 2.64, P <0.017). Cases reporting death were significantly older (79.36 ± 10.41-year-old vs. 42.64 ± 12.55-year-old, P <0.01, 95% CI 29.30-44.15) and more likely experienced hypertension (50.00% vs. 11.42%, OR = 7.76, P <0.01) and neurological disorders (50.00% vs. 5.36%, OR = 17.65, P <0.01) than other vaccine recipients. The outpatient and emergency room visit rates were 11.92 and 22.42% for AEFIs, and 2.53% of cases needed hospitalization. Conclusion: AEFIs of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were generally non-severe local or systemic reactions.

Thus, the objective of this study was to explore how caregivers of infants under 6 months of age perceived changes to infant feeding and other food and health-related matters during the COVID-19 State of Emergency in Nova Scotia, Canada. Four weeks after the State of Emergency began, between 17 April and 15 May 2020, caregivers completed this online survey, including the Perceived Stress Scale. Participants (n = 335) were 99% female and mostly White (87%). Over half (60%) were breastfeeding, and 71% had a household income over CAD$60,000. Most participants (77%) received governmental parental benefits before the emergency, and 59% experienced no COVID-19-related economic changes. Over three quarters of participants (77%) scored moderate levels of perceived stress. Common themes of concern included social isolation, COVID-19 infection (both caregiver and infant), and a lack of access to goods, namely, human milk substitutes ('infant formula'), and services, including health care, lactation support, and social supports. Most COVID-19-related information was sought from the internet and social media, so for broad reach, future evidence-based information should be shared via online platforms. Although participants were experiencing moderate self-perceived stress and shared numerous concerns, very few COVID-19-related changes to infant feeding were reported, and there were few differences by socio-economic status, likely due to a strong economic safety net in this Canadian setting.","Fry, Hillary L; Levin, Olga; Kholina, Ksenia; Bianco, Jolene L; Gallant, Jelisa; Chan, Kathleen; Whitfield, Kyly C",Matern Child Nutr,410,16

It is responsible for various clinical symptoms, including hyposmia and other neurological ones. Current literature suggests the olfactory mucosa as a port of entry to the CNS, but how the virus reaches the olfactory groove is still unknown. Because the first neurological symptoms of invasion (hyposmia) do not correspond to first signs of infection, the hypothesis of direct contact through airborne droplets during primary infection and therefore during inspiration is not plausible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if a secondary spread to the olfactory groove in a retrograde manner during expiration could be more probable. Methods: Four three-dimensional virtual models were obtained from actual CT scans and used to simulate expiratory droplets. The volume mesh consists of 25 million of cells, the simulated condition is a steady expiration, driving a flow rate of 270 ml/s, for a duration of 0.6 seconds. The droplet diameter is of 5 µm. Results: The analysis of the simulations shows the virus to have a high probability to be deployed in the rhinopharynx, on the tail of medium and upper turbinates. The possibility for droplets to access the olfactory mucosa during the expiratory phase is lower than other nasal areas, but consistent. Discussion: The data obtained from these simulations demonstrates the virus can be deployed in the olfactory groove during expiration. Even if the total amount in a single act is scarce, it must be considered it is repeated tens of thousands of times a day, and the source of contamination continuously acts on a timescale of several days. The present results also imply CNS penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through olfactory mucosa might be considered a complication and, consequently, prevention strategies should be considered in diseased patients.","Pipolo, Carlotta; Bulfamante, Antonio Mario; Schillaci, Andrea; Banchetti, Jacopo; Castellani, Luca; Saibene, Alberto Maria; Felisati, Giovanni; Quadrio, Maurizio",Int J Med Sci,410,0

There are still many unresolved questions regarding the pathogenesis of this disease and especially the reasons underlying the extremely different clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe manifestations, including the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 showed phylogenetic similarities to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, and some of the clinical features are shared between COVID-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections. Available evidence indicate that the so called ""cytokine storm"" an uncontrolled over-production of soluble markers of inflammation which, in turn, sustain an aberrant systemic inflammatory response, is a major responsible for the occurrence of ARDS. Chemokines are low molecular weight proteins with powerful chemoattractant activity which play a role in the immune cell recruitment during inflammation.

Several meta-analyses have indicated that many comorbidities were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 severity or mortality. The original report also showed that the mortality rate of COVID-19 in breast cancer patients is more dependent on comorbidities than previous radiation therapy or current anti-cancer therapy. However, no meta-analysis has focused on this aspect. This systematic review aims to assess whether breast cancer will increase the severity and mortality of patients infected with COVID-19 and to explore which factors that may affect the severity or mortality rate of breast cancer patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We will search the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Wanfang database from December 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Cohort studies comparing the disease severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients with and without breast cancer will be included. Two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias of the included cohort studies using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We will conduct meta-analyses to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using the random-effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel method. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to rate the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This study will provide comprehensive evidence for medical staff to adopt effective treatment strategies for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We created a cohort of Veterans who were tested positive for COVID-19, extracted data on age, gender, and race, and clinical characteristics from their electronic health records, and trained a DNN model for predicting the adverse outcome. Then, we analyzed the association of the demographic variables with the risks of the adverse outcome using the impact scores and interaction scores for explaining DNN models. The results showed that, on average, older age and African American race were associated with higher risks while female gender was associated with lower risks. However, individual-level impact scores of age showed that age was a more impactful risk factor in younger patients and in older patients with fewer comorbidities. The individual-level impact scores of gender and race variables had a wide span covering both positive and negative values. The interaction scores between the demographic variables showed that the interaction effects were minimal compared to the impact scores associated with them. In conclusion, the DNN model is able to capture the non-linear relationship between the risk factors and the adverse outcome, and the impact scores and interaction scores can help explain the complicated non-linear effects between the demographic variables and the risk of the outcome.","Shao, Yijun; Ahmed, Ali; Liappis, Angelike P; Faselis, Charles; Nelson, Stuart J; Zeng-Treitler, Qing",J Healthc Inform Res,410,19

VPA has been increasingly associated with intentional or unintentional overdose. In patients presenting with severe VPA overdose, supportive care and airway protection are cornerstones of treatment, while levocarnitine is suggested in patients with hyperammonemia and hemodialysis is recommended in patients with VPA serum concentrations (SC) >1,300 mg/L and presence of cerebral edema or shock. Meropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity. The pharmacological interaction between VPA and meropenem is characterized by a rapid decrease in VPA concentrations, which contraindicates concurrent use. Case presentation The following case report describes the use of meropenem to enhance the clearance of VPA in the case of severe VPA overdose. A patient with altered mental status was transported to the emergency department (ED) after VPA overdose. Meropenem was prescribed for significant elevated VPA SC. An important decline in SC was observed with short-term meropenem dosing, and an improvement in mental status occurred shortly after administration. Conclusions Carbapenem therapy has the potential to be used as last line strategy in the management of severe VPA overdose in patients where SC represent a significant risk of toxicity and clinical symptoms suggest difficulty managing the patient.","Muñoz-Pichuante, Daniel; Villa-Zapata, Lorenzo; Lolas, Russi",Drug Metab.

Modestly sized case series have described clinical factors associated with COVID-19, while ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression analyses have been described in some cell types. Patients with cancer may have worse outcomes to COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an integrated study of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across and within organ systems, by normal versus tumor, across several existing databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas, Census of Immune Single Cell Expression Atlas, The Human Cell Landscape, and more). We correlated gene expression with clinical factors (including but not limited to age, gender, race, body mass index, and smoking history), HLA genotype, immune gene expression patterns, cell subsets, and single-cell sequencing as well as commensal microbiome. RESULTS: Matched normal tissues generally display higher ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression compared with cancer, with normal and tumor from digestive organs expressing the highest levels. No clinical factors were consistently identified to be significantly associated with gene expression levels though outlier organ systems were observed for some factors. Similarly, no HLA genotypes were consistently associated with gene expression levels. Strong correlations were observed between ACE2 expression levels and multiple immune gene signatures including interferon-stimulated genes and the T cell-inflamed phenotype as well as inverse associations with angiogenesis and transforming growth factor-ß signatures. ACE2 positively correlated with macrophage subsets across tumor types. TMPRSS2 was less associated with immune gene expression but was strongly associated with epithelial cell abundance. Single-cell sequencing analysis across nine independent studies demonstrated little to no ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression in lymphocytes or macrophages. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression associated with commensal microbiota in matched normal tissues particularly from colorectal cancers, with distinct bacterial populations showing strong associations. CONCLUSIONS: We performed a large-scale integration of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression across clinical, genetic, and microbiome domains. We identify novel associations with the microbiota and confirm host immunity associations with gene expression. We suggest caution in interpretation regarding genetic associations with ACE2 expression suggested from smaller case series.","Bao, Riyue; Hernandez, Kyle; Huang, Lei; Luke, Jason John",J. immunotherap. cancer,410,16

Recent evidence indicates that even though most pregnant have a mild or asymptomatic course, a severe course of COVID-19 and a higher risk of progression to diseases have also been described, along with a heightened risk for pregnancy complications. Yet, vertical transmission of the virus is rare and the possibility of placental SARS-CoV-2 infection as a prerequisite for vertical transmission requires further studies. We here assessed the severity of COVID-19 and onset of neonatal infections in an observational study of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Our placental analyses showed a paucity of SARS-CoV-2 viral expression ex vivo in term placentae under acute infection. No viral placental expression was detectable in convalescent pregnant women. Inoculation of placental explants generated from placentas of non-infected women at birth with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro revealed inefficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in different types of placental tissues, which provides a rationale for the low ex vivo viral expression. We further detected specific SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in pregnant women within a few days upon infection, which was undetectable in cord blood. Our present findings confirm that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rare, likely due to the inefficient virus replication in placental tissues. Despite the predominantly benign course of infection in most mothers and negligible risk of vertical transmission, continuous vigilance on the consequences of COVID-19 during pregnancy is required, since the maternal immune activation in response to the SARS-CoV2 infection may have long-term consequences for children's health.","Tallarek, Ann-Christin; Urbschat, Christopher; Fonseca Brito, Luis; Stanelle-Bertram, Stephanie; Krasemann, Susanne; Frascaroli, Giada; Thiele, Kristin; Wieczorek, Agnes; Felber, Nadine; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Markert, Udo R; Hecher, Kurt; Brune, Wolfram; Stahl, Felix; Gabriel, Gülsah; Diemert, Anke; Arck, Petra Clara",Front Immunol,410,21

However, neurological manifestations of COVID 19, namely Guillain-Barre syndrome are rare. We present a case of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), a form of GBS in a patient with recent COVID infection. Case: 66 year old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department for progressive weakness of all extremities for 2 days. Patient was diagnosed with COVID 19 three weeks prior to onset of weakness. As per patient, he only had mild respiratory illness with cough, general weakness without respiratory symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, he felt weakness in his lower extremities, which then progressed to involve the upper extremities. On initial evaluation the patient's pupils were symmetric and 3mm, reactive to light, visual field were full to confrontation, cranial nerves intact, shoulder shrug symmetric with full strength. He had decreased motor tone with 2/5 strength in both upper and lower extremities and depressed or absent reflexes in all extremities. His labs were significant for positive COVID 19 PCR and antibodies. CT head was negative for acute stroke or intracranial pathology. The patient was admitted to MICU where he developed respiratory muscle weakness with diminished vital capacity of 12ml/kg and negative inspiratory force of 12mmHg and he was intubated. Cerebral spinal fluid showed elevated protein to 145mg/dL, WBC of 4/UL with 50% lymphocytes and glucose of 67. Other CSF studies were negative for oligoclonal bands, EBV, CMV, cryptococcus, syphilis, and sarcoidosis. Electromyography was consistent with moderate AIDP. He received 5 doses of IVIG with no significant improvement so he underwent tracheostomy and was initiated on plasmapheresis for AIDP. Discussion: GBS is an immune-mediated disease that typically affects the peripheral neurons and nerve roots after respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. Typical infections are Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, Influenza, and there are even reports of GBS after MERS and SARS COV-1. However, there has been increasing evidence of COVID 19 causing neurologic manifestations such as encephalitis, meningitis, stroke, and GBS [1]. Patients, such as the one presented in this report with GBS, usually have a long and protracted disease despite aggressive treatments with IVIG and plasmapheresis with reliance on mechanical ventilator.

Now is a critical moment to ask how health promotion might become more responsive to and representative of people's daily realities. Also how it can become a more inclusive partner in, and collaborative conduit of, knowledge-one capable of both informing intellects and transforming hearts. It needs to feel the pulse of the ""fierce urgency of now,"" and perhaps nothing can reveal this pulse more than the creative power of art-especially poetry. Drawing from critical and Black feminist theory, I use commentary in prose to conceptualize and call for an epistemically just health promotion guided by poetry as praxis-not just as method. I posit that, as praxis rooted in lived realities, poetry becomes experiential excavation and illumination; a practice of community, communion, and solidarity; a site and source of healing; and a space to create new narratives of health to forge new paths toward its promotion. I accordingly suggest a need to view and value poetry as a critical scholarship format to advance health promotion knowledge, discourse, and action toward a more humanized pursuit-and narrative-of health equity.","Petteway, Ryan J",Health Promot Pract,410,16

Arrival/departure dates are crop and weather dependent. MSFWs may be employed by a grower or a farm labor contractor (FLC). Like farmworker housing, FLCs may be registered or unregistered. Primary care or enabling services are provided by the NC Farmworker Health Program or community health centers that receive dedicated federal funding for MSFWs. The arrival of NC's growing season, MSFWs, and COVID-19 brought unforeseen challenges even to those experienced in caring for MSFWs. Challenges include congregate activities, consistency/accuracy of COVID-19 related communications, availability of alternate housing, barriers to testing and contact tracing, lack of internet connectivity in farmworker housing and insufficient personal protective equipment. Challenges are discussed in no order of occurrence or level of importance as many are inter-related. To meet these challenges, a migrant health and housing workgroup was convened. Members include the NC Department of Labor-Agricultural Safety and Health Bureau, NC Department of Health and Human Services - Communicable Disease Branch and NC Farmworker Health Program, NC Community Health Center Association and NC Agromedicine Institute. Members work collaboratively along the continuum from local to state levels and across agencies and communities to facilitate strategies to address COVID-19 challenges.

Here, we performed a high throughput screening of approximately 1,700 US FDA-approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 20 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine besylate, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, mefloquine, and thioridazine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of >600, indicating a wide therapeutic window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had a safety index of 22 in similar experiments. Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds (fendiline HCl, monensin sodium salt, vortioxetine, sertraline HCl, and salifungin) were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion.

Practicing psychologists need to adapt to new conditions of a forced transition to the online counseling. Until now, however, no data are available about adaptation to online counseling among Russian practicing psychologists during the COVID-19 pandemic;innovativeness among psychologists has been scarcely investigated. This study aims to identify the factors of adaptation to online counseling among psychologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is that psychologists’ innovative qualities are associated with their successful adaptation to online counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The additional hypotheses were that psychologists’ successful adaptation to online counseling is associated with work experience, region of residence, modality of counseling, and a positive attitude towards working from home. This study represents the first attempt to examine the factors of psychologists’ adaptation to online counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. The study sample comprised 312 counseling psychologists from Russia. To examine adaptation and innovative qualities the authors used the original questionnaire for Studying Individual Attitudes Towards Innovation (N. M. Lebedeva, A. N. Tatarko). Descriptive statistics procedures, Chi-square test, and Cramer’s V test were used. Results. Psychologists scored high on innovative qualities and had an average level of willingness to take risks for success. Psychologists’ innovative qualities are associated with successful adaptation to online counseling. No associations were found between adaptation and both work experience, and psychologists’ region of residence. Gestalt therapists scored highest on adaptation to the online format;cognitive-behavioral psychologists scored lowest. The assumption that there is an association between the modality of counseling and adaptation was confirmed. Positive attitudes towards working from home were generally associated with successful adaptation among psychologists. Counseling psychologists who had no problem with blurring the work/ home boundaries enjoyed working from home. Discussion. Well-developed innovative qualities, possibilities for comfortable working at home, and the modality of work contributed to successful adaptation to online counseling for most psychologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. Major recommendations for future research, as well as study limitations are discussed. © Skipor S. I., Vorobieva A. E., 2021.","Skipor, S. I.; Vorobieva, A. E.",Russian Psychological Journal,410,8

CONTEXT: Without a method to understand if day-to-day variation in outcomes may be attributed to meaningful signals of change-rather than variability we would expect-care providers, improvement leaders, policy-makers, and the public will struggle to recognize if epidemic conditions are improving. METHODS: We developed a novel hybrid C-Chart and I-Chart to detect within a geographic area the start and end of exponential growth in reported deaths. Reported deaths were the unit of analysis owing to erratic reporting of cases from variability in local testing strategies. We used simulation and case studies to assess chart performance and define technical parameters. This approach also applies to other critical measures related to a pandemic when high-quality data are available. CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid chart detected the start of exponential growth and identified early signals that the growth phase was ending. During a pandemic, timely reliable signals that an epidemic is waxing or waning may have mortal implications. This novel chart offers a practical tool, accessible to system leaders and front-line teams, to visualize and learn from daily reported deaths during an epidemic. Without Shewhart charts and, more broadly, a theory of variation in our epidemiological arsenal, we lack a scientific method for real-time assessment of local conditions. Shewhart charts should become a standard method for learning from data in the context of a pandemic or epidemic.","Perla, Rocco J; Provost, Shannon M; Parry, Gareth J; Little, Kevin; Provost, Lloyd P",Int. j. qual. health care,410,0

Twenty-one beef calves were administered 2 mL of an IN MLV vaccine containing BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V (Inforce3®) between one and five weeks of age. Sixty days after primary vaccination, calves were randomly assigned to one of two groups: IN-MLV (n = 11): Calves received 2 mL of the same IN MLV vaccine used for primary vaccination and 2 mL of a SC MLV vaccine containing BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi- Shield GOLD® BVD). SC-MLV (n = 10): Calves were administered 2 mL of a MLV vaccine containing, BHV1, BRSV, BPI3V, and BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi-Shield GOLD® 5). Blood and nasal secretion samples were collected on days -61 (primary vaccination), -28, -14, 0 (booster vaccination), 14, 21, 28, 42 and 60 for determination of SNA titers, cytokine gene expression analysis and nasal virus-specific IgA concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures analysis through PROC GLIMMIX of SAS®. Booster vaccination by neither IN nor SC routes induced a significant increase in SNA titers against BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V. Subcutaneous booster vaccination induced significantly greater BRSV-specific SNA titers (on day 42) and IgA concentration in nasal secretions (on days 21 and 42) compared to calves receiving IN booster vaccination. Both IN and SC booster vaccination were able to stimulate the production of BHV1-specific IgA in nasal secretions. In summary, booster vaccination of young beef calves using either SC or IN route two months after IN MLV primary vaccination resulted in comparable SNA titers, cytokine gene expression profile and virus-specific IgA concentration in nasal secretions. Only a few differences in the systemic and mucosal immune response against BHV1 and BRSV were observed.

However, little is known about the impact of polypharmacy on clinical outcomes among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review summarizes the available literature on the association between polypharmacy and specific drug classes, and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted an electronic database search on Embase, Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, LITCOVID, PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and China national knowledge infrastructure for studies on Polypharmacy among COVID-19 patients using relevant combinations of the keywords. Only studies published between November 2019 to September 2020 were included. Seven articles out of 1502 unique articles met the inclusion criteria and were used for the current study. We adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline in conducting and reporting this systematic review. RESULTS: The total sample size of all studies was 474,342, out of which 10,519 patients were COVID-19 positive, and 4818 COVID-19 positive patients experienced polypharmacy. Five out of the 7 included studies found associations between polypharmacy and negative clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Polypharmacy was associated with increase in the relative risk of a positive COVID-19 test result (P < 0.01), death among male COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001), increase in the rate of acute kidney injury (P = 0.003), and adverse drug reactions (P < 0.001). Antipsychotic drugs were associated with severe COVID-19 morbidity (OR = 2.79; 95% CI 2.23-3.49) and increased risk of death among COVID-19 infected men (OR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.18-2.48) and women (OR = 1.96; 95% CI 1.41-2.73). CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy and selected drug classes are associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Understanding these relationships can enhance risk stratification and evidence-based decision-making that may improve care and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","Iloanusi, Sorochi; Mgbere, Osaro; Essien, Ekere J",,410,20

Their mean age was 42.4 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Headache (85%) and seizures (65%) were the common presenting symptoms, with a mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13. CVT was the presenting feature in 13 cases (65%), while 7 patients (35%) developed CVT while being treated for COVID-19 infection. Respiratory symptoms were absent in 45% of the patients. The most common imaging finding was infarction (65%), followed by hemorrhage (20%). The superior sagittal sinus (65%) was the most common site of thrombosis. Acute inflammatory markers were raised, including elevated serum D-dimer (87.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (69%), and C-reactive protein (47%) levels. Homocysteine was elevated in half of the tested cases. The mortality rate was 20% (4 patients). A good functional outcome was seen in the surviving patients, with a mean modified Rankin Scale score at discharge of 1.3. Nine patients (45%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1 at discharge. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related CVT is more common among males at older ages when compared to previously reported non-COVID-19-related CVT cases. CVT should be suspected in COVID-19 patients presenting with headache or seizures. Mortality is high, but functional neurological outcome is good among survivors.","Hameed, Sajid; Wasay, Mohammad; Soomro, Bashir A; Mansour, Ossama; Abd-Allah, Foad; Tu, Tianming; Farhat, Raja; Shahbaz, Naila; Hashim, Husnain; Alamgir, Wasim; Iqbal, Athar; Khan, Maria",Cerebrovasc Dis Extra,410,24

The aim of the study is to investigate the findings of temporal tomography and evaluate the middle ear and mastoid in COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was planned. Patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. COVID-19 patients, who had temporal bone tomography scans (CT), were evaluated. One hundred twenty-nine COVID-19 patients with positive PCR, who also had temporal bone scans, were included in the study. A grading system was used to evaluate the effusion in the middle ear and mastoid cells. According to this grading system, left and right middle ear and mastoid were evaluated separately. In the grading system, the scores were evaluated as 0=no effusion, 1=partial effusion, and 2=100% effusion. The maximum score was accepted as 8.

At the same time, the reorganization of the pediatric medical-surgical activities and infrastructures was carried out, with the consequent suspension of the non-urgent surgical activity of Pediatric Urology. We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activity in a Pediatric Urology division, as well as surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and surgical data was carried out, including complications and readmissions of all patients operated on in the division of Pediatric Urology within the duration of the state of alarm. Five time periods have been created according to the de-escalation phases. RESULTS: Forty-nine surgical procedures were carried out on 45 patients (8 prior to the implementation of the de-escalation phases). High priority pathologies were the most frequent in the first phases, being the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction the most prevalent. Four complications were recorded (8.8%), none of them were respiratory. CONCLUSIONS: The EAU recommendations for the resumption of surgical activity have allowed a correct, safe and gradual transition to the routine surgical activity in Pediatric Urology. The Clavien-Dindo classification is useful and valid for application in this division. No respiratory complications have been reported that could be attributable to the pandemic situation.","Merino-Mateo, L; Tordable Ojeda, C; Cabezalí Barbancho, D; Gómez Fraile, A",Actas urol. esp,410,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19 among health professionals (physicians, dentists, pharmacists) two weeks prior to the start of the Greek vaccination campaign against COVID-19. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted over the period 15-22 December 2020 in 340 health professionals in Central Greece. We found a high level of acceptance for COVID-19 vaccine (78.5%) and a high vaccination coverage for the influenza vaccine (74%). Age > 45 years (OR = 2.01; 95% C.I. = 2.01-4.3), absence of fear over vaccine safety (OR = 4.09; 95% C.I. = 1.36-12.3), and information received from the Greek public health authorities (OR = 11.14; 95% C.I. = 5.48-22.6), were factors independently associated with the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. Our study indicates a high level of the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance among physicians, dentists and pharmacists. Nevertheless, several interventions can be implemented to increase acceptance of vaccine among health-care workers (HCWs) and could be especially directed at younger and vaccine-hesitant health care workers due to fear of vaccine side-effects. Last, our results provide some evidence that receiving vaccine-related information from the Greek Center for Diseases Control (E.O.D.Y.) could reduce the drivers of hesitancy and enhance the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination.","Papagiannis, Dimitrios; Rachiotis, George; Malli, Foteini; Papathanasiou, Ioanna V; Kotsiou, Ourania; Fradelos, Evangelos C; Giannakopoulos, Konstantinos; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I",,410,16

Anecdotal reports suggested that students found this experience rich for learning. Previous studies have explored alternative models of student service, however this defined medical student support role is novel. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were recorded with 20 medical students at a UK medical school exploring their experiences of placement learning and experiences of working as healthcare assistants. Responses were analysed qualitatively using a framework approach. The framework was developed into a model describing key findings and their relationships. RESULTS: Interviews yielded data that broadly covered aspects of (1) Medical students' experiences of clinical placement learning (2) Medical students' experiences of working as medical student healthcare assistants (3) Learning resulting from working as a healthcare assistant (4) Hierarchies and professional barriers in the clinical environment (5) Influences on professional identity. Participants described barriers and facilitators of clinical learning and how assuming a healthcare assistant role impacted on learning and socialisation within the multidisciplinary team. Students became increasingly socialised within the healthcare team, contributing directly to patient care; the resulting social capital opened new opportunities for learning, team working and enhanced students' interprofessional identity. Students described the impact of these experiences on their aspirations for their future practice. CONCLUSIONS: Changes to work patterns in healthcare and delivery models of medical education have eroded opportunities for students to contribute to healthcare delivery and be embedded within a team. This is impacting negatively on student learning and socialisation and we suggest that medical curricula have much to learn from nursing and allied health professional training. Longitudinal embedment with a multidisciplinary team, where students have a defined role and work directly with patients may not only add value to clinical service, but also overcome current barriers to effective placement learning and interprofessional identity formation for medical students.","Nolan, Helen; Owen, Katherine",BMC Med Educ,410,16

RESULTS: Here we present preliminary STHAM simulation results that reproduce the overall trends observed in the Wasatch Front (Utah, United States of America) for the general population. The results presented here clearly indicate that human activity patterns are important in predicting the rate of infection for different demographic groups in the population.

The spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key target of antiviral drugs. Focusing on the existing S protein structure, molecular docking was used in this study to calculate the binding energy and interaction sites between 14 antiviral molecules with different structures and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the potential drug candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were analyzed. Tizoxanide, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and arbidol were found to have high binding energies, and they effectively bind key sites of the S1 and S2 subunits, inhibiting the virus by causing conformational changes in S1 and S2 during the fusion of the S protein with host cells. Based on the interactions among the drug molecules, the S protein and the amino acid environment around the binding sites, rational structure-based optimization was performed using the molecular connection method and bioisosterism strategy to obtain Ti-2, BD-2, and Ar-3, which have much stronger binding ability to the S protein than the original molecules. This study provides valuable clues for identifying S protein inhibitor binding sites and the mechanism of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect as well as useful inspiration and help for the discovery and optimization of small molecule S protein inhibitors.","Sun, Chuancai; Zhang, Jian; Wei, Jiao; Zheng, Xiaoli; Zhao, Xianyang; Fang, Zengjun; Xu, Dongmei; Yuan, Huiqing; Liu, Yipeng",PLoS One,410,16

The impact of the disease among the obstetric population remains unclear, and the study of the placenta can provide valuable information. Adequate sampling of the placental tissue can help characterize the pathways of viral infections. METHODS: A protocol of placental sampling is proposed, aiming at guaranteeing representativity of the placenta and describing the adequate conservation of samples and their integrity for future analysis. The protocol is presented in its complete and simplified versions, allowing its implementation in different complexity settings. RESULTS: Sampling with the minimum possible interval from childbirth is the key for adequate sampling and storage. This protocol has already been implemented during the Zika virus outbreak. CONCLUSION: A protocol for adequate sampling and storage of placental tissue is fundamental for adequate evaluation of viral infections on the placenta. During the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of this protocol may help to elucidate critical aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nobrega, Guilherme de Moraes; Guida, José Paulo Siqueira; Japecanga, Rodolfo Rosa; Antolini-Tavares, Arthur; Mysorekar, Indira; Costa, Maria Laura",Rev Bras Ginecol Obstet,410,27

Hospital administrations had to provide a prompt response to a rapidly evolving emergency characterized by the necessity of giving access to an enormous number of infected patients, guaranteeing appropriate care to patients in need of other types of treatment, and simultaneously preserving the well-being of healthcare providers. To optimize the diagnostic pathway during the current COVID-19 outbreak, the hospital administration of our tertiary center applied a highly structured framework assigning specific tasks to the different units composing the Department of Imaging. In particular, since the beginning of the pandemic, a mobile CT scanner in a truck was rented and became operative for all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and another CT was assigned for all suspected cases. The success and efficacy of the management applied by our administration is demonstrated by the fact that during the outbreak, the radiological workflow was never interrupted. In fact, despite the national lockdown only a 29.3% decrease of CT scans occurred compared to the previous year.

At the front line of the present war against COVID-19, medical teams are endangering their lives as they continue to treat patients suffering from the disease. What is the degree of danger that a medical team must accept in the face of a pandemic? What are the theoretical justifications for these risks? This article offers answers to these questions by citing opinions based on Jewish ethical thought that has been formulated down through the ages. According to Jewish ethics, the obligation to assist and care for patients is based on many commandments found in the Bible and on rulings in the Responsa literature. The ethical challenge is created when treating the sick represents a real existential danger to the caregivers and their families. This consideration is relevant for all dangerous infectious diseases and particularly for the coronavirus that has struck around the world and for which there is as yet no cure. Many rabbis over the years have offered the religious justifications for healing in a general sense and especially in cases of infectious diseases as they have a bearing on professional and communal obligations. They have compared the ethical expectations of doctors to those of soldiers but have not sanctioned taking risks where there is insufficient protection or where there is a danger to the families of the medical professionals.","Rashi, Tsuriel",Med. health care philos,410,16

We sought to review the literature to appraise the clinicians on these outcomes. METHODS: A literature search using the specific keywords was carried out in the database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar up till December 11, 2020 applying Boolean method. Full text of all the relevant articles that reported the outcomes of ADA in patients with T2DM and COVID-19 were retrieved. Subsequently, an appraisal of literature report was narratively presented. RESULTS: Available studies that reported the outcomes of ADA are either case series or retrospective cohorts or prospective observational studies, in absence of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results from these observational studies suggest that amongst all the non-insulin ADA, metformin users prior to the hospitalization had improved outcomes compared to the non-users. Data for dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are encouraging although inconsistent. No documentation of any harm or benefit has been observed for sulfonylureas (SUs), sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). No data is yet available for pioglitazone. CONCLUSION: Metformin and DPP-4i should be continued in patients with T2DM until hospitalization or unless contraindicated. No evidence of harm suggests that SUs, SGLT-2i or GLP-1RAs may not be stopped unless very sick, hospitalized or contraindicated. The results from RCTs are needed to claim any meaningful benefit with either metformin or DPP-4i in patients with T2DM and COVID-19.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Singh, Ritu; Saboo, Banshi; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,410,16

The scale of spread and impact of the pandemic left many nations grappling with preventive and curative approaches. The infamous lockdown measure introduced to mitigate the virus spread has altered many aspects of our social routines in which demand for online-based services skyrocketed. As the virus propagate, so does misinformation and fake news around it via online social media, which seems to favour virality over veracity. With a majority of the populace confined to their homes for a long period, vulnerability to the toxic impact of online misinformation is high. A case in point is the various myths and disinformation associated with the Covid-19, which, if left unchecked, could lead to a catastrophic outcome and hamper the fight against the virus. While the scientific community is actively engaged in identifying the virus treatment, there is a growing interest in combating the associated harmful infodemic. To this end, researchers have been curating and documenting various datasets about Covid-19. In line with existing studies, we provide an expansive collection of curated datasets to support the fight against the pandemic, especially concerning misinformation.

Restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 influenza (2009), Ebola (2014) and, currently in the containment of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, they do not always work as expected. METHODS: To determine when mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected communities. One community comprises a low-risk, low-density population with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a high-risk, high-density population without access to effective medical resources. FINDINGS: Unrestricted mobility between the two risk communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size. INTERPRETATION: Mobility restrictions may not be an effective policy for controlling the spread of an infectious disease if it is assessed by the overall final epidemic size. Patterns of mobility established through the independent mobility and trade decisions of people in both communities may be sufficient to contain epidemics.","Espinoza, Baltazar; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos; Perrings, Charles",PLoS One,410,16

The mechanisms underlying this difference remain unclear. Methods: We compared the immunological landscape between COVID-19 and two other contagious respiratory illnesses (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) by clustering analysis of the three diseases based on 27 immune signatures' scores. Results: We identified three immune subtypes: Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, which displayed high, medium, and low immune signatures, respectively. We found 20%, 35.5%, and 44.5% of COVID-19 cases included in Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, respectively; all influenza cases were included in Immunity-H; 66.7% and 33.3% of RSV cases belonged to Immunity-H and Immunity-L, respectively. These data indicate that most COVID-19 patients have weaker immune signatures than influenza and RSV patients, as evidenced by 22 of the 27 immune signatures having lower enrichment scores in COVID-19 than in influenza and/or RSV. The Immunity-M COVID-19 patients had the highest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and lowest viral loads and were the youngest. In contrast, the Immunity-H COVID-19 patients had the lowest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and highest viral loads and were the oldest. Most immune signatures had lower enrichment levels in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in non-ICU patients. Gene ontology analysis showed that the innate and adaptive immune responses were significantly downregulated in COVID-19 versus healthy individuals. Conclusions: Compared to influenza and RSV, COVID-19 displayed significantly different immunological profiles. Elevated immune signatures are associated with better prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","Abdelrahman, Zeinab; Chen, Zuobing; Lyu, Haoyu; Wang, Xiaosheng",,410,16

In theUK, few studies have reported poorer outcomes for certain ethnicpopulations. UK government introduced shielding guidance to protectthe most vulnerable patients and this was in force for a number ofmonths. However, shielding guidance was initially released only inEnglish, which resulted in further disenfranchisement of the Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic community (BAME). We undertook an auditto understand experiences of shielding particularly in rheumatologicalBAME patients in multi-ethnic communities in 3 centres -Wolverhampton, Leicester and Oxford.MethodsThis study was approved in all three sites as an audit. Patientscontacting rheumatology helpline or having routine consultations wereincluded. Each centre aimed to recruit at least 20 patients. Aquestionnaire was developed to capture important data on shielding.The study was conducted between May and June 2020 during thepeak of the first wave of Covid 19.ResultsWe recruited 79 patients into this audit, of these 54 were of BAME and25 of Caucasian ethnicity with 17 males and 62 females. RheumatoidArthritis (RA) was the commonest diagnosis in 49 of these patients(62%) and these patients were older (median ages 56 vs. 46 years, p = 0.14). BSR risk scoring algorithm was used to determine need forshielding (BSR score of 3 or more) - 38 patients fell into this category.The remaining patients had scored lower and had the option ofshielding or enhanced social distancing. Of the 13 Caucasian patientswho should have been shielding, 11 were (85%). Of the 25 BAMEpatients who should have been shielding: 17 were, and 8 were not(68%, p = 0.26;65% looking at South Asian patients alone).Understanding of reasons for shielding was clear for 21 out of 25Caucasian patients (84%). In contrast, 33 of 54 patients from BAMEbackgrounds (61%) were clear on this (p = 0.10). WithinWolverhampton and Leicester, the numbers are starker with 20 outof 37 (54%) being clear on this. Very few Caucasian patients madechanges to their existing medications with 84% carrying on theirmedications as they were before the onset of COVID 19. However, of54 BAME patients, 14 patients had stopped medications - either bythemselves or as per advice of health professionals (74%, p = 0.16).There was a significant difference between centres in patientsstopping medications with patients from Leicester much more likely(p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionDespite the small numbers, the data clearly suggest that BAMEpatients were less likely to understand the reasons for shielding, tofollow shielding advice, and more likely to change their medications, thereby risking a flare. Addressing culturally competent educationalneeds and health equality for BAME rheumatology patients continuesto remain a challenge.","Dubey, S.; Kumar, K.; Bunting, H.; Sheeran, T.; Douglas, B.; Sabu, J.; Attwal, M.; Moorthy, A.",Rheumatology (United Kingdom),410,1

We conducted a serosurveillance using antibody testing in an area where official report of COVID-19 infection is not done yet. Blood samples were obtained from 1404 healthcare workers (41 ± 11 years) in our hospital on May 29-31, 2020. First, the potential infection frequency was confirmed using two quantitative antibody tests. In addition, the usefulness of rapid antibody kit testing for COVID-19 serosurveillance was examined.

While the reduced human presence and mobility, causing declines in visitation rates of protected areas, may generally favour biodiversity conservation in natural ecosystems, the pandemic has caused major disruptions of the food supply chain. Furthermore, the ""reverse migration""of labour has led to scarcity of workforce in many localities hitting agricultural operations. The cumulative effect is food insecurity for millions of people in both the developed and developing countries. It is therefore crucial to encourage local food production systems at the household and community levels. Tropical homegardens, which are resilient and sustainable production systems, are important in this respect. Homegardening is a unique farming system, which combines divergent production and service functions around the homesteads and contribute to the supply of fresh food at the household level. Being a decentralized production system, such practices may reduce food wastage along the supply chain. A prominent structural attribute of homegardens is the great diversity of species ranging from creeping herbs to tall trees and livestock, implying their potential for biodiversity conservation. Although land-use systems are challenged as never before in the wake of the pandemic, homegardening may provide a way forward to overcome the looming food insecurity at the household level in the rural areas of many countries. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Kumar, B.

Traditional approaches for the prevention and control of infectious diseases include vaccination programmes, hygiene measures and drugs that suppress the pathogen, treat the disease symptoms or attenuate aggressive reactions of the host immune system. The provision of vaccines and biologic drugs such as antibodies is hampered by the high cost and limited scalability of traditional manufacturing platforms based on microbial and animal cells, particularly in developing countries where infectious diseases are prevalent and poorly controlled. Molecular farming, which uses plants for protein expression, is a promising strategy to address the drawbacks of current manufacturing platforms.

We sought to determine whether infliximab-treated patients with IBD have attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. DESIGN: Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared with a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin &#945;4ß7 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between 22 September and 23 December 2020. RESULTS: Rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% (161/4685) vs 6.0% (134/2250), p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; OR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.87), p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92), p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity. In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab-treated than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% (39/81) vs 83% (30/36), p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV-2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut-off index (0.2-5.6) vs 37.0 (15.2-76.1), p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is associated with attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 that were further blunted by immunomodulators used as concomitant therapy. Impaired serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection might have important implications for global public health policy and individual anti-TNF-treated patients. Serological testing and virus surveillance should be considered to detect suboptimal vaccine responses, persistent infection and viral evolution to inform public health policy.

This study aimed to compare the effects of losartan and amlodipine in patients with primary HTN and COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomised clinical trial, hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and primary HTN were enrolled in the study. One arm received losartan, 25 mg, twice a day and the other arm received amlodipine, 5 mg per day for 2 weeks. The main outcomes were compare 30-day mortality rate and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The mean age of patients treated with losartan (N = 41) and amlodipine (N = 39) was 67.3 ± 14.8 and 60.1 ± 17.3 years, respectively (P value = .068). The length of hospital stay in losartan and amlodipine groups was 4.57 ± 2.59 and 7.30 ± 8.70 days, respectively (P value = .085). Also, the length of ICU admission in losartan and amlodipine group was 7.13 ± 5.99 and 7.15 ± 9.95 days, respectively (P value = .994). The 30-day mortality was two and five patients in losartan and amlodipine groups, respectively (P value = .241). CONCLUSIONS: There was no priority in losartan or amlodipine administration in COVID-19 patients with primary HTN in decreasing mortality rate, hospital and ICU length stay.

RAS dysregulation is one of the major characteristics of several cardiovascular diseases, thus adjustment of this system is the main therapeutic target. RAS inhibitors - particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) - are commonly used for treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Patients with cardiovascular diseases are the group most commonly seen amongst those with COVID-19 comorbidity. At the beginning of this pandemic, a dilemma occurred regarding the use of ACEIs and ARBs potentially aggravating cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Urgent clinical trials from different countries and hospitals reported that there is no association between RAS inhibitor treatment and COVID-19 infection or comorbidity complication. Nevertheless, the disturbance of the RAS system that is associated with COVID-19 infection and the potential treatment targeting this area has yet to be resolved. In this review, the link between the dysregulation of classical RAS and counter-regulatory RAS activities in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular metabolic diseases is investigated. In addition, the latest findings based on ACEIs and ARBs administration and ACE-2 availability in relation to COVID-19 which may provide a better understanding of RAS contribution to COVID-19 pathology is discussed as it is of the utmost importance amid the current pandemic.","Almutlaq, Moudhi; Alamro, Abir Abdullah; Alroqi, Fayhan; Barhoumi, Tlili",,410,24

METHODS: Participants from two Swiss organisations, aged 18-65 years and working from home during the lockdown (n = 69) were included. Baseline data collected in January 2020 before the lockdown (office work) were compared with follow-up data in April 2020 during lockdown (working from home). The primary outcome of NP was assessed with a measure of intensity and disability. Secondary outcomes were quality of workstation ergonomics, number of work breaks, and time spent working at the computer. Two linear mixed effects models were fitted to the data to estimate the change in NP. RESULTS: No clinically relevant change in the average NP intensity and neck disability was found between measurement time points. Each working hour at the computer increased NP intensity by 0.36 points (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.62) indicating strong evidence. No such effect was found for neck disability. Each work break taken reduced neck disability by 2.30 points (95% CI: - 4.18 to - 0.42, evidence). No such effect was found for NP intensity. There is very strong evidence that workstation ergonomics was poorer at home. CONCLUSION: The number of work breaks and hours spent at the computer seem to have a greater effect on NP than the place of work (office, at home), measurement time point (before COVID-19, during lockdown) or the workstation ergonomics. Further research should investigate the effect of social and psychological factors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04169646.

This study investigated the relationship between serum interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and alpha defensin levels and the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 100 patients who were admitted to the chest diseases department and intensive care unit of our hospital and diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab samples between March 24 and May 31, 2020. The control group consisted of 50 nonsymptomatic health workers with negative real-time PCR results in routine COVID-19 screening in our hospital. RESULTS: Serum alpha defensin, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared to patients who did not (p < .001 for all). Alpha defensin, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with and without MAS or ARDS when compared to the control group (p < .001 for all). When the 9 patients who died were compared with the 91 surviving patients, IL-1Ra and IL-18 levels were found to be significantly higher in the nonsurvivors (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Our findings of correlations between alpha defensin and levels of IL-1Ra and IL-18, which were previously shown to be useful in COVID-19 treatment and follow-up, indicates that it may also be promising in treatment.","Kerget, Bugra; Kerget, Ferhan; Aksakal, Alperen; Askin, Seda; Saglam, Leyla; Akgün, Metin",J Med Virol,410,24

Few analyses have specifically looked at quantifying the financial impact of the pandemic on practicing neurosurgeons. A survey analysis was performed to address this need. METHODS: A 19-question survey was distributed to practicing neurosurgeons in the United States and its territories. The questions evaluated respondents' assessments of changes in patient and procedural volume, salary and benefits, practice expenses, staffing, applications for government assistance, and stroke management. Responses were stratified by geographic region. RESULTS: The response rate was 5.1% (267/5224). Most respondents from each region noted a >50% decrease in clinic volume. Respondents from the Northeast observed a 76% decrease in procedure volume, which was significantly greater than that of other regions (P = 0.003). Northeast respondents were also significantly more likely to have been reassigned to nonneurosurgical clinical duties during the pandemic (P < 0.001). Most respondents also noted decreased salary and benefits but experienced no changes in overall practice expenses. Most respondents did not experience significant reductions in nursing or midlevel staffing. These trends were not significantly different between regions. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to decreases in patient and procedural volume and physician compensation despite stable practice expenses. Significantly more respondents in the Northeast region noted decreases in procedural volume and reassignment to nonneurosurgical COVID-related medical duties. Future analysis is necessary as the pandemic evolves and the long-term clinical and economic implications become clear.","Caruso, James P; Swartz, Karin; Mazzola, Catherine; Ban, Vin Shen; Singh, Ravi; Eldridge, Cody; Schirmer, Clemens; Cheng, Joseph; Bauer, Andrew M; Steinmetz, Michael; Adogwa, Owoicho",World neurosurgery (Online),410,3

Currently, it has been revealed that patients with underlying disease, especially those with kidney disease are more prone to develop complications. Some studies associate kidney transplantation as a risk factor for COVID-19 progression; however, epidemiologic data that demonstrate this are amazingly rare. Considering the importance of the topic, we report on six kidney transplant recipients (median age 47 [41-55]) with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. The most common admission presentations were fever (83.3%), dyspnea, and myalgia. At baseline, immunosuppressive therapy was ceased, prednisolone dose was increased, and all patients received antiviral treatment including hydroxychloroquine and umifenovir. After a median follow-up of 11.5 days from admission, six patients (100%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI), 50% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and two patients (33.3%) deceased as a result of deterioration in respiratory status. Overall, these findings demonstrate that respiratory involvement may be a risk indicator of in-hospital mortality in kidney recipients with COVID-19. In addition, AKI development in kidney recipients with COVID-19 is of utmost importance given the higher AKI occurrence in these patients compared with others. Therefore, more intensive attention should be paid to kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19.","Rahimzadeh, Hormat; Keykhaei, Mohammad; Razeghi, Effat; Zivari, Ensieh; Mansouri, Ensieh Sadat",CEN case reports,410,1

One reason for this is the disruption of food marketing systems and subsequent changes in farm and consumer prices. Based on primary data in Ethiopia collected just before the start and a few months into the pandemic, we assess changes in farm and consumer prices of four major vegetables and the contribution of different segments of the rural-urban value chain in urban retail price formation. We find large, but heterogeneous, price changes for different vegetables with relatively larger changes seen at the farm level, compared to the consumer level, leading to winners and losers among local vegetable farmers due to pandemic-related trade disruptions. We further note that despite substantial hurdles in domestic trade reported by most value chain agents, increases in marketing?and especially transportation?costs have not been the major contributor to overall changes in retail prices. Marketing margins even declined for half of the vegetables studied. The relatively small changes in marketing margins overall indicate the resilience of these domestic value chains during the pandemic in Ethiopia.","Hirvonen, Kalle Minten Bart Mohammed Belay Tamru Seneshaw",Agricultural Economics,410,32

However, given the dynamic landscape of tRNA pools among tissues, it is unclear whether different viruses infecting different tissues have adapted their codon usage toward their tropism. Here, we collect the coding sequences of 502 human-infecting viruses and determine that tropism explains changes in codon usage. Using the tRNA abundances across 23 human tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we build an in silico model of translational efficiency that validates the correspondence of the viral codon usage with the translational machinery of their tropism. For instance, we detect that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is specifically adapted to the upper respiratory tract and alveoli. Furthermore, this correspondence is specifically defined in early viral proteins. The observed tissue-specific translational efficiency could be useful for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines.","Hernandez-Alias, Xavier; Benisty, Hannah; Schaefer, Martin H; Serrano, Luis",Cell Rep,410,26

Despite its inherent limitations, telemedicine offers many advantages to both patient and physician as an alternative to in-person evaluation of select patients. In the near term, telemedicine allows nonpandemic care to proceed while observing appropriate public health concerns to minimize the spread of pandemic pathogens. Thus, it behooves practitioners to use telemedicine consultations for common otolaryngology complaints. Assessment of the dizzy patient is well-suited to an algorithmic approach that can be adapted to a telemedicine setting. As best practices for telemedicine have yet to be defined, we present herein a practical approach to the history and limited physical examination of the dizzy patient in the telemedicine setting for the general otolaryngologist. Indeed, once the acute crisis has abated, we suspect that this approach will continue to be an effective way to manage dizzy patients.","Chari, Divya A; Wu, Matthew J; Crowson, Matthew G; Kozin, Elliott D; Rauch, Steven D",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,410,20

To face the pandemic outbreak, hospitals converted wards to assure COVID-19 patients' care and adopted measures to reduce virus diffusion. The aim of this study was to determine how many physiotherapists, in the Lombardy region, worked during pandemic, whether they continued their usual practice or were employed in COVID-19 wards and in which tasks they were involved. The survey was submitted online by the national professional order. The response rate was 11.79%. During the pandemic, 648 (53.9%) respondents interrupted their services. Less than 20% of the physiotherapists that continued working were assigned to COVID-19 wards with the role of physiotherapist. Only a small proportion of respondents had advanced skills in respiratory physiotherapy. Moreover, this study showed a limited involvement of physiotherapists inside the very acute and intense settings. In conclusion, this work revealed that, during COVID-19 pandemic, in the Lombardy region a small percentage of physiotherapists was employed in COVID-19 wards, mainly in post-acute context. Even though the response rate of this survey was very low, this study highlights the need to define and underline the role of physiotherapy in acute setting during emergency.","Privitera, Emilia; D039,; Abrosca, Francesco; Gaudiello, Giuseppe; Lazzeri, Marta; Bellofiore, Angela; Frigerio, Pamela; Santambrogio, Martina",Monaldi arch. chest dis,410,24

In this study, we discuss the imbalance of multiple systems during the infection and the importance of therapeutic choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of cardiac and anti-coagulant therapies in COVID-19 patients. The crosstalk between angiotensin, kinin-kallikrein system, as well as inflammatory and coagulation systems plays an essential role in COVID-19. Cardiac complications and coagulopathies imply the crosstalks between the mentioned systems. We believe that the blockage of bradykinin can be a good option in the management of COVID-19 and CVD in patients and that supportive treatment of respiratory and cardiologic complications is needed in COVID-19 patients. Ninety-one percent of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to hospital with a prolonged aPTT were positive for lupus anticoagulant, which increases the risk of thrombosis and prolonged aPTT. Therefore, the question that is posed at this juncture is whether it is safe to use the prophylactic dose of heparin particularly in those with elevated D-dimer levels. It should be noted that timing is of high importance in anti-coagulant therapy; therefore, we should consider the level of D-dimer, fibrinogen, drug-drug interactions, and risk factors during thromboprophylaxis administration. Fibrinogen is an independent predictor of resistance to heparin and should be considered before thromboprophylaxis. Alteplase and Futhan might be a good choice to assess the condition of heparin resistance. Finally, the treatment option, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant therapy are critical decisions in COVID-19 patients.","Haybar, Habib; Maniati, Mahmood; Saki, Najmaldin; Zayeri, Zeinab Deris",Mol Biol Rep,410,30

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether cumulative proton pump inhibitor dose is associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia while controlling for multiple variables. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients who underwent upper endoscopy with gastric biopsy between 2005 and 2014. Covariate data retrieved included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, Helicobacter pylori status (based on clarithromycin-amoxicillin-proton pump inhibitor issued), cumulative proton pump inhibitor issued within 10 years (quartiles (PPI-Q1-4) of daily drug dose), anti-parietal cell antibodies, body mass index and comorbidity index. RESULTS: Of the 14,147 included patients (median age 63.4 years; women 54.4%; Helicobacter pylori-positive 29.0%), 1244 (8.8%) had gastric intestinal metaplasia. Increasing age, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, anti-parietal cell antibodies and proton pump inhibitor use were all associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. Upper quartiles of cumulative proton pump inhibitor doses (PPI-Q4 and PPI-Q3 vs. PPI-Q1) were associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia: adjusted odds ratios 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.57) and 1.27 (95% CI 1.07-1.52), respectively, for the whole cohort (Ptotal 0.007, Ptrend 0.013), 1.69 (95% CI 1.23-2.33) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.04-1.89), respectively, for Helicobacter pylori-positive patients (Ptotal 0.004, Ptrend 0.005) and 1.21 (95% CI 0.98-1.49) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.96-1.49), respectively, for Helicobacter pylori-negative patients (Ptotal 0.288, Ptrend 0.018).

Findings reveal that South Africa accounts for 40% of the total confirmed cases in Africa, followed by Egypt (18%), Nigeria (6.8%), Ghana (4.6%) and Algeria (3.6). Our study shows a significant relationship between population density and COVID-19 cases in Nigeria (R2 = 0.76; y = 2.43x - 268.7). This expression suggests that high population densities catalyze the spread of COVID-19. While Nigeria has only recorded about 25,964 cases as at the time of writing, the country is struggling to match pressures from rising cases as a result of existing disparities in health care systems.","Olusola, Adeyemi; Olusola, Babatunde; Onafeso, Olumide; Ajiola, Felix; Adelabu, Samuel",GeoJournal,410,26

METHODS: Between December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020, 23 hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms. Descriptive analysis and correlation of patients' clinical and CT characteristics were performed. Laboratory results from time of first admission and CT absorption (defined as reduction in lesion area, decrease in density, and absorption of some solid components) were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. RESULTS: Fifteen (65.2%) patients were asymptomatic with patchy ground-glass opacity in a single lung lobe. Eight (34.8%) patients were symptomatic with multiple patchy ground-glass shadows, consolidation, and fibrous stripes. Differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate between first admission and CT absorption were significant (P<0.001). Median absorption time was shorter in the asymptomatic group compared with the symptomatic group (5 vs 10 days; P<0.001). Median hospitalization time between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 14 vs 25.5 days; P>0.001. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization for all patients was 6 days (IQR 5-8) and 17 days (IQR 13-25), respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiological findings and clinical characteristics in pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization in asymptomatic patients were significantly shorter than in symptomatic patients. Lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate may be used as laboratory indicators of CT absorption.","Wu, Xiaoqing; Sun, Ruihong; Chen, Jianpu; Xie, Yuanliang; Zhang, Shutong; Wang, Xiang",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,410,26

Objective: To study symptoms and symptom relief during the last week of life, comparing nursing homes with hospitals. Design: The Swedish Register of Palliative Care with national coverage was used. Breakthrough symptoms were registered as Yes/No. Symptom relief was recorded on a 3-grade scale as complete-partial-no relief. All deaths in COVID-19 were contrasted to deaths in a reference population (deaths 2019). Deaths at nursing homes were compared with deaths in hospitals. Setting and Subjects: All deaths in hospitals or nursing homes (n = 490) were analyzed. Deaths in other settings (specialized palliative care wards [n = 11], in palliative home care [n = 2], or in their own homes [n = 8]) were excluded (n = 21). Only patients with expected deaths (n = 390) were entered in the final analysis. Results: Breathlessness as a breakthrough symptom was more common in COVID-19 patients than in the 2019 reference population (p < 0.001) and relief of breathlessness, as well as anxiety, delirium, and death rattles was less successful in COVID-19 patients (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01 in different comparisons). Patients were older in nursing homes than in hospitals (86.6 years vs. 80.9 years, p < 0.001) and more often female (48% vs. 34%, p < 0.001). Breakthrough of breathlessness was much more frequently reported in hospital settings than in nursing homes, 73% versus 35% (p < 0.0001), and complete relief was more rarely possible in hospitals, 20% versus 42% (p < 0.01). The proportion of partial relief+complete relief was comparable, 92% versus 95% (ns). Also, anxiety and pain were more often completely relieved in nursing homes (p < 0.01 in both comparisons). Conclusion: The lower symptom prevalence in nursing homes may be explained by elderly frail residents dying already in the first phase of the COVID-19 disease, before acute respiratory distress syndrome develops.","Strang, Peter; Bergström, Jonas; Lundström, Staffan",J. palliat. med,410,16

We report our experience with 6 patients hospitalized in Northern Italy during the outbreak. METHODS: Of the 396 living heart transplant recipients from 1985 to 2020 included in the study, 6 patients developed the novel 2019 coronavirus disease. Risk factors, last follow-up characteristics, onset presentation, in-hospital course of disease and blood examinations data were collected for these patients. RESULTS: All patients were symptomatic and had positive results from a nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 6 patients, 5 were hospitalized and 1 remained self-quarantined at home. Two patients died and 3 were discharged home. Two patients were admittted to the intensive care unit . Immunosuppressive therapy was modified with a median reduction comprising doses that were 50% cyclosporine and 50% mycophenolate. All patients received a medium-dose of corticosteroids as a bolus medication in addition to their therapy. All hospitalized patients received hydroxychloroquine; 2 patients received ritonavir/lopinavir. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for prophylaxis were administered to all. One patient had an ischaemic stroke and died of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of any strong evidence regarding the treatment of heart transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we faced a new challenge in managing viral infection in an immunosuppressed population. Because immunomodulation interaction with the infection seems to be crucial for developing severe forms of the disease, we managed to reduce immunosuppressive therapy by adding medium doses of corticosteroids. Despite the limited number of affected patients, this report suggests that special considerations should be given to treating coronavirus disease in the heart transplant recipient population.","Caraffa, Raphael; Bagozzi, Lorenzo; Fiocco, Alessandro; Bifulco, Olimpia; Nadali, Matteo; Ponzoni, Matteo; Carrozzini, Massimiliano; Toscano, Giuseppe; Fraiese, Angela Pompea; Metra, Marco; Lombardi, Carlo Maria; Serafini, Francesco; Ribola, Angela; Jorgji, Vjola; Bottio, Tomaso; Gerosa, Gino",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,410,16

METHODS: To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12%) and asthma (n=19, 15%).

CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P<0.05) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

In the void created by a lack of clinical experience with COVID-19, artificial intelligence (AI) may be an important tool to bolster clinical judgment and decision making. However, a lack of clinical data restricts the design and development of such AI tools, particularly in preparation for an impending crisis or pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of a ""patients-like-me"" framework to predict the deterioration of patients with COVID-19 using a retrospective cohort of patients with similar respiratory diseases. METHODS: Our framework used COVID-19-like cohorts to design and train AI models that were then validated on the COVID-19 population. The COVID-19-like cohorts included patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, unspecified pneumonia, influenza, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at an academic medical center from 2008 to 2019. In total, 15 training cohorts were created using different combinations of the COVID-19-like cohorts with the ARDS cohort for exploratory purposes. In this study, two machine learning models were developed: one to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 hours for each hospitalized day, and one to predict all-cause mortality at the time of admission. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. We established model interpretability by calculating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scores to identify important features. RESULTS: Compared to the COVID-19-like cohorts (n=16,509), the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=159) were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of patients of Hispanic ethnicity, a lower proportion of patients with smoking history, and fewer patients with comorbidities (P<.001). Patients with COVID-19 had a lower IMV rate (15.1 versus 23.2, P=.02) and shorter time to IMV (2.9 versus 4.1 days, P<.001) compared to the COVID-19-like patients. In the COVID-19-like training data, the top models achieved excellent performance (AUROC>0.90). Validating in the COVID-19 cohort, the top-performing model for predicting IMV was the XGBoost model (AUROC=0.826) trained on the viral pneumonia cohort. Similarly, the XGBoost model trained on all 4 COVID-19-like cohorts without ARDS achieved the best performance (AUROC=0.928) in predicting mortality. Important predictors included demographic information (age), vital signs (oxygen saturation), and laboratory values (white blood cell count, cardiac troponin, albumin, etc). Our models had class imbalance, which resulted in high negative predictive values and low positive predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: We provided a feasible framework for modeling patient deterioration using existing data and AI technology to address data limitations during the onset of a novel, rapidly changing pandemic.","Sang, Shengtian; Sun, Ran; Coquet, Jean; Carmichael, Harris; Seto, Tina; Hernandez-Boussard, Tina",J Med Internet Res,410,18

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the predictive accuracy of host biomarkers at clinical presentation to the ED for adverse outcome. METHODS: Prospective observational study of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the ED of a Swiss hospital. Concentrations of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction biomarkers were determined at clinical presentation. We evaluated the accuracy of clinical signs and these biomarkers in predicting 30-day intubation/mortality, and oxygen requirement by calculating the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and by classification and regression tree analysis. RESULTS: Of 76 included patients with COVID-19, 24 were outpatients or hospitalized without oxygen requirement, 35 hospitalized with oxygen requirement, and 17 intubated/died. We found that soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells had the best prognostic accuracy for 30-day intubation/mortality (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95) and IL-6 measured at presentation to the ED had the best accuracy for 30-day oxygen requirement (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94). An algorithm based on respiratory rate and sTREM-1 predicted 30-day intubation/mortality with 94% sensitivity and 0.1 negative likelihood ratio. An IL-6-based algorithm had 98% sensitivity and 0.04 negative likelihood ratio for 30-day oxygen requirement. CONCLUSIONS: sTREM-1 and IL-6 concentrations in COVID-19 in the ED have good predictive accuracy for intubation/mortality and oxygen requirement. sTREM-1- and IL-6-based algorithms are highly sensitive to identify patients with adverse outcome and could serve as early triage tools.","Van Singer, Mathias; Brahier, Thomas; Ngai, Michelle; Wright, Julie; Weckman, Andrea M; Erice, Clara; Meuwly, Jean-Yves; Hugli, Olivier; Kain, Kevin C; Boillat-Blanco, Noémie",J. allergy clin. immunol,410,24

In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. Subsequently, it spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, e.g., in terms of air temperature and humidity among other factors, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus propagation, both outdoors and especially indoors, by short-range droplet and aerosol (airborne) transmission, or/and by changing social contact patterns. Later recent atmospheric circulation conditions in Europe (July 2020) and the U.S. (October 2020) seem to support our hypothesis, although further research is needed in order to evaluate other confounding variables. Interestingly, the atmospheric conditions during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 seem to have resembled at some stage with the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Sanchez-Lorenzo, A; Vaquero-Martínez, J; Calbó, J; Wild, M; Santurtún, A; Lopez-Bustins, J A; Vaquero, J M; Folini, D; Antón, M",Environ Res,410,24

During this process light, an important environmental signal, triggers the inhibition of mesocotyl elongation and the production of photosynthetically active chloroplasts, and etiolated leaves transition from the ""sink"" stage to the ""source"" stage. De-etiolation has been extensively studied in maize (Zea mays L). However, little is known about how this transition is regulated. In this study, we describe a quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic atlas of the de-etiolation process in maize. We identified 16,420 proteins and quantified 14,168. In addition, 8746 phosphorylation sites within 3110 proteins were identified. From the proteomic and phosphoproteomic data combined, we identified a total of 17,436 proteins, 27.6% of which are annotated protein coding genes in the Zea_mays AGPv3.28 database. Only 7% of proteins significantly changed in abundance during de-etiolation. In contrast, the phosphorylation levels of more than 26% of phosphoproteins significantly changed; these included proteins involved in gene expression and homeostatic pathways and rate-limiting enzymes involved in photosynthesis light and carbon reactions. Based on phosphoproteomic analysis, 34% (1057) of all phosphoproteins identified in this study contained more than three phosphorylation sites, and 37 proteins contained more than 16 phosphorylation sites, which shows that multi-phosphorylation is ubiquitous during the de-etiolation process. Our results suggest that plants might preferentially regulate the level of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) rather than protein abundance for adapting to changing environments. The study of PTMs could thus better reveal the regulation of de-etiolation.","Gao, Zhi-Fang; Shen, Zhuo; Chao, Qing; Yan, Zhen; Ge, Xuan-Liang; Lu, Tiancong; Zheng, Haiyan; Qian, Chun-Rong; Wang, Bai-Chen",Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics,410,32

Patient and professional feedback on an acute male inpatient ward in South London highlighted a demand for more medication information outside the formal ward round setting. We aimed to have 100% of patients meet our criteria for “Patient-Centred Prescribing” on the ward by March 2021. To fulfil criteria, all patients are offered: (1) ward round discussion, (2) written patient information leaflets (PILs), (3) informal discussion groups, all regarding medication.The principles of this quality improvement project (QIP) were drawn from definitions of patient-centred care and standards of good practice;patients should have access to a variety of information formats, relevant to the individual, and the knowledge gained empowers patients.Patient experience data revealed that 30% of clients answered passively to the question, “Do you feel involved in your care?” We hypothesized that medication discussion groups positively impact patients’ wellbeing, by providing a safe space that facilitates conversation surrounding medication issues.MethodWe conducted weekly audits on patients whose admission duration was &gt;7 days, and recorded fulfilment of the above criteria. At week 1, we introduced a program of weekly medication discussion groups led by members of the wider multi-disciplinary team covering a broad topic range. At week 6, we developed a rolling rota of the discussion groups and posters were displayed in advance. At week 14, all patients were offered PILs through a 1:1 interaction and this continued as routine practice. Medication discussion group feedback was obtained via questionnaires and “The Blob Tree”, a psycho-emotional assessment tool commonly used in healthcare settings.ResultIn 19 weeks, the median percentage of patients who fulfilled our criteria for Patient-Centred Prescribing was 92.86%. After 11 medication discussion groups, 79.3% of questionnaire responders wanted further sessions. 88% of “The Blob Tree” responses collected inferred a positive emotional response after the group discussions and half of those noticed an improvement in their emotional state.ConclusionThis QIP was overall a success;it fulfilled a requirement to meet good standards in information sharing and became embedded in the fabric of the ward, continuing to run as part of the activities program. It demonstrated the impact of education on patients’ mental wellbeing through empowerment and peer support. As a by-product it established multidisciplinary connections and improved therapeutic relationships. Challenges included patient engagement secondary to acute mental illness or negative symptoms and maintaining project momentum following a COVID-19 outbreak.","Todd, Anna Blunstone Rosy",BJPsych Open,410,16

One of these concerning body composition (in this context; bone, lean and adipose tissue) is osteosarcopenic adiposity (OSA) syndrome. OSA occurs most often with aging, but also in cases of some chronic diseases and is exacerbated with the presence of low-grade chronic inflammation (LGCI). OSA has been associated with poor nutrition, metabolic disorders and diminished functional abilities. This paper addresses various influences on OSA and LGCI, as well as their mutual action on each other, and provides nutritional and behavioral approaches which could be personalized to help with either preventing or managing OSA and LGCI in general, and specifically in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressed in more detail are nutritional recommendations for and roles of macro- and micronutrients and bioactive food components; the microbiome; and optimal physical activity regimens. Other issues, such as food insecurity and nutritional inadequacy, circadian misalignment and shift workers are addressed as well.

These theoretical advances have prompted improvements in experimental techniques to test these predictions. As a result, experimental studies of simple binary hydrides under pressure have yielded high critical superconducting transition temperatures (Tc), of 260 K in LaH10, close to the commonly accepted threshold for room temperature, 293 K, at pressures near 180 GPa. We successfully synthesized a metallic La-based superhydride from La metal and ammonia borane, NH3BH3, and find a multi-step transition with a Tc of 294 K for the highest onset. When subjected to subsequent thermal excursions to higher temperatures that promoted a chemical reaction to what we believe is a ternary or higher order system, the transition temperature was driven to higher temperatures. Although the reaction does not appear to be complete, the onset temperature was pushed from 294 K to 556 K before the experiments had to be terminated. The results provide evidence for hot superconductivity well above room temperature, in line with recent predictions for a higher order hydride under pressure.","Grockowiak, A.

METHODS: Using real-time insights from two Cancer Council NSW services-131120 Information and Support Line and Online Community (CCOC) forums-we assessed service demand trends, distress levels (using the distress thermometer), and content from 131120 calls and online posts between 01 December 2019 and 31 May 2020. Emergent themes were identified through an inductive conventional content analysis with 131120 call notes, followed by a deductive directed content analysis on CCOC posts. RESULTS: In total, 688 COVID-19-related 131120 calls (n = 496) and online posts (n = 192) were analysed. Service demand peaked in March 2020 and self-reported distress peaked in May 2020 at an average of 8/10 [Mean = 7.5; SD = 0.9].

We aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemics on stroke management during the first month of Italy lockdown. In addition, we described the emergency structured pathway adopted by an Italian University Hub Stroke Unit in the cross-border Italy-Slovenia area. METHODS: We analyzed admitted patients' clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Total admissions experienced a reduction of 45% during the lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (16 vs 29, respectively), as well as a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS>10) at admission (n = 8, 50% vs n = 8, 28%). A dramatic prevalence of stroke of unknown symptom onset was observed in 2020 (n = 8, 50% vs n = 3, 10%). During lockdown, worse functional and independence outcomes were found, despite the similar proportion of reperfused patients. Similar 'symptoms alert-to-admission' and 'door-to-treatment' times were observed. During lockdown hospitalization was shorter and fewer patients completed the stroke work-up. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the adopted strategies for stroke management during the COVID-19 emergency have suggested being effective, while suffering a reduced and delayed reporting of symptoms. Therefore, we recommend raising awareness among the population against possible stroke symptoms onset.

This pandemic had major effects on the health market, the pharmaceutical sector, and was associated with considerable impacts; which may appear in short and long-term time-horizon and need identification and appropriate planning to reduce their socio-economic burden. OBJECTIVES: Current short communication study assessed pharmaceutical market crisis during the COVID-19 era; discussing short- and long-term impacts of the pandemic on the pharmaceutical sector. RESULTS: Short-term impacts of COVID-19 pandemic includes demand changes, regulation revisions, research and development process changes and the shift towards tele-communication and tele-medicine. In addition, industry growth slow-down, approval delays, moving towards self-sufficiency in pharm-production supply chain and trend changes in consumption of health-market products along with ethical dilemma could be anticipated as long-term impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on pharmaceutical sector in both global and local levels. CONCLUSION: The pandemic of COVID-19 poses considerable crisis on the health markets, including the pharmaceutical sector; and identification of these effects, may guide policy-makers towards more evidence-informed planning to overcome accompanying challenges.

Sand used to stabilize fissures and facilitate gas flow creates a potential occupational hazard from respirable fracking sand dust (FSD). As studies of the immunotoxicity of FSD are lacking, the effects of whole-body inhalation (6 h/d for 4 d) of a FSD, i.e., FSD 8, was investigated at 1, 7, and 27 d post-exposure in rats. Exposure to 10 mg/m3 FSD 8 resulted in decreased lung-associated lymph node (LLN) cellularity, total B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and total natural killer (NK) cells at 7-d post exposure. The frequency of CD4+ T-cells decreased while the frequency of B-cells increased (7 and 27 d) in the LLN. In contrast, increases in LLN cellularity and increases in total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were observed in rats following 30 mg/m3 FSD 8 at 1 d post-exposure. Increases in the frequency and number of CD4+ T-cells and NK cells were observed in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid at 7-d post-exposure (10 mg/m3) along with an increase in total CD4+ T-cells, CD11b + cells, and NK cells at 1-day post-exposure (30 mg/m3). Increases in the numbers of B-cells and CD8+ T-cells were observed in the spleen at 1-day post 30 mg/m3 FSD 8 exposure. In addition, NK cell activity was suppressed at 1 d (30 mg/m3) and 27 d post-exposure (10 mg/m3). No change in the IgM response to sheep red blood cells was observed. The findings indicate that FSD 8 caused alterations in cellularity, phenotypic subsets, and impairment of immune function.","Anderson, Stacey E; Shane, Hillary; Long, Carrie; Marrocco, Antonella; Lukomska, Ewa; Roberts, Jenny R; Marshall, Nikki; Fedan, Jeffrey S",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,410,15

Food insecurity has in fact soared all over the UK, with many people forced to rely on food support providers to not go hungry. This paper uses a unique dataset on 55 food support organizations active in Greater Manchester during the first COVID-19 wave, and 41 semi-structured interviews with food aid spokespersons and stakeholders, to shed light on what they overcame, the complications and drawbacks of the food emergency response plan put in place. The results indicate that food aid organizations that remained open were surprisingly effective despite the growth in user demand and the decrease in volunteers. However, the necessity to maintain a timely supply food at all costs came with important drawbacks. The lockdown measures that followed COVID-19 not only affected the financial stability and management of the organizations, and the availability of food, but undermined the ways in which food support providers used to operate. Owing to physical distancing measures and to the increasing numbers of users, more or less intangible forms of support such as financial advice, empathic listening and human warmth were partially lost, probably when they were needed more than ever.

However, material synthesis techniques for producing CSSPs economically in batch processes remain elusive. In this report, a practical and straightforward method for the preparation of CSSPs is presented. By refluxing freshly prepared nonporous silica particles in ammonia-water solution in the presence of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) at 70-100 °C, CSSPs with shell thicknesses of up to 300 nm and pore sizes from 8 to 25 nm were easily prepared. The effects of the synthetic conditions on the shell thickness, surface area, and pore size were investigated in detail, and the method reproducibility was evaluated in scale-up experiments. A mechanism of CSSP formation is also proposed. The CSSPs were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, laser particle size (dynamic light scattering) analysis, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments. The synthesized 3.4-µm CSSPs were functionalized with dimethyloctadecylchlorosilane and used as an HPLC packing material, exhibiting excellent separation performance for both small molecules and large biomolecules. In summary, we report the simplest method developed thus far for the preparation of monodisperse core-shell silica particles suitable for HPLC column packing.","Wu, Yaling; Sun, Xiaotong; Zhu, Junchen; Shen, Jiawei; Wang, Huiying; Zhu, Lunan; Zhou, Yang; Ke, Yanxiong",J Chromatogr A,410,27

However, recent developments in holomorphic HF theory show that this disappearing behaviour is only a manifestation of the way conventional HF equations prevent solutions from being analytically continued, but it is unclear what factors govern the existence and the locations of these disappearances. In this work, we explore some of these factors from the perspective of spatial symmetry by introducing a classification for symmetry constraints on electronic-structure calculations. This forms a framework for us to systematically investigate several analytical holomorphic HF solutions of a model $\textrm{[H}_4\textrm{]}^{2+}$ system in STO-3G and demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, spatial symmetry imposes strict requirements on the reality of certain solutions. The implications for self-consistent-field HF search algorithms are then discussed.

However, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation remain poorly characterized. To dissect the function of HBc, a yeast two-hybrid was performed to identify HBc-binding proteins, and the C-terminal of BRG1/hBRM-associated factors 200 (BAF200C) was identified. Then, the existence of HBc interactions with BAF200C and full-length BAF200 was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation assays in 293T, HepG2 and HepG2-NTCP cells. Furthermore, we show that the binding between HBc and BAF200 was of vital importance to HBc mediated downregulation of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) expression, and the mechanisms for the downregulation were disclosed as follows. Basal level of IFITM1 expression depends on BAF200, rather than the JAK–STAT1 pathway. The interaction of HBc with BAF200 disturbs the stability of the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complex and results in the suppression of IFTM1 transcription. Finally, the antiviral effects of IFITM1 on cell proliferation and HBV replication were found to be partially restored when HBc was co-transfected with BAF200. Collectively, our findings indicate that HBc plays a role in HBV resistance against the antiviral activities of IFNα, providing details about HBV evasion of host innate immunity.","Li, Tongya; Ke, Zunlong; Liu, Weiyong; Xiong, Ying; Zhu, Ying; Liu, Yingle",Viruses,410,29

METHODS: To characterize vaccine uptake among US child care providers, we conducted a multistate cross-sectional survey of the child care workforce. Providers were identified through various national databases and state registries. A link to the survey was sent via e-mail between May 26 and June 23, 2021. A 37.8% response yielded 21 663 respondents, with 20 013 satisfying inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Overall COVID-19 vaccine uptake among US child care providers (78.2%, 90% confidence interval: 77.5% to 78.9%) was higher than the US general adult population (65%). Vaccination rates varied between states from 53.5% to 89.4%. Vaccine uptake among respondents differed significantly (P < .01) based on respondent age (70.0% for ages 25-34, 91.6% for ages 75-84), race (70.0% for Black or African Americans, 92.5% for Asian Americans), annual household income (70.8% for <$35 000, 85.1% for >$75 000), and child care setting (73.0% for home-based, 79.7% for center-based). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine uptake among US child care providers was higher than the general US adult population. Those who were younger, lower income, Black or African American, resided in states either in the Mountain West or the South, and/or worked in home-based child care programs reported the lowest rates of vaccination. State public health leaders and lawmakers should prioritize these subgroups to realize the largest gains in vaccine uptake among providers.","Patel, Kavin M; Malik, Amyn A; Lee, Aiden; Klotz, Madeline; Humphries, John Eric; Murray, Thomas; Wilkinson, David; Shafiq, Mehr; Yildirim, Inci; Elharake, Jad A; Diaz, Rachel; Reyes, Chin; Omer, Saad B; Gilliam, Walter S",Pediatrics,410,1

We first proposed and established a Bayesian model to predict the epidemic spreading behavior. In this model, the infection probability matrix is estimated according to the individual contact frequency in certain population group. This infection probability matrix is highly correlated with population geographic distribution, population age structure and so on. This model can effectively avoid the prediction malfunction by using the traditional ordinary differential equation methods such as SIR (susceptible, infectious and recovered) model and so on. Meanwhile, it would forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hot spots geographically at different time. According to the results revealed by Bayesian model, the effect of population geographical distribution should be considered in the prediction of epidemic situation, and there is no simple derivation relationship between the threshold of group immunity and the virus reproduction numberR0. If we further consider the virus mutation effect and the antibody attenuation effect, with a large global population spatial distribution, it will be difficult for us to eliminate Covid-19 in a short time even with vaccination endeavor.

Our study included all adult patients who underwent minor surgery in one of the seven surgical departments of our hospital: urology, digestive, plastic, gynecological, otolaryngology, gynecology or maxillofacial surgery. Preoperative self-isolation, clinical assessment using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nasopharyngeal RT‐PCR and chest CT scan performed the day before surgery were part of our active prevention strategy. The main outcome was the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days following surgery. The COVID-19 status of patients after discharge was updated during the postoperative consultation and to ensure the accuracy of data, all patients were contacted again by telephone. RESULTS: A total of 551 patients from six different specialized surgical Departments in our tertiary care center were enrolled in our study. More than 99% (546/551) of included patients underwent a complete preoperative Covid-19 screening including RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan upon admission to the Hospital.

A test should have high sensitivity; however, the sensitivity of the PCR test is highly influenced by viral load, which changes over time. Because it is difficult to collect data before the onset of symptoms, the current literature on the sensitivity of the PCR test before symptom onset is limited. In this study, we used a viral dynamics model to track the probability of failing to detect a case of PCR testing over time, including the presymptomatic period. The model was parametrized by using longitudinal viral load data collected from 30 hospitalized patients. The probability of failing to detect a case decreased toward symptom onset, and the lowest probability was observed 2 days after symptom onset and increased afterwards. The probability on the day of symptom onset was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.5 to 1.9) and that 2 days before symptom onset was 60.2% (95% CI: 57.1 to 63.2).

Although viruses are known to affect host survival in populations, this has not been previously evaluated in the context of host group selection. Group selection per se is not a currently accepted idea and its apparent occurrence is explained by statistical gene frequency models of kin selection. Viruses were not considered in such models. Prevalent views associate viruses and disease. Yet many viruses establish species-specific persistent, inapparent infections that are stable on an evolutionary time scale. Such persistent infections can have large effects on relative reproductive fitness of competing host populations. In this essay, I present arguments on how persistent infections can promote population survival. Mouse hepatitis virus is used as well studied examplar to re-evaluate the theoretical basis of the mouse haystack model of M Smith.

CONCLUSION: The study shows that the self-efficacy of pregnant women depends deeply on being informed of the general and specific self-care principles. Besides, sensitivity could be achieved through the increased risk perception and knowledge on the pandemic. However, pregnant mothers should know the potential threats that could pose them at risk of vulnerability.

The cytokinic storm, thromboinflammation and pulmonary tropism are the bedrock of tissue lesions responsible for acute respiratory failure and for prolonged infection that may lead to multiple organ failure and death. The thrombogenicity of this infectious disease is illustrated by the high frequency of thromboembolic events observed even in Covid-19 patients treated with anticoagulation. Increased D-Dimers, a biomarker reflecting activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) are associated with higher mortality in Covid-19 patients. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge on the thromboembolic manifestations, the disturbed hemostatic parameters, and the thromboinflammatory conditions associated to Covid-19 and we will discuss the modalities of anticoagulant treatment or other potential antithrombotic options.","Ribes, Agnès; Vardon-Bounes, Fanny; Mémier, Vincent; Poette, Michael; Au-Duong, Jonathan; Garcia, Cédric; Minville, Vincent; Sié, Pierre; Bura-Rivière, Alessandra; Voisin, Sophie; Payrastre, Bernard",Adv Biol Regul,410,23

A retrospective observational cohort study of all children (0–15 years) attending for urgent care across Oxfordshire, during the first UK lockdown in 2020, compared to matched dates in 2015–2019, across two paediatric hospitals providing secondary care, including one with tertiary services. Our outcome measures were changes in numbers of patients attending and inpatient diagnoses (using ICD-10 classification) during the first 2020 lockdown, compared with the previous 5 years, were used. We found that total Emergency Department (ED) attendances (n = 4030) and hospital admissions (n = 1416) during the first UK lockdown were reduced by 56.8% and 59.4%, respectively, compared to 2015–2019 (5-year means n = 7446.8 and n = 2491.6, respectively). Proportions of patients admitted from ED and length of stay were similar across 2015–2020. ICD-10 diagnoses in lockdown of 2020 (n = 2843) versus matched 2015–2019 dates (n = 19,946) demonstrated significantly greater neoplasm diagnoses (p = 0.0123). Of diagnoses ‘missing’ in lockdown, 80% were categorised as infectious diseases or their sequelae and 20% were non-specific pains/aches/malaise and accidental injury/poisonings. Conclusions: Pandemic public health measures significantly altered paediatric presentations. Oxfordshire hospitals had a 58% reduction in ED attendances/inpatient admissions, with ‘missing’ diagnoses predominantly infection-related illnesses. These are likely driven by a combination of the following: (1) public health infection control measures successfully reducing disease transmission, (2) parents/carers keeping mild/self-limiting disease at home, and (3) pandemic-related healthcare anxieties. Prospective studies are needed to ensure referral pathways identify vulnerable children, those with social concerns, and avoid delayed presentation.

The conversion of ceramide into sphingosine is mediated by ceramidases. Altogether, five human ceramidases—named acid ceramidase, neutral ceramidase, alkaline ceramidase 1, alkaline ceramidase 2, and alkaline ceramidase 3—have been identified as having maximal activities in acidic, neutral, and alkaline environments, respectively. All five ceramidases have received increased attention for their implications in various diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Farber disease. Furthermore, the potential anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of ceramidases in host cells exposed to pathogenic bacteria and viruses have also been demonstrated. While ceramidases have been a subject of study in recent decades, our knowledge of their pathophysiology remains limited. Thus, this review provides a critical evaluation and interpretive analysis of existing literature on the role of acid, neutral, and alkaline ceramidases in relation to human health and various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases. In addition, the essential impact of ceramidases on tissue regeneration, as well as their usefulness in enzyme replacement therapy, is also discussed.","Duarte, Carolina; Akkaoui, Juliet; Yamada, Chiaki; Ho, Anny; Mao, Cungui; Movila, Alexandru",Cells,410,27

The aim of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in selected cytokine or chemokines response in asthmatic children compared to non-asthmatic children during acute M. pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: Seventy-five children, 6–12 years of age, admitted with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Two patient groups were defined: the children with known asthma (N = 40) and non-asthmatic children (N = 35). Interleukin (IL)-18 and selected chemokines, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and regulation upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by means of ELISA in the plasma samples of the patients collected on admission. We investigated the values of these mediators in relation to the asthma status and symptom severity of the patients. Twenty age-matched, non-infected controls were also studied. RESULTS: Plasma levels of IL-18 and the chemokines increased significantly in the patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia compared to non-infected, age-matched controls (P < 0.01). However, the asthmatic patients showed significantly reduced IL-18 and CXCL10 responses (P < 0.01, <0.05, respectively) and had more severe pneumonia symptoms (P < 0.01) compared to non-asthmatic patients. IL-18 was significantly lower in severe pneumonia group than in non-severe group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that IL-18 and the chemokines are importantly involved in the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia. It also indicates that some asthmatic children have deficient IL-18 response when affected by M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which might be associated with more severe pneumonia observed in this group of patients.","Chung, Hai Lee; Shin, Jin Young; Ju, Mi; Kim, Woo Taek; Kim, Sang Gyung",Cytokine,410,1

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients remain largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. Clinical data were collected from medical records from 13 January 2020 to 26 February 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: A total of 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (56.0–70.0) years. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (n = 7; 25.0%). Eight (28.6%) patients were suspected to have hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n = 23, 82.1%), dry cough (n = 22, 81%), and dyspnoea (n = 14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (n = 23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (n = 23, 82.1%), anaemia (n = 21, 75.0%), and hypoproteinaemia (n = 25, 89.3%). The common chest computed tomography (CT) findings were ground-glass opacity (n = 21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (n = 13, 46.3%). A total of 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and the mortality rate was 28.6%. If the last antitumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.079, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.086–15.322, P = 0.037]. Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk of developing severe events (HR = 5.438, 95% CI 1.498–19.748, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.

Results: Public emotions showed different evolution modes during different phases of COVID-19. Events about the development of COVID-19 remained hot, but generally declined, and public attention shifted to other aspects of the epidemic (e.g., encouragement, support, and treatment).

METHODS AND RESULTS: From February to April 2020, we prospectively studied a cohort of 96 participants comprising 47 consecutive patients with CAD and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (CAD+SARS-CoV-2), 19 CAD patients without infections, and 30 healthy controls. Clinical assessment included blood sampling, echocardiography, and electrocardiography within 12 hours of admission. Respiratory failure was stratified by the Horovitz Index (HI) as moderately/severely impaired when HI ≤ 200 mmHg. The clinical endpoint (EP) was defined as HI ≤ 200 mmHg with subsequent mechanical ventilation within a follow-up of 30 days. The numbers of CD14(dim)CD16(+) non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were remarkably low in CAD+SARS-CoV-2 compared to CAD patients without infection and healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Moreover, these CD14(dim)CD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14(dim)CD16(+) monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD+SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14(dim)CD16(+) monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Decreased numbers of CD14(dim)CD16(+) monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD+SARS-CoV-2 patients. Intensified risk assessments comprising monocyte sub- and phenotypes may help to identify patients at risk for respiratory failure. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are at risk of life-threatening heart and lung injury accelerated by the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found substantially low numbers of CD14(dim)CD16(+) non-classical monocytes with an altered phenotype suggesting impaired migration behaviour and T cell activation capacity in peripheral blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients with CAD, compared to CAD patients without infection or healthy controls. Decreased numbers of CD14(dim)CD16(+) monocytes predicted rapidly progressive respiratory failure (Horovitz index ≤ 200 mmHg) with subsequent mechanical ventilation. Therefore, early sub- and phenotyping of CD14(dim)CD16(+) monocytes using simple flow cytometry might predict worsening of respiratory failure at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk CAD patients, who require an extensive heart failure and anti-thrombotic therapy to improve their clinical outcome.","Mueller, Karin Anne Lydia; Langnau, Carolin; Günter, Manina; Pöschel, Simone; Gekeler, Sarah; Petersen-Uribe, Álvaro; Kreisselmeier, Klaus-Peter; Klingel, Karin; Bösmüller, Hans; Li, Bo; Jaeger, Philippa; Castor, Tatsiana; Rath, Dominik; Gawaz, Meinrad Paul; Autenrieth, Stella E",Cardiovasc Res,410,5

A molecular signature response classifier (MSRC) that predicts which patients with RA are unlikely to respond to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor (TNFi) therapy would have wide clinical utility. METHODS: The protein–protein interaction map specific to the rheumatoid arthritis pathophysiology and gene expression data in blood patient samples was used to discover a molecular signature of non-response to TNFi therapy. Inadequate response predictions were validated in blood samples from the CERTAIN cohort and a multicenter blinded prospective observational clinical study (NETWORK-004) among 391 targeted therapy-naïve and 113 TNFi-exposed patient samples. The primary endpoint evaluated the ability of the MSRC to identify patients who inadequately responded to TNFi therapy at 6 months according to ACR50. Additional endpoints evaluated the prediction of inadequate response at 3 and 6 months by ACR70, DAS28-CRP, and CDAI. RESULTS: The 23-feature molecular signature considers pathways upstream and downstream of TNFα involvement in RA pathophysiology. Predictive performance was consistent between the CERTAIN cohort and NETWORK-004 study. The NETWORK-004 study met primary and secondary endpoints. A molecular signature of non-response was detected in 45% of targeted therapy-naïve patients. The MSRC had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64 and patients were unlikely to adequately respond to TNFi therapy according to ACR50 at 6 months with an odds ratio of 4.1 (95% confidence interval 2.0–8.3, p value 0.0001). Odds ratios (3.4–8.8) were significant (p value < 0.01) for additional endpoints at 3 and 6 months, with AUC values up to 0.74. Among TNFi-exposed patients, the MSRC had an AUC of up to 0.83 and was associated with significant odds ratios of 3.3–26.6 by ACR, DAS28-CRP, and CDAI metrics. CONCLUSION: The MSRC stratifies patients according to likelihood of inadequate response to TNFi therapy and provides patient-specific data to guide therapy choice in RA for targeted therapy-naïve and TNFi-exposed patients.

Inhalation of infectious airborne particles can lead to infection, a route that can even be more predominant compared with droplet or contact transmission. To study the transmission between a susceptible and an infected person, we estimate the distribution of arrival times of small diffusing aerosol particles to the inhaled region located below the nose until the number of particles reaches a critical threshold. Our results suggest that although contamination by continuous respiration can take around 90 minutes at a distance of one meter, it is reduced to a few minutes when coughing or sneezing. Interestingly, there is not much differences between outdoors and indoors when the air is still. When a window is open inside an office, the infection time is reduced. Finally, wearing a mask leads to a delay in the time to infection.

It follows that HCWs from this country could have pre-existingMERS-CoV antibodies that may either protect from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection or cause false SARS-CoV-2 seropositive results. In this article, we report the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 among high-risk healthcare workers in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study enrolling 420 high-risk HCWs who are physically in contact with COVID-19 patients in three tertiary hospitals in Riyadh city. The participants were recruited between the 1(st) of July to the end of December 2020. A 3 ml of the venous blood samples were collected and tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk HCWs was 14.8% based on SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing while only 7.4% were positive by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for viral RNA. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 seropositive HCWs had symptoms and the most frequent symptoms were body aches, fever, cough, loss of smell and taste, and headache. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV IgG was 1% (4 participants) and only one participant had dual seropositivity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Three MERS-CoV positive samples (75%) turned to be negative after using in-house ELISA and none of the MERS-CoV seropositive samples had detectable neutralization activity. CONCLUSION: Our SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence results were higher than reported regional seroprevalence studies. This finding was expected and similar to other international findings that targeted high-risk HCWs. Our results provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2- seropositivity in Saudi Arabia similar to other countries was due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 rather than MERS-CoV antibody.","Alroqi, Fayhan; Masuadi, Emad; Alabdan, Lulwah; Nogoud, Maysa; Aljedaie, Modhi; Abu-Jaffal, Ahmed Selah; Barhoumi, Tlili; Almasoud, Abdulrahman; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Alsaedi, Abdulrahman; Khan, Mohammad; Arabi, Yaseen M.; Nasr, Amre",J Infect Public Health,410,3

Designing small molecule inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction is considered as a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. But to date, only a few compounds have been reported as SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction inhibitors. In this study, we described the virtual screening and experimental validation of two novel inhibitors (DC-RA016 and DC-RA052) against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction. The NanoBiT assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays demonstrated their capabilities of blocking SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction and directly binding to both S-RBD and ACE2. Moreover, the pseudovirus assay revealed that these two compounds possessed significant antiviral activity (about 50% inhibition rate at maximum non-cytotoxic concentration). These results indicate that the compounds DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 are promising inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction and deserve to be further developed.","Xiong, Jiacheng; Xiang, Yusen; Huang, Ziming; Liu, Xiaohong; Wang, Mengge; Ge, Guangbo; Chen, Hongzhuan; Xu, Jianrong; Zheng, Mingyue; Chen, Lili",Front Chem,410,27

We investigated sexual behaviour, use and need for sexual healthcare during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants (N=2018), including men (cis/transgender), transwomen and gender-diverse people reporting sex with another man (cis/transgender) or non-binary person assigned male at birth, completed an online cross-sectional survey (23 June 2020–14 July 2020), in response to adverts on social media and dating apps. Sexual behaviour, service use and unmet need for STI testing (any new male and/or multiple condomless anal sex (CAS) partners without STI testing) in the 3 months since lockdown began were examined and compared using multivariable analyses with an equivalent 3-month period in a 2017 survey (N=1918), conducted by the same research team. RESULTS: Since lockdown began, 36.7% of participants reported one or more new partners, 17.3% reported CAS with multiple partners, 29.7% HIV testing (among 1815 of unknown/negative status), 24.9% STI testing and 15.4% using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Since lockdown began, 25.3% of participants had unmet need for STI testing. This was more likely among Asian versus white participants (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.76, (1.14 to 2.72), p=0.01); for participants living in Scotland (aOR=2.02, (1.40 to 2.91), p<0.001) or Northern Ireland (aOR=1.93, (1.02–3.63), p=0.04) versus England; and for those living with HIV (aOR=1.83, (1.32 to 2.53), p<0.001). Compared to 2017, the equivalent 2020 subsample were less likely to report new male partners (46.8% vs 71.1%, p<0.001), multiple CAS partners (20.3% vs 30.8%, p<0.001) and have unmet need for STI testing (32.8% vs 42.5%, p<0.001) in the past 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: We found potential for ongoing STI/HIV transmission among men who have sex with men during the initial UK lockdown, despite reduced sexual activity, and inequalities in service access. These findings will support public health planning to mitigate health risks during and after the COVID-19 response.","Howarth, Alison R; Saunders, John; Reid, David; Kelly, Isabelle; Wayal, Sonali; Weatherburn, Peter; Hughes, Gwenda; Mercer, Catherine H",Sex Transm Infect,410,21

Mortality recorded among severe-critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) has been significantly high, especially in most COVID-19 epicenters. Reports on the unique clinical characteristics and outcomes from the ICU admissions are on-going with isolated studies in Africa. This study was a retrospective single-centre study involving all polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of the department of medicine and therapeutics, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, over the period of 13(th) April - 28(th) June 2020. Twenty-two (22) patients in total fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Patients' socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory parameters outcomes as well as treatment modalities employed were extracted from their respective medical records and analyzed using STATA version 14. Dyspnoea, fever and cough were most common associated symptoms. The mean duration of admission at the ICU was 4.1 ± 3.0 days with five deaths (22.7%). About 91% (20/22) had at least one comorbidity with hypertension as the most prevalent. The median oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO(2)/FiO(2)) level was significantly higher in persons with only COVID-19 pneumonia compared to those with complicated respiratory failure (p<0.001). Six (27.3%) out of the 22 patients had non-invasive ventilation, with only 1/22 (4.5%) receiving mechanical ventilation. Although non-significant, the mean duration of ICU stay was relatively shorter in patients who received therapeutic doses of anticoagulation (p=0.32). Duration of treatment with methylprednisolone was significantly associated with patient outcomes (p=0.04) and serum ferritin levels had a tendency to negatively affect outcome (p=0.06). Clearly there are still no specific targeted medications for COVID-19 treatment, except for empirically symptoms-guided treatments and management of mild to critically ill patients.

Using a novel SARS-Cov-2-specific artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC), coupled with a rapid expansion protocol (REP) as practiced in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) therapy, we generate an immune catalytic quantity of Virus Induced Lymphocytes (VIL). Using T cell receptor (TCR)-specific aAPCs carrying co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptide-pentamer complexes, we expand virus-specific VIL derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of convalescent COVID-19 patients up to 1,000-fold. This is achieved in a clinically relevant 7-day vein-to-vein time-course as a potential adoptive cell therapy (ACT) for COVID-19. We also evaluate this approach for other viral pathogens using Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific VIL from donors as a control. Rapidly expanded VIL are enriched in virus antigen-specificity and show an activated, polyfunctional cytokine profile and T effector memory phenotype which may contribute to a robust immune response. Virus-specific T cells can also be delivered allogeneically via MHC-typing and patient human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matching to provide pragmatic treatment in a large-scale therapeutic setting. These data suggest that VIL may represent a novel therapeutic option that warrants further clinical investigation in the armamentarium against COVID-19 and other possible future pandemics.","Sivapalan, Rohan; Liu, Jinyan; Chakraborty, Krishnendu; Arthofer, Elisa; Choudhry, Modassir; Barie, Philip S; Barouch, Dan H; Henley, Tom",bioRxiv,410,16

Furthermore, effective COVID‐19 vaccines were developed in record time, and their rollout worldwide is already making a significant difference, although major challenges remain in terms of equal access. The pandemic has engaged scientists and the public alike, and terms such as seroprevalence, neutralizing antibodies, antibody escape and vaccine certificates have become familiar to a broad community. Here, we review key findings concerning B cell and antibody (Ab) responses to SARS‐CoV‐2, focusing on non‐severe cases and anti‐spike (S) Ab responses in particular, the latter being central to protective immunity induced by infection or vaccination. The emergence of viral variants that have acquired mutations in S acutely highlights the need for continued characterization of both emerging variants and Ab responses against these during the evolving pathogen‐immune system arms race.","Castro Dopico, Xaquin; Ols, Sebastian; Loré, Karin; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B.",J Intern Med,410,17

Therefore, a rapid and accurate method that can reliably detect the D614G mutation will be beneficial. This study aims to analyze the potential use of the two-step Reverse Transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction - high resolution melting analysis (RT-qPCR-HRM) to detect a specific mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. METHODS: Six SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples were synthesized into cDNA and analyzed with the qPCR-HRM method in order to detect the D614G mutation in Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The primers are designed to target the specific Spike region containing the D614G mutation. The qPCR-HRM analysis was conducted simultaneously, and the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 variant was confirmed by conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing methods. RESULTS: The results showed that the melting temperature (T(m)) of the D614 variant was 79.39 ± 0.03 °C, which was slightly lower than the T(m) of the G614 variant (79.62 ± 0.015 °C). The results of the HRM analysis, visualized by the normalized melting curve and the difference curve were able to discriminate the D614 and G614 variant samples. All samples were identified as G614 variants by qPCR-HRM assay, which was subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

We aimed to compare three digital RIDTs and one conventional RIDT. METHODS: We assessed 218 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients between neonates and 90 years old in 2016. Three digital RIDTs were BUDDI, Sofia Influenza A+B Fluorescence Immunoassay, Veritor System Flu A+B assay. One conventional test was the SD Bioline Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1/2009). All test results were compared with those from the Anyplex Flu A/B Typing Real‐time Detection real‐time PCR. The four RIDTs were tested with diluted solutions from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) to compare lower detection limit. Cross‐reactivity of four RIDTs within other respiratory viruses was identified. RESULTS: For influenza A, BUDDI, Sofia, Veritor, and Bioline showed 87.7%, 94.5%, 87.7%, and 72.6% sensitivity, and 100%, 97.7%, 96.5%, and 100% specificity.

The pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia involved excessive immune reaction in the host - a “cytokine storm”, that determined extensive tissue damage associated with coagulation abnormalities. Severity of this disease is associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, pulmonary disease or age. Thrombotic complications are reported during COVID-19 evolution even with prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE In this study, we evaluate hematological and coagulation parameters in order to obtain predictors for an unfavourable evolution of the patient. DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed a prospective study that included all patients admitted in our hospital in Hematology, Pneumology, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Department at Colentina Clinical Hospital during April - July 2020. The study group included 144 patients that were split into ICU and non-ICU patients. All patients were SARS-CoV-2-positive by molecular test. The distribution according to gender was as follows: 67 male with median age: 61 (min 22, max 88) and 77 female with median age: 57 (min 17, max 92). RESULTS Age is an important risk factor for the severity; 50 patients admitted in ICU with median age 67 (min 34, max 92) and 94 non-ICU patients with median age 52.5 (min 17, max 92), p=0.00003. Associated comorbidities were important and were present in both groups. In ICU patients, we obtained lower level of lymphocytes compared with non ICU group median: 1 x 103/L (min 0.04 x 103/L max 3.28 x 103/L) vs 1.57 x 103/L (min 0.39 x 103/L max 23.35 x 103/L), p=0.0001. There are no significant differences between groups for the rest of hematological parameters. The neutrophil/lymphocytes ratio (NLR) is with statistical difference between ICU and non-ICU groups: 2.34 (min 1.06, max 31.90) vs 7.94 (min 2.18, max 90.04), p<0.000001. This indicator seems to be predictor for severe evolution; a high correlation with IL-6 level (r=0.73, p< 0.001) was obtained. NLR in association with IL-6, CRP and ferritin level are important factors in severe evolution of COVID-19 (severe pneumonia-more than 50% of lung evaluated by CT-scan and presence of any complications during COVID-19 evolution), coefficient of determination-R2 =0.69, R2 - adjusted 0.67, p<0.0001). The ICU patients with unfavourable evolution had a higher level of D-Dimers at the admission in hospital compared with ICU patients who were discharged from the hospital (3.42 mg/ml FEU vs 1.09 mg/ml FEU, p=0.01). Patients with thrombosis (stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, thromboembolism) during COVID-19 evolution have higher level of D Dimers compared with patients without thrombotic complications (7.35 mg/ml FEU vs 0.82 mg/ml FEU), p=0.0001. There are no difference for another coagulation tests (APTT, Quick time) or Protein C, Protein S and Antithrombin III level. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that NLR in association with feritin, CRP and IL-6 assessment are important to be evaluated in COVID-19 patient in order to expect a severe evolution of the disease. D- Dimer should be an important parameter to be evaluated for all COVID-19 patients in order to identify COVID-19 patients with high risk of thrombotic complications.

For this reason, COVID-19 vaccine administration in pregnancy has been endorsed by multiple professional societies including ACOG and SMFM despite exclusion of pregnant women from initial clinical trials of vaccine safety and efficacy. However, to date little data exists regarding outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant patients. Study Design: A comprehensive vaccine registry was combined with a delivery database for an integrated healthcare system to create a delivery cohort including vaccinated patients. Maternal sociodemographic data were examined univariately for factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Pregnancy and birth outcomes were analyzed, including a composite measure of maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications, the Adverse Outcome Index. Results: Of 2002 patients in the delivery cohort, 140 (7.0%) received a COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and 212 (10.6%) experienced a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. The median gestational age at first vaccination was 32 weeks (range 13 6/7-40 4/7), and patients vaccinated during pregnancy were less likely than unvaccinated patients to experience COVID-19 infection prior to delivery (1.4% (2/140) vs. 11.3% (210/1862)) P<0.001No maternal COVID-19 infections occurred after vaccination during pregnancy. Factors significantly associated with increased likelihood of vaccination included older age, higher level of maternal education, lower pre-pregnancy BMI, and use of infertility treatment for the current pregnancy. Tobacco or other substance use, Hispanic ethnicity, and higher gravidity were associated with a lower likelihood of vaccination. No significant difference in the composite adverse outcome (5.0% (7/140) vs. 4.9% (91/1862) P=0.95) or other maternal or neonatal complications, including thromboembolic events and preterm birth, was observed in vaccinated mothers compared to unvaccinated patients. Conclusions: Vaccinated pregnant women in this birth cohort were less likely to experience COVID-19 infection compared to unvaccinated pregnant patients, and COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased pregnancy or delivery complications. Significant sociodemographic disparities in vaccine uptake and/or access were observed among pregnant patients, and future efforts should focus on outreach to low-uptake populations.","Theiler, R.

BACKGROUND: Given the high incidence of coronavirus and shortage of nurses in Iranian hospitals, learning about nurses’ intention to care for patients with COVID‐19 is important. DESIGN: In this cross‐sectional study, 648 Iranian nurses were surveyed during March 2020. The online questionnaire consisted of two parts. The mediating role was explored for the following: job satisfaction and commitment in the association of workload, quality of supervisor, extra‐role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care. The study adhered to STROBE checklist for cross‐sectional studies. RESULTS: The results of this study show that job satisfaction and organisational commitment mediated the relationship of nurses’ workload, quality of supervisor, extra‐role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care for patients with COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate the importance of job satisfaction and organisational commitment as mechanisms that help to understand the association of nurses’ workload, quality of supervisor, extra‐role behaviours and pay satisfaction with the intention to care during the COVID‐19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Hospital managers need to attend to the role of nurses’ job satisfaction and other organisational factors to ensure that they can cope with the challenges of the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Sharif Nia, Hamid; Arslan, Gökmen; Naghavi, Navaz; Sivarajan Froelicher, Erika; Kaveh, Omolhoda; Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed; Rahmatpour, Pardis",J Clin Nurs,410,6

We asked whether mobility restrictions were associated with changes in the occurrence of COVID-19 in 34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan. Our data sources were the Google Global Mobility Data Source, which reports different types of mobility, and COVID-19 cases retrieved from the dataset curated by Our World in Data. Beginning at each country’s 100th case, and incorporating a 14-day lag to account for the delay between exposure and illness, we examined the association between changes in mobility (with January 3 to February 6, 2020 as baseline) and the ratio of the number of newly confirmed cases on a given day to the total number of cases over the past 14 days from the index day (the potentially infective ‘pool’ in that population), per million population, using LOESS regression and logit regression. In two-thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased cases, especially early in the pandemic. Once both mobility and incidence had been brought down, further restrictions provided little additional benefit. These findings point to the importance of acting early and decisively in a pandemic.","Oh, Juhwan; Lee, Hwa-Young; Khuong, Quynh Long; Markuns, Jeffrey F.; Bullen, Chris; Barrios, Osvaldo Enrique Artaza; Hwang, Seung-sik; Suh, Young Sahng; McCool, Judith; Kachur, S.

In the present study, the influence of the administration of rFeIFN on blood markers of inflammation (α-globulins, α(1)-acid glycoprotein) and immune system activation (γ-globulins, IgG, IgM, specific anti-feline parvovirus IgG or IgM) was evaluated in a cattery developing an outbreak of feline panleukopenia due to feline parvovirus (FPV) infection few days after initial administration of rFeIFN. Kittens (n = 23) were injected with rFeIFN (1 MU/kg subcutaneoulsy, once a day for 3 days) and their blood parameters were compared with those of 17 untreated cats. Cats that survived the outbreak were vaccinated and re-sampled 1 month after the last rFeIFN administration. Time of emergence of clinical signs and survival rate were not significantly different between the two groups. Controls and treated cats surviving the infection had high levels of γ-globulins, total- and anti-FPV specific IgGs, likely due to passive transfer of maternal immunity. Compared to controls, treated kittens had lower levels of α(1)-globulins and higher mean values of γ-globulins and immunoglobulins. Data from samples collected after vaccination revealed a higher level of γ-globulins, total- and anti-FPV specific IgGs in treated kittens, compared with controls, suggesting that rFeIFN stimulates antibody production. Based on this results, rFeIFN should be administered to the queen, to increase passive maternal immunity, or to kittens before introduction in a potentially contaminated environment.","Paltrinieri, Saverio; Crippa, Alessia; Comerio, Teodora; Angioletti, Andrea; Roccabianca, Paola",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,410,1

Consequently, there is a demand for developing outpatient control procedures which cater to the needs of the individual patient. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare a patient-controlled outpatient follow-up system, Open Outpatient Clinic Programme (OOCP), with traditional scheduled routine follow-up (TSRF) regarding patient satisfaction and disease activity markers in RA patients. METHOD: In a 2-year randomized controlled trial, RA patients were allocated to OOCP or TSRF. OOCP patients had no scheduled appointments but were allowed acute appointments with their rheumatologist and had access to nurse-led consultations and a telephone helpline. Appointments for the TSRF group were scheduled according to routine procedures (clinical parameters: DAS-28, C-reactive protein, VAS pain, tender and swollen joint count, HAQ-DI and radiographs; psychological parameters: VAS patient satisfaction and EQ-5D). RESULTS: Of 282 patients, 239 completed the study (OOCP/TSRF characteristics: age 61.4 ± 10.5/60.9 ± 12.2 years, females 77/74%, ACPA positive 66/65%). At years 1 and 2, OCCP had fewer visits (year 2: 2.6 ± 1.6 vs. 3.5 ± 2; p < 0.0005) but more phone calls (year 2: 0.7 ± 1.4 vs. 0.1 ± 0.3; p < 0.0005) compared to TSRF. OOCP was comparable to TSRF regarding clinical and psychological outcome measures, and no radiographic progression was observed. CONCLUSIONS: OOCP was associated with significantly fewer visits but with more phone calls to the nurse and was comparable with TSGentofte University HospitalRF regarding clinical, psychological and radiographic outcomes. Thus, the organization of outpatient care according to OOCP may be applied to strengthen patient-centred care in patients with RA.

This study sought to assess the usage of cloth face masks in grades pre‐K‐2 and identify associated characteristics and adverse events. It is the first data to assess mask wearing by young children in school. METHODS: This online, prospective, observational, survey in multiple schools within a single school district in a major metropolitan area measured adherence to face covering mandates by students in grades pre‐K‐2 as measured by percentage of day with appropriate face mask wearing per report via daily teacher surveys for the first 4 weeks of school. RESULTS: The primary outcome was percent of the day that the entire class was wearing their masks appropriately. Of the estimated almost 1000 students and 1048 classroom days reported, the mean percentage of the school day with appropriate mask usage was 76.9%. CONCLUSIONS: For a majority of the day while conducting in‐person instruction, children in grades pre‐K‐2 are able to adhere to mask wearing as a key mitigation strategy for limiting SARS‐CoV2 infection spread and possible future use.","Mickells, Geoffrey E.; Figueroa, Janet; West, Kelly Withers; Wood, Anna; McElhanon, Barbara O.",J Sch Health,410,26

We modelled the impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) out to 2030/2031 of reductions in PCV13 coverage and population mixing associated with restrictions on non-essential healthcare visits and social distancing measures introduced in 2020/2021 to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. DESIGN: Using an existing model of pneumococcal transmission in England and Wales, we simulated the impact of a 40% reduction in coverage and a 40% reduction in mixing between and within age groups during two lockdowns in spring 2020 and autumn/winter 2020/2021. More and less extreme reductions in coverage and mixing were explored in a sensitivity analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predicted annual numbers of IPD cases under different coverage and mixing reduction scenarios with uncertainty intervals (UIs) generated from minimum and maximum values of the model predictions using 500 parameter sets. RESULTS: The model predicted that any increase in IPD cases resulting from a reduction in PCV13 coverage would be more than offset by a reduction in pneumococcal transmission due to social distancing measures and that overall reductions in IPD cases will persist for a few years after resumption of normal mixing. The net reduction in cumulative IPD cases over the five epidemiological years from July 2019 was predicted to be 13 494 (UI 12 211, 14 676) all ages. Similar results were obtained in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdowns are predicted to have had a profound effect on pneumococcal transmission resulting in a reduction in pneumococcal carriage prevalence and IPD incidence for up to 5 years after the end of the lockdown period. Carriage studies will be informative in confirming the predicted impact of the lockdown measures after they have been lifted.","Choi, Yoon Hong; Miller, Elizabeth",BMJ Open,410,23

Currently, however, no effective drug or vaccine is available to treat or prevent the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we report our discovery of a promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate, the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic dalbavancin, based on virtual screening of the FDA-approved peptide drug library combined with in vitro and in vivo functional antiviral assays. Our results showed that dalbavancin directly binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with high affinity, thereby blocking its interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, dalbavancin effectively prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC(50) of ~12 nM. In both mouse and rhesus macaque models, viral replication and histopathological injuries caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are significantly inhibited by dalbavancin administration. Given its high safety and long plasma half-life (8–10 days) shown in previous clinical trials, our data indicate that dalbavancin is a promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate.","Wang, Gan; Yang, Meng-Li; Duan, Zi-Lei; Liu, Feng-Liang; Jin, Lin; Long, Cheng-Bo; Zhang, Min; Tang, Xiao-Peng; Xu, Ling; Li, Ying-Chang; Kamau, Peter Muiruri; Yang, Lian; Liu, Hong-Qi; Xu, Jing-Wen; Chen, Jie-Kai; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Peng, Xiao-Zhong; Lai, Ren",Cell Res,410,24

The envelope protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has been retrieved from the NCBI database. The bioinformatics analysis was carried out by using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to predict B- and T-cell epitopes. The predicted HTL and CTL epitopes were docked with HLA alleles and binding energies were evaluated. The allergenicity of predicted epitopes was analyzed, the conservancy analysis was performed, and the population coverage was determined throughout the world. Some overlapped CTL, HTL, and B-cell epitopes were suggested to become a universal candidate for peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19. This vaccine peptide could simultaneously elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. We hope to confirm our findings by adding complementary steps of both in vitro and in vivo studies to support this new universal predicted candidate.","Jakhar, Renu; Gakhar, S.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to report the associated symptoms for COVID-19 cases, to estimate the proportion of contacts, and to describe the clinical signs and behaviors among individuals with and without myocardial infarction history among cases and contacts. METHODS: A 2-week cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted during the first lockdown period in France, from May 4 to 15, 2020. A total of 668 households participated, representing 703 individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in the past 2 years and 849 individuals without myocardial infarction history. RESULTS: High rates of compliance with health measures were self-reported, regardless of age or risk factors. There were 4 confirmed COVID-19 cases that were registered from 4 different households. Based on deductive assumptions of the 1552 individuals, 9.73% (n=151) were identified as contacts, of whom 71.52% (108/151) were asymptomatic. Among individuals with a myocardial infarction history, 2 were COVID-19 cases, and the estimated proportion of contacts was 8.68% (61/703), of whom 68.85% (42/61) were asymptomatic. The cases and contacts presented different symptoms, with more respiratory signs in those with a myocardial infarction history.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to assess the extent to which interest in gun preparation has increased amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic using data from Google searches related to purchasing and cleaning guns. METHODS: We fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model over Google search data from January 2004 up to the week that US President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency. We used this model to forecast Google search volumes, creating a counterfactual of the number of gun preparation searches we would expect if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred, and reported observed deviations from this counterfactual. RESULTS: Google searches related to preparing guns have surged to unprecedented levels, approximately 40% higher than previously reported spikes following the Sandy Hook, CT and Parkland, FL shootings and 158% (95% CI 73-270) greater than would be expected if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred. In absolute terms, approximately 2.1 million searches related to gun preparation were performed over just 34 days. States severely affected by COVID-19 appear to have some of the greatest increases in the number of searches.

HPAI H5N8 viruses have been circulating in Egyptian poultry flocks since 2016. In this study, 74 commercial chicken farms tested positive for HPAI H5N8 virus. Genetic characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) of Egyptian HPAI H5N8 viruses showed a relationship with those recently isolated in Europe. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of subtype H5N8 continue to circulate, causing huge economic losses and serious impact on poultry production worldwide. Recently, HPAIV H5N8 has been spreading rapidly, and a large number of HPAI H5N8 outbreaks have been reported in Eurasia 2020–2021. In this study, we conducted an epidemiological survey of HPAI H5N8 virus at different geographical locations in Egypt from 2017 to 2019. This was followed by genetic and pathogenic studies. Our findings highlight the wide spread of HPAI H5N8 viruses in Egypt, including in 22 governorates. The genetic analyses of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments emphasized a phylogenetic relatedness between the Egyptian HPAI H5N8 viruses and viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b recently isolated in Europe. These findings suggest that a potential back transmission of Egyptian HPAI H5N8 virus has occurred from domestic poultry in Egypt to migratory wild birds, followed by further spread to different countries. This highlights the importance of continuous epidemiological and genetic studies of AIVs at the domestic–wild bird interface.

However, it is important to rule out other etiologies of hyponatremia in such cases keeping in mind the effect of an alternate etiology on patient management and outcome. We present a case of hypovolemic hyponatremia in a patient with COVID-19, which unlike SIADH, required fluid replacement early in the disease course for its correction. A 52-year-old Filipino gentleman presented with a three-week history of diarrhea and symptomatic hyponatremia. There was no history of fever or respiratory symptoms. Physical examination revealed a dehydrated and confused middle-aged gentleman. Labs revealed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and severe hyponatremia (108 mmol/L). Blood cultures and stool workup were negative. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Hyponatremia workup excluded SIADH. The patient had hypovolemic hyponatremia due to gastrointestinal (GI) losses and was managed with saline infusion for correction of hyponatremia with improvement in his clinical status. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 is not only secondary to SIADH but can also be due to other etiologies. Hypovolemic hyponatremia should be distinguished from SIADH as these conditions employ different management strategies, and early diagnosis and management of hypovolemic hyponatremia affects morbidity and mortality.","Khan, Adeel A; Ata, Fateen; Munir, Waqar; Yousaf, Zohaib",Cureus,410,1

Moreover, in Italy, the government banned all non-essential travel across the entire country from the beginning of March. Consequently, Italian cyclists were banned from leaving their homes and therefore unable to perform their ordinary training activities. The Italian Association of Professional Cyclists (ACCPI) early on during that period noticed that several cyclists were experiencing a worrying decrease in their mental well-being and asked the authors to set up an online Sport Psychology Intervention (SPI) during lockdown to enhance the athletes' mental health. Through a number of unprecedented events and considerations, the aim of the current investigation was to assess the Italian cyclists' mental health during the lockdown and its changes after the SPI. We validated the Italian version of the Sport Mental Health Continuum Short Form (Sport MHC-SF)—presented in Study 1—and then applied it to a sample of Italian professional cyclists—presented in Study 2—prior to and after the SPI. To achieve these objectives, the reliability and construct validity of the Italian version of the Sport MHC-SF were tested in Study 1. RM-MANOVA tests were run to evaluate the effect of SPI on cyclists in Study 2. A total of 185 Italian athletes were involved in the validation of the MHC in Study 1 and 38 professional cyclists in Study 2. Results from Study 1 suggested a three-factor higher order model of Sport MHC-SF [Model fit: χ(2)(df) = 471.252 (252), p < 0.000; CFI = 0.951; RMSEA = 0.049; RMR= 0.048]. MCFA showed that the default model kept invariance among groups of athletes (i.e., female, male, individual, and team sports). Results from Study 2 highlighted that professional cyclists who followed the SPI were able to cope better with psychological stressors, showing improved well-being compared to the athletes that did not. No significant differences were found for emotional and social well-being. The present multi-study paper contributes to the theoretical field with a validated measure of Sport MHC-SF translated in the Italian language and culture. It also provides practical implications related to cases of reduced mental health due to injury, illness, or similar situations of home confinement in the future.","Bertollo, Maurizio; Forzini, Fabio; Biondi, Sara; Di Liborio, Massimiliano; Vaccaro, Maria Grazia; Georgiadis, Emmanouil; Conti, Cristiana",Front Psychol,410,24

Design Cross-sectional study Setting and Participants 59,930 nursing home staff tested for active SARS-CoV-2 infection in Indiana. Measures Receiver operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC) to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying positive cases of staff within facilities based on community COVID-19 activity level including county positivity rate and county cases per 10,000. Results The detection of any infected staff within a facility using county cases per 10,000 population or county positivity rate resulted in an AUC of 0.648 (95% CI 0.601-0.696) and 0.649 (95% CI 0.601-0.696), respectively. Of staff tested, 28.0% were certified nursing assistants (CNAs), yet accounted for 36.9% of all staff testing positive. Similarly, licensed practical nurses (LPNs) were 1.4% of staff, but 4.7% of positive cases. Conclusions and Implications We failed to observe a meaningful threshold of community COVID-19 activity for the purpose of predicting nursing homes with any positive staff. Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in August 2020 sets the minimum frequency of routine testing for nursing home staff based on county positivity rates. Using the recommended 5% county positivity rate to require weekly testing may miss asymptomatic infections among nursing home staff. Further data on results of all-staff testing efforts, particularly with the implementation of new widespread strategies such as point-of-care testing, is needed to guide policy to protect high risk nursing home residents and staff. If the goal is to identify all asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infected nursing home staff, comprehensive repeat testing may be needed regardless of community level activity.","Blackburn, Justin; Weaver, Lindsay; Cohen, Liza; Menachemi, Nir; Rusyniak, Dan; Unroe, Kathleen T.",J Am Med Dir Assoc,410,33

In response, the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics remains a clinical priority. To accomplish this, it is necessary to evaluate neutralizing antibodies and screen for MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. METHODS: In this study, we produced a pseudovirus bearing the full-length spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV in the Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 backbone. We then established a pseudovirus-based inhibition assay to detect neutralizing antibodies and anti-MERS-CoV entry inhibitors. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the generated MERS-CoV pseudovirus allows for single-cycle infection of a variety of cells expressing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the confirmed receptor for MERS-CoV. Consistent with the results from a live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay, the antisera of mice vaccinated with a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 377–662) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG exhibited neutralizing antibody response against infection of MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Furthermore, one small molecule HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 (ADS-J1) and the 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (HP-HSA) could significantly inhibit MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the established MERS-CoV inhibition assay is a safe and convenient pseudovirus-based alternative to BSL-3 live-virus restrictions and can be used to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors, as well as evaluate vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies against the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV.","Zhao, Guangyu; Du, Lanying; Ma, Cuiqing; Li, Ye; Li, Lin; Poon, Vincent KM; Wang, Lili; Yu, Fei; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Jiang, Shibo; Zhou, Yusen",Virol J,410,1

The so-called ‘COVID-19 associated coagulopathy’ (CAC) represents a key aspect in the genesis of organ damage from SARS-CoV-2. The main coagulative alterations described in the literature are represented by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen. Although CAC has some common features with disseminated intravascular coagulation and sepsis-induced coagulopathy, there are important differences between these clinical pictures and the phenotype of CAC is unique. The pathogenesis of CAC is complex and is affected by the strong interconnection between the inflammatory system and coagulation, in the phenomenon of immunothrombosis and thrombo-inflammation. Several mechanisms come into play, such as inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, the complement system as well as an alteration of the fibrinolytic system. Finally, an altered platelet function and especially endothelial dysfunction also play a central role in the pathophysiology of CAC. Heparin has several potential effects in CAC, in fact in addition to the anticoagulant effect, it could have a direct antiviral effect and anti-inflammatory properties. The high incidence of thrombo-embolic phenomena despite the use of antithrombotic prophylaxis have led some experts to recommend the use of anticoagulant doses of heparin, but at present the optimal anticoagulant regimen remains to be determined.","Lorini, Ferdinando Luca; Di Matteo, Maria; Gritti, Paolo; Grazioli, Lorenzo; Benigni, Alberto; Zacchetti, Lucia; Bianchi, Isabella; Fabretti, Fabrizio; Longhi, Luca",Eur Heart J Suppl,410,24

Correspondence",17.91784,4.6895313,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has ever-increasing attributed deaths. Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously and remotely, outside of hospital facilities, recognising early clinical deterioration. We aim to determine the feasibility & acceptability of remote monitoring systems for quarantined individuals in a hotel suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: A pilot, proof-of-concept, feasibility trial was conducted in engineered hotels near London airports (May–June 2020). Individuals arriving to London with mild suspected COVID-19 symptoms requiring quarantine, as recommended by Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with COVID-19 symptoms unable to isolate at home were eligible. The SensiumVitals™ patch, measuring temperature, heart & respiratory rates, was applied on arrival for the duration of their stay. Alerts were generated when pre-established thresholds were breeched; trained nursing staff could consequently intervene. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals (M = 7, F = 7) were recruited; the mean age was 34.9 (SD 11) years. Mean length of stay was 3 (SD 1.8) days. In total, 10 vital alerts were generated across 4 participants, resulting in telephone contact, reassurance, or adjustment of the sensor. No individuals required hospitalisation or virtual general practitioner review. DISCUSSION: This proof-of-concept trial demonstrated the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Benefits included reduced viral exposure to healthcare staff, with recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring systems can be applied to hotels to deliver healthcare safely in individuals suspected of COVID-19. Further work is required to evaluate this model on a larger scale.

In this study, we obtained a blood leukocytes sequencing data set of COVID‐19 patients from the GEO database and obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We further analyzed these DEGs by protein–protein interaction analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and identified the DEGs closely related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Then, we constructed a six‐gene model (comprising IFIT3, OASL, USP18, XAF1, IFI27, and EPSTI1) by logistic regression analysis and calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the diagnosis of COVID‐19. The AUC values of the training group, testing group, and entire group were 0.930, 0.914, and 0.921, respectively. The six genes were highly expressed in patients with COVID‐19 and positively correlated with the expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 invasion‐related genes (ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL). The risk score calculated by this model was also positively correlated with the expression of TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL, indicating that the six genes were closely related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In conclusion, we comprehensively analyzed the functions of DEGs in the blood leukocytes of patients with COVID‐19 and constructed a six‐gene model that may contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic ideas for COVID‐19. Moreover, these six genes may be therapeutic targets for COVID‐19.","Gao, Xin; Liu, Yuan; Zou, Shaohui; Liu, Pengqin; Zhao, Jing; Yang, Changshun; Liang, Mingxing; Yang, Jinlian",J Med Virol,410,0

Social distancing will impact the organization of outpatient clinics (OCs) and require general restructuring of health care. METHODS: Our retinal team participated in a structured fact-finding session to implement social distancing of patients and staff in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) clinics. Clinic flow and performance were continually reviewed and improved. A retrospective audit of all wAMD follow-up appointments was conducted for 4 weeks from the start of the UK lockdown. A search for clinical guidance regarding retinal services was performed on the homepages of international professional bodies. The guidelines were compared to the implemented changes in our wAMD social distancing OCs (SDOCs) and potential risk examined. RESULTS: The changes in clinic setup to achieve SDOCs are described. The average total time spent in the clinic area by each patient has reduced by 27%. The audit concluded that 65% of patients needed a treatment interval of 4–7 weeks after their appointment, 17% at either 8 or 9 weeks, and 18% at 10 weeks or beyond. The UK, Australian–New Zealand, US, and German professional ophthalmology bodies have published divergent guidelines, but all recommended a continuation of anti-VEGF injections. CONCLUSION: Health-care provision will change and hospitals and outpatient facilities will have to adapt to the COVID-19 epidemic.

Objective: To compare antibody detection in dried blood spot eluates using the Roche Elecsys immunoassay (index test) with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay (reference test). Setting: One Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England. Participants: 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME. Outcome Measures: Sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population. Results: 18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using a cut-off of ten median absolute deviations above the immunoassay result with negative samples, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma. Conclusion: DBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance.

We collect the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates in Europe, spanning 114 subnational areas in 7 countries, with a systematic categorisation of interventions tailored to the second wave. Using a hierarchical Bayesian transmission model, we estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs from local case and death data. We manually validate the data, address limitations in modelling from previous studies, and extensively test the robustness of our estimates. The combined effect of all NPIs was smaller relative to estimates from the first half of 2020, indicating the strong influence of safety measures and individual protective behaviours--such as distancing--that persisted after the first wave. Closing specific businesses was highly effective. Gathering restrictions were highly effective but only for the strictest limits. We find smaller effects for closing educational institutions compared to the first wave, suggesting that safer operation of schools was possible with a set of stringent safety measures including testing and tracing, preventing mixing, and smaller classes. These results underscore that effectiveness estimates from the early stage of an epidemic are measured relative to pre-pandemic behaviour.

The concern is that these legislators traded in anticipation of COVID-19 having a major impact on the financial markets, while publicly suggesting otherwise. We consider whether these legislator trades were in a time window, and of a nature, that would be consistent with trading ahead of the market. Towards this end, we assess the reactions of US industries to sudden COVID-related news announcements, concomitantly with an analysis of levels of investor attention to COVID. Results suggest that, at an industry-level, for legislator trading to be “ahead of the market” it needed to have been done prior to February 26, and involving the 15 industries we identify as having abnormal returns, especially medical and pharmaceutical products (positive); restaurants, hotels, and motels (negative); as well as services and utilities. These criteria are met by many of the legislator trades.

To clarify the chemical characterization of chiral glucosinolates—the antiviral active ingredients of Radix Isatidis, an optimized efficient method of HPLC-UV-CD was developed to simultaneously separate and quantify the four main chiral glucosinolates: progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin. The first step was to determine progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin using HPLC-UV, and then determine the R-goitrin and S-goitrin by coupling with CD detection. Subsequently, through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g factor) and the percent optical purity of R-goitrin, the contents of R-goitrin and S-goitrin from the R,S-goitrin mixture were calculated separately. Furthermore, the chemical composition features of the four chiral glucosinolates in 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis were conducted. The total content of the four glucosinolates was obviously higher in crude drugs, and the variance character of each glucosinolate contents was different. In summary, the accurate measurement method reported here allows for better control of the internal quality of R. Isatidis and its granules and provides a powerful approach for the analysis of other chiral components in traditional Chinese medicines.","Shi, Yanhong; Zheng, Cheng; Li, Jinhang; Yang, Li; Wang, Zhengtao; Wang, Rui",Molecules,410,24

Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, also called a cytokine storm. The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine which drives the cytokine storm and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. 9 case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for a qualitative synthesis. In all of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ versus the SOC and a combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.482 (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.326-0.713). Additionally, 12 uncontrolled trials were identified for a qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 13.6%. Results from the systematic analysis provide positive evidence for the potential efficacy of TCZ, validating the merit and need for ongoing clinical trials of the drug to treat severe COVID-19.","Kaye, A.

However, cancer patients were excluded from clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccinations, and thus the data on the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients are limited. In this systematic review, we assessed the seroconversion rate and the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations in cancer patients. We searched a bibliographic database up until 31 July 2021. Utilizing inclusion criteria, six studies were selected and analyzed for this meta-analysis. This included 621 cancer patients and 256 controls. Results show that patients with solid tumors show adequate antibody responses (>90%), though the antibody titers were significantly lower than those of healthy controls. Similarly, a significantly lower rate of seroconversion was registered in patients with hematologic malignances. The vaccines showed a good safety profile; no grade 3–4 adverse events were registered. This review demonstrates generally high immunogenicity from COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer, with better results for solid tumors than hematological malignances, and with a good safety profile.","Cavanna, Luigi; Citterio, Chiara; Toscani, Ilaria",Vaccines (Basel),410,24

The identification of high-risk patients is a continuing challenge in routine care. We aimed to identify factors that influence clinical worsening. We analyzed 52 cell populations, 71 analytes, and RNA-seq gene expression in the blood of severe patients from the French COVID-19 study upon hospitalization (n = 61). COVID-19 patients showed severe abnormalities of 27 cell populations relative to healthy donors (HDs). Forty-two cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components were elevated in COVID-19 patients. Supervised gene expression analyses showed differential expression of genes for neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, T- and B-cell receptors, EIF2 signaling, and ICOS-ICOSL pathways in COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised analysis confirmed the prominent role of neutrophil activation, with a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker. CD177 was the most highly differentially-expressed gene contributing to the clustering of severe patients and its abundance correlated with CD177 protein serum levels. CD177 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients from both the French and confirmatory Swiss cohort (n = 203) than in HDs (P< 0.01) and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P< 0.001), correlating with the time to symptoms onset (P = 0.002). Longitudinal measurements showed sustained levels of serum CD177 to discriminate between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01). These results highlight neutrophil activation as a hallmark of severe disease and CD177 assessment as a reliable prognostic marker for routine care.","Levy, Y.; Wiedemann, A.; Hejblum, B.

A recently published international standard indicates that regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi provide accurate estimates of core body temperature and are preferred sites for fever screening. Therefore, rapid, automated identification of the canthi regions within facial IR images may greatly facilitate rapid fever screening of asymptomatic travelers. However, it is more difficult to accurately identify the canthi regions from IR images than from visible images that are rich with exploitable features. In this study, we developed and evaluated techniques for multi-modality image registration (MMIR) of simultaneously captured visible and IR facial images for fever screening. We used free form deformation (FFD) models based on edge maps to improve registration accuracy after an affine transformation. Two widely used FFD models in medical image registration based on the Demons and cubic B-spline algorithms were qualitatively compared. The results showed that the Demons algorithm outperformed the cubic B-spline algorithm, likely due to overfitting of outliers by the latter method. The quantitative measure of registration accuracy, obtained through selected control point correspondence, was within 2.8 ± 1.2 mm, which enables accurate and automatic localization of canthi regions in the IR images for temperature measurement.","Dwith Chenna, Yedukondala Narendra; Ghassemi, Pejhman; Pfefer, T.

A case-control study was carried out in the 2016 spring calving season. A total of 194 bobby calves, comprising 38 cases (calves that died or were condemned for health or welfare reasons before the point of slaughter) and 156 controls (calves deemed acceptable and presented for slaughter) were included in the study. Case and control calves were selected by veterinarians located at 29 processing premises across New Zealand. Information regarding management of selected calves on-farm, during transport and at the processor was obtained retrospectively via questionnaires administered to supplying farmers, transport operators and processing premises personnel. Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origin’s calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farm’s calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealand’s pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farm’s calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season. This requires further investigation.","Boulton, Alana C.; Kells, Nikki J; Cogger, Naomi; Johnson, Craig B.; O’Connor, Cheryl; Webster, Jim; Palmer, Anna; Beausoleil, Ngaio J.",Prev Vet Med,410,10

Immunofluorescence showed that all cells became infected at a multiplicity of 10 PFU/cell. The virus was concentrated and purified to obtain the high titered stocks needed for these one-step growth experiments. Release of virus into the culture medium started 4 hr after infection (pi) and was complete at 10 hr pi. Synthesis of virus-specific RNA, measured by the incorporation of [3H]uridine in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, also started at 4 hr pi and its maximum rate occurred between 6 and 8 hr pi. RNA labeled during this period was isolated from infected cells. About 50% of this RNA bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured with glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Seven RNA species with the following molecular weights were present: 5.6 × 106 (RNA1), 4.0 × 106 (RNA2), 3.0 × 106 (RNA3), 1.4 × 106 (RNA4), 1.2 × 106 (RNA5), 0.9 × 106 (RNA6), and 0.6 × 106 (RNA7). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. To determine whether these RNA species were functional as messengers in infected cells, virus-specific RNAs present in polyribosomes were analyzed. EDTA treatment was used to discriminate between RNA present in polyribosomes and in EDTA-resistant, presumably ribonucleoprotein, particles. Most (91%) of RNA1 was present in EDTA-resistant particles; the remainder and all other RNAs synthesized between 6 and 8 hr pi were present in polyribosomes. We conclude that MHV-A59 has six subgenomic mRNAs. Since the total molecular mass (11.1 × 106 daltons) of these messengers is about twice that of the viral genome, sequence homologies must exist between the mRNAs. The position of these homologous regions and the translation products of each of the mRNAs remain to be determined.","Spaan, Willy J.M.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Horzinek, Marian C.; Van Der Zeijst, Bernard A.M.",Virology,410,30

The aim of this study was to delve into health professionals’ job satisfaction by assessing the predictive role of happiness and meaning at work. Specifically, it was hypothesized that job meaning would moderate the relationship between job happiness and satisfaction. METHODS: The study hypothesis was tested among 108 healthcare professionals (53 physicians and 55 nurses) working in eight MS centers in Italy. Participants were administered the Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation and the Job Satisfaction Questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to test the moderating role of job meaning between job happiness and satisfaction. RESULTS: A significant interaction effect of job happiness and meaning on job satisfaction was identified for both physicians and nurses. When work was attributed low meaning, participants experiencing high job happiness were more satisfied with their work than those reporting low happiness; by contrast, when work was perceived as highly meaningful, participants’ levels of job happiness did not significantly contribute to job satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on the interplay between job happiness and meaning, findings bring forward practical suggestions for the preservation and promotion of job satisfaction among health professionals working with MS patients. Particularly, they suggest the need to strengthen those job-related aspects that may enhance job meaning, thus providing health professionals with significant reasons to persevere in their work in the face of daily challenges.","Negri, Luca; Cilia, Sabina; Falautano, Monica; Grobberio, Monica; Niccolai, Claudia; Pattini, Marianna; Pietrolongo, Erika; Quartuccio, Maria Esmeralda; Viterbo, Rosa Gemma; Allegri, Beatrice; Amato, Maria Pia; Benin, Miriam; De Luca, Giovanna; Gasperini, Claudio; Minacapelli, Eleonora; Patti, Francesco; Trojano, Maria; Bassi, Marta",Neurol Sci,410,22

Isolated gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon presenting features in adults with COVID-19 myocarditis. The availability of antibody testing is a valuable addition to the confirmation of COVID-19, when repeated reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs are negative. CASE SUMMARY: A young healthcare worker presented with dizziness and pre-syncope, 4 weeks after his original symptoms that included fever, lethargy, and diarrhoea. Despite 2 weeks of isolation, followed by a quiescent spell, his symptoms had returned. Shortly after, he presented in cardiogenic shock (left ventricular ejection fraction 25%), that required vasopressor support, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging suggested florid myocarditis. Three nasopharyngeal swabs (Days 1, 3, and 5) were negative for SARS-CoV-2, but subsequent serology (Day 13) confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

We calculated who would receive shielding advice using the British Society for Rheumatology’s risk stratification guidance and accompanying scoring grid, and assessed whether ethnicity and history of nephritis were over-represented in the shielding group. RESULTS: The audit included 1003 patients from 51 centres across all 4 nations of the UK. Overall 344 (34.3%) patients had a shielding score ≥3 and would have been advised to shield.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of pediatric patients with asthma and healthy children without chronic disease who infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a retrospective, case-control study comparing the asthma diagnosed and healthy children who were diagnosed as COVID-19 in our hospital between March 11 and November 10, 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 6,205 children were diagnosed with CO­VID-19 in our hospital. Only 54 (0.87%) patients had a diagnosis of asthma. The mean of the age was 10.5 years and 53.7% (n:29) of the patients with asthma were male. Cough, shortness of breath, emesis, and diarrhea were found to be significantly higher in asthma group than in the control group (respectively p = 0.002, 0.000, 0.002, 0.019, 0.015). Patients who were given SABA was significantly higher in asthma diagnosed patients (p = 0.000). Hospitalization was significantly higher in asthma group (p = 0.025), and the duration of hospitalization was significantly higher in control group (p = 0.034). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of requiring oxygen treatment and in laboratory findings between groups. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that pediatric patients diagnosed with asthma were in a mild clinic. According to these findings, asthma may not affect the course of the COVID-19 in children.","Metbulut, Azize Pınar; Mustafaoğlu, Özlem; Şen, Gülşah; Kanık Yüksek, Saliha; Külhaş Çelik, İlknur; Akça, Halise; Dibek Mısırlıoğlu, Emine",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,410,12

Based on this, our objective is to systematically retrieve and summarize the clinical studies on Baduanjin, with a view to providing more evidence-based evidence in support of the application of Baduanjin for healthcare, and to identify the shortcomings of existing research and provide feasibility suggest for further clinical research. Both four English language and four Chinese language electronic databases were used to search articles related to Baduanjin during 2000–2019. SPSS 22.0 software was used to analyze the data, and the risk of bias tool in the RevMan 5.3.5 software was used to evaluate the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials. A total of 810 publications were identified, including 43 (5.3%) systematic reviews, 614 (75.8%) randomized controlled trials, 66 (8.1%) nonrandomized controlled clinical studies, 84 (10.4%) case series, and 3 (0.4%) case reports.

It is also worth noting that there were no serious adverse events related to Baduanjin intervention. Most studies were small sample size research, and the methodological quality of randomized controlled trials is generally low. The clinical studies of Baduanjin have a substantial quantity and evidence base. However, there are significant differences among different studies in the specific intervention measures such as style, intensity, duration, learning, and practice methods, which need to be further standardized and unified. Further high-quality designed and reporting studies are recommended to further validate the clinical benefits of Baduanjin.","Zhou, Jing; Yu, Yunyang; Cao, Biwei; Li, Xiaoya; Wu, Miao; Wen, Tao; Xiong, Yuan; Jia, Jian; Zhao, Yan",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,410,23

Metagenomic approaches are increasingly used in the detection of novel viral pathogens but also to generate complete genomes of uncultivated viruses. In silico identification of complete viral genomes from sequence data would allow rapid phylogenetic characterization of these new viruses. Often, however, complete viral genomes are not recovered, but rather several distinct contigs derived from a single entity are, some of which have no sequence homology to any known proteins. De novo assembly of single viruses from a metagenome is challenging, not only because of the lack of a reference genome, but also because of intrapopulation variation and uneven or insufficient coverage. Here we explored different assembly algorithms, remote homology searches, genome-specific sequence motifs, k-mer frequency ranking, and coverage profile binning to detect and obtain viral target genomes from metagenomes. All methods were tested on 454-generated sequencing datasets containing three recently described RNA viruses with a relatively large genome which were divergent to previously known viruses from the viral families Rhabdoviridae and Coronaviridae. Depending on specific characteristics of the target virus and the metagenomic community, different assembly and in silico gap closure strategies were successful in obtaining near complete viral genomes.","Smits, Saskia L.; Bodewes, Rogier; Ruiz-Gonzalez, Aritz; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Koopmans, Marion P.; Osterhaus, Albert D.

Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for deciding the appropriate clinical approach and minimizing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics. Diagnosis of RV is extremely challenging due to genetic and serological variability among its numerous types and their similarity to enteroviruses. Objective: We sought to develop a rapid nucleic acid test that can be used for the detection of Rhinovirus within both laboratory and near patient settings. Study design: We developed and evaluated a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method called Reverse Transcription Strand Invasion-Based Amplification (RT-SIBA) to rapidly detect Rhinovirus from clinical specimens. Result: The method, RT-SIBA, detected RV in clinical specimens with high analytical sensitivity (96%) and specificity (100%). The time to positive result was significantly shorter for the RV RT-SIBA assay than for a reference RV nucleic acid amplification method (RT-qPCR). Conclusion: The rapid detection time of the RV SIBA assay, as well as its compatibility with portable instruments, will facilitate prompt diagnosis of infection and thereby improve patient care.","Kainulainen, Veera; Elf, Sonja; Susi, Petri; Mäki, Minna; Pitkäranta, Anne; Koskinen, Janne O.; Korpela, Riitta; Eboigbodin, Kevin E.",J Virol Methods,410,16

Au SAMU 62, l’une des réponse apportées à la montée en puissance du dispositif de renfort covid au CRAA a été la mise en place d’une ligne de régulation psychiatrique, destinée aux appels à forte valence émotionnelle, qu’ils soient en lien avec l’anxiété relative à l’épidémie, les difficultés d’ajustement en lien avec le confinement, ou la rupture des soins psychiatriques chez les personnes souffrant de troubles mentaux. Cette ligne a été assurée, du 20 mars 2020 au 15 mai 2020, par 15 régulateurs exerçant dans le champ de la santé mentale (psychiatres, psychologues et infirmiers) et volontaires de la cellule d’urgence médico-psychologique du Pas-de-Calais. Sur l’ensemble du dispositif, 556 appels ont été régulés, soit une moyenne de 9,8 appels par jours. La typologie des appels était dans un quart des cas une anxiété en lien avec la crainte d’être infecté, pour le deuxième quart, des difficultés d’ajustement engendrées par le confinement et pour la moitié environ une symptomatologie psychiatrique, qu’elle soit connue et en rupture partielle de suivi du fait de la suspension des soins programmés en psychiatrie, ou précipitée par le contexte. Les bénéfices mis en exergue du dispositif étaient les suivants : la décharge des ARM d’appels souvent chronophages, l’expertise d’un professionnel de santé mentale permettant de fluidifier le parcours du patient en aval et la connaissance des différents secteurs de psychiatrie du département permettant de moduler la réponse apportée à l’appelant. Enfin, il est à noter que la présence du régulateur psychiatrique en salle de régulation a permis un transfert naturel de ces appels, et une acculturation réciproque, appréciée par les professionnels du SAMU. Au vu de la pertinence de la mise en place d’une ligne de régulation psychiatrique dans le contexte épidémique du COVID-19, il semble intéressant d’envisager la pérennisation de ce dispositif, qui s’inscrit dans un contexte global d’évolution de l’offre de soins d’urgences. The epidemic context of COVID 19 and the containment measures, put in place since 16 March 2020, has significantly increased the number of emergencies calls in call center (SAMU). In the department of Pas-de-Calais, one step of the crisis measures was setting up a psychiatric regulation line, which aims to manage calls with strong emotional valence (in connexion with containment, anxiety related to the epidemic context, or break in psychiatric cares for people suffering of mental disorders). This psychiatric hotline was provided from 20 March 2020 to 15 May 2020 by fifteen psychiatric careers (psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric nurses) from the network of the medical-psychological emergency unit (unit of the emergency call center which aims to manage people involved in psychotraumatic events). In total, 556 calls were answered, i.e. an average of 9,8 calls per day. The typology of calls was in a quarter of the cases anxiety related to the fear of being infected, in the second quarter, adjustment disorders related to containment, and for about half of the calls, psychiatrics symptoms whether it was preexisting and increased by the discontinuation of care, or context-induced. The benefits identified by this device were as follows: -the discharge of time-consuming calls for the medical dispatcher assistant, -the expertise of a mental health professional, knowing the mental health network, to make the decision more fluid. Last but not least, it is interesting to note that the presence of the psychiatric regulator in the regulation room allowed a transfer of calls and a reciprocal acculturation. In view of the relevance of the establishment of a psychiatric regulation line in the epidemic context of Covid-19, it seems interesting to consider the sustainability of this system, which is part of a global context of evolution of the provision of emergency care.","Rougegrez, Laure; Dupont, Marine",Ann Med Psychol (Paris),410,1

It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. RESULTS: The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test. CONCLUSION: In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.","Gao, Ming; Yang, Lihui; Chen, Xuefu; Deng, Yiyu; Yang, Shifang; Xu, Hanyi; Chen, Zixing; Gao, Xinglin",Respir Med,410,16

This study aims to examine from the perspective of nurses’ personal interests whether mistreatment by patients decreases nurses’ workplace well-being and career commitment, and how their susceptibility to emotional contagion and emotional regulation ability might mitigate these negative effects. This study adopted a cross-sectional study design (data were collected through self-reported questionnaires with a two-month time lag between the months of August–October 2017). A total of 289 nurses from three hospitals in Shandong province, China, were recruited to participate in our study. The results reveal that mistreatment by patients is negatively related to nurses’ workplace well-being and career commitment. Emotional contagion susceptibility moderates the relationships between mistreatment by patients and career commitment, while there is no significant buffering effect of mistreatment by patients on workplace well-being. Emotional regulation ability moderates the relationships between mistreatment by patients and both workplace well-being and career commitment. These results suggest that improvements in nurses’ emotional regulation ability and susceptibility to emotional contagion can alleviate the harmful impacts of mistreatment by patients.","Liu, Bing; Zhu, Naixin; Wang, Huijuan; Li, Fengyu; Men, Chenghao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,410,29

A close association between migration and hibernation exists in temperate, but not in tropical, bats. Compared with birds, bats are relatively short-distance migrators, with maximum migration distances being <2000 km; intercontinental migration is likely to be uncommon in bats. Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.","Fleming, T.H.",Encyclopedia of Animal Behavior,410,19

METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment administered online asked respondents (N = 306) to imagine the COVID-19 caseload had surged and that they were lay members of a panel tasked to allocate the final ICU bed. They had to decide which patient was more deserving for each of 14 patient pairs. Patients were characterized by 5 attributes: age, occupation, caregiver status, health prior to being infected, and prognosis. Respondents were randomly allocated to one of 7 sets of 14 pairs. Multinomial, mixed logit, and latent class models were used to model the observed choice behavior. RESULTS: A latent class model with 3 classes was found to be the most informative. Two classes valued active decision making and were slightly more likely to choose patients with caregiving responsibilities over those without. One of these classes valued prognosis most strongly, with a decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 65 y and older. The other valued both prognosis and age highly, with decreasing probability of bed allocation for those 45 y and older and a slight preference in favor of frontline health care workers. The third class preferred more random decision-making strategies. CONCLUSIONS: For two-thirds of those sampled, prognosis, age, and caregiving responsibilities were the important features when making allocation decisions, although the emphasis varies. The remainder appeared to choose randomly.","Street, Amelia E.; Street, Deborah J.; Flynn, Gordon M.",Med Decis Making,410,16

Although research suggests that social isolation affects health and wellbeing, reactions may vary depending on individuals. The current study assessed the relationships between personality variables (preference for solitude and Big Five personality), mental health (anxiety, stress, loneliness), and creativity, and tried to determine whether the identified personality profiles affect individuals’ mental health and creativity. French respondents (N = 430) filled in an online questionnaire during the first lockdown in Spring 2020. The results showed that the preference for solitude and personality variables of the Big Five predicted individuals’ mental health and creativity. Moreover, a cluster analysis revealed three profiles of individuals: “Affiliation”, “Emotionally Stable Lonely” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely”. Results showed that individuals with “Affiliation” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely” profiles expressed higher stress and anxiety, and the latter performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an “Emotionally Stable Lonely” profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a creative insight task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns. With this knowledge, health professionals could develop appropriate interventions to accompany high-risk individuals in situations of social isolation.

We have included a PCR for HBoV in a study on airway infections in children. OBJECTIVES: To study the occurrence of HBoV in Norwegian children, and to evaluate the results of a semiquantitive PCR. STUDY DESIGN: During a 4-month period in the winter season 2006/2007 we collected nasopharyngeal aspirations from children who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics. All samples were examined for 17 agents with real-time PCR. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 45 of 376 samples (12%). The occurrence of HBoV was stable during the study period. Multiple viral infections were present in 78% of the samples (42% double, 20% triple and 16% quadruple infections). RS-virus, enterovirus and human metapneumovirus were the most frequently codetected agents. In samples with a high load for HBoV, significantly fewer multiple infections were found than in the other samples. Eighty-eight percent of the 25 patients with HBoV recorded as either the only or the dominating virus, and 50% of the other patients, had lower respiratory tract infection. The difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV was frequently detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with airway infections in Norway. Multiple viral infections were common among the HBoV-infected patients.

We aimed to provide timely specialist input for consult requests during the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing an Inpatient eConsult Programme. METHODS: We used the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance implementation science framework and run chart analysis to evaluate the reach, adoption and maintenance of the Inpatient eConsult Programme compared with traditional in-person consults. We solicited qualitative feedback from frontline physicians and specialists for programme improvements. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 46 available in-person consult orders and 21 new eConsult orders. At the peak of utilisation, 42% of all consult requests were eConsults, and by the end of the study period, utilisation fell to 20%. Qualitative feedback revealed subspecialties best suited for eConsults (infectious diseases, nephrology, haematology, endocrinology) and influenced improvements to the ordering workflow, documentation, billing and education regarding use. DISCUSSION: When offered inpatient eConsult requests as an alternative to in-person consults in the context of a surge in patients with COVID-19, frontline physicians used eConsult requests and decreased use of in-person consults. As the demand for consults decreased and PPE shortages were no longer a major concern, eConsult utilisation decreased, revealing a preference for in-person consultations when possible.

The profile of specific antibodies to individual proteins of the virus is critical to the development of vaccine and diagnostic tools. In this study, 13 recombinant proteins associated with four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) and five putative uncharacterized proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a and 9b) of the SARS-CoV were prepared and used for screening and monitoring their specific IgG antibodies in SARS patient sera by protein microarray. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent-phase SARS patients, whereas those to proteins E, M, 3b, 6 and 7a were undetected. In the detectable specific antibodies, anti-S and anti-N were dominant and could persist in the sera of SARS patients until week 30. Among the rabbit antisera to recombinant proteins S3, N, 3a and 9b, only anti-S3 serum showed significant neutralizing activity to the SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells. The results suggest (1) that anti-S and anti-N antibodies are diagnostic markers and in particular that S3 is immunogenic and therefore is a good candidate as a subunit vaccine antigen; and (2) that, from a virus structure viewpoint, the presence in some human sera of antibodies reacting with two recombinant polypeptides, 3a and 9b, supports the hypothesis that they are synthesized during the virus cycle.","Qiu, Maofeng; Shi, Yuling; Guo, Zhaobiao; Chen, Zeliang; He, Rongqiao; Chen, Runsheng; Zhou, Dongsheng; Dai, Erhei; Wang, Xiaoyi; Si, Bingyin; Song, Yajun; Li, Jingxiang; Yang, Ling; Wang, Jin; Wang, Hongxia; Pang, Xin; Zhai, Junhui; Du, Zongmin; Liu, Ying; Zhang, Yong; Li, Linhai; Wang, Jian; Sun, Bing; Yang, Ruifu",Microbes Infect,410,20

We present our data on the use of rapid antigen test (RAT) as a screening tool prior to endoscopy to prevent the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent any GI endoscopic procedure from July 2020 to October 2020 at a tertiary referral center in New Delhi, India. All patients underwent screening for COVID-19 using RAT, and endoscopy was performed only when the RAT was negative. The data are presented as numbers and percentages. RESULTS: A total of 3,002 endoscopic procedures were performed during the study period. Only one endoscopic procedure was performed in a COVID-19 positive patient. A total of 53 healthcare workers were involved in conducting these procedures. Only 2 healthcare workers (3.8%) were diagnosed COVID-19 positive, presumably due to community-acquired infection, during this period.

Among the multiple factors possibly involved, a role for air pollution has also been hypothesized. This nationwide observational study demonstrated the significant positive relationship between COVID-19 incidence rates and PM2.5 and NO(2) levels in Italy, both considering the period 2016–2020 and the months of the epidemic, through univariate regression models, after logarithmic transformation of the variables, as the data were not normally distributed. That relationship was confirmed by a multivariate analysis showing the combined effect of the two pollutants, adjusted for the old-age index and population density. An increase in PM2.5 and NO(2) concentrations by one unit (1 µg/m(3)) corresponded to an increase in incidence rates of 1.56 and 1.24 × 10(4) people, respectively, taking into account the average levels of air pollutants in the period 2016–2020, and 2.79 and 1.24 × 10(4) people during March–May 2020.

We aimed to review medical and global health journals’ sex/gender reporting, and the gender and geography of authorship. METHODS: 542 research and non-research articles from 14 selected journals were reviewed using a retrospective survey design. Paper screening and systematic data extraction was conducted with descriptive statistics and regression analyses calculated from the coded data. Outcome measures were journal characteristics, the extent to which published articles met sex/gender reporting guidelines, plus author gender and location of their affiliated institution. RESULTS: Five of the fourteen journals explicitly encourage sex/gender analysis in their author instructions, but this did not lead to increased sex/gender reporting beyond the gender of study participants (OR=3.69; p=0.000 (CI 1.79 to 7.60)). Just over half of research articles presented some level of sex/gender analysis, while 40% mentioned sex/gender in their discussion. Articles with women first and last authors were 2.4 times more likely to discuss sex/gender than articles with men in those positions (p=0.035 (CI 1.062 to 5.348)). First and last authors from high-income countries (HICs) were 19 times as prevalent as authors from low-income countries; and women from low-income and middle-income countries were at a disadvantage in terms of the impact factor of the journals they published in. CONCLUSION: Global health and medical research fails to consistently apply a sex/gender lens and remains largely the preserve of authors in HIC.

Eating and sharing meals together among the community's members, especially relatives and neighbours, are a common practice in both daily life and social gathering events. Fish are a significant protein source and are associated with variety of traditional recipes. Cyprinid fish are one of the most preferred fish by Isaan villagers for daily consumption because they are accessible and affordable. Consumption of these fish probably causes the persistence of high endemicity of human liver fluke infection, particularly with Opisthorchis viverrini, in northeast Thailand. Because the consumption of raw cyprinid fish is a well-documented risk factor for liver fluke infection, sharing of risky raw fish dishes may influence disease transmission through a community. Social network analysis was used to investigate fish and fish-based meal sharing among household members in Isaan villages in liver fluke endemic areas. The findings from three studies confirmed the persistence of traditional Isaan raw fish consumption and food-sharing practice. Social connections via food sharing among villagers played an important role in liver fluke infection and transmission dynamics as a risk factor. Thus these sociocultural factors should be taken into account in designing strategies for control of opisthorchiasis and other food-borne illnesses at the community level.","Phimpraphai, Waraphon; Tangkawattana, Sirikachorn; Kasemsuwan, Suwicha; Sripa, Banchob",Adv Parasitol,410,23

We isolated recombinant aphthoviruses from cells simultaneously infected with temperature-sensitive mutants of two different subtype strains. Analysis of the proteins induced by 16 independently generated recombinants revealed two types of protein pattern, which were consistent with single genetic crossovers on the 5′ side and 3′ side, respectively, of the central P34-coding region. Recombinants invariably inherited all four coat proteins from the same parent, and novel recombinant proteins were not observed. RNAase T1 fingerprints of virus RNA, prepared from representatives of each recombinant type, confirmed the approximate crossover sites that had been deduced from the inheritance of proteins.

Although infectious causes of fetal mortality are diagnosed less frequently, infection in utero may also compromise the development of the fetus without causing death. This review presents fetomaternal responses to infection and the changes which can be observed in such cases. Response to infection, especially the concentration of immunoglobulins and some acute-phase proteins, may be used for diagnostic purposes. Some changes in internal organs may also be used as an indicator of infection in utero. However, in all cases (except pathogen-specific antibody response) non-pathogen-specific responses do not aid in pathogen-specific diagnosis of the cause of calf death. But, nonspecific markers of in utero infection may allow us to assign the cause of fetal mortality to infection and thus increase our overall diagnosis rate, particularly in cases of the “unexplained stillbirth”. ABSTRACT: Bovine perinatal mortality due to infection may result either from the direct effects of intrauterine infection and/or the fetal response to such infection, leading to the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS). Both intrauterine infection and FIRS, which causes multi-organ damage and involution of immune organs, compromise fetal survivability, sometimes fatally. Organ injury associated with FIRS may, in addition to causing fetal mortality, irreversibly compromise extrauterine adaptation of the neonate, a recognized problem in human fetuses. Diagnosis of intrauterine infection and of FIRS requires related, but independent analytical approaches. In addition to detection of pathogens, the immune and inflammatory responses of the bovine fetus may be utilized to diagnose intrauterine infection. This can be done by detection of specific changes in internal organs and the measurement of antibodies and/or elements of the acute phase reaction. Currently our ability to diagnose FIRS in bovine fetuses and neonates is limited to research studies. This review focuses on both the fetomaternal response to infection and diagnostic methods which rely on the response of the fetus to infection and inflammatory changes, as well other methods which may improve diagnosis of intrauterine infection in cases of bovine perinatal mortality.","Jawor, Paulina; Mee, John F.; Stefaniak, Tadeusz",Animals (Basel),410,1

Often, virus-induced suppression of host gene expression, including those involved in antiviral responses, contributes to viral pathogenicity. Accordingly, clarifying the mechanisms of virus-induced disruption of host gene expression is important for understanding virus–host cell interactions and virus pathogenesis. Three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have emerged in the past two decades. All of them encode nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) in their genomes. Nsp1 of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV exhibit common biological functions for inducing endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs and inhibition of host translation, while viral mRNAs evade the nsp1-induced mRNA cleavage. SARS-CoV nsp1 is a major pathogenic determinant for this virus, supporting the notion that a viral protein that suppresses host gene expression can be a virulence factor, and further suggesting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1, which has high amino acid identity with SARS-CoV nsp1, may serve as a major virulence factor. This review summarizes the gene expression suppression functions of nsp1 of CoVs, with a primary focus on SARS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1.","Nakagawa, Keisuke; Makino, Shinji",Cells,410,5

In higher organisms, most of the subunits are expressed as multiple isoforms, with some enriched in specific compartments or tissues and others expressed ubiquitously. In mammals, subunit a is expressed as four isoforms (a1-4) that target the enzyme to distinct biological membranes. Mutations in a isoforms are known to give rise to tissue-specific disease, and some a isoforms are upregulated and mislocalized to the plasma membrane in invasive cancers. However, isoform complexity and low abundance greatly complicate purification of active human V-ATPase, a prerequisite for developing isoform-specific therapeutics. Here, we report the purification of an active human V-ATPase in native lipid nanodiscs from a cell line stably expressing affinity-tagged a isoform 4 (a4). We find that exogenous expression of this single subunit in HEK293F cells permits assembly of a functional V-ATPase by incorporation of endogenous subunits. The ATPase activity of the preparation is >95% sensitive to concanamycin A, indicating that the lipid nanodisc-reconstituted enzyme is functionally coupled. Moreover, this strategy permits purification of the enzyme’s isolated membrane subcomplex together with biosynthetic assembly factors coiled-coil domain–containing protein 115, transmembrane protein 199, and vacuolar H(+)-ATPase assembly integral membrane protein 21. Our work thus lays the groundwork for biochemical characterization of active human V-ATPase in an a subunit isoform-specific manner and establishes a platform for the study of the assembly and regulation of the human holoenzyme.","Oot, Rebecca A.; Yao, Yeqi; Manolson, Morris F.; Wilkens, Stephan",J Biol Chem,410,26

Our case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential for pneumonia and importance of early urine legionella antigen testing. CASE PRESENTATION: 55 year-old male with no significant medical history presented with 8 day history of fever, chills and dry cough. Exam was unremarkable except bilateral rales. Labs were significant for elevated inflammatory markers done as part of a COVID panel with C-reactive protein >190, troponin 0.063, d-dimer >20, ferritin 15k, lactate dehydrogenase 682, Creatinine kinase 553 and WBC 31.1, absolute lymphocyte 0.7, AST 179, ALT 91, ALP 164, Total Bilirubin 6.0, Sodium 123, BUN 130, Creatinine 12.4. Chest X-ray significant for bilateral ground glass opacity, He was admitted to ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Despite high suspicion, COVID-19 test was negative thrice, including lower respiratory sampling. However, his urine legionella antigen testing was positive. ICU course was complicated by septic shock, renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, acute liver failure and acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and later tracheostomy. He was treated with 14 day course of antibiotics and later weaned off the ventilator. DISCUSSION: Severe legionnaires' disease, though uncommon, has a very similar presentation as COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea being the most common clinical presentation, whereas laboratory findings significant for elevated inflammatory markers including CRP, CK and LDH are noted in both the diseases (1). Liver and renal failure are also equally involved in both the disease. However, severe hyponatremia and elevated WBC count should raise higher suspicion for Legionella than COVID-19. Our patient presented as a diagnostic challenge with many clinical features that resemble both diseases. The early detection of Legionella pneumonia was imperative to our patient's recovery with prompt treatment with empiric antibiotics. First-line diagnostic testing typically occurs by looking for urine antigens, which tests for the most virulent legionella species, L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (2). Although culture diagnosis remains the gold standard and the most specific diagnostic testing, urine antigen testing allows for early diagnosis and earlier tailoring of antibiotics (3). Thus, for all patients with increased suspicion for COVID-19, we recommend co-testing for urine legionella antigen to rule out Legionnaires' pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our case report suggests that we should not overlook typical presentations of known diseases even in the midst of a pandemic. It serves as a reminder to continue early testing for treatable diseases, like Legionella, so as to not miss an opportunity to save a life. REFERENCE #1: Huang C Wang Y Li X et al.

Hospital pharmacy was selected as the most preferred sector by 242 (55.4%) of the participants, while community pharmacy was the least favoured pharmacy sector (17% or 6.2%). The enablers that might influence the consideration of a job in community pharmacy included career aspiration and social accountability. On the other hand, the barriers were personal beliefs about the sector and the nature of the work. Conclusions: The community pharmacy sector was found to be the least preferred sector to work in. The study revealed a list of enablers that the participants found to be relevant or of high relevance when choosing community pharmacy as a career pathway. Some of the enablers contribute to the role of the pharmacist towards the local community, social accountability, and towards the country’s Vision, such as interaction with the general public and educating them. Other enablers are related to the pharmacists’ career aspirations, such as owning a business. Some of the barriers that were found relevant include high workload, inflexible working hours, and limited opportunities for professional development. Localisation of community pharmacies would help to create more jobs for national pharmacists, increase the participation of female pharmacists in the workforce and support the achievement of Vision 2030. The barriers should be tackled on several levels: undergraduate curriculum, regulatory, and actual practice. Undergraduate education needs to include primary pharmaceutical care services in its curriculum. Regulatory changes include enforcing the renationalisation of the community pharmacy sector and permitting females to work in community pharmacies without location restrictions.","Almaghaslah, Dalia; Alsayari, Abdulrhman; Almanasef, Mona; Asiri, Amjad",Int J Environ Res Public Health,410,28

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) develop systemic physiological changes that could increase the risk of severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and result in atypical clinical features of COVID-19 with possible delay in both diagnosis and treatment. We evaluated differences in clinical features and evolution of COVID-19 between people with SCI and able-bodied individuals. SETTING: The study was conducted in an Italian inpatient rehabilitation referral center for individuals with SCI during the lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We compared clinical information between patients with SCI and able-bodied healthcare workers of the same center who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Overall, 15 out of the 25 SCI patients admitted to the center and 17 out of the 69 healthcare workers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with SCI exhibited a significantly more advanced age and a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Nevertheless, no significant differences in clinical expression of COVID-19 and treatment strategies were observed between the two groups. All hospitalized subjects were treated in nonintensive care units and no deaths occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the supposed notion that COVID-19 could exhibit atypical clinical features or a worse evolution in the frail population of people with SCI.","D’Andrea, S.; Berardicurti, O.; Berardicurti, A.; Felzani, G.; Francavilla, F.; Francavilla, S.; Giacomelli, R.; Barbonetti, A.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,410,18

Such a dynamic scenario imposes the necessity to define a new framework for cancer care. The first emerging evidence has transmitted contrasting messages with regards to cancer care management. Some authors have hypothesized an increased infection risk for cancer patients, with a more severe disease, requiring a reorganization of health care system that could disrupt an established high quality cancer care routine in many developed countries. Other authors have attempted to interpret data related to cancer patients by better defining their “active status”. We herein present our point of view in the light of current evidence and based on the experience matured at our cancer institute in managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our core idea is that “active cancer” may be considered a proxy of more recent exposure to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, and the frequency of access to health care facilities can be predicted as a function of the severity of cancer symptoms. Hence, COVID-19 screening program and the adjustment of cancer care provision in a cancer institutions should be led by this risk model, while awaiting new evidence.","Barba, Maddalena; Krasniqi, Eriseld; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Vici, Patrizia",J Transl Med,410,1

Utilizing a previously generated mutant, we demonstrate that the absence of all four Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) accessory ORFs (deletion of ORF3, -4a, -4b, and -5 [dORF3-5]) has major implications for viral replication and pathogenesis. Importantly, attenuation of the dORF3-5 mutant is primarily driven by dysregulated host responses, including disrupted cell processes, augmented interferon (IFN) pathway activation, and robust inflammation. In vitro replication attenuation also extends to in vivo models, allowing use of dORF3-5 as a live attenuated vaccine platform. Finally, examination of ORF5 implicates a partial role in modulation of NF-κB-mediated inflammation.

The main aim of this review is to address molecular mechanisms, beyond drugs, that can be helpful against viral infection for this and future pandemics. We will highlight (1) the contribution of the MAPK cascade in viral infection and (2) the possible use of MAPK inhibitors in curbing viral infections, alone or in combination with HCQ and quinoline analogues.

METHODS: : A prospective observational cohort study enrolled 53 mild non-hospitalized and 48 hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients to a tertiary hospital in Oman. RESULTS: : Hospitalized patients were older (58 years vs 36 years, p <0.001) and had more comorbid conditions like diabetes (65 % Vs 21% p<0.001). Hospitalized patients had significantly higher inflammatory markers (p<0.001); C-reactive protein (CRP) (114 vs 4 mg/L), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (33 vs 3.71pg/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (417 vs 214 U/L), ferritin (760 vs 196 ng/mL), fibrinogen (6 vs 3 g/L), D-dimer (1.0 vs 0.3 mcg/mL), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) score (2 vs 0) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (4 vs 1.1), (p<0.001).

This study aimed to assess, via systematic review and meta-analysis, the effectiveness of both traditional strategies and contemporary innovations for retention adopted by longitudinal cohort studies in the past decade. METHODS: Health research databases were searched for retention strategies used within longitudinal cohort studies published in the 10-years prior, with 143 eligible longitudinal cohort studies identified (141 articles; sample size range: 30 to 61,895). Details on retention strategies and rates, research designs, and participant demographics were extracted. Meta-analyses of retained proportions were performed to examine the association between cohort retention rate and individual and thematically grouped retention strategies. RESULTS: Results identified 95 retention strategies, broadly classed as either: barrier-reduction, community-building, follow-up/reminder, or tracing strategies. Forty-four of these strategies had not been identified in previous reviews. Meta-regressions indicated that studies using barrier-reduction strategies retained 10% more of their sample (95%CI [0.13 to 1.08]; p = .01); however, studies using follow-up/reminder strategies lost an additional 10% of their sample (95%CI [− 1.19 to − 0.21]; p = .02). The overall number of strategies employed was not associated with retention. CONCLUSIONS: Employing a larger number of retention strategies may not be associated with improved retention in longitudinal cohort studies, contrary to earlier narrative reviews. Results suggest that strategies that aim to reduce participant burden (e.g., flexibility in data collection methods) might be most effective in maximising cohort retention.

Orthopaedic departments have adopted business continuity models and guidelines for essential and non-essential surgeries to preserve hospital resources as well as protect patients and staff. These guidelines broadly encompass reduction of ambulatory care with a move towards telemedicine, redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons/residents to the frontline battle against COVID-19, continuation of education and research through web-based means, and cancellation of non-essential elective procedures. However, if containment of COVID-19 community spread is achieved, resumption of elective orthopaedic procedures and transition plans to return to normalcy must be considered for orthopaedic departments. The COVID-19 pandemic also presents a moral dilemma to the orthopaedic surgeon considering elective procedures. What is the best treatment for our patients and how does the fear of COVID-19 influence the risk-benefit discussion during a pandemic? Surgeons must deliberate the fine balance between elective surgery for a patient’s wellbeing versus risks to the operating team and utilization of precious hospital resources. Attrition of healthcare workers or Orthopaedic surgeons from restarting elective procedures prematurely or in an unsafe manner may render us ill-equipped to handle the second wave of infections. This highlights the need to develop effective screening protocols or preoperative COVID-19 testing before elective procedures in high-risk, elderly individuals with comorbidities. Alternatively, high-risk individuals should be postponed until the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection is minimal. In addition, given the higher mortality and perioperative morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery, the decision to operate must be carefully deliberated. As we ramp-up elective services and get “back to business” as orthopaedic surgeons, we have to be constantly mindful to proceed in a cautious and calibrated fashion, delivering the best care, while maintaining utmost vigilance to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19 during this critical transition period.

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is an important enzyme for viral replication. Small molecules that inhibit this protease could lead to an effective COVID-19 treatment. The 2-pyridone scaffold was previously identified as a possible key pharmacophore to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). A search for natural, antimicrobial products with the 2-pyridone moiety was undertaken herein, and their calculated potency as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was investigated. Thirty-three natural products containing the 2-pyridone scaffold were identified from the literature. An in silico methodology using AutoDock was employed to predict the binding energies and inhibition constants (K(i) values) for each 2-pyridone-containing compound with SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). This consisted of molecular optimization of the 2-pyridone compound, docking of the compound with a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), and evaluation of the predicted interactions and ligand-enzyme conformations. All compounds investigated bound to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), close to the catalytic dyad (His-41 and Cys-145). Thirteen molecules had predicted K(i) values < 1 μM. Glu-166 formed a key hydrogen bond in the majority of the predicted complexes, while Met-165 had some involvement in the complex binding as a close contact to the ligand. Prominent 2-pyridone compounds were further evaluated for their ADMET properties. This work has identified 2-pyridone natural products with calculated potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and with desirable drug-like properties, which may lead to the rapid discovery of a treatment for COVID-19.","Forrestall, Katrina L.; Burley, Darcy E.; Cash, Meghan K.; Pottie, Ian R.; Darvesh, Sultan",Chem Biol Interact,410,7

AIMS: To find whether an initial HRCT chest can help triage patient by determining their oxygen requirement, place of treatment, laboratory parameters and risk of mortality and to compare 3 CT scoring systems (0-20, 0-25 and percentage of involved lung models) to find if one is a better predictor of prognosis than the other. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study conducted at a Tertiary care hospital in Mumbai, Patients undergoing CT scan were included by complete enumeration method. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Data collected included demographics, days from swab positivity to CT scan, comorbidities, place of treatment, laboratory parameters, oxygen requirement and mortality. We divided the patients into mild, moderate and severe based on 3 criteria - 20 point CT score (OS1), 25 point CT score (OS2) and opacity percentage (OP). CT scans were analysed using CT pneumonia analysis prototype software (Siemens Healthcare version 2.5.2, Erlangen, Germany). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ROC curve and Youden's index were used to determine cut off points. Multinomial logistic regression used to study the relations with oxygen requirement and place of admission. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was done to test the goodness of fit of our models. RESULTS: A total of 740 patients were included in our study. All the 3 scoring systems showed a significant positive correlation with oxygen requirement, place of admission and death. Based on ROC analysis a score of 4 for OS1, 9 for OS2 and 12.7% for OP was determined as the cut off for oxygen requirement. CONCLUSIONS: CT severity scoring using an automated deep learning software programme is a boon for determining oxygen requirement and triage. As the score increases, the chances of requirement of higher oxygen and intubation increase. All the three scoring systems are predictive of oxygen requirement.","Kohli, Anirudh; Jha, Tanya; Pazhayattil, Amal Babu",Indian J Radiol Imaging,410,1

The development of a vaccine that contributes to the “One Health” Initiative could be the answer to prevent the spread of the virus and control human and animal disease. The current commercially available veterinary vaccines are generally costly and most require high levels of biosafety for their manufacture. Consequently, we explored making a particulate vaccine candidate made transiently in plants as a more cost-effective and safer means of production. A WNV virus-like particle-display-based vaccine candidate was generated by the use of the SpyTag/SpyCatcher (ST/SC) conjugation system. The WNV envelope protein domain III (EDIII), which contains WNV-specific epitopes, was fused to and displayed on AP205 phage virus-like particles (VLPs) following the production of both separately in Nicotiana benthamiana. Co-purification of AP205 and EDIII genetically fused to ST and SC, respectively, resulted in the conjugated VLPs displaying EDIII with an average coupling efficiency of 51%. Subcutaneous immunisation of mice with 5 μg of purified AP205: EDIII VLPs elicited a potent IgG response to WNV EDIII.

PARTICIPANTS: The population for the study are patients with severe disease with a confirmed laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in 3 tertiary-care hospitals in Lima, Peru. 1. Age 18 or older. 2. Hospitalization due to COVID-19 with laboratory confirmation (either with serologic, molecular, or antigen test along with a compatible clinical presentation). 3. Severe or critical COVID-19 disease. Respiratory rate of 22 or more. Hypoxemia with oxygen saturation equal or less than 93%. Abnormal blood gas analysis (PaO(2) < 60 mmHg, PaCO(2) > 50 mmHg, or Pa/FiO(2) < 300). Mechanical ventilation requirement less than 72 h. Shock. 4. Capacity to provide informed consent (patient or patient’s direct relative); 5. Availability of convalescent plasma units compatible with ABO blood type of the subject. Exclusion criteria: 1. Contraindication for transfusion (e.g., prior anaphylaxis, congestive heart failure). 2. Hemodynamic instability (PA < 60 mmHg refractory to vasopressors). 3. Uncontrolled concomitant infections\. 4. Stupor or coma. 5. Platelets < 50,000/μL or disseminated intravascular coagulation. 6. Serum creatinine > 3.5 mg/dL or dialysis requirement. 7. Total bilirubin > 6 mg/dL or jaundice of unknown etiology. 8. Myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. 9. Active or recent (< 7 days) intracranial hemorrhage. 10. Pregnancy. Donors: The donors have to meet the following criteria: male between 30 and 60 years with a previous diagnosis of severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia within the last 3 months, with resolution of symptoms of at least 28 days. The rationale for including donors with severe disease is to maximize the probability of collecting convalescent plasma units with high titer of neutralizing antibodies, as the technology to measure this specific type of antibodies is not routinely available in Peru. Aliquots of plasma will be stored for future quantification of neutralizing antibodies. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Convalescent plasma from donors with previous severe COVID-19 is the investigational medical product. The experimental group will receive 1 to 2 units of 200 to 250 ml of convalescent plasma along with local standard treatment. The control group will receive local standard treatment alone. The participants randomized to plasma will have evaluations at 6 h and 24 h to specifically evaluate possible post transfusion events. All the participants will be evaluated at day 3, day 7, and day 30 after enrolment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Incidence of serious adverse reactions related to convalescent plasma transfusion within 24 h after convalescent plasma administration. Mortality from any cause during hospitalization at 30 days post randomization. Length of hospitalization at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Duration of mechanical ventilation at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Length of hospitalization in an intensive care unit at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Oxygen requirement evolution at days 3 and 7. Score Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) evolution at days 3 and 7. Dynamics of inflammatory marker (lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) evolution at days 3 and 7. Proportion of patients progressing to multi-organ failure at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. Proportion of transfusion related adverse reactions at 30 days post randomization or until hospital discharge. RANDOMIZATION: Randomization will be carried out within the electronic case report form (eCRF) in 1:1 ratio (receive plasma/control) in a randomization process established by blocks of size 2, 4, and 6. Allocation to the treatment arm of an individual patient will not be available to the investigators before completion of the whole randomization process. Randomization blocks will be performed with “ralloc”, Stata’s randomization process v.16.0. Randomization through the eCRF will be available 24 h every day. BLINDING (MASKING): Both the participants and study staff will be aware of the allocated intervention. Blinded statistical analysis will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size was calculated using the Fleiss formula with continuity correction to detect a mortality reduction from 50 to 20% between the two treatment arms with a confidence level of 95% and a power of 80%. Based on this information, a total of 45 patients per arm would be needed. After adjustment for a drop-out rate of 10% after enrolment, a total of 50 patients per arm (100 patients in total) will be enrolled.

We aimed to understand the scale, nature, and duration of changes to admissions for different types of acute coronary syndrome in England and to evaluate whether in-hospital management of patients has been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analysed data on hospital admissions in England for types of acute coronary syndrome from Jan 1, 2019, to May 24, 2020, that were recorded in the Secondary Uses Service Admitted Patient Care database. Admissions were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), myocardial infarction of unknown type, or other acute coronary syndromes (including unstable angina). We identified revascularisation procedures undertaken during these admissions (ie, coronary angiography without percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], PCI, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery). We calculated the numbers of weekly admissions and procedures undertaken; percentage reductions in weekly admissions and across subgroups were also calculated, with 95% CIs. Findings Hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome declined from mid-February, 2020, falling from a 2019 baseline rate of 3017 admissions per week to 1813 per week by the end of March, 2020, a reduction of 40% (95% CI 37–43). This decline was partly reversed during April and May, 2020, such that by the last week of May, 2020, there were 2522 admissions, representing a 16% (95% CI 13–20) reduction from baseline. During the period of declining admissions, there were reductions in the numbers of admissions for all types of acute coronary syndrome, including both STEMI and NSTEMI, but relative and absolute reductions were larger for NSTEMI, with 1267 admissions per week in 2019 and 733 per week by the end of March, 2020, a percent reduction of 42% (95% CI 38–46). In parallel, reductions were recorded in the number of PCI procedures for patients with both STEMI (438 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 346 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 21%, 95% CI 12–29) and NSTEMI (383 PCI procedures per week in 2019 vs 240 by the end of March, 2020; percent reduction 37%, 29–45). The median length of stay among patients with acute coronary syndrome fell from 4 days (IQR 2–9) in 2019 to 3 days (1–5) by the end of March, 2020. Interpretation Compared with the weekly average in 2019, there was a substantial reduction in the weekly numbers of patients with acute coronary syndrome who were admitted to hospital in England by the end of March, 2020, which had been partly reversed by the end of May, 2020. The reduced number of admissions during this period is likely to have resulted in increases in out-of-hospital deaths and long-term complications of myocardial infarction and missed opportunities to offer secondary prevention treatment for patients with coronary heart disease. The full extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome will continue to be assessed by updating these analyses.

Celle-ci, dans sa forme sévère, s’est avérée associée à un risque accru d’AVC ischémique et hémorragique. Ces AVC surviendraient suite à un mécanisme inflammatoire dans lequel interviendrait un orage de cytokines. Le virus pourrait également directement s’introduire dans le cerveau via les voies olfactives, le processus d’internalisation du virus faisant intervenir sa glycoprotéine S de surface et l’enzyme de conversion de l’angiotensine 2.

Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted.","Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth; Aldhaleei, Wafa Ali; Rahmani, Jamal; Mahabadi, Mohammadjavad Ashrafi; Bandari, Deepak Kumar",,410,2

SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells via the binding of its S protein to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). The use of ACEIs/ARBs (RAAS inhibitors) regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and may increase ACE2 expression. Considering the large use of ACEIs/ARBs in hypertensive patients, some professional groups are concerned about whether the use of RAAS inhibitors affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or the risk of severe illness and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we summarize preclinical and clinical studies to investigate whether the use of ACEIs/ARBs increases ACE2 expression in animals or patients. We also analyzed whether the use of these drugs affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe illness or mortality based on recent studies. Finally, the review suggests that current evidence does not support the concerns.","Zhang, Jishou; Wang, Menglong; Ding, Wen; Wan, Jun",Life Sci,410,20

Infectious clones for PRRSV have been constructed, and so far at least 14 different infectious clones are available representing both genotypes I and II. Two strategies have been taken for progeny reconstitution: RNA transfection and DNA transfection. Mutations, insertions, deletions, and replacements of the viral genome have been employed to study the structure function relationship, foreign gene expression, functional complementation, and virulence determinants. Essential regions and non-essential regions for viral replication have been identified in both the coding regions and non-encoding regions. Foreign sequences have successfully been inserted into the nsp2 and N regions and in the space between ORF1b and ORF2a. Chimeras between member viruses in the family Arteriviridae have also been constructed and utilized to study cell tropism and functional complementation.

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective analysis of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and IgG antibody at a quaternary-care, free-standing pediatric hospital between March 13, 2020 to June 21, 2020 included 6369 patients who underwent PCR testing and 215 patients who underwent antibody testing. During the initial study period, testing focused primarily on symptomatic children; the later study period included asymptomatic patients who underwent testing as preadmission or preprocedural screening. We report the proportion of positive and negative tests, time to viral clearance, and time to seropositivity. RESULTS: The rate of positivity varied over time due to viral circulation in the community and transition from targeted testing of symptomatic patients to more universal screening of hospitalized patients. Median duration of viral shedding (RT-PCR positivity) was 19.5 days and time from RT-PCR positivity to negativity was 25 days. Of note, patients aged 6 through 15 years demonstrated a longer time of RT-PCR positivity to negativity, compared with patients aged 16 through 22 years (median=32 versus 18 days, P = .015). Median time to seropositivity, by chemiluminescent testing, from RT-PCR positivity was 18 days while median time to reach adequate levels of neutralizing antibodies (defined as comparable to 160 titer by plaque reduction neutralization testing) was 36 days. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged period of viral shedding after infection with SARS CoV-2. It is unknown whether this correlates with persistent infectivity. Only 17 of 33 patients demonstrated adequate neutralizing antibodies during the timeframe of specimen collection. It remains unknown if IgG antibody against spike structured proteins correlates with immunity, and how long antibodies and potential protection persist.","Bahar, Burak; Jacquot, Cyril; Mo, Yunchuan D.; DeBiasi, Roberta L.; Campos, Joseph; Delaney, Meghan",J Pediatr,410,26

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading globally, affecting millions of people worldwide, and led to significant loss of lives and deterioration of the global economy. The current adverse effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic demands finding new detection methods for future viral outbreaks. The environment's transmission pathways include and are not limited to air, surface water, and wastewater environments. The wastewater surveillance, known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), can potentially monitor viral outbreaks and provide a complementary clinical testing method. Another investigated outbreak surveillance technique that did not yet implement in a sufficient number of studies is the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the air. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its related machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies are currently emerging techniques for detecting viral outbreaks using global data. To date, there are no reports that illustrate the potential of using WBE with AI to detect viral outbreaks. This study investigates the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and provides current updates on the surveillance of viral outbreaks using wastewater-based epidemiology, viral air sampling, and AI. It also proposes a novel framework based on an ensemble of ML and DL algorithms to provide a beneficial supportive tool for decision-makers. The framework exploits the available data to discover meaningful insights and knowledge that allows researchers and practitioners to build efficient methods and protocols that accurately monitor and detect viral outbreaks. The proposed framework could provide early detection of viruses, forecast risk maps and vulnerable areas, and estimate the number of infected citizens.","Abdeldayem, Omar M.; Dabbish, Areeg M.; Habashy, Mahmoud M.; Mostafa, Mohamed K.; Elhefnawy, Mohamed; Amin, Lobna; Al-Sakkari, Eslam G.; Ragab, Ahmed; Rene, Eldon R.",Sci Total Environ,410,0

We used data from the European Survey on Alcohol use and COVID-19 (ESAC) conducted in Czechia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the UK (N = 31921). Past-year alcohol consumption and changes in consumption were measured by AUDIT-C. Drinking habits were compared according to percentiles of pre-pandemic consumption levels, below versus above the 90th percentile. Across countries, drinkers in the highest 10% for pre-pandemic consumption increased their drinking during the pandemic, whereas absolute changes among those initially drinking below this level were modest. The percentage of people reporting >28 alcohol units/week increased significantly in seven of eight countries. During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption in the upper decile of the drinkers increased as did the prevalence of heavy drinkers, in contrast with a declining consumption in other groups in the sample.","Rossow, Ingeborg; Bartak, Miroslav; Bloomfield, Kim; Braddick, Fleur; Bye, Elin K.; Kilian, Carolin; López-Pelayo, Hugo; Mäkelä, Pia; Moan, Inger Synnøve; Moskalewicz, Jacek; Petruzelka, Benjamin; Rogalewicz, Vladimír; Manthey, Jakob",Int J Environ Res Public Health,410,18

The biosensor employs cys-kemptide (CLRRASLG) as a substrate peptide which was immobilized on the surface of a gold electrode via the self-assembly of the thiol terminals in cysteine (C) residues. The interaction between protein kinase A (PKA) and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) on the cys-kemptide immobilized electrode can cause the transfer of ATP terminal phosphates to the peptide substrates at serine (S) residues, which alters the surface charge of the electrode, thus enabling monitoring of the PKA activity via measuring the interfacial electron transfer resistance with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The proposed sensor showed reliable, sensitive, and selective detection of PKA activity with a wide dynamic range of 0.1–100 U/mL and a detection limit of 56 mU/mL. The sensor also exhibited high selectivity, rendering it possible to screen PKA inhibitors. Moreover, the sensor can be employed to evaluate the activity and inhibition of PKA in real samples.","Cho, Hyunju; Lee, Chang-Seuk; Kim, Tae Hyun",Biomedicines,410,26

Clinical translation has been often hampered by poor biodistribution, however. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) appear as a possibility to increase the cellular delivery of non-permeant biomolecules such as nucleic acids. This review focuses on CPP-delivery of several classes of oligonucleotides (ONs), namely antisense oligonucleotides, splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) and siRNAs. Two main strategies have been used to transport ONs with CPPs: covalent conjugation (which is more appropriate for charge-neutral ON analogues) and non-covalent complexation (which has been used for siRNA delivery essentially). Chemical synthesis, mechanisms of cellular internalization and various applications will be reviewed. A comprehensive coverage of the enormous amount of published data was not possible. Instead, emphasis has been put on strategies that have proven to be effective in animal models of important human diseases and on examples taken from the authors' own expertise.","Boisguérin, Prisca; Deshayes, Sébastien; Gait, Michael J.; O'Donovan, Liz; Godfrey, Caroline; Betts, Corinne A.; Wood, Matthew J.A.; Lebleu, Bernard",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,410,22

RECENT FINDINGS: With an onset in childhood, narcolepsy often has a delayed diagnosis due to symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness not being recognized or being misdiagnosed. Clinical, electrophysiological, and biological tests are needed in order to diagnose narcolepsy. At the same time, the discovery of the link with the immunoregulatory human leukocyte antigen complex and the adverse events in relation to the H1N1 pandemic vaccines have shuffled the epidemiological numbers. SUMMARY: In this meta-review, we pooled incidence rates and prevalence rates reported in 30 countries or from 209 sets of data. Findings are reported per age, continent, and proxy race/ethnicity as well as period (i.e., before/after the pandemic). This meta-review showed that narcolepsy occurs in 0.87–1.21 of the world population, with specifically NT1 being investigated. Its pooled incidence rate in vaccinated samples is 1.58. There is furthermore an underreporting of narcolepsy in ethnic/race and gender minorities, of childhood narcolepsy type 2 and potential comorbid conditions masking the clinical complaints and hence timely diagnosis.","Spruyt, Karen",Curr Sleep Med Rep,410,16

We sought to report elective surgical case distribution, associated gross hospital earnings and regional hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity as elective surgical cases are cancelled and then resumed under simulated trends of COVID-19 incidence. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort analysis was performed using insurance claims from 161 million enrollees from the MarketScan database from January 1, 2008 to December 31,2017. COVID-19 cases were calculated using a generalized Richards model. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports on the number of hospitalized and intensive care patients by age were used to estimate the number of cases seen in the ICU, the reduction in elective surgeries and the financial impact of this from historic claims data, using a denominator of all inpatient revenue and outpatient surgeries. RESULTS: Assuming 5% infection prevalence, cancelling all elective procedures decreases ICU overcapacity from 340% to 270%, but these elective surgical cases contribute 78% (IQR 74, 80) (1.1 trillion (T) US dollars) to inpatient hospital plus outpatient surgical gross earnings per year. Musculoskeletal, circulatory and digestive category elective surgical cases compose 33% ($447B) of total revenue. CONCLUSIONS: Procedures involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and digestive system account for the largest loss of hospital gross earnings when elective surgery is postponed. As hospital bed capacity increases following the COVID-19 pandemic, restoring volume of these elective cases will help maintain revenue.","Tonna, Joseph E.; Hanson, Heidi A.; Cohan, Jessica N.; McCrum, Marta L.; Horns, Joshua J.; Brooke, Benjamin S.; Das, Rupam; Kelly, Brenna C.; Campbell, Alexander John; Hotaling, James",medRxiv,410,6

The implications of COVID-19-related stressors may be particularly salient for young adults, who are at higher-risk for mental health concerns and substance use behaviors. We developed a multifaceted scale that assessed distinct domains of COVID-19-related stressors and examined associations between these stressors and indices of mental health, well-being, and substance use (alcohol and marijuana use). In April—June of 2020, 1181 young adults were recruited from two- and four-year colleges to participate in this study (M(age) = 20.40; 59.95% women). Exploratory factor analysis identified five domains of COVID-19-related stressors: job insecurity, social/relational, financial, illness-related, and school-related. The overall pattern of results indicated that COVID-19-related stressors were related to poorer mental health and well-being. Social/relational stressors emerged as a primary concern most strongly associated with indices of mental health and alcohol use, relative to other stressors. However, illness-related stressors and school-related stressors were associated with less alcohol use. Stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may impact young adults’ health and well-being but disentangling various stressor domains informs more tailored intervention and prevention strategies.

Several aerial vehicles communicate with one another to form flying ad hoc networks. Unmanned aerial vehicles perform a wide range of tasks that make life easier for humans. However, due to the high frequency of mobile flying vehicles, network problems such as packet loss, latency, and perhaps disrupted channel links arise, affecting data delivery. The use of UAV-enabled IoT in sports has changed the dynamics of tracking and working on player safety. WBAN can be merged with aerial vehicles to collect data regarding health and transfer it to a base station. Furthermore, the unbalanced energy usage of flying things will result in earlier mission failure and a rapid decline in network lifespan. This study describes the use of each UAV's residual energy level to ensure a high level of safety using an ant-based routing technique called AntHocNet. In health care, the use of IoT-assisted aerial vehicles would increase operational performance, surveillance, and automation optimization to provide a smart application of flying IoT. Apart from that, aerial vehicles can be used in remote communication for treatment, medical equipment distribution, and telementoring.

Further, sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more severe outcomes in aged men. Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men. CONTENT: The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China. We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging. Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies. CONCLUSION: The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender. The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.","Gebhard, Catherine; Regitz-Zagrosek, Vera; Neuhauser, Hannelore K.; Morgan, Rosemary; Klein, Sabra L.",Biol Sex Differ,410,32

To better understand the replication features of these viruses in their target organs and molecular pathogenesis of these different viruses, comparative proteomic analysis was performed to investigate the proteome changes of primary target organ during IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 infections, using 2D‐DIGE followed MALDI‐TOF/TOF‐MS. In total, 44, 39, 41, 48, and 38 proteins were identified in the tracheal tissues of the chickens inoculated with IBV (ck/CH/LDL/97I, H120), NDV (La Sota), and AIV H9, and between ck/CH/LDL/97I and H120, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis showed that IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 induced similar core host responses involved in biosynthetic, catabolic, metabolic, signal transduction, transport, cytoskeleton organization, macromolecular complex assembly, cell death, response to stress, and immune system process. Comparative analysis of host response induced by different viruses indicated differences in protein expression changes induced by IBV, NDV, and AIV H9 may be responsible for the specific pathogenesis of these different viruses.

In this study, eight additional gC negative (gC−) mutants derived from KOS-321 were shown to vary widely in their ability to induce lethal encephalitis in female DBA/2 mice following intracerebral inoculation. This variation in virulence showed no correlation with thymidine kinase activity. One less virulent gC− strain, gC−39, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC+ recombinant virions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC−viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC+) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse model of HSV-induced encephalitis and that cotransfection procedures can induce additional mutations that affect viral pathogenesis.","Sunstrum, James C.; Chrisp, Clarence E.; Levine, Myron; Glorioso, Joseph C.",Virus Research,410,16

A single-blinded, six-week, randomized controlled pilot trial involving 70 sedentary young Chinese females, aged 18–30 years, was conducted. An intervention group (IG) (n = 33) underwent a HIIT intervention and health education, while a waitlist group (WG) (n = 37) only received health education. In pre-, mid-, and post-tests, both groups filled out questionnaires about physical activity, sedentary behavior, and mental health. Cognitive functions were assessed at the pre- and post-tests by computer-administered cognitive tests. A mixed-effect model with repeated measures was used to analyze outcomes of interest. The retention rate of the IG and WG was 100% and 78.38%, respectively. The IG were found to have significantly increased rates of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (M(diff) = 940.61, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 576.67, 1304.55) from pre-test to post-test, while the WG demonstrated a more marked reduction in sedentary time (M(diff) = −73.02, p = 0.038, 95% CI: −141.90, −4.14) compared with the IG in the post-test. Moreover, anxiety and stress levels were shown to significantly reduce in the IG over the six-week period (M(diff) = −4.73, p = 0.002, 95% CI: −7.30, −2.15 and M(diff) = −5.09, p = 0.001, 95% CI: −8.29, −1.89, respectively). In addition, we observed a significant improvement in verbal ability (p = 0.008, [Formula: see text] = 0.19) following the HIIT intervention and effects of the interaction with time on processing speed (p = 0.050, [Formula: see text] = 0.10) and episodic memory (p = 0.048, [Formula: see text] = 0.11). Moreover, the IG had better global cognitive performance than the WG in the post-test (M(diff) = 8.28, p = 0.003, 95% CI: 3.06, 13.50). In summary, both an online bodyweight HIIT intervention combined with health education, or health education alone, can effectively improve health-related behaviors, but the behavioral consequences may differ based on the emphasis of different intervention modalities. Furthermore, the “bodyweight HIIT plus health education” modality might be a more promising online intervention strategy to mitigate against negative emotions and improve cognitive function.","Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Beier; Gan, Liaoyan; Ke, Limei; Fu, Yingyao; Di, Qian; Ma, Xindong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,410,10

A ""safety loop"" model postulates risk-related decisions are not based on objective and measurable risks but on the subjective perception of those risks. We here illustrate a quantification of the difference between objective and subjective risks. Method: The objective risks (or chances) can be obtained from traditional 2 x 2 tables by calculating the positive (+LR) and negative (-LR) likelihood ratios. The subjective perception of objective risks is calculated from the same 2 x 2 tables by exchanging the X- and Y-axes. The traditional 2 x 2 table starts with the hypothesis, uses a test and a gold standard to confirm or exclude the investigated condition. The 2 x 2 table with inverted axes starts with the communication of a test result and presumes that the communication of bad news (whether right or false) will induce ""perceived anxiety"" while good news will induce ""perceived safety"". Two different functions (confirmation and exclusion) of both perceptions (perceived anxiety and safety) can be quantified with those calculations. Results: The analysis of six published tests and of one incompletely reported test on COVID-19 polymerase chain reactions (completed by four assumptions on high and low sensitivities and specificities) demonstrated that none of these tests induces ""perceived safety"". Eight of the ten tests confirmed the induction of perceived anxiety with +LRs (range 3.1 - 5900). In two of these eight tests a -LR (0.25 and 0.004) excluded the induction of perceived safety. Conclusions: Communication of test results caused perceived anxiety but not perceived safety in 80% of the investigated tests. Medical tests, whether right or false, generate strong psychological messages. In the case of COVID-19 tests may induce more perceived anxiety than safety.","Porzsolt, F.; Pfuhl, G.; Kaplan, R.

Albumin is able to bind to almost all known drugs, as well as many nutraceuticals and toxic substances, largely determining their pharmaco- and toxicokinetics. Albumin of humans and respective representatives in cattle and rodents have their own structural features that determine species differences in functional properties. However, albumin is not only passive, but also an active participant of pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic processes, possessing a number of enzymatic activities. Numerous experiments have shown esterase or pseudoesterase activity of albumin towards a number of endogeneous and exogeneous esters. Due to the free thiol group of Cys34, albumin can serve as a trap for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, thus participating in redox processes. Glycated albumin makes a significant contribution to the pathogenesis of diabetes and other diseases. The interaction of albumin with blood cells, blood vessels and tissue cells outside the vascular bed is of great importance. Interactions with endothelial glycocalyx and vascular endothelial cells largely determine the integrative role of albumin. This review considers the esterase, antioxidant, transporting and signaling properties of albumin, as well as its structural and functional modifications and their significance in the pathogenesis of certain diseases.","Belinskaia, Daria A.; Voronina, Polina A.; Shmurak, Vladimir I.; Jenkins, Richard O.; Goncharov, Nikolay V.",Int J Mol Sci,410,24

Multiple studies have assessed the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of virus-specific immunity in COVID-19 convalescents, however, some aspects of the development of memory T-cell responses after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection remain uncovered. Methods: In most of published studies T-cell immunity to the new coronavirus is assessed using peptides corresponding to SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes, or with peptide pools covering various parts of the viral proteins. Here, we determined the level of CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory T-cell responses in COVID-19 convalescents by stimulating PBMCs collected 1 to 6 months after recovery with sucrose gradient-purified live SARS-CoV-2. IFNγ production by the central and effector memory helper and cytotoxic T cells was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining assay and flow cytometry. Results: Stimulation of PBMCs with live SARS-CoV-2 revealed IFNγ-producing T-helper effector memory cells with CD4(+)CD45RA(−)CCR7(−) phenotype, which persisted in circulation for up to 6 month after COVID-19. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNγ-secreting cytotoxic effector memory T cells were found at significant levels only shortly after the disease, but rapidly decreased over time. Conclusion: The stimulation of immune cells with live SARS-CoV-2 revealed a rapid decline in the pool of effector memory CD8(+), but not CD4(+), T cells after recovery from COVID-19. These data provide additional information on the development and persistence of cellular immune responses after natural infection, and can inform further development of T cell-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Matyushenko, Victoria; Isakova-Sivak, Irina; Kudryavtsev, Igor; Goshina, Arina; Chistyakova, Anna; Stepanova, Ekaterina; Prokopenko, Polina; Sychev, Ivan; Rudenko, Larisa",Viruses,410,1

Here, we sought to identify the neural substrates underlying the relationship between PB and alcohol misuse. METHODS: We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 61 problem drinkers to characterize the functional connectivity of the hypothalamus and ventral striatum (VS) in relation to PB. We specifically examined whether the connectivities of the hypothalamus and VS were differentially influenced by PB to produce contrasting effects on alcohol use. Finally, we evaluated how individual differences in social support modulate the inter-relationships of social isolation, neural connectivity, and the severity of problem drinking. RESULTS: Whole-brain multiple regressions show a positive relationship between PB and hypothalamic connectivity with the hippocampus and an inverse pattern for VS connectivity with the middle frontal gyrus. Difference in strength between the 2 connectivities predicted the severity of problem drinking, suggesting an imbalance involving elevated hypothalamic and diminished prefrontal cortical modulation in socially isolated problem drinkers. A path analysis further revealed that the lack of social support was associated with a bias toward low prefrontal connectivity, which in turn increased PB and facilitated problem drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Altered hypothalamus and VS connectivity may underlie problem drinking induced by social isolation. The current findings also highlight the important role of social support as a potential protective factor against alcohol misuse.","Le, Thang M; Wang, Wuyi; Zhornitsky, Simon; Dhingra, Isha; Chen, Yu; Zhang, Sheng; Li, Chiang-Shan R",Int J Neuropsychopharmacol,410,24

Individuals with diabetes and poor glycemic control have an even worse prognosis. Despite of the need/effectiveness of social distancing measures (i.e.: home confinement, quarantine and/or lockdown) during COVID-19 outbreak, preliminary findings showed an increase in negative behaviors during COVID-19 home confinement (i.e.: ~33.5% reduction in physical activity, ~28.6% (~3.10h) increase in sedentary behavior (i.e.: daily sitting, reclining and lying down time), and more unhealthy food consumption and meal pattern), which may have important clinical implications. For example, we estimated that this reduction in physical activity can increase the cases of type 2 diabetes (from ~7.2% to ~9.6%; ~11.1 million cases per year) and all-cause mortality (from ~9.4% to ~12.5%; ~1.7 million deaths per year) worldwide. Few weeks of reduction in physical activity levels result in deleterious effects on several cardiometabolic (i.e.: glycemic control, body composition, inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, vascular function…) and functional parameters (i.e.: cardiorespiratory/muscle fitness, balance, agility…). In contrast, physical activity and exercise are important tools for preventing and treating diabetes and others NCDs. Home-based exercise programs are useful, safe and effective for the management of diabetes, and could be widely used during COVID-19 outbreak. In this context, there is an urgent need for recommending physical activity/exercise, during and beyond COVID-19 outbreak, for improving the management of diabetes, as well as to prevent the increase in global burden of COVID-19, diabetes and others NCDs.","Marçal, Isabela Roque; Fernandes, Bianca; Viana, Ariane Aparecida; Ciolac, Emmanuel Gomes",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),410,22

TAM signaling, which has largely studied in the immune system and in cancer, has been involved in coagulation-related pathologies. Because of these established biological functions, the GAS6-PROS1/TAM system is postulated to play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression complications. The participation of the TAM system in vascular function and pathology has been previously reported. However, in the context of COVID-19, the role of TAMs could provide new clues in virus-host interplay with important consequences in the way that we understand this pathology. From the viral mimicry used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells, to the immunothrombosis that is associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, TAM signaling seems to be involved at different stages of the disease. TAM targeting is becoming an interesting biomedical strategy, which is useful for COVID-19 treatment now, but also for other viral and inflammatory diseases in the future.","Tutusaus, Anna; Marí, Montserrat; Ortiz-Pérez, José T.; Nicolaes, Gerry A.

METHODS: A cohort of 55 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was prospectively recruited – blood sampling was performed at baseline, post-treatment and hospital discharge. Serum IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory investigations were compared between treatment groups and across timepoints. Acute serum IL-6 and CRP levels were then compared to those with suspected COVID-19 (SCOVID) and age and sex matched patients with SAB and patients hospitalized for any non-infectious condition (NIC). RESULTS: IL-6 was elevated at admission in the SARS-CoV-2 cohort but at lower levels compared to matched SAB patients. Median (IQR) IL-6 at admission was 73.89 pg/mL (30.9, 126.39) in SARS-CoV-2 compared to 92.76 pg/mL (21.75, 246.55) in SAB (p=0.017); 12.50 pg/mL (3.06, 35.77) in patients with NIC; and 95.51 pg/mL (52.17, 756.67) in SCOVID. Median IL-6 and CRP levels decreased between admission and discharge timepoints. This reduction was amplified in patients treated with remdesivir and/or dexamethasone. CRP and bedside vital signs were the strongest predictors of COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the kinetics of IL-6 did not offer enhanced predictive value for disease severity in COVID-19 over common investigations such as CRP and vital signs.","Copaescu, Ana; James, Fiona; Mouhtouris, Effie; Vogrin, Sara; Smibert, Olivia C.; Gordon, Claire L.; Drewett, George; Holmes, Natasha E.; Trubiano, Jason A.",Front Immunol,410,23

The aim of this retrospective study is to estimate the impact that remdesivir—the first drug for COVID-19 approved in the EU—would have had in the first wave. METHODS: This study simulated the impact that remdesivir could have had on the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) capacity (bed occupancy) and the number of deaths that could have been prevented, based on two scenarios: a real-life scenario (without remdesivir) and an alternative scenario (with remdesivir). It considered the clinical results of the ACTT-1 trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia who required supplemental oxygen. The occupancy rates in general wards and ICUs were estimated in both scenarios. RESULTS: Remdesivir use could have prevented the admission of 2587 patients (43.75%) in the ICUs. It could have also increased the SNHS capacity in 5656 general wards beds and 1700 ICU beds, showing an increase in the number of beds available of 17.53% (95% CI 3.98%–24.42%) and 23.98% (95% CI 21.33%–28.22%), respectively, at the peak of the occupancy rates. Furthermore, remdesivir use could have prevented 7639 deaths due to COVID-19, which implies a 27.51% reduction (95% CI 14.25%–34.07%).

It is necessary to understand the impact of the pandemic among this population to address health care needs, reduce transmission, and diminish COVID-19-related morbidity. Methods: Thirty interviews were conducted with asylum seekers and health care professionals in a temporary camp in Matamoros, Mexico to determine challenges, perceptions, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were coded in NVivo12 by using a team-based approach. Results: The pandemic caused significant mental health burdens but no perceived adverse physical effects, with the U.S. border closure and health care access barriers as more pressing concerns. Participants reported access to information about COVID-19 but had varied levels of knowledge and adherence to disease reduction strategies due to camp conditions. Most participants believed that they had special protection from COVID-19, including strong immune systems or from God. The nongovernmental organizations providing health care and sanitation faced multiple challenges to implement new policies to manage COVID-19. The institution of required temperature checks and quarantine of COVID-19 positive patients led to distrust, decreased seeking of health care services among asylum seekers, and possible underreporting of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Our findings among asylum seekers in a Matamoros camp highlight the challenges to implementing disease reduction policies in low-resource congregate camps. Policies to address disease outbreaks focusing on the social determinants of health, health care access barriers, and community engagement may be more acceptable to asylum seekers, suggesting the need for effective strategies to provide prevention information that complements such measures.","Reynolds, Christopher W.; Ramanathan, Vidya; Lorenzana, Elena; Das, Porag J.; Sagal, Kyra M.; Lozada-Soto, Kristen M.; Deda, Linda Camaj; Haque, Anisa S.; Schmitzberger, Florian F.; Quiroga, Grecia; Raven, Sarah A.; Heisler, Michele",Health Equity,410,11

Millions of people lost their lives to this pandemic. While a lot of efforts are being invested in vaccinating the population, there is also an emergent requirement to find potential therapeutics to effectively counter this fast mutating SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced pathogenicity. Virus-infected host cells switch their metabolism to a more glycolytic phenotype. This switch induced by the virus is needed for faster production of ATP and higher levels of glycolytic intermediates, which are required for anabolic processes such as fatty acid synthesis and nucleotide generation for new virion synthesis and packaging. In this study, we used 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) to target and inhibit the metabolic reprogramming induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results showed that virus infection induces glucose influx and glycolysis resulting in selective high accumulation of the fluorescent glucose/2-DG analogue, 2-NBDG in these cells. Subsequently, 2-DG reduces the virus multiplication and alleviates the cells from infection-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death. Herein, we demonstrate that progeny virions produced from 2-DG treated cells are defective with compromised infectivity potential. Further, it was also observed that mannose inhibits 2-NBDG uptake at a very low concentration, suggesting that 2-DG uptake in virus-infected cells might be exploiting the specific mannose transporter or high-affinity glucose transporter, GLUT3, which was found to be increased on SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, our findings suggest that 2-DG effectively inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 multiplication and can be used as a treatment regimen.

The Coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Studies report both a severe inflammatory syndrome and a procoagulant state in severe COVID-19 cases, with an increase of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this context, we discuss the use of doppler ultrasonography (DUS) in the screening and diagnosis of DVT in ambulatory and hospitalized patients with, or suspected of having, COVID-19, outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Material and Methods. Non-systematic review of the literature. Results. In patients hospitalized for or suspected of COVID-19 infection with the presence of either a) DVT clinical symptoms, b) a strong DVT clinical probability (Wells score > 2) or c) elevated D-dimer levels without DVT clinical symptoms and without PE on lung CT angio-scan, DVT should be investigated with DUS. In the presence of PE diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically, additional systematic DVT screening using DUS is not recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of 4-points compression DUS for DVT screen and diagnosis is the most appropriate method in this context. Discussion. Systematic DUS for DVT screening in asymptomatic COVID patients is not recommended unless the patient is in the ICU. This would increase the risk of unnecessarily exposing medical staff to SARS-CoV-2 and monopolizing limited resources during this period.","Maxime, Sebuhyan; Raphaël, Mirailles; Benjamin, Crichi; Corinne, Frere; Philippe, Bonnin; Anne, Bergeron-Lafaurie; Denis, Blandine; Geoffroy, Liegon; Peyronie, Olivier; Dominique, Farge",J Med Vasc,410,16

However, the relative efficiency of social distancing against COVID-19 remains controversial, since social distancing and isolation/quarantine were implemented almost at the same time in China. METHODS: In this study, surveillance data of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in the year 2018-2020 were used to quantify the relative efficiency of NPIs against COVID-19 in China, since isolation/quarantine was not used for the influenza epidemics. Given that the relative age-dependent susceptibility to influenza and COVID-19 may vary, an age-structured Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model was built to explore the efficiency of social distancing against COVID-19 under different population susceptibility scenarios. RESULTS: The mean effective reproductive number, R(t), of COVID-19 before NPIs was 2.12 (95% confidential interval (CI): 2.02-2.21). By March 11, 2020, the overall reduction in R(t) of COVID-19 was 66.1% (95% CI: 60.1%-71.2%). In the epidemiological year 2019/20, influenza transmissibility reduced by 34.6% (95% CI: 31.3%-38.2%) compared with that in the epidemiological year 2018/19. Under the observed contact patterns changes in China, social distancing had similar efficiency against COVID-19 in three different scenarios. By assuming same efficiency of social distancing against seasonal influenza and COVID-19 transmission, isolation/quarantine and social distancing could lead to a 48.1% (95% CI: 35.4%-58.1%) and 34.6% (95% CI: 31.3%-38.2%) reduction of the transmissibility of COVID-19.

It is critical for global vaccine community to work together to secure effective progress towards animal welfare and to ensure that vaccines of ever higher quality can reach the populations in need in the shortest possible timeframe. Advancements in the field, case studies, and experiences from Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) were the topics discussed by an international gathering of experts during a recent conference titled “Animal Testing for Vaccines – Implementing Replacement, Reduction and Refinement: Challenges and Priorities”. This conference was organized by the International Alliance for Biological Standardization (IABS), and held in Bangkok, Thailand on December 3 and 4 2019. Participants comprised stakeholders from many parts of the world, including vaccine developers, manufacturers and regulators from Asia, Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In interactive workshops and vibrant panel discussions, the attendees worked together to identify the remaining barriers to validation, acceptance and implementation of alternative methods, and how harmonization could be promoted, especially for LMICs.","Akkermans, Arnoud; Chapsal, Jean-Michel; Coccia, Eliana M.; Depraetere, Hilde; Dierick, Jean-François; Duangkhae, Parichat; Goel, Sunil; Halder, Marlies; Hendriksen, Coenraad; Levis, Robin; Pinyosukhee, Koraphong; Pullirsch, Dieter; Sanyal, Gautam; Shi, Li; Sitrin, Robert; Smith, Dean; Stickings, Paul; Terao, Eriko; Uhlrich, Sylvie; Viviani, Laura; Webster, Jim",Biologicals,410,10

This makes them inappropriate for evaluating testing and contact tracing strategies to contain an outbreak. An alternative used in practice is the application of agent- or individual-based models (ABM). However ABMs are complex, less well-understood and much more computationally expensive. This paper presents a new method for accurately including the effects of Testing, contact-Tracing and Isolation (TTI) strategies in standard compartmental models. We derive our method using a careful probabilistic argument to show how contact tracing at the individual level is reflected in aggregate on the population level. We show that the resultant SEIR-TTI model accurately approximates the behaviour of a mechanistic agent-based model at far less computational cost. The computationally efficiency is such that it be easily and cheaply used for exploratory modelling to quantify the required levels of testing and tracing, alone and with other interventions, to assist adaptive planning for managing disease outbreaks.","Sturniolo, S.; Waites, W.; Colbourn, T.; Manheim, D.; Panovska-Griffiths, J.",,410,1

In recent history, the deployment of surge medical facilities and their importance in improving the provision of crisis care became relevant. The primary objective of this study was to describe the development and implementation of an alternate care site (ACS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a retrospective, single-center study that was conducted between April 7, 2020, and May 26, 2020, of adult patients from a primary facility admitted to an ACS, labeled Staten Island University Hospital East (SIUH-E). These select patients met specific inclusion criteria for SIUH-E before transfer. Results During the operational course of SIUH-E, 813 patients were screened and 203 patients were accepted for transfer. Of the patients admitted to SIUH-E, 120 (59%) were male. The mean age was 63 years (SD = 13.91). The mean length of stay was 3.93 days (SD = 3.94). Among discharged patients, 179 (88%) were discharged to home or another long-term facility, whereas 24 (12%) patients required a transfer back to the main campus. Conclusions In this study, we describe the development and implementation of an alternate care surge facility during the COVID-19 pandemic. SIUH-E played a vital role in effectively caring for select COVID-19 patients, which allowed the primary facilities to treat a greater volume of higher acuity patients. The combined efforts of the state and hospital were able to create and sustain a safe, practical alternative care facility.","Mathews, Kurien; Podlog, Mikhail; Greenstein, Josh; Cioè‐Peña, Eric; Cambria, Bartholomew; Ardolic, Brahim; Hahn, Barry; Basile, Joseph",Cureus,410,6

Here, we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed at high levels in yeast (Pichia pastoris), as a suitable vaccine candidate against COVID-19. After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel® were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-γ IL-6, and IL-10 secretion, among other cytokines. Overall, these data suggest that the RBD219-N1C1 recombinant protein, produced in yeast, is suitable for further evaluation as a human COVID-19 vaccine, in particular, in an Alhydrogel® containing formulation and possibly in combination with other immunostimulants.","Pollet, Jeroen; Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Versteeg, Leroy; Keegan, Brian; Zhan, Bin; Wei, Junfei; Liu, Zhuyun; Lee, Jungsoon; Kundu, Rahki; Adhikari, Rakesh; Poveda, Cristina; Villar, Maria Jose; de Araujo Leao, Ana Carolina; Altieri Rivera, Joanne; Momin, Zoha; Gillespie, Portia M.; Kimata, Jason T.; Strych, Ulrich; Hotez, Peter J.; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,410,1

In this paper, a vehicle driver drowsiness detection method using wearable electroencephalographic (EEG) based on convolution neural network (CNN) is proposed. The presented method consists of three parts: data collection using wearable EEG, vehicle driver drowsiness detection and the early warning strategy. Firstly, a wearable brain computer interface (BCI) is used to monitor and collect the EEG signals in the simulation environment of drowsy driving and awake driving. Secondly, the neural networks with Inception module and modified AlexNet module are trained to classify the EEG signals. Finally, the early warning strategy module will function and it will sound an alarm if the vehicle driver is judged as drowsy. The method was tested on driving EEG data from simulated drowsy driving. The results show that using neural network with Inception module reached 95.59% classification accuracy based on one second time window samples and using modified AlexNet module reached 94.68%. The simulation and test results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed drowsiness detection method for vehicle driving safety.","Zhu, Miankuan; Chen, Jiangfan; Li, Haobo; Liang, Fujian; Han, Lei; Zhang, Zutao",Neural Comput Appl,410,20

Methods National REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) seroprevalence study using self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG among a random population sample of 100,000 adults over 18 years in England, 20 June to 13 July 2020. Results Completed questionnaires were available for 109,076 participants, yielding 5,544 IgG positive results and adjusted (for test performance), re-weighted (for sampling) prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8, 6.1). Highest prevalence was in London (13.0% [12.3, 13.6]), among people of Black or Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity (17.3% [15.8, 19.1] and 11.9% [11.0, 12.8] respectively) and those aged 18-24 years (7.9% [7.3, 8.5]).

One third (32.2%, [31.0-33.4]) of antibody positive individuals reported no symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, the majority (78.8%) reported symptoms during the peak of the epidemic in England in March (31.3%) and April (47.5%) 2020.

However, there is a need for peer-reviewed scientific evidence to support these trends. The goals of this preliminary study were to investigate possible differences in the number of animals entering and exiting animal shelters in the Northeastern United States and describe changes that shelters made to their usual operations in response to COVID-19. Fourteen animal shelters completed an anonymous, online survey between 2 November and 31 December 2020. Fewer dogs and cats were admitted to animal shelters and adopted between March–June 2020 compared with the same months of 2019. We found that the proportion of animals who were adopted or euthanized did not differ between the years, although there were considerable differences between the shelters. While many shelters endeavored to recruit new foster caregivers during the pandemic, the overall proportion of animals who spent time in foster care was no greater in 2020 compared with 2019. Our study provides pilot data about how the COVID-19 pandemic affected animal shelter operations and illustrates the range of different experiences of animal shelters in the Northeastern United States. ABSTRACT: Anecdotal reports indicate that many animal shelters experienced increased adoption and foster care rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet peer-reviewed evidence is lacking. In this pilot survey of 14 animal shelters in the Northeastern United States, we aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animal intakes, foster care and five outcome types and describe operational changes reported by shelters in response to COVID-19. Paired sample t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare intake, adoption, euthanasia and foster care rates and numbers between March–June 2019 and 2020. The number of dogs and cats that entered shelters was significantly lower during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the same months of 2019 (t = 3.41, p = 0.01, t = 2.69, p = 0.02). Although the overall rate of adoption and euthanasia did not differ, the numbers adopted and euthanized decreased significantly for both dogs and cats, reflecting the significantly decreased intake. We also found significant variability between shelters. During the pandemic, several shelters sought to expand their foster care networks through operational changes (n = 6) and statements made to the public (n = 7). However, the proportion of dogs and cats housed in foster care did not differ between March–June 2019 and 2020 in our sample. Our findings offer preliminary insights regarding the impact of a worldwide pandemic on the functioning of animal shelters.","Powell, Lauren; Houlihan, Caitlin; Stone, Martha; Gitlin, Ilana; Ji, Xuke; Reinhard, Chelsea L.; Watson, Brittany",Animals (Basel),410,20

The aim of this study was to better understand the effectiveness of low-dose emetine for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In this real-world study, 63 patients with mild or common COVID-19 were recruited from Wuhan Fangcang Shelter Hospital and five COVID-19-designated hospitals in Anhui Province, China from February to March 2020. Thirty-nine patients from Wuhan Fangcang Shelter Hospital were assigned to a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial, and 24 patients from the 5 COVID-19-designated hospitals in Anhui Province underwent a real-world study. The medication course of emetine was less than 10 days. The main symptoms and adverse reactions of all patients were observed and recorded. The primary outcome measure was the time required for a negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA result or the negative result rate on day 10. Secondary outcomes included axillary temperature, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, and respiratory frequency recovery. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University on February 20, 2019 (approval No. PJ2020-03-19) and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on February 20, 2019 (registration number: ChiCTR2000030022). RESULTS: The oxygen saturation values were higher in the treatment group than in the control group on the first day after enrollment for patients treated at Fangcang Shelter Hospital. The axillary body temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation among patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital were related to the time effect but not to the intervention measures. The respiratory rate and oxygen saturation of patients in the Anhui designated hospitals were related to the intervention measures but not to the time effect. The axillary body temperature of patients in Anhui designated hospitals was related to the time effect but not to the intervention measures. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary study shows that low-dose emetine combined with basic conventional antiviral drugs improves clinical symptoms in patients with mild and common COVID-19 without apparent adverse effects, suggesting that moderately increased doses of emetine may have good potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.","Fan, Song; Zhen, Qi; Chen, Cheng; Wang, Wenjun; Wu, Qibing; Ma, Huihui; Zhang, Chengyuan; Zhang, Li; Lu, Baojing; Ge, Huiyao; Yong, Liang; Li, Bao; Yu, Yafen; Chen, Weiwei; Mao, Yiwen; Qu, Guangbo; Su, Li; Wang, Aoli; Ding, Zhen; Li, Haiwen; Zhang, Jin; Wang, Yonglian; Gao, Yufeng; Xu, Xihai; Zhu, Zhongming; Chen, Jun; Zhang, Long; Liang, Hongqiang; Wu, Song; Huang, Meng; Xia, Quan; Li, Ping; Sun, Yehuan; Liang, Chaozhao; Wei, Wei; Liu, Qingsong; Sun, Liangdan",J BioX Res,410,1

METHODS: This was a single-center simulation study performed from December 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. Each participant underwent quantitative fit test (QNFT) of N95 respirators according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration protocol. Adequacy of respirator fit was represented by the fit factor (FF), which is calculated as the number of ambient particles divided by the number inside the respirator. We divided all participants into the group that passed the overall fit test but failed at least one individual exercise (partially passed group [PPG]) and the group that passed all exercises (all passed group [APG]). Then, the participants performed three sessions of continuous chest compressions, each with a duration of 2 min, while undergoing real-time fit testing. The primary outcome was any failure (FF < 100) of the fit test during the three bouts of chest compression. RESULTS: Forty-four participants passed the QNFT. Overall, 73% (n = 32) of the participants failed at least one of the three sessions of chest compression; the number of participants who failed was significantly higher in the PPG than in the APG (94% vs. 61%; p = 0.02). Approximately 18% (n = 8) of the participants experienced mask fit failures, such as strap slipping. CONCLUSIONS: Even if the participants passed the QNFT, the N95 respirator did not provide adequate protection against respiratory infections during chest compression.","Hwang, Sung Yeon; Yoon, Hee; Yoon, Aerin; Kim, Taerim; Lee, Guntak; Jung, Kwang Yul; Park, Joo Hyun; Shin, Tae Gun; Cha, Won Chul; Sim, Min Seob; Kim, Seonwoo",Am J Emerg Med,410,1

This study was to evaluate CO(2) levels in dental operatories and determine the accuracy of using CO(2) levels to assess ventilation rate in dental clinics. Mechanical ventilation rate in air change per hour (ACH(VENT)) was measured with an air velocity sensor and airflow balancing hood. CO(2) levels were measured in these rooms to analyze factors that contributed to CO(2) accumulation. Ventilation rates were estimated using natural steady-state CO(2) levels during dental treatments and experimental CO(2) concentration decays by dry ice or mixing baking soda and vinegar. We compared the differences and assessed the correlations between ACH(VENT) and ventilation rates estimated by the steady-state CO(2) model with low (0.3 L/min, ACH(SS30)) or high (0.46 L/min, ACH(SS46)) CO(2) generation rates, by CO(2) decay constants using dry ice (ACH(DI)) or baking soda (ACH(BV)), and by time needed to remove 63% of excess CO(2) generated by dry ice (ACH(DI63%)) or baking soda (ACH(BV63%)). We found that ACH(VENT) varied from 3.9 to 35.0 in dental operatories. CO(2) accumulation occurred in rooms with low ventilation (ACH(VENT) ≤6) and overcrowding but not in those with higher ventilation. ACH(SS30) and ACH(SS46) correlated well with ACH(VENT) (r = 0.83, P = 0.003), but ACH(SS30) was more accurate for rooms with low ACH(VENT). Ventilation rates could be reliably estimated using CO(2) released from dry ice or baking soda. ACH(VENT) was highly correlated with ACH(DI) (r = 0.99), ACH(BV) (r = 0.98), ACH(DI63%) (r = 0.98), and ACH(BV63%) (r = 0.98). There were no statistically significant differences between ACH(VENT) and ACH(DI63%) or ACH(BV63%). We conclude that ventilation rates could be conveniently and accurately assessed by observing the changes in CO(2) levels after a simple mixing of household baking soda and vinegar in dental settings.","Huang, Q.; Marzouk, T.; Cirligeanu, R.; Malmstrom, H.; Eliav, E.; Ren, Y.-F.",J Dent Res,410,28

This creates a barrier to the strategic development of disease control solutions for livestock, companion animals and wildlife that not only affects animal health but can affect human health by increasing the risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens. There have been a number of projects aimed at reducing the capability gaps in the veterinary immunological toolbox, the majority of these focusing on livestock species. Various approaches have been taken to veterinary immunological reagent development across the globe and technological advances in molecular biology and protein biochemistry have accelerated toolbox development. While short-term funding initiatives can address specific gaps in capability, they do not account for long-term sustainability of reagents and databases that requires a different funding model. We review the past, present and future of the veterinary immunological toolbox with specific reference to recent developments discussed at the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Veterinary Immunology Committee (VIC) Immune Toolkit Workshop at the 12th International Veterinary Immunology Symposium (IVIS) in Seattle, USA, 16–19 August 2019.

Initially, enthusiasm was high regarding their implementation as a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI). Yet, no country was able to prevent larger outbreaks without falling back to harsher NPIs, and the total effect of digital contact tracing remains elusive. Based on the results of empirical studies and modeling efforts, we show that digital contact tracing apps might have prevented cases on the order of single-digit percentages up until now, at best. We show that this poor impact can be attributed to a combination of low participation rates, a non-flexible reliance on symptom-based testing, low engagement of participants, and delays between testing and test result upload. We find that contact tracing does not change the epidemic threshold and exclusively prevents more cases during the supercritical phase of an epidemic, making it unfit as a tool to prevent outbreaks. Locally clustered contact structures may increase the intervention's efficacy, but only if the number of contacts per individual is homogeneously distributed, a condition usually not found in contact networks. Our results suggest that policy makers cannot rely on digital contact tracing to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 or similar diseases.","Burdinski, A.; Brockmann, D.; Maier, B. F.",,410,15

MATERIALS & METHODS: A literature search was conducted on April 21, 2020 and updated on July 24, 2020 using PubMed, Embase, World Health Organization, and Google Scholar. Only studies which described chest CT findings of COVID-19 in pregnant patients were included for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 67 articles and 427 pregnant patients were analyzed. The most frequently encountered pulmonary findings on chest CT of pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (77.2%, 250/324), posterior involvement (72.5%, 50/69), multilobar involvement (71.8%, 239/333), bilateral lung involvement (69.4%, 231/333), peripheral distribution (68.1%, 98/144), and consolidation (40.9%, 94/230). Pregnant patients were also found to present more frequently with consolidation (40.9% vs. 21.0–31.8%) and pleural effusion (30.0% vs. 5.0%). Clinical findings included antepartum fever (198 cases), lymphopenia (128 cases), and neutrophilia (97 cases). Of the 251 neonates delivered to mothers with COVID-19, 96.8% of the neonates had negative RT-PCR and/or IgG antibody testing. In the eight cases (3.2%) of reported neonatal infection, tests were either conducted up to 72 h after birth or were found negative on all subsequent RT-PCR tests. CONCLUSION: Pregnant patients appear to present with more advanced COVID-19 CT findings than those of the general adult population. The changes in laboratory values found in pregnant patients also mirror those found in the general patient population. Lastly, results from neonatal testing suggest low risk of vertical transmission. SUMMARY STATEMENT: The initial chest CT scans of 427 pregnant patients with COVID-19 showed higher rates of consolidation and pleural effusion in comparison to the general population.","Oshay, Rachel R.; Chen, Michael Y.C.; Fields, Brandon K.K.; Demirjian, Natalie L.; Lee, Ryan S.; Mosallaei, Daniel; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,410,16

Objective: To determine socio-demographic factors associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore mediating pathways for race disparities in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Design: Cross sectional analysis of COVID-19 Surveillance and Outcomes Registry (CURATOR). Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to provide likelihood estimates (adjusted Odds Ratios: aOR, 95% confidence intervals: CI) of positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework was utilized to explore three mediation pathways (low income, high population density, high comorbidity burden) for association between African American race and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Setting: A large healthcare system comprising of one central tertiary care, seven large community hospitals and an expansive ambulatory and emergency care network in the Greater Houston area. Participants: Individuals of all ages, races, ethnicities and sex tested for SARS-CoV-2. Exposure: Socio-demographic (age, sex, race, ethnicity, household income, residence population density) and comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiac disease) factors. Main Outcome: Positive reverse transcriptase polymerized chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 4,513 tested individuals, 754 (16.7%) tested positive. Overall mean (SD) age was 50.6 (18.9) years, 62% females and 26% were African American. African American race was associated with higher comorbidity burden, lower socio-economic status, and higher population density residence. In the fully adjusted model, African American race (vs. White; aOR, CI: 1.84, 1.49-2.27) and Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic; aOR, CI: 1.70, 1.35-2.14) had a higher likelihood of infection. Older individuals and males were also at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SEM framework demonstrated a statistically significant (p = 0.008) indirect effect of African American race on SARS-CoV-2 infection mediated via a pathway that included residence in densely populated zip code.

In 2012, a multivariate panel analysis developed by Chen and Haynes was applied to the Chinese regions to quantify the HSR impact on tourism output. The Chinese experience confirmed that, during the period 1999-2010, emerging high speed rail services did have significant positive impacts on boosting tourism in China. Since them, no similar empirical tool has ever been tested in Europe. The aim of this paper is to analyze and validate the suitability of this tool to assess empirically the effects of HSR on Spanish tourism during the period 1999-2014, and to enhance the abovementioned model with a tourism database. With more than 20 years’ HSR experience, and operating the longest HSR network in Europe (2,900 km), Spain offers a good scenario for this model application because Spanish tourism sector represents 10.2% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Results clearly show that there is a direct linkage between the evolution of certain Spanish tourism outputs and the construction of the HSR network. However, authorś recommendations include future new research on some variables limitations like the type of tourism output considered or the consideration of alternative explanatory indicators.","Guirao, B.; Campa, J.

However, considering its novel nature, it is important to create awareness among the public to be able to take timely preventive measures. On the contrary, misinformation and myths from online communities result in severe damages in mitigation of this novel disease. Objective: Focusing on these aspects, this manuscript reviews public awareness about COVID-19, myths surrounding it, its symptoms, treatment, transmission, importance of information sources, types of information to be considered in awareness campaigns, promotional channels, and their implications in Saudi Arabia. Methods: An online questionnaire-based survey was used for collecting data related to five major aspects related to COVID-19 and awareness creation process. The survey was accessed by 1,881 people, out of whom 741 people participated in the survey. However, 150 dropouts left the survey in between, as a result of which a final sample of 591 was achieved, indicating the response rate of 39.3% and a completion rate of 79.76%. Results: Awareness levels of the participants related to COVID-19, its means of transmission, preventive measures, symptoms, and treatment were identified to be moderate to high (60–80%). However, reliance on a few myths and violation of certain preventive measures were identified with majority of the participants (more than 60%). The Ministry of Health was identified to be the most reliable source of information followed by family and friends. Moreover, 15 types of information were identified to be highly relevant and important, which need to be effectively disseminated among the public through effective communication channels. Conclusions: Lack of awareness can result in serious outcomes in relation to COVID-19. Effective awareness campaigns including relevant information from reliable sources can improve the knowledge of people, and they must be effective in developing positive attitudes among the public toward adopting preventive measures.","Alanezi, Fahad; Aljahdali, Anan; Alyousef, Seham; Alrashed, Hebah; Alshaikh, Wyam; Mushcab, Hayat; Alanzi, Turki",Front Public Health,410,30

These chemokines are components of innate immune response to respiratory tract pathogens. We examined the promoter variants of CXCL-10 and their role in predisposition to tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: The promoter 1.8 kb of CXCL-10 was sequenced in 24 healthy Chinese individuals to identify genetic polymorphisms. Three tagging SNPs in CXCL-10 promoter (− 1447A > G, − 872G > A, − 135G > A) were selected, and genotyping were performed in 240 TB patients and 176 healthy Chinese subjects. Disease associations were examined by χ(2) and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: A promoter SNP (− 135G > A) with minor allele frequency of 0.1 showed a moderate association with TB both in genotype analysis (p = 0.01) and allelic analysis (p = 0.03); other tagging SNPs (− 1447A > G, − 872G > A) were not associated with TB. The odd ratio of the protective allele − 135G > A was 0.51(C.I 0.29 − 0.91) for homozygotes and heterozygotes carriers of the A allele. CONCLUSION: A new potential protective SNP (− 135G > A) for TB is identified in the promoter of chemokine gene, CXCL-10. Interestingly, the exact same allele has been shown to enhance IP-10 transactivation and susceptibility to Hepatitis B virus infection in a recent publication. This SNP, located at 14 bp upstream of a NF-kB binding site, might also account for the susceptibility to TB.

METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among community pharmacists from Saudi Arabia using a convenience sampling technique. An online questionnaire based on Google forms was used to collect data. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted using SPSS statistics 22. Student t-test, one way ANOVA, and Pearson correlation statistics were used where applicable. Results with a p-value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: One thousand and six community pharmacists responded to the survey. Males’ rating of their ability to operate medical devices was significantly higher than females (overall average score of 3.8 versus 3.5, p=0.033). As years of experience increased there were slight but significant increases in the overall scores on ability to operate medical devices (p=0.002) and confidence to counsel patients about the devices (p=0.032). Those who got a board certification used devices for self-treatment significantly more than their counterparts (on average 6.9 devices versus 5.2, p=0.003). Those who received clinical training reported higher rates of ability to use/operate devices (p=0.011), confidence to counsel patients on devices (p=0.001), and counseling practice (p=0.044) than those who did not receive clinical training.

Whereas passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable option, selection of optimal units for therapy and lack of clear therapeutic benefit from transfusion remain as barriers to the use of CCP. Study design and methods: To identify plasma that is expected to benefit recipients, we measured anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody levels using clinically available serological assays and correlated with the neutralizing activity of CCP from donors. Neutralizing titer of plasma samples was measured by assaying infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped retrovirus particles in the presence of dilutions of plasma samples. We also used this assay to identify evidence of passive transfusion of neutralizing activity in CCP recipients. Results: Viral neutralization and anti-spike protein antibodies in 109 samples from 87 plasma donors were highly varied but modestly correlated with each other. Recipients who died of COVID-19 were found to have been transfused with units with lower anti-spike antibody levels and neutralizing activity. Passive transfer of neutralization activity was documented in 62% of antibody naive plasma recipients.

As operative volumes decrease, cancer surgeries must be triaged and prioritized with careful thought and attention to ensure maximal benefit for the maximum number of patients. Peritoneal malignancies present a unique challenge, as surgical management can be resource intensive, but patients have limited non-surgical treatment options. This review summarizes current data on outcomes and resource utilization to help inform decision-making and case prioritization in times of constrained health care resources. Methods: A rapid literature review was performed, examining surgical and non-surgical outcomes data for peritoneal malignancies. Narrative data synthesis was cross-referenced with relevant societal guidelines. Peritoneal malignancy surgeons and medical oncologists reviewed recommendations to establish a national perspective on case triage and mitigating treatment strategies. Results and Conclusions: Triage of peritoneal malignancies during this time of restricted health care resource is nuanced and requires multidisciplinary discussion with consideration of individual patient factors. Prioritization should be given to patients where delay may compromise resectability of disease, and where alternative treatment options are lacking. Mitigating strategies such as systemic chemotherapy and/or surgical deferral may be utilized with close surveillance for disease stability or progression, which may affect surgical urgency. Unique hospital capacity, and ability to manage the complex post-operative course for these patients must also be considered to ensure patient and system needs are aligned.","Shariff, Farhana; Bischof, Danielle; Govindarajan, Anand; Prince, Rebecca; Burkes, Ronald; Haase, Erika; Mack, Lloyd; Temple, Walley; Hebbard, Pamela; Boulanger-Gobeil, Cindy; Giacomantonio, Carman; Brind’Amour, Alexandre; Sidéris, Lucas; Dubé, Pierre; Hamilton, Trevor; MacNeill, Andrea; Bouchard-Fortier, Antoine; Younan, Rami; McCart, Andrea",Curr Oncol,410,14

The potential use of estimands to improve trial research and reporting has been underpinned by the recent publication of the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on the use of estimands in clinical trials in 2019. We set out to assess how well estimands are described in published trial protocols. METHODS: We reviewed 50 trial protocols published in October 2020 in Trials and BMJ Open. For each protocol, we determined whether the estimand for the primary outcome was explicitly stated, not stated but inferable (i.e. could be constructed from the information given), or not inferable. RESULTS: None of the 50 trials explicitly described the estimand for the primary outcome, and in 74% of trials, it was impossible to infer the estimand from the information included in the protocol. The population attribute of the estimand could not be inferred in 36% of trials, the treatment condition attribute in 20%, the population-level summary measure in 34%, and the handling of intercurrent events in 60% (the strategy for handling non-adherence was not inferable in 32% of protocols, and the strategy for handling mortality was not inferable in 80% of the protocols for which it was applicable). Conversely, the outcome attribute was stated for all trials. In 28% of trials, three or more of the five estimand attributes could not be inferred. CONCLUSIONS: The description of estimands in published trial protocols is poor, and in most trials, it is impossible to understand exactly what treatment effect is being estimated. Given the utility of estimands to improve clinical research and reporting, this urgently needs to change.

Anxiety and depression are the most common symptoms. Objective: To evaluate the mental health of the Brazilian population during the SARs-CoV-2 pandemic and its relationship with demographic and health characteristics. Methods: Adults from all Brazilian States participated (n = 12,196; women: 69.8%, mean age = 35.2 years). The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Impact of Event Scale–revised were used (online survey). Data validity and reliability were verified by confirmatory factor analysis and ordinal alpha coefficient. The probability of presenting psychological symptoms was calculated by multiple logistic regression and odds ratio (OR) (0 = without symptoms, 1 = with mild, moderate, and severe levels of symptoms). Results: High prevalence of depression (61.3%), anxiety (44.2%), stress (50.8%), and psychological impact (54.9%) due to the isolation experienced from the pandemic was found. Younger individuals (OR = 1.58–3.58), those that felt unsafe (OR = 1.75–2.92), with a previous diagnosis of mental health (OR = 1.72–2.64) and/or had general health problems before the pandemic (OR = 1.17–1.51), who noticed changes in their mental state due to the pandemic context (OR = 2.53–9.07), and excessively exposed to the news (OR = 1.19–2.18) were at increased risk of developing symptoms. Women (OR = 1.35–1.65) and those with lower economic status (OR = 1.38–2.69) were more likely to develop psychological symptoms. Lower educational levels increased the likelihood of depressive (OR = 1.03–1.34) and intrusive symptoms (OR = 1.09–1.51).

We therefore aimed to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) in patients taking methotrexate and commonly used targeted biological therapies, compared with healthy controls. Given the roll-out of extended interval vaccination programmes to maximise population coverage, we present findings after the first dose. METHODS: In this cohort study, we recruited consecutive patients with a dermatologist-confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis who were receiving methotrexate or targeted biological monotherapy (tumour necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors, interleukin [IL]-17 inhibitors, or IL-23 inhibitors) from a specialist psoriasis centre serving London and South East England. Consecutive volunteers without psoriasis and not receiving systemic immunosuppression who presented for vaccination at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London, UK) were included as the healthy control cohort. All participants had to be eligible to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before and on day 28 (±2 days) after vaccination. The primary outcomes were humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, defined as neutralising antibody responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and spike-specific T-cell responses (including interferon-γ, IL-2, and IL-21) 28 days after vaccination. FINDINGS: Between Jan 14 and April 4, 2021, 84 patients with psoriasis (17 on methotrexate, 27 on TNF inhibitors, 15 on IL-17 inhibitors, and 25 on IL-23 inhibitors) and 17 healthy controls were included. The study population had a median age of 43 years (IQR 31–52), with 56 (55%) males, 45 (45%) females, and 85 (84%) participants of White ethnicity. Seroconversion rates were lower in patients receiving immunosuppressants (60 [78%; 95% CI 67–87] of 77) than in controls (17 [100%; 80–100] of 17), with the lowest rate in those receiving methotrexate (seven [47%; 21–73] of 15). Neutralising activity against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was significantly lower in patients receiving methotrexate (median 50% inhibitory dilution 129 [IQR 40–236]) than in controls (317 [213–487], p=0·0032), but was preserved in those receiving targeted biologics (269 [141–418]). Neutralising titres against the B.1.1.7 variant were similarly low in all participants. Cellular immune responses were induced in all groups, and were not attenuated in patients receiving methotrexate or targeted biologics compared with controls. INTERPRETATION: Functional humoral immunity to a single dose of BNT162b2 is impaired by methotrexate but not by targeted biologics, whereas cellular responses are preserved. Seroconversion alone might not adequately reflect vaccine immunogenicity in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases receiving therapeutic immunosuppression. Real-world pharmacovigilance studies will determine how these findings reflect clinical effectiveness.

The negative health outcomes for the COVID-19 infection have been most severe in the frail elderly dwelling in Canadian long-term care (LTC) homes. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey of Ontario LTC Clinicians working in LTC homes in Ontario Canada was conducted to provide the clinician perspective on the preparedness and engagement of the LTC sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey questionnaire was developed in collaboration with the Ontario Long-Term Care Clinicians organization (OLTCC) and was distributed between March 30, 2020 to May 25, 2020. All registered members of the OLTCC and Nurse-led LTC Outreach Teams were invited to participate. The primary outcomes were: 1) the descriptive report of the screening measures implemented, communication and information received, and the preparation of the respondent’s LTC home to a potential COVID-19 outbreak; and 2) the level of agreement, as reported using a five-point Likert scale), to COVID-19 preparedness statements for the respondent’s LTC home was also assessed. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 54% (160/294). LTC homes implemented a wide range of important interventions (e.g. instituting established respiratory isolation protocols, active screening of new LTC admissions, increasing education on infection control processes, encouraging sick staff to take time off, etc). Ample communications pertinent to the pandemic were received from provincial LTC organizations, the government and public health officials. However, the feasibility of implementing public health recommendations, as well as the engagement of the LTC sector in pandemic planning were identified as areas of concern. Medical director status was associated with an increased knowledge of local implementation of interventions to mitigate COVID-19, as well as endorsing increased access to reliable COVID-19 information and resources to manage a potential COVID-19 outbreak in their LTC home. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the communication and implementation of recommendations in the Ontario LTC sector, despite some concerns regarding feasibility. Importantly, LTC clinician respondents clearly indicated that better engagement with LTC leaders is needed to plan a coordinated pandemic response.

We show that, in equilibrium, whether the public firm engages in innovation more aggressively than the private firm depends on the degree of spillovers. Moreover, firms’ equilibrium locations exhibit neither maximal nor minimal differentiation. Finally, privatization could reduce social welfare because it may generate inefficient location and insufficient R&D investment. This suggests that a mixed duopoly could be socially preferable to a private duopoly in the presence of endogenous R&D spillovers.","Zhang, Jianhu; Li, Changying",Ann Reg Sci,410,5

In this study, we evaluated a series of molecules based on the plant (Cedrus deodara) derived α,β,γ-Himachalenes scaffolds. RESULTS: The results obtained from estimated affinity and ligand efficiency suggested that BCH10, BCH15, BCH16, and BCH17 could act as potential inhibitors of Nsp1. Moreover, MD simulations comprising various MD driven time-dependent analyses and thermodynamic free energy calculations also suggested stable protein-ligand complexes and strong interactions with the binding site. Furthermore, the selected molecules passed drug likeliness parameters and the physiochemical property analysis showed acceptable bioactivity scores.

We found that current valence ratings were significantly lower than the original ones from 2015. This negative shift correlated with key aspects of the personal situation during the confinement, including working and living status, and subjective well-being. These findings indicate that quarantine impacts mood negatively, resulting in a negatively biased perception of emotive stimuli.

To increase public awareness of exposure risks in daily activities, we propose a birthday-paradox-based probability model to implement in a web-based system, named COSRE (community social risk estimator) and make in-time community exposure risk estimation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We define exposure risk to mean the probability of people meeting potential cases in public places such as grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops, offices, etc. Our model has three inputs: the real-time number of active and asymptomatic cases, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the room. With COSRE, possible impacts of the pandemic can be explored through spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., a variable number of people may be projected into public places through time to assess changes of risk as the pandemic unfolds. The system has potential to advance understanding of the true exposure risks in various communities. It introduces an objective element to plan, prepare and respond during a pandemic. Spatial analysis tools are used to draw county-level exposure risks of the United States from April 1 to July 15, 2020. The correlation experiment with the new cases in the next two weeks shows that the risk estimation model offers promise in assisting people to be more precise about their personal safety and control of daily routine and social interaction.

Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is known to be effective in several hyperinflammatory diseases. We investigated the effects of anakinra on inflammatory parameters and clinical outcomes in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with clinical features of hyperinflammation. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with anakinra were compared to a group of standard care. Serial data of clinical inflammatory parameters and concentrations of multiple circulating cytokines were determined and aligned on start day of anakinra in the treatment group, and median start day of anakinra in the control group. Analysis was performed for day − 10 to + 10 relative to alignment day. Clinical outcomes were analyzed during 28 days. Additionally, three sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) using propensity score-matched groups, (2) selecting patients who did not receive corticosteroids, and (3) using a subset of the control group aimed to match the criteria (fever, elevated ferritin) for starting anakinra treatment. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics and clinical parameters on ICU admission were similar between groups. As a consequence of bias by indication, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) (p = 0.0002), ferritin (p = 0.009), and temperature (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the anakinra group on alignment day. Following treatment, no relevant differences in kinetics of circulating cytokines were observed between both groups. Decreases of clinical parameters, including temperature (p = 0.03), white blood cell counts (p = 0.02), and plasma levels of ferritin (p = 0.003), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), creatinine (p = 0.01), and bilirubin (p = 0.007), were more pronounced in the anakinra group. No differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay were observed between groups. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results.

Multi-chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics. We identify parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function. Results: The numerical simulation results exhibit the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the range of 25% fluctuation from simulation results. It is predicted by multi-chain models that Singapore are experiencing a nonnegligible risk of explosive outbreak, thus stronger measures are urgently needed to contain the epidemic. Conclusion: The multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model provides an effective way to early detect the appearance of imported infectors and super spreaders and forecast a second outbreak. It can also explain the data in those countries where the single-chain model shows deviation from the data.","Pan, Hanshuang; Shao, Nian; Yan, Yue; Luo, Xinyue; Wang, Shufen; Ye, Ling; Cheng, Jin; Chen, Wenbin",,410,1

Materials and Methods: The data of 5628 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The maximum level of morbidity during hospital admission was classified as mild or severe, and patient mortality was recorded. Clinical symptoms were categorized as respiratory, gastrointestinal, general, and neurologic symptoms. The hazard ratios (HRs) for clinical symptoms associated with mortality were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The odds ratios (ORs) for clinical symptoms associated with morbidity were analyzed using the logistic regression model. Results: Of the included COVID-19 patients, 15.4% (808/5253) were classified as having severe morbidity. Morbidity was related to the clinical symptoms of cough, sputum, shortness of breath, vomiting/nausea, diarrhea, fever, and altered mental status or confusion. According to the symptom categories, respiratory and general symptoms were related to high morbidity (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.30–1.53, p < 0.001 for respiratory symptom and OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.18–1.59, p < 0.001 for general symptom).

Recent experiences of emerging microbial threats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome and new influenza variants affecting humans, the re-emergence of infectious disease problems and the possibility of bioterrorism have evidenced the need for implementation of infectious disease surveillance programmes. Clinical microbiology laboratories play a pivotal role in these programmes. They have the first opportunity to detect these problems and should participate in the design of reporting strategies and dissemination of this information. Policies for the flow of data to national and international authorities should be established using passive surveillance strategies. However, active surveillance programmes taking advantage of new methodologies, including virtual tools and mathematical programs, should be the goal for early detection of unusual patterns of microbial pathogens, outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections. In addition, early implementation of response strategies should be designed and performed with the cooperation of microbiology laboratories, and intervention and response protocols should be defined with the participation of clinical microbiologists.","Cantón, R.",Clin Microbiol Infect,410,16

During the first emergency phase of the epidemic, RT-qPCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, which is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, exhibited limitations due to availability of reagents and budget constraints. This stressed the need to develop screening procedures that require fewer resources and are suitable to be extended to larger portions of the population. RT-qPCR on pooled samples from individual NP swabs seems to be a promising technique to improve surveillance. We performed preliminary experimental analyses aimed to investigate the performance of pool testing on samples with low viral load and we evaluated through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations alternative screening protocols based on sample pooling, tailored to contexts characterized by different infection prevalence. We focused on the role of pool size and the opportunity to develop strategies that take advantage of natural clustering structures in the population, e.g. families, school classes, hospital rooms. Despite the use of a limited number of specimens, our results suggest that, while high viral load samples seem to be detectable even in a pool with 29 negative samples, positive specimens with low viral load may be masked by the negative samples, unless smaller pools are used. The results of MC simulations confirm that pool testing is useful in contexts where the infection prevalence is low. The gain of pool testing in saving resources can be very high, and can be optimized by selecting appropriate group sizes. Exploiting natural groups makes the definition of larger pools convenient and potentially overcomes the issue of low viral load samples by increasing the probability of identifying more than one positive in the same pool.","Baccini, Michela; Rocco, Emilia; Paganini, Irene; Mattei, Alessandra; Sani, Cristina; Vannucci, Giulia; Bisanzi, Simonetta; Burroni, Elena; Peluso, Marco; Munnia, Armelle; Cellai, Filippo; Pompeo, Giampaolo; Micio, Laura; Viti, Jessica; Mealli, Fabrizia; Carozzi, Francesca Maria",PLoS One,410,21

Sources included the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and PubMed. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide, with viral etiologies being very common. Given the rapidly emerging pandemic associated with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing coronavirus disease 2019, it is important to review the clinical presentation and immunologic changes associated with viral pneumonia. Symptoms of viral pneumonia include common respiratory tract infection symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Immunologic changes include up-regulation of airway pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns contributing to cytokine and genomic changes. Coronavirus disease 2019 clinical presentation is typical of viral pneumonia with an increased prevalence of early pulmonary infiltrates and lymphopenia. Principles of early coronavirus disease 2019 management and isolation as well as potential therapeutic approaches to the emerging pandemic are discussed.","Darden, Dijoia B.; Hawkins, Russell B.; Larson, Shawn D.; Iovine, Nicole M.; Prough, Donald S.; Efron, Philip A.",Crit Care Explor,410,23

After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life-structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between 3 and 7 April 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18 and 22 April 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6 and 10 May 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25 and 29 May 2020 (Time 4). This four-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents' psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted.

Patients with ARTI were included from Teaching Hospital, Anuradhapura from March 2013 to August 2014. Indirect fluorescence assay was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates for the identification of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, influenza A and B and hMPV]. Moreover, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was done to further confirm the hMPV infection. RESULTS: In this case series, hMPV infection showed a range of respiratory symptoms from common cold to life threatening lower respiratory tract infections with varying severity. In some cases, the clinical presentation of hMPV infection was similar to the ARTI caused by RSV. hMPV co-infections with of RSV have also been seen in some cases of ARTI.

In a previous phase 2a trial, RTB101 (previously known as BEZ235), an oral mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, was observed to increase IFN-induced antiviral gene expression and decrease the incidence of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in older adults. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether oral RTB101 upregulated IFN-induced antiviral responses and decreased the incidence of viral RTIs when given once daily for 16 weeks during winter cold and flu season. METHODS: We did a phase 2b and a phase 3 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in adults aged at least 65 years enrolled in New Zealand, Australia, and the USA at 54 sites. In the phase 2b trial, patients were aged 65–85 years, with asthma, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, were current smokers, or had an emergency room or hospitalisation for an RTI within the past 12 months. In the phase 3 trial, patients were aged at least 65 years, did not have COPD, and were not current smokers. In the phase 2b trial, patients were randomly assigned to using a validated automated randomisation system to oral RTB101 5 mg, RTB101 10 mg once daily, or placebo in part 1 and RTB101 10 mg once daily, RTB101 10 mg twice daily, RTB101 10 mg plus everolimus once daily, or matching placebo in part 2. In the phase 3 trial, patients were randomly assigned to RTB101 10mg once daily or matching placebo. The phase 2b primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed RTIs during 16 weeks of winter cold and influenza season and the phase 3 primary outcome was the incidence of clinically symptomatic respiratory illness defined as symptoms consistent with an RTI, irrespective of whether an infection was laboratory-confirmed. Patients, investigators, and sponsor were masked to treatment assignments. All patients who received at least part of one dose of study drug were included in the primary and safety analyses. The phase 2b trial was registered with ANZCTR, ACTRN12617000468325, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03373903, and the phase 3 trial was registered with ANZCTR, ACTRN12619000628145. FINDINGS: In the phase 2b trial, we recruited 652 participants in total between May 16, 2017, and Jan 10, 2018, 179 participants to part 1 of the study (randomly assigned 1:1:1 to RTB101 5 mg once daily [61 participants], RTB101 10 mg once daily [58 participants], or matching placebo [60 participants]) and 473 patients to part 2 (randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to RTB101 10 mg once daily [118 participants], RTB101 10 mg twice daily [120 participants], RTB101 10 mg in combination with everolimus 0·1 mg daily [115 participants] or matching placebo [120 participants]). In our first prespecified statistical analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for part 2 of the phase 2b trial efficacy of RTB101 10 mg in combination with everolimus 0·1 mg once daily compared with placebo did not meet statistical significance but, in our second prespecified analysis, which included data from part 1 and part 2, we found a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients who had one or more laboratory-confirmed RTIs in the RTB101 10 mg once daily treatment group (34 [19%] of 176) compared with the pooled placebo group (50 [28%] of 180; odds ratio [OR] 0·601 [90% CI 0·391–0·922]; p=0·02). In the phase 3 trial, we enrolled 1024 patients between May 7, 2018, and July 19, 2019. 513 (50·1%) participants were randomly assigned to RTB101 10 mg once daily and 510 (49·9%) to placebo. In the full analysis set of the phase 3 trial, RTB101 did not reduce the proportion of patients with clinically symptomatic respiratory illness (134 [26%] of 511 patients in the RTB101 treatment group vs 125 [25%] 510 patients in the placebo treatment group; OR 1·07 [90% CI 0·80–1·42]; p=0·65). In both trials, significantly more IFN-induced antiviral genes were upregulated in patients treated with RTB101 as compared with placebo. The study drug was found to be safe and well-tolerated across trials and treatment groups. Only one patient in the placebo group in the phase 3 trial had serious adverse events (nausea, fatigue, hyponatraemia, and arthralgia) which were considered related to study drug treatment. Three patients died in the phase 2b trial and one in the phase 3 trial but no deaths were considered related to study treatment. INTERPRETATION: The combined results indicate that low doses of the mTOR inhibitor RTB101 are well tolerated and upregulate IFN-induced antiviral responses in older adults. Further refinement of clinical trial endpoints and patient populations might be required to identify whether upregulation of IFN responses by mTOR inhibitors consistently decreases the incidence or severity of viral infections in older adults.

Moreover, trajectory analysis revealed gene expression changes from monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages toward M1 or M2 macrophages and identified the distinct macrophage subpopulation that had rapidly undergone SARS-CoV-2-mediated activation of inflammatory responses. Finally, we found that different spectrums of M1 or M2 macrophages showed distinct patterns of gene modules downregulated by immune-modulatory drugs. Overall, these results elucidate fundamental aspects of the immune response dynamics provoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lee, Jeong Seok; Koh, June-Young; Yi, Kijong; Kim, Young-Il; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, Eun-Ha; Kim, Se-Mi; Park, Sung Ho; Ju, Young Seok; Choi, Young Ki; Park, Su-Hyung",bioRxiv,410,16

An affective event perspective,17.937553,5.040746,2021-02-03,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the heterogeneous transmission patterns of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea, with a particular focus on epidemiological characteristics of superspreaders. DESIGN: Retrospective epidemiological analysis. SETTING: Multiple healthcare facilities of secondary and tertiary care centres in an urban setting. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 185 laboratory-confirmed cases with partially known dates of illness onset and most likely sources of infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Superspreaders were identified using the transmission tree. The reproduction number, that is, the average number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case, was estimated as a function of time and according to different types of hosts. RESULTS: A total of five superspreaders were identified. The reproduction number throughout the course of the outbreak was estimated at 1.0 due to reconstruction of the transmission tree, while the variance of secondary cases generated by a primary case was 52.1. All of the superspreaders involved in this outbreak appeared to have generated a substantial number of contacts in multiple healthcare facilities (association: p<0.01), generating on average 4.0 (0.0–8.6) and 28.6 (0.0–63.9) secondary cases among patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities and others. The time-dependent reproduction numbers declined substantially below the value of 1 on and after 13 June 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Superspreaders who visited multiple facilities drove the epidemic by generating a disproportionate number of secondary cases. Our findings underscore the need to limit the contacts in healthcare settings. Contact tracing efforts could assist early laboratory testing and diagnosis of suspected cases.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Endo, Akira; Saitoh, Masaya; Kinoshita, Ryo; Ueno, Ryo; Nakaoka, Shinji; Miyamatsu, Yuichiro; Dong, Yueping; Chowell, Gerardo; Mizumoto, Kenji",BMJ Open,410,2

Pollution is varied, ranging from human-made plastics and pharmaceutical compounds, to human-altered abiotic factors, such as sediment and nutrient runoff. As global population, wealth and resource consumption continue to grow, so too does the amount of potential pollution produced. This presents us with a grand challenge which requires interdisciplinary knowledge to solve. There is sufficient data on the human health, social, economic, and environmental risks of marine pollution, resulting in increased awareness and motivation to address this global challenge, however a significant lag exists when implementing strategies to address this issue. This review draws upon the expertise of 17 experts from the fields of social sciences, marine science, visual arts, and Traditional and First Nations Knowledge Holders to present two futures; the Business-As-Usual, based on current trends and observations of growing marine pollution, and a More Sustainable Future, which imagines what our ocean could look like if we implemented current knowledge and technologies. We identify priority actions that governments, industry and consumers can implement at pollution sources, vectors and sinks, over the next decade to reduce marine pollution and steer us towards the More Sustainable Future.
