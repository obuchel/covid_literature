14627,"Venomous snakebites: Rapid action saves lives—A multifaceted community education programme increases awareness about snakes and snakebites among the rural population of Tamil Nadu, India",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Geographical accessibility to healthcare is an important component of infectious disease dynamics. Timely access to health facilities can prevent disease progression and enables disease notification through surveillance systems. The importance of accounting for physical accessibility in response to infectious diseases is increasingly recognized. Yet, there is no comprehensive review of the literature available on infectious diseases in relation to geographical accessibility to care. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the current state of knowledge on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A search strategy was developed and conducted on Web of Science and PubMed on 4 March 2019. New publications were checked until May 28, 2020. All publication dates were eligible. Data was charted into a tabular format and descriptive data analyses were carried out to identify geographical regions, infectious diseases, and measures of physical accessibility among other factors. Search queries in PubMed and Web of Science yielded 560 unique publications. After title and abstract screening 99 articles were read in full detail, from which 64 articles were selected, including 10 manually. Results of the included publications could be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) decreased spatial accessibility to health care was associated with a higher infectious disease burden, (2) decreased accessibility was associated to lower disease reporting, minimizing true understanding of disease distribution, and (3) the occurrence of an infectious disease outbreak negatively impacted health care accessibility in affected regions. In the majority of studies, poor geographical accessibility to health care was associated with higher disease incidence, more severe health outcomes, higher mortality, and lower disease reporting. No difference was seen between countries or infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, policy-makers and scientists rely on data collected through passive surveillance systems, introducing uncertainty on disease estimates for remote communities. Our results highlight the need for increasing integration of geographical accessibility measures in disease risk modelling, allowing more realistic disease estimates and enhancing our understanding of true disease burden. Additionally, disease risk estimates could be used in turn to optimize the allocation of health services in the prevention and detection of infectious diseases.","Hierink, Fleur; Okiro, Emelda A.; Flahault, Antoine; Ray, Nicolas",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781385/,659
15364,Pulse-Controlled Amplification–A new powerful tool for on-site diagnostics under resource limited conditions,2021-01-29,"Surveillance of recombinant enterovirus 71 (EV71) and subgenotype replacement is vital for preventing and controlling hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks. Despite this, data on recombinant variants and phylogeny of circulating EV71 strains in mainland China are limited. In this study, recombinant variants of EV71 were identified in mainland China from 2009 to 2018. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that except for individual strains (CQ2014-86/CQ/CHN/2014 and EV71/Xiamen/2009 (B5)), almost all of the EV71 strains in mainland China belonged to the subgenotype C4a. Analysing complete genome sequences of 196 EV71 isolates, 3 intertypic recombination strains (VR1432, 30-2/2015/BJ, and Guangdong-2009) and 5 intratypic recombination strains (EV71/P1034/2013, VR1432, Henan-ZMD/CHN/2012, Hubei-WH/CHN/2012, and EV71/P868/2013/China) were identified among naturally circulating EV71. The breakpoints of these recombinant strains were located within the P1, P2, and P3 encoding regions. Notably, a double recombinant (VR1432) resulting from recombination between EV71 subgenotype C4a and C4b strain SHZH98 and a CA8 strain Donovan was identified. This study reports these specific intertypic and intratypic recombination events for the first time highlighting the importance of genetic recombination in the emergence of new enterovirus variants.

211726,Global resource shortages during COVID-19: Bad news for low-income countries,2020,"The new coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), surprisingly, does not affect only the lungs. The severe response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to include a ""cytokine storm,"" which indicates a state of hyperinflammation and subsequent dysfunction of multiple organs and tissues in the most severe cases. This could be the reason why populations at the highest risk for death from the SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) are those suffering from chronic low-grade inflammation, but prone to hyperinflammation. This includes individuals of advanced age and those with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Inflammation resolution is strongly dependent on lipid mediators, the specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). &#969;-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (&#969;-3 PUFAs) are precursors of very potent SPMs, including resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Additionally, they are associated with a less aggressive inflammatory initiation, after competing with &#969;-6 fatty acids for eicosanoid synthesis. Therefore, it makes sense to consider the use of &#969;-3 PUFAs for clinical management of COVID-19 patients. &#969;-3 PUFAs may be given by oral, enteral, or parenteral routes; however, the parenteral route favors faster incorporation into plasma phospholipids, blood cells, and tissues. Here, we discuss these aspects to propose the parenteral infusion of &#969;-3 PUFAs as adjuvant immunopharmacotherapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Torrinhas, Raquel S; Calder, Philip C; Lemos, Gabriela O; Waitzberg, Dan L",Nutrition,,659
230790,Identifying the outbreak signal of COVID-19 before the response of the traditional disease monitoring system,2020,"Background and objectives: The whole world is spending an extraordinary effort by implementing various measures to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of the preventive measures is greatly influenced by the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards the disease. In this study, KAP values and some characteristic features of people recovered from COVID-19 were determined by conducting a questionnaire survey. Materials and Methods:&nbsp;The questionnaire survey was conducted between 1 and 10 January 2021 on people who recovered from COVID-19 in a total of 150 different locations in Turkey. The questionnaire consisted of 46 questions: 14 for determining demographic and some characteristic features of the participants, and 32 for determining their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The data obtained were evaluated using descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: It was determined that 63% of the participants had at least one chronic illness, 3.9% suffered from the disease twice, and 45.2% changed their smoking habits. The average knowledge score of the participants about COVID-19 was calculated as 10.25 (SD = 2.37; range 0-15). The participants were found to have a high level of knowledge about the symptoms and prevention methods in general, and positive changes in post-illness attitudes and behaviors. However, there was a great instability regarding the drugs and vaccines used in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusions: This was the first study carried out in Turkey to determine knowledge, attitudes, practices, and some characteristic features of people who recovered from COVID-19. It was suggested that health authorities in the country need to develop more effective strategies and policies to find out permanent solutions in order to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic by taking into account the concerns of the public, particularly with regards to the drugs used in the treatment and vaccination.","Yakut, Seda; Karagülle, Burcu; Atçali, Tugçe; Öztürk, Yasin; Açik, Mehmet Nuri; Çetinkaya, Burhan",Medicina (Kaunas),,659

289021,Air and surface contamination in non-health care settings among 641 environmental specimens of 39 COVID-19 cases,2020,"Rationale: It is recommended that internal medicine residency programs incorporate point of care ultrasound (POCUS) training into the curriculum. However, the optimal approach to this training lacks recommendations or structural guidelines. We sought to compare an asynchronous video curriculum to a bedside hands-on/didactic curriculum. We used diagnostic accuracy as a surrogate for quality of ultrasound education. We hypothesize there is no difference in the accuracy of cardiac and lung POCUS comparing these two strategies. Methods: This pilot study was conducted in the Medical Intensive Care Unit at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Via block randomization, internal medicine trainees were assigned to a combined hands-on/didactic (further called “didactic”) ultrasound curriculum or a video-based curriculum. The didactic curriculum consisted of a 45-minute demonstration of cardiac and lung POCUS taught by a pulmonary/critical care fellow. Trainees assigned to the video curriculum were provided access to six short, topic-focused ultrasound videos. For both curricula, topics included introduction to the machine, parasternal long axis, parasternal short axis, apical four chamber, and subxiphoid views. Lung ultrasound focused on lung sliding, B lines, A lines, and pleural effusions. Participants were asked to perform ultrasounds while rotating in the MICU on patients who were scheduled to receive a gold-standard diagnostic test (CT chest, chest X-ray, formal transthoracic echocardiogram). Trainees were asked to comment on left and right ventricular function and pericardial effusion. Lung ultrasound evaluated for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and ascites. Participants recorded the interpretations of their images in an online based form, prior to reviewing the formal gold-standard study. The results of the formal exams were retrospectively compared to the POCUS interpretations. The primary outcome of this study was diagnostic accuracy. Results: A total of 36 cardiac exams and 20 lung exams were performed. We utilized a Fisher's Exact Test to compare the diagnostic accuracy of those who receive the didactic curriculum to the video curriculum. There was no difference in interpretation accuracy between didactic and video curriculums in cardiac or lung ultrasound. Conclusion: Based on diagnostic accuracy, a video-based POCUS curriculum is non-inferior to a didactic curriculum. As the COVID pandemic continues, the medical education paradigm will need to shift from traditional strategies to ones that implore asynchronous learning to promote social distancing. However, this cannot come at the cost of inferior medical education. Our results suggest that instruction can continue safely using a video-based curriculum with no impact on ultrasound education.

317172,Optofluidic multiplex detection of single SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A antigens using a novel bright fluorescent probe assay,2021,"This national professional society guidance lays out operational and ethical principles for decision-making during a pandemic, in the immediate context of COVID-19 in the early 2020 surge iteration but with potential ongoing relevance. It identifies the different phases of a pandemic and the implications for capacity and mutual aid within a national healthcare system, and introduces a revised CRITCON-PANDEMIC framework for shared operational responsibilities and clinical decision-making. Usual legal and ethical frameworks should continue to apply while capacity and mutual aid are available (CRITCON-PANDEMIC levels 0-3); clinicians should focus on current clinical needs and should not treat patients differently because of anticipated future pressures. In conditions of resource limitation (CRITCON-PANDEMIC 4), a structured and equitable approach is necessary and an objective Decision Support Aid is proposed. In producing this guidance, we emphasise that all patients must be treated with respect and without discrimination, because everyone is of equal value. The guidance has been put together with input from patient and public groups and aims to provide standards that are fair to everyone. We acknowledge that COVID-19 is a new disease with a partial and evolving knowledge base, and aim to provide an objective clinical decision-making framework based on the best available information. It is recognised that a factual assessment of likely benefit may take into account age, frailty and comorbidities, but the guidance emphasises that every assessment must be individualised on a balanced, case by case, basis and may inform clinical judgement but not replace it. The effects of a comorbidity on someone's ability to benefit from critical care should be individually assessed. Measures of frailty should be used with care, and should not disadvantage those with stable disability.","Montgomery, J.; Stokes-Lampard, H. J.; Griffiths, M.

358122,Inhibition of PIKfyve kinase prevents infection by Zaire ebolavirus and SARS-CoV-2,2020,"ABSTRACT: Antibodies are a fundamental tool to fight infections but are intrinsically built as a double-edged sword. One side recognizes the microbial antigen, and the other gives a call to arms to fight infection by recruiting immune cells and triggering inflammation. A balanced immune response must combine a potent neutralizing antibody and a swift disposal of the invading agent by innate immune cells with the least tissue damage possible. The longer the immune system takes to control the infection, the higher the possibility for a self-sustaining inflammatory process with potentially fatal consequences for the host. In addition to quantity, the quality of antibodies also matters, because posttranslational modifications altering the N-glycan composition in Fc fractions may help tilt the balance to the effector side, by modifying their affinity for Fc receptors in immune cells. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a wealth of data bolstering our understanding of the rules governing the production of protective and nonprotective antibodies. Also, it has broadened our understanding of the role of viruses in triggering autoimmunity and inflammation, and widened our knowledge of the different mechanisms that can be activated by viral infection and lead to autoantibody production, inflammation, and progressive tissue damage. In addition, the COVID-19 infection has contributed a great deal to our comprehension of the role of antibodies in the causation of cytokine storms and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, also seen in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases.","Rodriguez, Martin A; Fuentes-Silva, Yurilis J; Vásquez, Gloria",J. clin. rheumatol,,659

387376,Temperature and population density influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of nonpharmaceutical interventions,2021,"Purpose: Currently available markers for early detection of diabetic nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end stage renal disease, have some limitations. There is insufficient evidence from previous studies about the role of several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the early development of DN. This study aimed to describe the expression of miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-25, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 in a sample of type 1 diabetic children and adolescents to explore their association with DN and some indices of kidney injury. Patients and Methods: Seventy type 1 diabetic patients, with 5 years' duration of diabetes or more, were recruited from Children's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of the above mentioned miRNAs in serum and to assess its association with DN, and the studied risk factors. Results: There was a significantly higher percentage of up-regulation of miRNA-377 and miRNA-93 (P=0.03, 0.02, respectively) in addition to significant down-regulation of miRNA-25 (P=0.01) in patients with DN than in patients without DN. In patients with DN, expression of miR-216a was significantly negatively correlated with creatinine (r=-0.4, P=0.04) and positively correlated with eGFR using creatinine (r=0.5, P=0.03). In the same group, expression of miR-21 was positively correlated with urinary cystatin C (r=0.6, P=0.01) and was negatively correlated with e-GFR using cystatin c (r=-0.6, P=0.01). miRNA-93 was associated with increased risk (odds ratio=15, 95% CI=12.03-24.63, P=0.01), while miRNA-25 was associated with decreased risk for albuminuria (odds ratio=0.15, 95% CI=0.08-0.55, P=0.03). Conclusion: miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DN, while miRNA-25 may have a reno-protective role. More studies are needed to document the value of these miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets in DN.","Abdelghaffar, Shereen; Shora, Hassan; Abdelatty, Sahar; Elmougy, Fatma; El Sayed, Reham; Abdelrahman, Heba; Soliman, Hend; Algebaly, HebatAllah; Ahmed, Sakinatalfouad; Alfy, Peter; Elshiwy, Yasmine",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,,659

METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study of heart failure patients inserted with remote monitoring (RM)-capable CIED. We analyzed the transmitted data of physical activity and fluid volume status of all patients, before, and during the lockdown periods between February and April 2020. The clinical status of the patients was also evaluated. Results: Device data from 429 patients implanted with CIED capable of RM were initially evaluated. Patients with an implantable loop recorder, Brugada or Long QT syndromes, and patients with incomplete transmissions were excluded. Eighty-two patients with heart failure were included. The median age was 65 years (58-72), and 53 (64.6%) subjects were men. There was a 27.1% decline in physical activity, and the median physical activity of patients significantly declined from 2.4 to 1.8 hours/day (p=0.000010). Conclusion: Data obtained by remotely monitored CIED in heart failure patients suggests a significant decline in physical activity during the country lockdown due to the pandemic.

The community needs assessment was the first step in the strategic prevention framework (SPF) to co-locate substance abuse, mental health, viral hepatitis, and HIV prevention care services for Latinx and Black/African American sexual gender minority young adults at a minority-serving institution. The SWOT analysis identified principles for selecting, adapting, and implementing an evidence-based intervention.

Progressive elevation of levels of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including IL-6, CXCL10, and GM-CSF) were associated with severity and accompanied by elevated markers of endothelial injury and thrombosis. Principal component and network analyses demonstrated central roles for IL-6 and GM-CSF in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Comparing these profiles to archived samples from patients with fatal influenza, IL-6 was equally elevated in both conditions whereas GM-CSF was prominent only in COVID-19. These findings further identify the key inflammatory, thrombotic, and vascular factors that characterize and distinguish severe and fatal COVID-19.","Thwaites, Ryan S; Sanchez Sevilla Uruchurtu, Ashley; Siggins, Matthew K; Liew, Felicity; Russell, Clark D; Moore, Shona C; Fairfield, Cameron; Carter, Edwin; Abrams, Simon; Short, Charlotte-Eve; Thaventhiran, Thilipan; Bergstrom, Emma; Gardener, Zoe; Ascough, Stephanie; Chiu, Christopher; Docherty, Annemarie B; Hunt, David; Crow, Yanick J; Solomon, Tom; Taylor, Graham P; Turtle, Lance; Harrison, Ewen M; Dunning, Jake; Semple, Malcolm G; Baillie, J Kenneth; Openshaw, Peter Jm",Sci. immunol,,659

In this context, it is essential to have easy-to-use indicators for people to use as a reference. The basic reproduction number of confirmed positives, $R_t$, fulfill such a role. This document proposes a data-driven approach to nowcast $R_t$ based on previous observations' statistical behavior. As more information arrives, the method naturally becomes more precise about the final count of confirmed positives. Our method's strength is that it is based on the self-reported onset of symptoms, in contrast to other methods that use the daily report's count to infer this quantity. We show that our approach may be the foundation for determining useful epidemy tracking indicators.","Salas, Joaqu'in",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09800v1.pdf,659
474490,Lessons from a local effort to screen for SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Background: Complement pathway inhibition may provide benefit for severe acute respiratory illnesses caused by viral infections such as COVID-19. We present results from a nonrandomized proof-of-concept study of complement C5 inhibitor eculizumab for treatment of severe COVID-19. Methods: All patients (N = 80) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit between March 10 and May 5, 2020 were included. Forty-five patients were treated with standard care and 35 with standard care plus eculizumab through expanded-access emergency treatment. The prespecified primary outcome was day-15 survival. Clinical laboratory values and biomarkers, complement levels, and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were also assessed. Findings: At day 15, estimated survival was 82.9% (95% CI: 70.4%â95.3%) with eculizumab and 62.2% (48.1%â76.4%) without eculizumab (log-rank test, P = 0.04). Patients treated with eculizumab experienced a significantly more rapid decrease in lactate, blood urea nitrogen, total and conjugated bilirubin levels and a significantly more rapid increase in platelet count, prothrombin time, and in the ratio of arterial oxygen tension over fraction of inspired oxygen versus patients treated without eculizumab. Eculizumab-associated changes in complement levels, laboratory values, and biomarkers were consistent with terminal complement inhibition, reduced hypoxia, and decreased inflammation. TESAEs of special interest occurring in >5% of patients treated with/without eculizumab were ventilator-associated pneumonia (51%/24%), bacteremia (11%/2%), gastroduodenal hemorrhage (14%/16%), and hemolysis (3%/18%). Interpretation: Findings from this proof-of-concept study suggest eculizumab may improve survival and reduce hypoxia in patients with severe COVID-19. Randomized studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach are needed.

494155,Helminth coinfection and COVID-19: An alternate hypothesis,2020,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has been responsible for approximately 75 million cases and 1.6 million deaths globally as of December 22, 2020. Currently, no treatment modalities or management options have been recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) prior to patient hospitalization and supplemental oxygen requirement. This poses a unique challenge for outpatient primary care physicians, who are often tasked with initial care of patients early on in their disease course. During the pandemic, our family practice provided medical care to approximately 2,000 families located in the surrounding Brooklyn community. With only telemedicine at our disposal, our clinic was tasked with treating patients presenting remotely who may or may not have had COVID-19 - a large clinical diagnosis was made given the absence of in-person testing. Often co-administered, Azithromycin was considered a supportive agent that may or may not have increased the benefit of hydroxychloroquine. However, Azithromycin may perform well on its own for various reasons as it has been shown to have antiviral activity against other RNA viruses, anti-inflammatory properties, and antiviral effects within bronchial epithelial cells. Azithromycin has also shown efficacy as an add-on treatment for reducing asthma exacerbations - pertinent to the pro-inflammatory pulmonary conditions in COVID-19 progression - and may even prevent or treat bacterial co-infection in patients with SARS-COV-2. In order to investigate the association between Azithromycin and the COVID-19 disease process, our clinical study retrospectively identified patients who were prescribed Azithromycin (500 mg on day one + 250 mg on days two to five) during the peak months of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City from March 2020 through May 2020. All patients prescribed Azithromycin with suspicion of COVID-19 infection were interviewed via telephone regarding their constellation of symptoms, compliance with the prescribed antibiotic for the intended course, symptom duration prior to and following antibiotic course initiation, as well as any further complications of their illness, if present. Ultimately, the majority of the patients who were interviewed over the phone concluded that a full course of Azithromycin helped improve their symptoms during their infection with COVID-19. Outcomes and complications in patients treated with Azithromycin were noteworthy in that there were no reports of pulmonary complications or deterioration of pulmonary function after treatment (e.g., no shortness of breath, wheezing, dyspnea, etc.), although some patients did experience residual coughing and nasal discharge post-treatment. We believe further study of this treatment in the setting of experimental, randomized controlled trials may reveal the benefits of Azithromycin in terms of reducing infection severity, length, and limiting the incidence of complications in patients with COVID-19.","Tafler, L.; Danilevsky, A.; Seth, D.",Cureus,,659

504876,SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 hijacks Nup98 to block STAT nuclear import and antagonize interferon signaling,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is a biosecurity threat, and many resource-rich countries are stockpiling and/or making plans to secure supplies of vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics for their citizens. We review the products that are being investigated for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19; discuss the challenges that countries in sub-Saharan Africa may face with access to COVID-19 vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics due to the limited capacity to manufacture them in Africa; and make recommendations on actions to mitigate these challenges and ensure health security in sub-Saharan Africa during this unprecedented pandemic and future public-health crises. MAIN BODY: Sub-Saharan Africa will not be self-reliant for COVID-19 vaccines when they are developed. It can, however, take advantage of existing initiatives aimed at supporting COVID-19 vaccine access to resource-limited settings such as partnership with AstraZeneca, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation, the Serum Institute of India, and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. Accessing effective COVID-19 therapeutics will also be a major challenge for countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as production of therapeutics is frequently geared towards profitable Western markets and is ill-adapted to sub-Saharan Africa realities. The region can benefit from pooled procurement of COVID-19 therapy by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in partnership with the African Union. If the use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients who are severely ill is found to be effective, access to the product will be minimally challenging since the region has a pool of recovered patients and human resources that can man supportive laboratories. The region also needs to drive the local development of rapid-test kits and other diagnostics for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics for COVID-19 will be a challenge for sub-Saharan Africans. This challenge should be confronted by collaborating with vaccine developers; pooled procurement of COVID-19 therapeutics; and local development of testing and diagnostic materials. The COVID-19 pandemic should be a wake-up call for sub-Saharan Africa to build vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics manufacturing capacity as one of the resources needed to address public-health crises.","Bright, Bisi; Babalola, Chinedum Peace; Sam-Agudu, Nadia Adjoa; Onyeaghala, Augustine Anayochukwu; Olatunji, Adebola; Aduh, Ufuoma; Sobande, Patrick O; Crowell, Trevor A; Tebeje, Yenew Kebede; Phillip, Sunny; Ndembi, Nicaise; Folayan, Morenike Oluwatoyin",Global Health,,659
508044,Remdesivir targets a structurally analogous region of the Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2 polymerases,2020,"PURPOSE: To determine the expressions of SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) genes in human and mouse ocular cells and comparison to other tissue cells. METHODS: Human conjunctiva and primary pterygium tissues were collected from pterygium patients who underwent surgery. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes was determined in human primary conjunctival and pterygium cells, human ocular and other tissue cell lines, mesenchymal stem cells as well as mouse ocular and other tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and SYBR green PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis showed consistent expression by 2 ACE2 gene primers in 2 out of 3 human conjunctival cells and pterygium cell lines. Expression by 2 TMPRSS2 gene primers could only be found in 1 out of 3 pterygium cell lines, but not in any conjunctival cells. Compared with the lung A549 cells, similar expression was noted in conjunctival and pterygium cells. In addition, mouse cornea had comparable expression of Tmprss2 gene and lower but prominent Ace2 gene expression compared with the lung tissue. CONCLUSION: Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With high and consistent expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in cornea, cornea rather than conjunctiva has higher potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Precaution is necessary to prevent possible SARS-CoV-2 infection through ocular surface in clinical practice.","Ma, Di; Chen, Chong-Bo; Jhanji, Vishal; Xu, Ciyan; Yuan, Xiang-Ling; Liang, Jia-Jian; Huang, Yuqiang; Cen, Ling-Ping; Ng, Tsz Kin",Eye (Lond),,659

591155,Host barriers to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated by ferrets in a high-exposure domestic setting,2021-05-04,"In December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged and rapidly spread throughout the world. It causes the respiratory disease COVID-19 via the transmission of microbial pathogens within bio-aerosols during speaking, sneezing, and coughing. Therefore, understanding bioaerosol dynamics is important for developing mitigation strategies against droplet-induced infections. Computer modelling, using Computational Fluid Dynamics, has become a useful tool in studying and visualising the spread of atomised bio-droplets but the effect of using cloth facemasks has not been fully quantified. In this study, simulations were carried out to quantify the extent of respiratory droplet transfer with and without facemasks between a pair of ventilated rooms by a mathematical model for the first time. A 600-μm pore facemask was used, representing the porosity of a typical cloth facemask. Using the discrete phase model, the transport of ejected droplets was tracked. The results show that in the facemask cases, more than 96% of all the ejected droplets in all scenarios were trapped in the recommended 2 m social distancing radius around the human source. Correspondingly, only a maximum of 80% of droplets were deposited within the social distancing radius in the no facemask scenarios, with >20% airborne and transported to the second room. One-dimensional empirical correlations were developed for droplet concentration as a function of distance from the bioaerosol source. The models show that droplet concentration decays exponentially from the source especially in the facemask cases. The study therefore reinforces the importance of face coverings in lessening the transmission of possibly infected respiratory droplets that transmit highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Aliyu, Aliyu M.; Singh, Dharminder; Uzoka, Chino; Mishra, Rakesh",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710221007919?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352710221007919,659

The interactions of coronavirus transmission with socio-economic factors in India using the multivariate approach were also investigated. METHODS: Actual cumulative infected population data from 15 February to May 15, 2020 was used for determination of parameters of a nested exponential statistical model, which were further employed for the prediction of infection. Correlation and Principal component analysis provided the relationships of coronavirus spread with socio-economic factors of different states of India using the Rstudio software. RESULTS: Cumulative infection and spreadability rate predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual observed data for all countries (R(2) = 0.985121 to 0.999635, and MD = 1.2–7.76%) except Iran (R(2) = 0.996316, and MD = 18.38%). Currently, the infection rate in India follows an upward trajectory, while other countries show a downward trend. The model claims that India is likely to witness an increased spreading rate of COVID-19 in June and July. Moreover, the flattening of the cumulative infected population is expected to be obtained in October infecting more than 12 lakhs people. Indian states with higher population were more susceptible to virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: A long-term prediction of cumulative cases, spreadability rate, pandemic peak of COVID-19 was made for India. Prediction provided by the model considering most recent data is useful for making appropriate interventions to deal with the rapidly emerging pandemic.","Kumar, Amit; Rani, Poonam; Kumar, Rahul; Sharma, Vasudha; Purohit, Soumya Ranjan",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187140212030254X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.07.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187140212030254X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683321/,659

In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. These sex-biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We found that male and female GBM cells exhibited opposing responses to pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Brd4. Brd4 knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition decreased male GBM cell clonogenicity and in vivo tumorigenesis, while increasing both in female GBM cells. These results were validated in male and female patient-derived GBM cell lines. Furthermore, analysis of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal of human GBM samples segregated by sex revealed that male GBM cells are significantly more sensitive to BET inhibitors than are female cells. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells. This has important implications for the clinical evaluation and use of BET inhibitors. Significance Consistent sex differences in incidence and outcome have been reported in numerous cancers including brain tumors. GBM, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, occurs with higher incidence and shorter survival in males compared to females. Brd4 is essential for regulating transcriptome-wide gene expression and specifying cell identity, including that of GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. The observed sex differences in BETi treatment strongly indicate that sex differences in disease biology translate into sex differences in therapeutic responses. This has critical implications for clinical use of BET inhibitors further affirming the importance of inclusion of sex as a biological variable.","Kfoury, Najla; Qi, Zongtai; Prager, Briana C; Wilkinson, Michael N; Broestl, Lauren; Berrett, Kristopher C; Moudgil, Arnav; Sankararaman, Sumithra; Chen, Xuhua; Gertz, Jay; Rich, Jeremy Naftali; Mitra, Robi D; Rubin, Joshua B",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/199059,659

Recently, COVID-19 has been declared as pandemic by the World Health Organization. Dealing with COVID-19 pandemic requires high intensity of administrative activity. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to assess and compare, objectively, hospital preparedness with available Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards. METHODS: CDC has issued checklist for the assessment of hospital preparedness for COVID-19 pandemic, globally. This list contains 10 elements with sub-sections. We objectified the same and scored the hospital preparations accordingly. Various financial efforts made by the hospital to procure COVID19-specified items was also recorded. RESULTS: As per the CDC checklist, the hospital scored 197 points (72.06%) out of 270 points with highest points in element two and eight. Element two is for the development for written COVID-19 plan. Element eight consists of addressing the occupational health of healthcare workers. Lowest scoring was in the element seven represented visitor access and movement within facility. During the study period, the hospital procured items of approximately 55 lakhs. In the study period, doctors, nursing staff, housekeeping staff, and security staff were channelized for doing COVID-19 duties. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained a score above 70% (good) which is quite encouraging, and we concluded that pandemic preparations in hospitals are necessary and it can be assessed objectively against prevailing standards. It is important in poor countries like India where spending on healthcare is minimal compared to other countries. Additionally, this assessment can be used to guide us further changes in policies and identifying the gaps in pandemic preparedness in hospitals which require special attention.","Singh, Sukhbir; Govindagoudar, Manjunath B.; Chaudhry, Dhruva; Singh, Pawan Kumar; Vashist, Aarushi; Vashist, Madan Gopal",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2455_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568145/,659
643998,Estimating unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States,2020-09-08,"Background and purpose — COVID-19 is among the most impactful pandemics that the society has experienced. Orthopedic surgery involves procedures generating droplets and aerosols and there is concern amongst surgeons that otherwise rational precautionary principles are being set aside due to lack of scientific evidence and a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This narrative review attempts to translate relevant knowledge into practical recommendations for healthcare workers involved in orthopedic surgery on patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Patients and methods — We unsystematically searched in PubMed, reference lists, and the WHO’s web page for relevant publications concerning problems associated with the PPE used in perioperative practice when a patient is COVID-19 positive or suspected to be. A specific search for literature regarding COVID-19 was extended to include publications from the SARS epidemic in 2002/3. Results — Transmission of infectious viruses from patient to surgeon during surgery is possible, but does not appear to be a considerable problem in clinical practice. Seal-leakage is a problem with surgical masks. Due to the lack of studies and reports, the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patient to surgeon during droplet- and aerosol-generating procedures is unknown. Interpretation — Surgical masks should be used only in combination with a widely covering visor and when a respirator (N95, FFP2, P3) is not made available. Furthermore, basic measures to reduce shedding of droplets and aerosols during surgery and correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment is important.","Basso, Trude; Dale, Håvard; Langvatn, Håkon; Lønne, Greger; Skråmm, Inge; Westberg, Marianne; Wik, Tina S; Witsø, Eivind",Acta orthopaedica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2020.1764234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408845/,659

Using two nationally representative datasets from India between 2006 and 2016, we estimated mortality rates and stunting by gender and by birth order among children under 5 years old. We then tested for differences between boys and girls within each survey round for both national and state levels using bootstrapped standard errors, controlling for cluster and sampling weights. We found striking progress in child mortality and stunting in India between 2006 and 2016 for both boys and girls. Boys were more likely to die than girls during the first year of life. Girls had a higher risk of mortality between age 1 and 5 years than boys in 2006, but the improvements in survival eliminated this gender gap in 2016. For stunting, we found no gender difference in 2006, but girls had higher height‐for‐age Z‐scores (HAZ) and lower stunting than boys in 2016. Trends in gender gaps in mortality and stunting vary substantially by birth order and between states. Our findings indicate that improvements in mortality and nutritional status among girls have started to close gender disparities. Policy efforts to close gaps must stay the course in states that have made progress and be accelerated in states where disparities are still prominent.","Alderman, Harold; Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Tran, Lan Mai; Menon, Purnima",Matern Child Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719159/,659
657052,A new Korean Research Investment for Global Health Technology (RIGHT) Fund to advance innovative neglected-disease technologies,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND: Despite the success of childhood immunization in reducing vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccine hesitancy is now a global health threat to this achievement. The current COVID-19 pandemic may change the picture of vaccine hesitancy toward childhood immunizations, which could influence the mothers’ intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. AIM: To measure the prevalence and related factors of vaccine hesitancy towards childhood immunization during the era of COVID-19 along with the prevalence of mothers’ intention to vaccinate their children the future COVID-19 and its association with childhood vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: Cross sectional study was conducted among 270 Saudi mothers attending outpatient clinics at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAAUH) in Riyadh by purposive sampling technique. Data were collected from January to February 2021 using SAGE Group standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Although most mothers strongly agree on the importance of the vaccine (79%), almost one-fourth of mothers were hesitant towards childhood immunization (24.31%). Similar percentage of mothers’ intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 in the next 6 months was reported (24%). Vaccine hesitancy was found to be a significant predictor of mothers’ intention. Mothers’ education level was significantly associated with being hesitant towards childhood immunization as well as the intention to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine (P < .05). Main reason that was highly significantly associated with being hesitant is the concerns about the side effect (50%). CONCLUSION: The present study reported a considerable percentage of mothers who are hesitant towards childhood immunization which predicts their intension to vaccinate towards COVID19 and is associated with the level of education.","Aldakhil, Haifa; Albedah, Norah; Alturaiki, Nouf; Alajlan, Raghad; Abusalih, Howeida",J Infect Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34481723/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121002471?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.08.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121002471,659

667693,SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 hijacks Nup98 to block STAT nuclear import and antagonize interferon signaling,2020-11-10,"Discovery of bats with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (CoVs) raised the specter of potential future outbreaks of zoonotic SARS-CoV-like disease in humans, which largely went unheeded. Nevertheless, the novel SARS-CoV-2 of bat ancestral origin emerged to infect humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and then became a global pandemic. Less than 5 months after its emergence, millions of people worldwide have been infected asymptomatically or symptomatically and at least 360,000 have died. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in severely affected patients includes atypical pneumonia characterized by a dry cough, persistent fever, and progressive dyspnea and hypoxia, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea and often followed by multiple organ failure, especially of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In this minireview, we focus on two endemic respiratory CoV infections of livestock: bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Both animal respiratory CoVs share some common features with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. BCoV has a broad host range including wild ruminants and a zoonotic potential. BCoV also has a dual tropism for the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. These aspects, their interspecies transmission, and certain factors that impact disease severity in cattle parallel related facets of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in humans. PRCV has a tissue tropism for the upper and lower respiratory tracts and a cellular tropism for type 1 and 2 pneumocytes in lung but is generally a mild infection unless complicated by other exacerbating factors, such as bacterial or viral coinfections and immunosuppression (corticosteroids).","Saif, Linda J.; Jung, Kwonil",J Clin Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32522830/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01355-20,659
