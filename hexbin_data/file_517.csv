Babesiosis presents clinically as a malaria-like illness with fever, chills, headache, fatigue with lymphopenia, atypical lymphocytes, mildly or transiently elevated serum transaminases, thrombocytopenia, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The diagnosis of babesiosis is based on identification of Babesia spp. on a peripheral blood smear. Babesiosis is usually mild in normal hosts, but it may be severe or even fatal in asplenic patients. Pulmonary manifestations are rare in babesiosis, but non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE) is the most frequent manifestation. NCPE in babesiosis does not appear to be related to the degree of parasitemia or splenic function and its onset may be early or late. NCPE usually resolves rapidly with supportive treatment; it is rarely fatal. Clinicians should suspect NCPE in patients with babesiosis who acutely develop shortness of breath and have chest radiograph findings compatible with acute pulmonary edema without cardiomegaly or pleural effusions.","Cunha, B.

Sitting in various positions at home without the proper back support is undesirable and can cause chronic back pain and other undesired side effects. Therefore, a new non-intrusive method to continuously monitor back postures in homes is proposed. A shirt is designed with integrated magnets. A magnetic sensor would be placed above the body's sternum, and magnets will be implemented on a shirt. The sensor will help ascertain the back posture position (straight or curved) and help provide feedback to mend the posture if deformed. In this paper, the initial results using the proposed system are presented using a wearable sensor system with a magnet integrated garment that can continuously monitor the varying sitting postures throughout daily lives. In addition, we discuss how the lower body posture affects the magnetic recording otherwise not detectable using the accelerometer-based systems currently available on the market.","Farnan, M.; Dolezalek, E.; Min, C.
