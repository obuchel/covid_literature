3050,Function of aquaporins in sepsis: a systematic review,2018-02-09,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a common cause of death in intensive care units worldwide. Due to the high complexity of this immunological syndrome development of novel therapeutic strategies is urgent. Promising drug targets or biomarkers may depict aquaporins (AQPs) as they regulate crucial key mechanisms of sepsis. MAIN BODY: Here we report on base of the current literature that several AQPs are involved in different physiological processes of sepsis. In immune system mainly AQPs 3, 5 and 9 seem to be important, as they regulate the migration of different immune cells. Several studies showed that AQP3 is essential for T cell function and macrophage migration and that AQP5 and AQP9 regulate neutrophil cell migration and impact sepsis survival. Additionally, to the function in immune system AQPs 1 and 5 play a role in sepsis induced lung injury and their downregulation after inflammatory stimuli impair lung injury. By contrast, AQP4 expression is up-regulated during brain inflammation and aggravates brain edema in sepsis. In kidney AQP2 expression is downregulated during sepsis and can cause renal failure. Some studies also suggest a role of AQP1 in cardiac function. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, AQPs are involved in many physiological dysfunctions in sepsis and their expressions are differently regulated. Additional research on the regulatory mechanisms of aquaporins may identify potential therapeutic targets.","Rump, Katharina; Adamzik, Michael",Cell Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807818/,386
4281,Two-dimensional echocardiography after return of spontaneous circulation and its association with in-hospital survival after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation,2020-01-08,"This retrospective cohort study investigated the association between in-hospital survival and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography within 24 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients who underwent in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ICPR) after in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (IHCA). The 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups comprised eligible patients who underwent transthoracic 2D echocardiography performed by the cardiology team within 24 hours after ROSC and those who did not, respectively. After propensity score (PS) matching, 142 and 284 patients in the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups, respectively, were included. A logistic regression analysis showed that the likelihood of in-hospital survival was 2.35-fold higher in the 2D-echo group than in the non-2D-echo group (P < 0.001). Regarding IHCA aetiology, in-hospital survival after cardiac arrest of a cardiac cause was 2.51-fold more likely in the 2D-echo group than in the non-2D-echo group (P < 0.001), with no significant inter-group difference in survival after cardiac arrest of a non-cardiac cause (P = 0.120). In this study, 2D echocardiography performed within 24 hours after ROSC was associated with better in-hospital survival outcomes for patients who underwent ICPR for IHCA with a cardiac aetiology. Thus, 2D echocardiography may be performed within 24 hours after ROSC in patients experiencing IHCA to enable better treatment.","Song, In-Ae; Cha, Jun Kwon; Oh, Tak Kyu; Jo, You Hwan; Yoon, Yeonyee E.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6949305/,386

11075,Preoperative Assessment and Management of Patients with Pain and Anxiety Disorders,2020-01-10,"PURPOSE: Sri Lanka is endemic to cutaneous leishmaniasis and reported as the latest focus of leishmaniasis in the Asian subcontinent. Annually, the number of leishmaniasis cases is increasing; therefore, more efficient diagnostic tools, treatment methods and effective prevention measures are indispensable. For this reason, many studies were conducted regarding leishmaniasis infections in Sri Lanka; however, some areas need more attention. Thus, in this review, we comprehensively discussed the studies on leishmaniasis carried out in Sri Lanka. METHODS: Published articles on leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar and ResearchGate databases. Inclusion criteria for the articles were based on keyword searches including ‘Leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka’, ‘Leishmaniasis vector in Sri Lanka’, ‘Sandfly species in Sri Lanka’, ‘Leishmaniasis epidemiology in Sri Lanka’ which are publicly accessible as of 15th July 2019. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated and summarized the leishmaniasis reports in Sri Lanka and mainly focused on clinical presentation of leishmaniasis infection, genetic characteristics of Leishmania donovani Sri Lankan strain, geographical distribution and associated environmental factors, immunological aspects of the infection, vector, reservoir host, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention and control. Furthermore, we identified the areas where further research is needed to fill the essential knowledge gaps. CONCLUSIONS: Leishmaniasis has become a critically important parasitic infection in Sri Lanka, whereas the significant clinical form is cutaneous leishmaniasis. Prevalence of the leishmaniasis infections is reported from all the districts of the country. Therefore, more studies are essential to be carried out to fill the existing knowledge gaps emphasized in this review.","Amarasinghe, Anjalie; Wickramasinghe, Susiji",Acta Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223001/,386

Among the preventive approaches proposed to control this disease is pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), whose effectiveness depends on the medication adherence. The aim of the present study was to determine the knowledge and attitudes about PrEP among a sample of Spanish nursing students as well as their intentions of receiving it in case it was indicated. An observational cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out. A total of 570 nursing students from the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain), ≥18 years old and of both sexes were invited to self-complete a questionnaire between February and March 2020. A total of 352 students decided to participate in the study. Participants had low knowledge [overall knowledge score 1(0–2)] and a neutral attitude towards PrEP. The intention of receiving PrEP improved significantly after the completion of the questionnaire and the administration of information about PrEP (p = 0.039; before: 23.58% and after: 93.77%). Nursing staff play an important role in the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, so their training in preventive strategies, such as PrEP, could help to reduce the incidence of new cases of HIV infection.","López-Díaz, Guillermo; Rodríguez-Fernández, Almudena; Domínguez-Martís, Eva María; Mosteiro-Miguéns, Diego Gabriel; López-Ares, David; Novío, Silvia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7578937/,386

15152,Effects of the reservoir bag disconnection on inspired gases during general anesthesia: a simulator-based study,2021-02-01,"The subcutaneous route of administration has provided convenient and non-inferior delivery of therapeutic proteins compared to intravenous infusion, but there is potential for enhanced immunogenicity toward subcutaneously administered proteins in a subset of patients. Unwanted anti-drug antibody response toward proteins or monoclonal antibodies upon repeated administration is shown to impact the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of multiple biologics. Unique immunogenicity challenges of the subcutaneous route have been realized through various preclinical and clinical examples, although subcutaneous delivery has often demonstrated comparable immunogenicity to intravenous administration. Beyond route of administration as a treatment-related factor of immunogenicity, certain product-related risk factors are particularly relevant to subcutaneously administered proteins. This review attempts to provide an overview of the mechanism of immune response toward proteins administered subcutaneously (subcutaneous proteins) and comments on product-related risk factors related to protein structure and stability, dosage form, and aggregation. A two-wave mechanism of antigen presentation in the immune response toward subcutaneous proteins is described, and interaction with dynamic antigen-presenting cells possessing high antigen processing efficiency and migratory activity may drive immunogenicity. Mitigation strategies for immunogenicity are discussed, including those in general use clinically and those currently in development. Mechanistic insights along with consideration of risk factors involved inspire theoretical strategies to provide antigen-specific, long-lasting effects for maintaining the safety and efficacy of therapeutic proteins.","Jarvi, Nicole L.; Balu-Iyer, Sathy V.",BioDrugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7848667/,386

METHODS: Weekly suicide mortalities and influenza-like illness (ILI) were analyzed using time series regression. Regression coefficient for suicide mortality based on percentage change of ILI was calculated using a quasi-Poisson regression. Non-linear distributed lag models with quadratic function up to 24 weeks were constructed. RESULTS: The association between ILI and suicide mortality increased significantly up to 8 weeks post-influenza diagnosis. A significant positive association between ILI and suicide mortality was observed from 2009, when a novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus provoked a worldwide pandemic. No meaningful association between these factors was observed before 2009. CONCLUSION: There was a significant positive relationship between ILI and suicide mortality after 2009, when a novel influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus provoked a worldwide pandemic.","Jung, Sun Jae; Lim, Sung-Shil; Yoon, Jin-Ha",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7880447/,386
15509,Association of ACE2 variant rs4646188 with the risks of atrial fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke in Uygur patients with type 2 diabetes,2021-02-18,"An increased incidence of narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) was observed in Scandinavia following the 2009–2010 influenza Pandemrix vaccination. The association between NT1 and HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 supported the view of the vaccine as an etiological agent. A/H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) is the main antigenic determinant of the host neutralization antibody response. Using two different immunoassays, the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) and Radiobinding Assay (RBA), we investigated HA antibody levels and affinity in an exploratory and in a confirmatory cohort of Swedish NT1 patients and healthy controls vaccinated with Pandemrix. HA antibodies were increased in NT1 patients compared to controls in the exploratory (LIPS p = 0.0295, RBA p = 0.0369) but not in the confirmatory cohort (LIPS p = 0.55, RBA p = 0.625). HA antibody affinity, assessed by competition with Pandemrix vaccine, was comparable between patients and controls (LIPS: 48 vs. 39 ng/ml, p = 0.81; RBA: 472 vs. 491 ng/ml, p = 0.65). The LIPS assay also detected higher HA antibody titres as associated with HLA-DQB1*06:02:01 (p = 0.02). Our study shows that following Pandemrix vaccination, HA antibodies levels and affinity were comparable NT1 patients and controls and suggests that HA antibodies are unlikely to play a role in NT1 pathogenesis.","Lind, Alexander; Marzinotto, Ilaria; Brigatti, Cristina; Ramelius, Anita; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Lampasona, Vito",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893011/,386
16139,Risk of respiratory infection in patients with plaque psoriasis,2021-01-10,"Background: Drug interactions are the most common preventable cause of adverse drug reaction, which may result in drug toxicity or undesired therapeutic effect with harmful outcomes to patients. Given the rising use of combination therapies, the main objectives of this study were to estimate the degree to which physicians can identify potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) correctly and to describe the common source of information used by physicians when they need to check PDDIs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey utilizing a self-administered online questionnaire was conducted among physicians in China. Participants were asked to classify 20 drug pairs as “no interaction,” “may be used together with monitoring,” “contraindication,” and “not sure.” We also collected data on the physician's source of information and altitude toward the PDDIs. An ordinary least square regression model was performed to investigate the potential predictors of PDDI knowledge. Results: Eligible questionnaires were obtained from 618 physicians. The respondents classified correctly 6.7 out of 20 drug pairs, or 33.4% of the drug interactions investigated. The number of drug pairs recognized by respondents was ranged from 0 to 16. The percentage of physicians who recognized specific drug pairs ranged from 8.3% for no interactions between conjugated estrogens and raloxifene, to 64.0% for the interaction between dopamine and phenytoin. When the respondents want to check PDDI information, the most commonly used source of information was package inserts (n = 572, 92.6%), followed by the Internet or mobile Apps (n = 424, 68.6%), consultation with clinical pharmacists (n = 384, 62.1%), medical textbooks (n = 374, 60.5%), knowledge base in Chinese (n = 283, 45.8%), and other physicians (n = 366, 59.2%). In the multiple regression analysis, the significant predictors of a higher number of recognized drug pairs were years of practice and altitudes toward PDDIs. Conclusion: In this online survey accessing physician's ability to detect PDDIs, less than half of the drug pairs were recognized, indicating unsatisfactory level of knowledge about the clinically significant drug interactions. Continuing education and accessible electronic database can help physicians detecting PDDIs and improve drug safety.","Yuan, Jing; Shen, Chunying; Wang, Chengnan; Shen, Gang; Han, Bing",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957001/,386
16294,Adenovirus 36 prevalence and association with human obesity: a systematic review,2021-03-22,"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients receiving dopaminergic treatment may experience bursts of creativity. Although this phenomenon is sometimes recognized among patients and their clinicians, the association between dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in PD patients and creativity remains underexplored. It is unclear, for instance, whether DRT affects creativity through convergent or divergent thinking, idea generation, or a general lack of inhibition. It is also unclear whether DRT only augments pre-existing creative attributes or generates creativity de novo. Here, we tested a group of PD patients when “on” and “off” dopaminergic treatment on a series of tests of creative problem-solving (Alternative Uses Task, Compound Remote Associates, Rebus Puzzles), and related their performance to a group of matched healthy controls as well as to their pre-PD creative skills and measures of inhibition/impulsivity. Results did not provide strong evidence that DRT improved creative thinking in PD patients. Rather, PD patients “on” medication showed less flexibility in divergent thinking, generated fewer ideas via insight, and showed worse performance in convergent thinking overall (by making more errors) than healthy controls. Pre-PD creative skills predicted enhanced flexibility and fluency in divergent thinking when PD patients were “on” medication. However, results on convergent thinking were mixed. Finally, PD patients who exhibited deficits in a measure of inhibitory control showed weaker convergent thinking while “on” medication, supporting previous evidence on the importance of inhibitory control in creative problem-solving. Altogether, results do not support the hypothesis that DRT promotes creative thinking in PD. We speculate that bursts of artistic production in PD are perhaps conflated with creativity due to lay conceptions of creativity (i.e., an art-bias).","Salvi, Carola; Leiker, Emily K.; Baricca, Beatrix; Molinari, Maria A.; Eleopra, Roberto; Nichelli, Paolo F.; Grafman, Jordan; Dunsmoor, Joseph E.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984162/,386
16667,Global Perspectives on Palliative Care for Cancer Patients: Not All Countries Are the Same,2021-04-08,"Plasma lipids have been at the center stage of the prediction and prevention strategies for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and novel lipidomic traits have been recognized as reliable biomarkers for CVD risk prediction. The mitochondria serve as energy supply sites for cells and can synthesize a variety of lipids autonomously. Therefore, investigating the relationships between mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and plasma lipidomic traits is meaningful. Here, we enrolled a total of 1,409 Han Chinese patients with coronary artery disease from three centers and performed linear regression analyses on the SNPs of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and lipidomic traits in two independent groups. Sex, age, aspartate aminotransferase, estimated glomerular filtration rate, antihypertensive drugs, hypertension, and diabetes were adjusted. We identified three associations, namely, D-loop(m.16089T>C) with TG(50:4) NL-16:0, D-loop(m.16145G>A) with TG(54:5) NL-18:0, and D-loop(m.16089T>C) with PC(16:0_16:1) at the statistically significant threshold of FDR < 0.05. Then, we explored the relationships between mitochondrial genetic variants and traditional lipids, including triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Two significant associations were found, namely MT-ND6(m.14178T>C) with TC and D-loop(m.215A>G) with LDLC. Furthermore, we performed linear regression analysis to determine on the SNPs of mtDNA and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and found that the SNP D-loop(m.16145G>A) was nominally significantly associated with LVEF (P = 0.047). Our findings provide insights into the lipidomic context of mtDNA variations and highlight the importance of studying mitochondrial genetic variants related to lipid species.","Wang, Zixian; Chen, Hui; Qin, Min; Liu, Chen; Ma, Qilin; Chen, Xiaoping; Zhang, Ying; Lai, Weihua; Zhang, Xiaojuan; Zhong, Shilong",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8027325/,386
17436,Hair Loss After Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2021-03-05,"Activating mutants of RAS are commonly found in human cancers, but to date selective targeting of RAS in the clinic has been limited to KRAS(G12C) through covalent inhibitors. Here, we report a monobody, termed 12VC1, that recognizes the active state of both KRAS(G12V) and KRAS(G12C) up to 400-times more tightly than wild-type KRAS. The crystal structures reveal that 12VC1 recognizes the mutations through a shallow pocket, and 12VC1 competes against RAS-effector interaction. When expressed intracellularly, 12VC1 potently inhibits ERK activation and the proliferation of RAS-driven cancer cell lines in vitro and in mouse xenograft models. 12VC1 fused to VHL selectively degrades the KRAS mutants and provides more extended suppression of mutant RAS activity than inhibition by 12VC1 alone. These results demonstrate the feasibility of selective targeting and degradation of KRAS mutants in the active state with noncovalent reagents and provide a starting point for designing noncovalent therapeutics against oncogenic RAS mutants.","Teng, Kai Wen; Tsai, Steven T.; Hattori, Takamitsu; Fedele, Carmine; Koide, Akiko; Yang, Chao; Hou, Xuben; Zhang, Yingkai; Neel, Benjamin G.; O’Bryan, John P.; Koide, Shohei",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113534/,386
17665,Heterogeneity in design and analysis of ICU delirium randomized trials: a systematic review,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Long-term right ventricular (RV) pacing leads to heart failure or a decline in left ventricular (LV) function in up to a fifth of patients. We aimed to establish whether patients with focal fibrosis detected on late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) have deterioration in LV function after RV pacing. METHODS: We recruited 84 patients with LV ejection fraction ≥40% into 2 observational CMR studies. Patients (n=34) with a dual-chamber device and preserved atrioventricular conduction underwent CMR in 2 asynchronous pacing modes (atrial asynchronous and dual-chamber asynchronous) to compare intrinsic atrioventricular conduction with forced RV pacing. Patients (n=50) with high-grade atrioventricular block underwent CMR before and 6 months after pacemaker implantation to investigate the medium-term effects of RV pacing. RESULTS: The key findings were (1) initiation of RV pacing in patients with fibrosis, compared with those without, was associated with greater immediate changes in both LV end-systolic volume index (5.3±3.5 versus 2.1±2.4 mL/m(2); P<0.01) and LV ejection fraction (−5.7±3.4% versus −3.2±2.6%; P=0.02); (2) medium-term RV pacing in patients with fibrosis, compared with those without, was associated with greater changes in LV end-systolic volume index (8.0±10.4 versus −0.6±7.3 mL/m(2); P=0.008) and LV ejection fraction (−12.3±7.9% versus −6.7±6.2%; P=0.012); (3) patients with fibrosis did not experience an improvement in quality of life, biomarkers, or functional class after pacemaker implantation; (4) after 6 months of RV pacing, 10 of 50 (20%) patients developed LV ejection fraction <35% and were eligible for upgrade to cardiac resynchronization according to current guidelines. All 10 patients had fibrosis on their preimplant baseline scan and were identified by >1.1 g of fibrosis with 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrosis detected on CMR is associated with immediate- and medium-term deterioration in LV function following RV pacing and could be used to identify those at risk of heart failure before pacemaker implantation.","Saunderson, Christopher E.D.; Paton, Maria F.; Brown, Louise A.E.; Gierula, John; Chew, Pei G.; Das, Arka; Sengupta, Anshuman; Craven, Thomas P.; Chowdhary, Amrit; Koshy, Aaron; White, Hazel; Levelt, Eylem; Dall’Armellina, Erica; Garg, Pankaj; Witte, Klaus K.; Greenwood, John P.; Plein, Sven; Swoboda, Peter P.",Circ Cardiovasc Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136461/,386
18333,Renal Function Assessment and Direct-Acting Oral Anticoagulants Dosing: Are We Entering a New Age?,2021-06-03,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) contains a 3.2 kb DNA genome and causes acute and chronic hepatitis. HBV infection is a global health problem, with 350 million chronically infected people at increased risk of developing liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methylation of HBV DNA in a CpG context (5mCpG) can alter the expression patterns of viral genes related to infection and cellular transformation. Moreover, it may also provide clues as to why certain infections are cleared or persist with or without progression to cancer. The detection of 5mCpG often requires techniques that damage DNA or introduce bias through a myriad of limitations. Therefore, we developed a method for the detection of 5mCpG on the HBV genome that does not rely on bisulfite conversion or PCR. With Cas9-guided RNPs to specifically target the HBV genome, we enriched in HBV DNA from primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) infected with different HBV genotypes, as well as enriching in HBV from infected patient liver tissue, followed by sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. Detection of 5mCpG by nanopore sequencing was benchmarked with bisulfite-quantitative methyl-specific qPCR (BS-qMSP). The 5mCpG levels in HBV determined by BS-qMSP and nanopore sequencing were highly correlated. Our nanopore sequencing approach achieved a coverage of ~2000× of HBV depending on infection efficiency, sufficient coverage to perform a de novo assembly and detect small fluctuations in HBV methylation, providing the first de novo assembly of native HBV DNA, as well as the first landscape of 5mCpG from native HBV sequences. Moreover, by capturing entire HBV genomes, we explored the epigenetic heterogeneity of HBV in infected patients and identified four epigenetically distinct clusters based on methylation profiles. This method is a novel approach that enables the enrichment of viral DNA in a mixture of nucleic acid material from different species and will serve as a valuable tool for infectious disease monitoring.","Goldsmith, Chloe; Cohen, Damien; Dubois, Anaëlle; Martinez, Maria Guadalupe; Petitjean, Kilian; Corlu, Anne; Testoni, Barbara; Hernandez-Vargas, Hector; Chemin, Isabelle",Microb Genom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209722/,386

In this study, the susceptible–exposed–infectious–asymptomatic–recovered (SEIAR) model fitted the actual incidence data of mumps. The effective reproduction number (R(t)) was used to evaluate and compare the transmission capacity in different areas. From 2005 to 2018, there were 36,415 cases. The incidence of mumps was highest among people aged 5–10 years (460.02 per 100,000). The SEIAR model fitted the reported mumps data well (P < 0.01). The median transmissibility (R(t)) was 1.04 (range = 0–2.50). There were two peak spreads every year (from March to May and from October to December). The R(t) peak always appeared in the first 2 months of the peak incidence rate. The peak time of the epidemic spread of mumps was 1–2 months earlier than the peak incidence rate. The prevention and control measures of vaccination for children aged 5–10 years should be taken before the peak transmission capacity each year, 2 months before the peak of the outbreak, to reduce the spread of mumps.","Peng, Ying; Yang, Tianlong; Zhu, Yuanzhao; Hu, Qingqing; Wang, Yao; Zhao, Zeyu; Rui, Jia; Lin, Shengnan; Liu, Xingchun; Xu, Jingwen; Yang, Meng; Deng, Bin; Huang, Jiefeng; Liu, Weikang; Luo, Li; Liu, Chan; Li, Zhuoyang; Li, Peihua; Kong, Deguang; Yang, Xiaobing; Chen, Tianmu",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8369200/,386
20335,Correction to: A cross‑section observational study on the seroprevalence of antibodies to COVID‑19 in patients receiving opiate agonist treatment,2021-08-26,"BACKGROUND: Type A aortic dissection is a very dangerous, fatal, and emergency condition for surgery. Acute aortic dissection is a rare condition, such that many patients will not survive without reconstructive surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case 24-year-old male who came with symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. The patient underwent ECG, chest radiology, and ultrasound, where the patient was found to have right pleural effusion while his ECG was normal. In the history taken from the patient, he had no underlying disease, no history of heart diseases in his family. For a better diagnosis, ETT and aortic CT angiography was performed on the patient which confirmed the evidence of dissection. Immediately after the diagnosis, necessary arrangements were made for open heart surgery and the patient was prepared for surgery. The patient was admitted in the cardiac surgery ICU for 5 days and his medication was carefully administered. After the conditions were stabilized, the patient was transferred to the post-cardiac surgery ICU ward. The patient was discharged from the hospital one week after the surgery and returned to the office as an OPD one week after his discharge. CONCLUSION: Various risk factors can play a role in creating aortic dissection. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to patients’ history for achieving a quick and definitive diagnosis. Therefore, to control the complications of placing the cannula as well as the duration of the surgery, it is very important to reduce the duration of pumping on the patient and to be very careful during the cannula placement.","Shafiee, Masoud; Shafiee, Mohsen; Tahery, Noorollah; Azadbakht, Omid; Nassari, Zeinab; Baghbani, Reza",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8390077/,386
20675,Development and Validation of Nomogram Prediction Model for Postoperative Sleep Disturbance in Patients Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Predictive equations (PEs) for estimating resting energy expenditure (REE) that have been developed from acute phase data may not be applicable in the late phase and vice versa. This study aimed to assess whether separate PEs are needed for acute and late phases of critical illness and to develop and validate PE(s) based on the results of this assessment. METHODS: Using indirect calorimetry, REE was measured at acute (≤5 days; n = 294) and late (≥6 days; n = 180) phases of intensive care unit admission. PEs were developed by multiple linear regression. A multi-fold cross-validation approach was used to validate the PEs. The best PEs were selected based on the highest coefficient of determination (R(2)), the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the lowest standard error of estimate (SEE). Two PEs developed from paired 168-patient data were compared with measured REE using mean absolute percentage difference. RESULTS: Mean absolute percentage difference between predicted and measured REE was <20%, which is not clinically significant. Thus, a single PE was developed and validated from data of the larger sample size measured in the acute phase. The best PE for REE (kcal/day) was 891.6(Height) + 9.0(Weight) + 39.7(Minute Ventilation)−5.6(Age) – 354, with R(2) = 0.442, RMSE = 348.3, SEE = 325.6 and mean absolute percentage difference with measured REE was: 15.1 ± 14.2% [acute], 15.0 ± 13.1% [late]. CONCLUSIONS: Separate PEs for acute and late phases may not be necessary.

21282,Temporal changes in epidemiological profile and fetal indications for late termination of pregnancy: a retrospective single-center study,2021-04-02,"BACKGROUND: Risk of mortality following surgery in patients across Africa is twice as high as the global average. Most of these deaths occur on hospital wards after the surgery itself. We aimed to assess whether enhanced postoperative surveillance of adult surgical patients at high risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality in Africa could reduce 30-day in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a two-arm, open-label, cluster-randomised trial of hospitals (clusters) across Africa. Hospitals were eligible if they provided surgery with an overnight postoperative admission. Hospitals were randomly assigned through minimisation in recruitment blocks (1:1) to provide patients with either a package of enhanced postoperative surveillance interventions (admitting the patient to higher care ward, increasing the frequency of postoperative nursing observations, assigning the patient to a bed in view of the nursing station, allowing family members to stay in the ward, and placing a postoperative surveillance guide at the bedside) for those at high risk (ie, with African Surgical Outcomes Study Surgical Risk Calculator scores ≥10) and usual care for those at low risk (intervention group), or for all patients to receive usual postoperative care (control group). Health-care providers and participants were not masked, but data assessors were. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality of patients at low and high risk, measured at the participant level. All analyses were done as allocated (by cluster) in all patients with available data. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03853824. FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2019, and July 27, 2020, 594 eligible hospitals indicated a desire to participate across 33 African countries; 332 (56%) were able to recruit participants and were included in analyses. We allocated 160 hospitals (13 275 patients) to provide enhanced postoperative surveillance and 172 hospitals (15 617 patients) to provide standard care. The mean age of participants was 37·1 years (SD 15·5) and 20 039 (69·4%) of 28 892 patients were women. 30-day in-hospital mortality occurred in 169 (1·3%) of 12 970 patients with mortality data in the intervention group and in 193 (1·3%) of 15 242 patients with mortality data in the control group (relative risk 0·96, 95% CI 0·69–1·33; p=0·79). 45 (0·2%) of 22 031 patients at low risk and 309 (5·6%) of 5500 patients at high risk died. No harms associated with either intervention were reported. INTERPRETATION: This intervention package did not decrease 30-day in-hospital mortality among surgical patients in Africa at high risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality. Further research is needed to develop interventions that prevent death from surgical complications in resource-limited hospitals across Africa.

22088,The risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with atopic dermatitis - a retrospective cohort study,2021-10-06,"ABSTRACT: Caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) is an infectious disease that affects goats and sheep causing drastic impacts on milk and meat production and is caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. The disease can be prevented through vaccination but currently, vaccines demonstrate limited efficacy consequently leading to a need for the development of new ones. Here, we described the in silico development of a new chimeric protein constructed with epitopes identified from the sequences of the genes nanH, pknG, spaC, and sodC, previously described as potential vaccinal targets against C. pseudotuberculosis. The chimera was expressed, purified, and its immunogenicity was evaluated using sera of immunized mice. Results indicate the chimeric protein was able to stimulate antibody production. Additionally, analysis using serum from naturally infected goats showed that the protein is recognized by sera from these animals, indicating the possibility for using this chimera in new diagnostic methods. KEY POINTS: • The chimera was expressed with 52 kDa and a yield of 7 mg/L after purification. • The chimera was recognized by the sera of animals immunized with this formulation. • Chimera reacted with the serum of goats naturally infected with C. pseudotuberculosis.

The theory is applied to Petri net games, where the strictly alternating games are in general undecidable. We consider soft bounds on Petri net places in order to achieve decidability and implement the algorithms in our prototype tool. Finally, we compare the performance of our approach with an algorithm proposed in the seminal work by Liu and Smolka for calculating the minimum fixed points on dependency graphs. The results show that using alternating simulation almost always improves the performance in time and space and with exponential gain in some examples. Moreover, we show that there are Petri net games where our algorithm with alternating simulation terminates, whereas the algorithm without the alternating simulation loops for any possible search order.","Karra, Shyam Lal; Larsen, Kim Guldstrand; Muñiz, Marco; Srba, Jiří",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324245/,386

In this study, we used invasive Lactobacillus plantarum (L.P) expressing the FnBPA protein as a novel bacterial carrier for DNA delivery into epithelial cells to develop a live oral DNA vaccine. A fusion DNA vaccine co-expressing EtMIC2 and chicken IL-18 (chIL-18) was constructed and then delivered to the host by invasive L.P. Its efficacy against Eimeria tenella challenge was evaluated in chickens by examining the relative weight gain rate; caecal lesion score; OPG; anti-coccidial index (ACI); levels of EtMIC2 antibody, FnBPA, IL-4, IL-18, IFN-γ and SIgA; and proliferation ability and percentages of CD4(+) and CD8(+) splenocytes. The experimental results showed that chickens immunized with invasive L.P carrying the eukaryotic expression vector pValac-EtMIC2 (pValac-EtMIC2/pSIP409-FnBPA) had markedly improved immune protection against challenge compared with that of chickens immunized with non-invasive L.P (pValac-EtMIC2/pSIP409). However, invasive L.P co-expressing EtMIC2 with the chIL-18 vector exhibited the highest protection efficiency against E. tenella. These results indicate that invasive Lactobacillus-expressing FnBPA improved humoural and cellular immunity and enhanced resistance to E. tenella. The DNA vaccine delivered by invasive Lactobacillus provides a new concept and method for the prevention of E. tenella.","Zhang, Zan; Huang, Hai-Bin; Jiang, Yan-Long; Liu, Jing; Gao, Xing; Liu, Yang; Yang, Wen-Tao; Shi, Chun-Wei; Wang, Dan; Wang, Jian-Zhong; Kang, Yuan-Huan; Wang, Chun-Feng; Yang, Gui-Lian",Parasitol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382971/,386

At the same time, the policy response is remarkably uniform: most of sub-Saharan Africa went into lockdown from the second week in March. What happens next for the pandemic across Africa is uncertain, but the March lockdowns are unlikely to have contained the epidemic by themselves. What is clear is that the combination of domestic lockdowns and the spill-over from the global recession means immediate and severe hardship. This paper looks beyond the public health aspects of the pandemic to examine the medium-term macroeconomic adjustment challenge confronting domestic policy-makers and international donors. We combine epidemiological and macroeconomic models to calibrate the scale of the combined shock to a representative low-income African economy and to show how alternative policy options for slowing transmission of COVID-19 impact on public revenue, and on GDP in the short run, and hence shape the path to recovery. Noting that the first lockdown, however costly, does not by itself eliminate the likelihood of a re-emergence of the epidemic, we then frame the agenda for key macroeconomic and public finance policies to sustain recovery, growth, and poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa. The initial hit to consumption will be up to one-third. All the public policy options are grim. International donor finance of US$40–50 billion, together with domestic reform to accelerate recovery, would make a significant difference to the outlook for poverty.","Adam, Christopher; Henstridge, Mark; Lee, Stevan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499707/,386

Such an idea is equal to restricting movement on the basis of biology threatens freedom, fairness and public health. Lessons from previous pandemics will be examined in the context of current measures being deployed, assessing practical and ethical aspects. For example, false negatives in people with few antibodies leading to immune individuals being incorrectly labelled as not immune or not having access to testing to demonstrate immunity. Additionally, the case of healthcare workers will be examined considering feasibility of testing, but also in terms of discrimination and stigma. Another aspect to be explored in detail is monitoring and how it erodes privacy, with the main aim of immunity passport controlling movement. Documentation systems are already presenting a serious risk to privacy, with China announcing the QR-code tracking systems is likely to stay in place after the pandemic ends. Access issues to testing can contribute to further discrimination, whereas labelling people on their basis of their COVID19 status would create a new measure of dividing the society to 'immunoprivileged and immonodeprived' people. A labelling particularly disconcerting in the absence of a free, universally available vaccine. Furthermore, Social and financial inequities would be amplified, whereas divisions between nations could be fueled. Already people with HIV are subjected to restrictions on entering, living and working in certain countries with laws that impinge on the rights of those from sexual and gender minorities. Governments should instead invest on pandemic damage limitation - test, trace and isolate, and apps that empower individuals to make safe choices about their own movements should be prioritized. Also, the development, production and global distribution of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-is key. Universal, timely, free access to a vaccination becomes possible could allow for ethical recording of vaccination status in the context of certain activities. Threats to freedom, fairness and public health are inherent to any platform that is designed to segregate society on the basis of biological data.

Rather than asking “whether it is justified to impose strict measures”, we propose asking “how to best care for a person’s carriership and well-being in ways that do not imply an unacceptable risk for others?”. A solidarity approach could include elevating baseline levels of precaution measures and accepting certain risks in cases where there is exceptionally much at stake. A generous national compensation policy that also covers for costs related to dedicated care is essential in a solidarity approach. An additional benefit of reframing the questions is that it helps to better acknowledge that being subjected to control measures is a highly personal matter.","Rump, Babette; Timen, Aura; Hulscher, Marlies; Verweij, Marcel",Monash Bioeth Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7648233/,386

In particular, we investigate if there is a correlation between the overall partisanship of a county and whether a county government's website (1) mentions COVID-19 and (2) provides safety instructions concerning COVID-19. We hypothesize that mass partisanship will impact the probability that a county government's website provides information related to the coronavirus. We find that a larger share of Democratic voters in a county is associated with an increase in the probability that a county government's website mentions COVID-19 and provides safety instructions for its residents. The results hold even after controlling for population density, internet subscriptions and COVID-19 cases and deaths.

In addition, more and more interventions are carried out on an outpatient basis. This particularly applies to arthroscopy, which also places high demands on the skills of the surgeon. Therefore, numerous virtual arthroscopy simulators have been developed over the past 20 years. These are virtual desktop systems that are coupled with a joint simulator, which allow tactile feedback. In this way basic arthroscopic skills (e.g. triangulation) or arthroscopic operations (e.g. partial meniscectomy) can be trained. The systems enable success control by recording various parameters (surgical time, camera and instrument path length, cartilage contact). Specific simulators already exist for all major joints. Scientific data are now available on face validity, content validity, construct validity and transfer validity of these systems. The skills learned can therefore be transferred to success in the operating room. The cost efficiency of these systems has so far not been resolved. Immersive virtual reality (VR) systems using 3D goggles and tactile hand sensors must be distinguished from desktop joint model systems. The participants usually join the application as an avatar. Immersive systems are therefore particularly suitable for simulating open surgical procedures (e.g. hip arthroplasty). Initial studies have also shown evidence for the use of immersive virtual reality for content, construct and transfer validity when training various open operations.

We examine the extent to which Modi has contributed to the strengthening of each of these partnerships with respect to institutionalisation, security, economic interaction and status.

Being a social scientist, I started with the factors influencing effective response to this crisis, as representative of efforts at social/societal change more broadly. After reflecting on the outcomes of the exercise which proved productive, I argue that if we, as researchers, want to reform the PhD, we would benefit from thinking more broadly about the nature of social science research, in fact, conceive of the PhD and our own work as encompassing solution-oriented inquiry. We would also expand and deepen our interactions with those beyond our own disciplinary colleagues: not just researchers in other disciplines, but those in other labour sectors and civil society—this whether the research/PhD goal is to address the climate crisis, other sustainability issues, or other meaningful goals.","McAlpine, Lynn",The PhD at the End of the World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8015683/,386
52604,Longitudinal Study of Prevalence of Sodium Abnormalities in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus has affected more than 100 million people. Most of these patients are hospitalized in isolation wards or self-quarantined at home. A significant percentage of COVID-19 patients may experience psychiatric symptoms. This study attempts to assess depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in home-isolated and hospitalized COVID-19 patients, besides whether the isolation setting affected these symptoms’ presentation. RESULTS: The study involved 89 patients with confirmed COVID-19 virus, and the patients were divided into 2 groups: 43 patients in the home-isolated group (group A) and 46 patients in the hospital-isolated group (group B). The majority of subjects were male and married; also, they were highly educated. 30.2% from group A and 47.8% from group B had a medical occupation. There was a statistically significant difference (p= 0.03) between both groups in the presence of chronic disease. There was a statistically significant increase in suicidal thoughts in the home-isolated group (37.2%) (p = 0.008**). We found a statistically significant increase in the abnormal scores of Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale–Depression (HADS–Depression) in the home-isolated group (69.7%) compared to the hospital-isolated group (32.6%) (p <0.001**) which denotes considerable symptoms of depression. Moreover, we found that (32.6%) from the home-isolated group and (39.1%) from the hospital-isolated group had abnormal scores of Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale–Anxiety (HADS–Anxiety) which denotes considerable symptoms of anxiety. Also, we found 66.7% and 87.2% scored positive by the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) in the home-isolated group and hospital-isolated group, respectively. Which was statistically significant (p = 0.02**). On doing a binary logistic regression analysis of HADS and DTS with significantly related independent factors, we revealed that lower education levels and family history of psychiatric disorder were risk factors for abnormal HADS–Anxiety scores in COVID-19 patients. The medical occupation was a protective factor against having abnormal HADS–Depression scores in COVID-19 patients, while home isolation was a risk factor. On the contrary, the medical occupation was a risk factor for scoring positive in DTS in COVID-19 patients. Simultaneously, low levels of education and home isolation were protective factors. CONCLUSION: A significant number of patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus develop depressive, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, whether they were isolated in the hospital or at home; besides, the isolation setting may affect the presenting symptoms.","Mohamed, Amany Elshabrawy; Yousef, Amira Mohamed",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8093000/,386
52671,Future projections of opioid use and cost in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain in Spain,2021-04-29,"Tracheostomy is a commonly performed airway surgery for critically ill patients. Tracheostomy tube is an indwelling prosthesis, providing potential surface for growth of bacteria. Biofilm formation by bacteria as a self-protective mechanism, has led to worrisome antibacterial resistance and thus higher rate of nosocomial infections. A prospective observational study was conducted with a purpose of knowing most common organisms capable of forming biofilm on tracheostomy tube and their antibiotic sensitivity in our setting. Fifty seven percent of the isolates were found to be capable of biofilm production. Acinetobacter baumannii (45%) was the commonest biofilm producer isolated and the commonest multidrug resistant organism (35.7%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.5%). Both biofilm producers and non-biofilm producers were found most susceptible to Amikacin (43%), followed by Gentamicin (30%) and Ciprofloxacin (18.5%). No significant association was found between biofilms and ventilators (p value = 0.558) or pre-existing infection (p value = 0.66) using Chi square test. Potentially biofilm producing bacteria were isolated from tracheostomy tube inner surfaces just after a week of their insertion, in majority of patients. Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the commonest biofilm forming organisms and Amikacin, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin were most sensitive drugs. Multi drug resistant organisms were also commonly found, stressing the need for sensitivity-based antibiotics. Ventilator usage had no strong association with biofilm formation. Patients with non-infectious conditions also harboured bacteria capable of biofilms in tracheostomy tubes demanding the need for stringent tube hygiene measures and prophylactic antibiotics.","Raveendra, Nandini; Rathnakara, Subhodha H.; Haswani, Neha; Subramaniam, Vijayalakshmi",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100750/,386

The Portuguese constitutional and legal framework is particularly generous regarding the right to healthcare to irregular migrants. Nevertheless, until now, several practical barriers prevented full access to healthcare services provided by the national health service, even in situations in which it was legally granted. This decision is not only remarkable in light of the fulfilling of migrants’ rights to health, as imposed by international commitments assumed by, but also in view of the fight against COVID-19. The decision is grounded both on human rights and in public health reasons. The paper is divided in two main parts. In the first one, it analyzes national State obligations with regard to healthcare provision to migrants in irregular situation. In the second part, it analyzes the Portuguese solution, using this case study to discuss the possible mechanisms to comply with such obligations.","Raposo, Vera Lúcia; Violante, Teresa",Hum Rights Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8102131/,386
53088,P076 Adherence to COVID-19 risk stratification during the peak of pandemic: a District General Hospital experience,2021-04-26,"Honey has good antimicrobial properties and can be used for medical treatment. The antimicrobial properties of unifloral honey varieties are different. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of nine kinds of Chinese monofloral honeys. In addition, headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) technology was used to detect their volatile components. The relevant results are as follows: 1. The agar diffusion test showed that the diameter of inhibition zone against Staphylococcus aureus of Fennel honey (21.50 ± 0.41 mm), Agastache honey (20.74 ± 0.37 mm), and Pomegranate honey (18.16 ± 0.11 mm) was larger than that of Manuka 12+ honey (14.27 ± 0.10 mm) and Manuka 20+ honey (16.52 ± 0.12 mm). The antimicrobial activity of Chinese honey depends on hydrogen peroxide. 2. The total antioxidant capacity of Fennel honey, Agastache honey, and Pomegranate honey was higher than that of other Chinese honeys. There was a significant positive correlation between the total antioxidant capacity and the total phenol content of Chinese honey (r = 0.958). The correlation coefficient between the chroma value of Chinese honey and the total antioxidant and the diameter of inhibition zone was 0.940 and 0.746, respectively. The analyzed dark honeys had better antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. 3. There were significant differences in volatile components among Fennel honey, Agastache honey, Pomegranate honey, and Manuka honey. Hexanal-D and Heptanol were the characteristic components of Fennel honey and Pomegranate honey, respectively. Ethyl 2-methylbutyrate and 3-methylpentanoic acids were the unique compounds of Agastache honey. The flavor fingerprints of the honey samples from different plants can be successfully built using HS-GC-IMS and principal component analysis (PCA) based on their volatile compounds. Fennel honey, Agastache honey, and Pomegranate honey are Chinese honey varieties with excellent antimicrobial properties, and have the potential to be developed into medical grade honey.","Zhang, Yan-Zheng; Si, Juan-Juan; Li, Shan-Shan; Zhang, Guo-Zhi; Wang, Shuai; Zheng, Huo-Qing; Hu, Fu-Liang",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125924/,386

53226,174 SARS-Cov-2 Increases The 30-Day Mortality in Hip Fracture Patients. A UK District Hospital’s Experience,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. INTRODUCTION: World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The pandemic is associated with more than 75 million cases and more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide. Greece implemented a nationwide lockdown on March 23, 2020, to control the pandemic wave and prevent reducing morbidity and mortality due to Covid-19. During this period, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) hospitalization in the cardiology department was reduced. In addition, the second pandemic wave also led to a new national lockdown on November 7, 2020, although it was implemented 15 days earlier in the relative regional hospital area due to high viral load. PURPOSE: Our study evaluated the number of hospitalized patients with ACS during the nationwide lockdown period, comparing them with the previous years (period 2018 and 2019). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data recordings regarding ACS (unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI) hospitalization rates in the Cardiology department were collected from the hospital""s register. Each year""s data analysis interval included the periods of the nationwide lockdown of 2020; March 23 to May 3 and October 14 to December 10. Statistical analysis was performed between periodic groups using the chi-square test (IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 23.0). RESULTS: During 2018, the number of patients hospitalized for ACS was 81 and consisted of 39,1% of the total hospitalizations in the Cardiology Department. In 2019 the number of patients hospitalized for ACS was 62 and consisted the 48,8% of the total hospitalizations, while in 2020, the number of patients hospitalized for ACS was 30 and consisted the 27,5% of the total hospitalizations. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference (p < 0,05) regarding ACS event hospitalization rate between the period of lockdown (March to May and October-December 2020) and the COVID-19-free period of the previous year (March to May and October to December 2019). There was no statistically significant difference (p > 0,05) regarding ACS event hospitalization rate between the period of lockdown (March to May and October to December 2020) and the COVID-19-free period of the year 2018 (March to May and October to December). Finally, there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0,05) in ACS event hospitalization rate between March to May and October to December regarding the years 2018 and 2019. CONCLUSION: Our results are in compliance with the ESC""s comparative survey regarding the observed worldwide reduction of hospitalizations for ACS during the COVID-19 lockdown era, suggesting a potential impact of lockdown in both non-environmental and environmental risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Factors of the relative epidemiological reduction are complexed and puzzled, while morbidity and mortality of ACS remained relatively stable even after the lockdown, so future studies are necessary to further investigate them.","Kanellos, I; Vasilakopoulos, V; Daios, S; Lampropoulos, S; Petridou, M; Kapos, I; Konstantinidis, D; Papakonstantinou, N; Kaiafa, G; Savopoulos, C",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135310/,386

BACKGROUND: The workflow and reperfusion time in STEMI patients are associated with morbidity-mortality. COVID19 lockdown restrictions could impact on routine prehospital management of STEMI. METHODS AND PURPOSE: Retrospective study comparing patients treated for STEMI during the period of lockdown in Spain (03/15/2020 to 05/31/2020) and patients with STEMI treated in the same period of the previous year (2019). The aim is to present our experience comparing the two periods attending to the prehospital flow of patients, the reperfusion strategy of choice, the prehospital complications and the ""patient delay time"" for reperfusion. RESULTS: We included 73 patients from the pre-COVID period and 67 patients from the lockdown. Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. During the lockdown, there was a significant increase in the number of patients who activated the emergency medical system (emergency number 112) bypassing an outpatient medical center. In addition and possibly due to patients’ preference for keeping social distance, there was an increase in the number of self-referred patients to the emergency department (ED), decreasing number of patients attended by ambulance system (table 1). There were no significant differences neither in the choice of reperfusion strategy nor in the occurrence of complications (image 1). The mean time from symptom onset to first medical contact (patient delay time) was not significantly prolonged (table 1). CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 lockdown, the flow of STEMI patients to the ED was modified because of patients preferences. It did not mean longer times to first medical attention or increase in the number of complications.","Jimenez Melo, O; Meseguer Gonzalez, D; Linares Vicente, JA; Rio Sanchez, S; Lukic Otanovic, A; Simo Sanchez, B; Lopez Cuartero, P; Jimenez Agesta, Y; Ruiz Arroyo, JR",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135420/,386
53738,Chest CT features of COVID-19 pediatric patients presented with upper respiratory symptoms,2021-05-31,"PubMed searches reveal much literature regarding lipids in barrier function of skin and less literature on lipids in barrier function of the oral mucosa. In terrestrial mammals, birds, and reptiles, the skin’s permeability barrier is provided by ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol in the outermost layers of the epidermis, the stratum corneum. This layer consists of about 10–20 layers of cornified cells embedded in a lipid matrix. It effectively prevents loss of water and electrolytes from the underlying tissue, and it limits the penetration of potentially harmful substances from the environment. In the oral cavity, the regions of the gingiva and hard palate are covered by keratinized epithelia that much resemble the epidermis. The oral stratum corneum contains a lipid mixture similar to that in the epidermal stratum corneum but in lower amounts and is accordingly more permeable. The superficial regions of the nonkeratinized oral epithelia also provide a permeability barrier. These epithelial regions do contain ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, which may underlie barrier function. The oral epithelial permeability barriers primarily protect the underlying tissue by preventing the penetration of potentially toxic substances, including microbial products. Transdermal drug delivery, buccal absorption, and lipid-related disease are discussed.","Wertz, Philip W.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155912/,386

In recent years, Phyllanthus urinaria has demonstrated potential to modulate the activation of critical pathways such as NF-κB, P13K/AKT, and ERK/JNK/P38/MAPKs associated with cell growth, proliferation, metastasis, and apoptotic cell death. To date, there is much evidence indicating that modulation of cellular signaling pathways is a promising approach to consider in drug development and discovery. Thus, therapies that can regulate cancer-related pathways are longed-for in anticancer drug discovery. This review's focus is to provide comprehensive knowledge on the anticancer mechanisms of Phyllanthus urinaria through the regulation of NF-κB, P13K/AKT, and ERK/JNK/P38/MAPKs signaling pathways. Thus, the review summarizes both in vitro and in vivo effects of Phyllanthus urinaria extracts or bioactive constituents with emphasis on tumor cell apoptosis. The literature information was obtained from publications on Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost. The key words used in the search were “Phyllanthus” or “Phyllanthus urinaria” and cancer. P. urinaria inhibits cancer cell proliferation via inhibition of NF-κB, P13K/AKT, and MAPKs (ERK, JNK, P38) pathways to induce apoptosis and prevents angiogenesis. It is expected that understanding these fundamental mechanisms may help stimulate additional research to exploit Phyllanthus urinaria and other natural products for the development of novel anticancer therapies in the future.","Saahene, Roland Osei.; Agbo, Elvis; Barnes, Precious; Yahaya, Ewura Seidu; Amoani, Benjamin; Nuvor, Samuel Victor; Okyere, Perditer",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8413045/,386

59343,A Study Protocol for an Open-Label Feasibility Treatment Trial of Visual Snow Syndrome With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,2021-09-24,"Introduction: Remote work was widely promoted in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the effects of remote work on psychological and physical stress responses and presenteeism of workers remain unclear. This research aims to provide empirical evidence of the implications for people and organizations of this new scenario of working from home. Methods: A two-wave panel survey of before and after the pandemic was performed to investigate the effects of remote work on these aspects among office workers. A total of 3,123 office workers from 23 tertiary industries responded to a questionnaire. Participants were surveyed about their job stress conditions and sleep practices in both 2019 and 2020, who had not done remote work as of 2019 were included in the study. The effects of remote work on psychological and physical stress responses and presenteeism were analyzed by multivariate analysis, with the adjustment of age, gender, overtime, job stressors, social support, and sleep status. Results: The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that remote work was associated with the reduction of psychological and physical stress responses independently of changes of job stressors, social support, sleep disturbance, and total sleep time on workdays. On the other hand, remote work of 5 days a week (full-remote) was associated with the reduction of work productivity. Conclusion: Promoting remote work can reduce psychological and physical stress responses, however, full-remote work has the risk of worsening presenteeism. From the viewpoint of mental health, the review of working styles is expected to have positive effects, even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shimura, Akiyoshi; Yokoi, Katsunori; Ishibashi, Yoshiki; Akatsuka, Yusaku; Inoue, Takeshi",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514617/,386

This study also aimed to discuss the possible pathogenesis of headache in COVID-19. Methods: Available articles from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched as of September 2 nd, 2020. Data on characteristics of the study, headache and COVID-19 were extracted following the PRISMA guidelines. Biases were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The cumulative prevalence of headache was calculated for the general population (i.e. adults and children). The pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) was calculated using the Z test to assess the association between headache and the presence of COVID-19 cases. Results: We included 104,751 COVID-19 cases from 78 eligible studies to calculate the global prevalence of headache in COVID-19 and 17 studies were included to calculate the association of headache and COVID-19. The cumulative prevalence of headache in COVID-19 was 25.2% (26,464 out of 104,751 cases). Headache was found to be more prevalent, approximately by two-fold, in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients with symptoms of other respiratory viral infections, OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.94, 2.5 with p=0.04. Conclusion: Headache is common among COVID-19 patients and seems to be more common in COVID-19 patients compared to those with the non-COVID-19 viral infection. No definitive mechanisms on how headache emerges in COVID-19 patients but several possible hypotheses have been proposed. However, extensive studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms.

Depending on its extent and severity, cells either alter their metabolism, and adopt a new state, or die. Fluctuations in environmental conditions occur frequently, and such stress disturbs cellular homeostasis, but in general, stresses are reversible and last only a short time. There is increasing evidence that regulation of gene expression in response to temporal stress happens post-transcriptionally in specialized subcellular membrane-less compartments called ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. RNP granules assemble through a concentration-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation of RNA-binding proteins that contain low-complexity sequence domains (LCDs). Interestingly, many factors that regulate microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and alternative splicing are RNA-binding proteins that contain LCDs and localize to stress-induced liquid-like compartments. Consequently, gene silencing through miRNAs and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs are emerging as crucial post-transcriptional mechanisms that function on a genome-wide scale to regulate the cellular stress response. In this Review, we describe the interplay between these two post-transcriptional processes that occur in liquid-like compartments as an adaptive cellular response to stress.","Kucherenko, Mariya M; Shcherbata, Halyna R",Journal of cell science,https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.202002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29444950/,386

METHODS From 2012 to 2018, EGC patients who underwent TLTG (n = 223), including the first case with intracorporeal hemi-double stapling, were matched to those who underwent LATG (n = 114) with extracorporeal circular stapling, using 2:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Prospectively collected morbidity was compared between the TLTG and LATG groups in conjunction with the learning curve. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QoL questionnaires QLQ-C30, STO22, and OG25 were prospectively surveyed during postoperative 1 year for patient subgroups. RESULTS After PSM, grade I pulmonary complication rate was lower in the TLTG group (n = 213) than in the LATG group (n = 111) (0.5% vs. 5.4%, P = 0.007). Other complications were not different between the groups. The learning curve of TLTG was overcome at the 26th case in terms of the comprehensive complication index. The TLTG group after learning curve showed lower grade I pulmonary complication rate than the matched LATG group (0.5% vs. 4.7%, P = 0.024). Regarding postoperative QoL, the TLTG group (n = 63) revealed less dysphagia (P = 0.028), pain (P = 0.028), eating restriction (P = 0.006), eating (P = 0.004), odynophagia (P = 0.023) than the LATG group (n = 21). Multivariate analyses for each QoL item demonstrated that TLTG was the only common independent factor for better QoL. CONCLUSIONS TLTG reduced grade I pulmonary complications and provided better QoL in dysphagia, pain, eating, odynophagia than LATG for patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer.","Park, Shin-Hoo; Suh, Yun-Suhk; Kim, Tae-Han; Choi, Yoon-Hee; Choi, Jong-Ho; Kong, Seong-Ho; Park, Do Joong; Lee, Hyuk-Joon; Yang, Han-Kwang",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-021-08744-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511059/,386
63899,Comorbid Dysphagia and Malnutrition in Elderly Hospitalized Patients.,2021-01-25,"Mycotoxins represent substantial challenges to the farming industry. These include toxins produced by Fusarium fungi, particularly trichothecenes (toxin T-2) and fumonisin (FB1). In the present study, we determined the effects of addition on Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysate (SCL) added to feed contaminated with T-2 and FB1 in terms of health, productive efficiency, and egg laying quality. We used 60 Hy-line Brown laying hens, and divided them into five groups with four repetitions per group and three birds per repetition. There was one group with no contamination with toxin (NoC). The four other groups included combinations of mycotoxin (4 ppm T-2, and 20 ppm FB1): A contamination group was used as control (the C+ group), and another two contained 500 g/ton of SCL (Detoxa Plus®) (the C + D500 group) or 1000 g/ton of SCL (the C + D1000 group). Finally, one group received feed containing 500 g/ton of Detoxa Plus® and 1000 g/ton of Uniwall Mos 25® (the C + D500 + U1000 group). The experimental period was 84 days, divided into three productive cycles of 28 days each. The NoC hens had greater egg production than the other groups. Hens that consumed feed with SCL had greater egg production than did the C+ group. The NoC hens produced eggs with greater weights than did the C hens; however, C + D1000 and C + D500 + U1000 birds produced greater egg weights than did the C+ group. The C+ group produced lower egg masses than did the NoC and C + D500 + U1000 groups. The feed intake (FI) was lower in hens that ingested mycotoxin. The use of SCL in feed minimized the negative effects of mycotoxin on feed conversion ratio (FI/dozen). Effects of treatment were detected for feed conversion ratio (kg/kg). The hens that consumed mycotoxin had lower shell resistance and thickness compared to those in the NoC group. The red color of egg yolk was greater in the control groups. There were fluctuations in levels of liver enzymes when birds consumed mycotoxin (sometimes reduced and sometimes increased); nevertheless, the cumulative effect increased the activity of alanine aminotransferase. The serum concentration of reactive oxygen species was greater in hens that ingested mycotoxin only on d 84 compared to the NoC group. Serum glutathione S-transferase activity was greater on d 56 in C + D500 and C + D1000 hens than in the others. We conclude that, in general, the consumption of mycotoxin impaired the performance and quality of the eggs of the hens; the addition of the S. cerevisiae lysate and the addition organic acids, yeast cell wall and mineral carrier minimized some of the negative effects caused by T-2 and FB1.","Dazuk, Vanessa; Boiago, Marcel M; Rolim, Gabriela; Paravisi, Andreia; Copetti, Priscilla M; Bissacotti, Bianca P; Morsch, Vera M; Vedovatto, Marcelo; Gazoni, Fabio L; Matte, Fabrizio; Micotti, Eduardo G; da Silva, Aleksandro S",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007430/,386

64413,Iatrogenic cerebral gas embolism-A systematic review of case reports.,2019,"BACKGROUND The sleeve gastrectomy (SG) can be performed with or without antral preservation (distance from the pylorus < 50mm). The objective of this study was to evaluate the distance between the pylorus and the end of the left vagus nerve in order to determine whether it could be used as a constant anatomical landmark to start gastric transection. METHODS This was a prospective, non-randomized study of 120 patients undergoing SG from January to October 2018. The distance measurement between pylorus and vagus nerve was performed at the beginning of the SG. The primary endpoint was the distance between the beginning of the pylorus and the end of the 2nd branch of the vagus nerve on the upper edge of the antrum. The secondary endpoints was the correlation factors between the preoperative data and the position of the end of the vagus nerve. RESULTS A total of 120 patients, with a mean BMI of 42.2 kg/m2 , underwent primary SG. The mean distance between pylorus and the end of the vagus nerve was 50.4 mm (35-64) on the upper part of the antrum. When considering the inferior part of the antrum, the minimum distance was 50 mm. No correlations were found between pre-operative data and distance measurements. CONCLUSION The vagus nerve can be considered as a constant and reliable anatomical landmark for performing SG with antral preservation. However, no correlation was found between the preoperative data and the location of the end of the vagus nerve. This article is protected by copyright.

Its major clinical presentation is characterized by respiratory symptoms ranging from mild cough to serve pneumonia with fever and potentially even death. Until today, there is no known medication to improve clinical symptoms or even prevent or fight the infection. The search for a useful vaccination is ongoing and it will probably not be available before the end of 2020. In this review, we highlight hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential agent to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and reduce as well as shorten clinical symptoms. Moreover, it might serve as a potential post-exposition prophylaxis. Although it has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, discoid or systemic lupus erythematosus, and malaria prophylaxis and therapy for decades, knowledge on HCQ as a potential treatment for COVID-19 is limited and multiple clinical trials have just emerged. Especially, rare HCQ side effects which were of minor importance for use in selected indications might gain major relevance with population-wide application. These rare side effects include retinopathy and-even more important-QT prolongation leading to sudden cardiac death by malignant arrhythmias.","Stremmel, Christopher; Kellnar, Antonia; Massberg, Steffen; Kääb, Stefan",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1177/1074248420935740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32700555/,386
64513,Clinical characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter hospitalized during the COVID-19 pandemic. The population analysis of nearly 5 million people.,2021-05-11,"Adaptive thermal plasticity allows organisms to adjust their physiology to cope with fluctuating environments. However, thermal plasticity is rarely studied in response to thermal variability and is often measured in a single life stage. Plasticity in response to thermal variability likely differs from responses to constant temperatures or acute stress. In addition, life stages likely differ in their plasticity and responses in one stage may be affected by the experiences in a previous stage. Increasing the resolution with which we understand thermal plasticity in response to thermal variation across ontogeny is crucial to understanding how organisms cope with the thermal variation in their environment and to estimating the capacity of plasticity to mitigate costs of rapid environmental change. We wanted to know if life stages differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity under temperature fluctuations. We reared Onthophagus taurus dung beetles in either low or high temperature fluctuation treatments and quantified thermal plasticity of metabolism of pupae and adults. We found that adults were thermally plastic and pupae were not. Next, we wanted to know if the plasticity observed in the adult life stage was affected by the thermal conditions during development. We again used low and high temperature fluctuation treatments and reared individuals in one condition through all egg to pupal stages. At eclosion, we switched half of the individuals in each treatment to the opposite fluctuation condition and, later, measured thermal plasticity of metabolism on adults. We found that temperature conditions experienced during the adult stage, but not egg to pupal stages, affects adult thermal plasticity. However, temperature fluctuations during development affect adult body size, suggesting that some aspects of the adult phenotype are decoupled from previous life stages and others are not. Our data demonstrate that life stages mount different responses to temperature variability and uniquely contribute to the adult phenotype. These findings emphasize the need to broadly integrate the life cycle into studies of phenotypic plasticity and physiology; doing so should enhance our ability to predict organismal responses to rapid global change and inform conservation efforts.","Carter, Amanda W; Sheldon, Kimberly S",The Journal of experimental biology,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.227884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917819/,386

METHODS A comprehensive literature review on COVID-19 was conducted. A two-stage modified Delphi technique involving 18 oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons across Canada was used to determine consensus risk-stratification criteria and PPE recommendations for surgeries performed in the North American context. RESULTS COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We summarize COVID-19 virology and transmission, as well as practice considerations for oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted predominantly by droplet mechanisms, some studies suggest that transmission is possible through aerosols. Among common procedures performed by oculofacial and plastic surgeons, some are likely to be considered aerosol-generating. Risk of transmission increases when manipulating structures known to harbor high viral loads. We present an algorithm for risk-stratification based on the nature of surgery and the anatomical sites involved and offer recommendations for PPE. CONCLUSIONS Although universal droplet precautions are now recommended in most healthcare settings, some clinical situations require more stringent infection control measures. By highlighting high-risk scenarios specific to oculofacial plastic and orbital surgery, as well as PPE recommendations, we hope to enhance the safety of continued care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daigle, Patrick; Leung, Victoria; Yin, Vivian; Kalin-Hajdu, Evan; Nijhawan, Navdeep",Orbit,https://doi.org/10.1080/01676830.2020.1781200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552229/,386

Overnight oximetry has been validated for predicting sleep apnea in surgical and sleep clinic patients. The objective of the study was to assess the predictive accuracy of oxygen desaturation index (ODI 4%) from home overnight oximetry when compared to apnea hypopnea index (AHI) from polysomnography for predicting sleep apnea in patients taking opioids for chronic pain. METHODS This was a planned post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study conducted at 5 pain clinics. Patient characteristics and daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dose were recorded. All consented patients underwent home overnight oximetry (PULSOX-300i, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc, Osaka, Japan) and in-laboratory polysomnography. The predictive performance of ODI 4% from oximetry was assessed against AHI from polysomnography. RESULTS Among 332 consented patients, 181 with polysomnography and overnight oximetry data were analyzed. The mean age and body mass index of 181 patients were 52 ± 13 years and 29 ± 6 kg/m2, respectively, with 40% men. The area under the receiver operating curve for ODI to predict moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (AHI ≥15 events/h) and severe sleep apnea (AHI ≥30 events/h) was 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.88) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.94). ODI ≥5 events/h had a sensitivity of 85% (95% CI, 74-92) and specificity of 57% (95% CI, 52-61) to predict moderate-to-severe sleep apnea. ODI ≥15 events/h had a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI, 55-83) and specificity of 88% (95% CI, 84-91) to predict severe sleep apnea. CONCLUSIONS Overnight home oximetry has a high predictive performance in predicting moderate-to-severe and severe sleep apnea in patients on opioids for chronic pain. It is a useful additional tool for health care providers for the screening of sleep apnea in this high-risk group.","Waseem, Rida; Wong, Jean; Ryan, Clodagh; Chung, Frances",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33950884/,386

We therefore aimed to illustrate the concept of internal coherence in nutrition and dietetics research, and its importance beyond individual elements of study quality. METHOD A targeted literature search in Nutrition and Dietetics was used to identify research illustrating one example of three main approaches to research (scientific, interpretive and critical inquiry) published between November 2017 and November 2020. Studies were included if they related to education research based on the expertise of the authors, and illustrated diverse points about internal coherence. The authors independently critiqued included studies for internal coherence and synthesised their findings. RESULTS From 76 manuscripts, 14 were identified as describing education research. Of the three selected studies that were critiqued, all had elements of internal coherence, in particular alignment between epistemology and methodology. However, each had elements of misalignment too, specifically between epistemology, axiology and method. The results point to the profession's historical groundings privileging the scientific approach, showing how this can yield misalignments, particularly when describing the limitations of interpretive and critical inquiry approaches. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates the importance of internal coherence as a marker of quality, over and above existing quality assessment checklists for qualitative and quantitative methodologies. As such, it can help authors, reviewers and editors to improve the quality of nutrition and dietetics research and its reporting.","Palermo, Claire; Reidlinger, Dianne P; Rees, Charlotte E",Nutrition & dietetics: the journal of the Dietitians Association of Australia,https://doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.12680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151511/,386

The majority of these infections are due to viruses. This study attempted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients with respiratory infection by the coronavirus OC43, NL63 and 229E. Patients and methods Between January 2013 and February 2014, we prospectively studied all patients with suspected clinical respiratory infection by taking throat swabs and performing a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in search of coronavirus. Results In 48 cases (7.0% of the 686 enrolled patients; 12.6% of the 381 in whom a virus was detected) the presence of a coronavirus demonstrated. In 24 cases, the virus was OC43 (50%); in 14 cases, the virus was NL63 (29%); and in 10 cases, the virus was 229E (21%). The mean age was 54.5 years, with a slight predominance of men. The most common clinical presentations were nonspecific influenza symptoms (43.7%), pneumonia (29.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (8.3%). Fifty-two percent of the patients required hospitalization, and 2 patients required intensive care. There were no deaths. Conclusion Acute respiratory infections caused by coronavirus mainly affect middle-aged male smokers, who are often affected by previous diseases.

EPID images used in this study were acquired using all available beams from a linac configured to deliver electron beams with nominal energies of 6, 9, 12, 16 and 20 MeV, as well as photon beams with nominal energies of 6 and 10 MV. A widely-available heterogeneous, approximately-humanoid, thorax phantom was used, to provide an indication of the contrast and noise produced when imaging different types of tissue with comparatively realistic thicknesses. The acquired images were automatically calibrated, corrected for the effects of variations in the sensitivity of individual photodiodes, using a flood field image. For electron beam imaging, flood field EPID calibration images were acquired with and without the placement of blocks of water-equivalent plastic (with thicknesses approximately equal to the practical range of electrons in the plastic) placed upstream of the EPID, to filter out the primary electron beam, leaving only the bremsstrahlung photon signal. While the electron beam images acquired using a standard (unfiltered) flood field calibration were observed to be noisy and difficult to interpret, the electron beam images acquired using the filtered flood field calibration showed tissues and bony anatomy with levels of contrast and noise that were similar to the contrast and noise levels seen in the clinically acceptable photon beam EPID images. The best electron beam imaging results (highest contrast, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios) were achieved when the images were acquired using the higher energy electron beams (16 and 20 MeV) when the EPID was calibrated using an intermediate (12 MeV) electron beam energy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring clinically-useful EPID images of patient anatomy using electron beams and suggest important avenues for future investigation, thus enabling and encouraging further research in this area. There is manifest potential for the EPID imaging method proposed in this work to lead to the clinical use of electron beam imaging for geometric verification of electron treatments in the future.","Kairn, T; Aland, T; Crowe, S B; Trapp, J V",Australasian physical & engineering sciences in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13246-015-0401-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581763/,386

73392,Generation and validation of in-hospital mortality prediction score in COVID-19 patients: Alba-score.,2021-02-16,"PURPOSE Spindle and kinetochore‑associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3) has recently been identified as a novel regulator of carcinogenesis in multiple types of cancers. However, the function and potential regulatory mechanisms of SKA3 in breast cancer remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to gain a detailed relevance of SKA3 in breast cancer. METHODS Expression of SKA3 in breast cancer was examined via real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis. Malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells were investigated via cell counting kit-8, cell apoptosis, and transwell invasion assays. The activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was monitored via luciferase reporter assay. The tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells in vivo was assessed via xenograft tumor assay. RESULTS SKA3 expression was elevated in breast cancer tissue and was correlated with shorter survival rates in breast cancer patients. Knockdown of SKA3 caused marked reductions in cellular proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells, whereas SKA3 overexpression accelerated proliferation and invasion. Knockdown of SKA3 resulted in decreased Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, and decreased expression of active β-catenin, which lead to the inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Akt significantly reversed the SKA3 overexpression-induced activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling markedly abrogated SKA3 overexpression-induced tumor-promotion effects, while re-activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling significantly reversed SKA3 knockdown-mediated tumor-inhibition effects. Knockdown of SKA3 resulted in a significant decrease in breast cancer tumor formation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS SKA3 accelerates proliferation and invasion in breast cancer through the modulation of Akt/Wnt/β-catenin signaling.","Zhang, Jian; Liu, Yang; Pu, Shengyu; He, Jianjun; Zhou, Can",Breast cancer research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-020-06078-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423159/,386
73755,The Role of Imaging in the Management of Suspected or Known COVID-19 Pneumonia. A Multidisciplinary Perspective.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Vascular calcification (VC) is characterized by mineral accumulation on the walls of arteries and veins, which is a pathological process commonly found in elderly individuals and patients with atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in VC. However, the role of SNHG29 is less clear. METHODS The expression of SNHG29, miR-200b-3p, α-Klotho, FGFR1 and FGF23 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was quantified by qRT-PCR and western blot assays. β-GP was used to construct an in vitro calcification model, followed by MTT assay to detect cell viability. Calcification was determined by alizarin red S staining and quantified by calcification assay. ALP activity was investigated by ALP staining. The interactions among SNHG29, miR-200b-3p and α-Klotho were verified by luciferase assay. RESULTS In the in vitro calcification model, SNHG29 was downregulated, while miR-200b-3p was upregulated. SNHG29 overexpression and miR-200b-3p knockdown significantly suppressed osteoblast-related factors (RUNX2 and BMP2), accompanied by activation of the α-Klotho/FGFR1/FGF23 axis, further inhibiting the formation of calcified nodules. Moreover, miR-200b-3p overexpression and α-Klotho knockdown reversed the SNHG29 overexpression-induced inhibitory effects on calcified VSMCs. CONCLUSION Our study is the first to demonstrate that SNHG29 could inhibit VSMC calcification by downregulating miR-200b-3p to activate the α-Klotho/FGFR1/FGF23 axis, suggesting SNHG29 as a novel therapeutic target for VC-associated diseases.","Huang, Chong; Zhan, Jin-Feng; Chen, Yan-Xia; Xu, Cheng-Yun; Chen, Yan",Cytokine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818704/,386

To determine the effect of reduced ejection fraction and demographic characteristics on the occurrence of cognitive impairment and depression after myocardial infarction. In the prospective study, the final sample consisted of 82 patients. Based on the value of the ejection fraction, the patients were divided into those with a value of < 40% and those having a value of ≥ 40%. Demographic data (age, gender, education), and data on comorbidities, were collected from the patients' medical history. The instruments of studies were: Mini-mental test and Beck depression inventory. The occurrence of cognitive impairment and depression was not, to a significant degree, associated with the level of ejection fraction. In contrast, demographics have shown positive predictive effects. Among demographic characteristics, the age of the patient proved to be a significant predictor for the occurrence of cognitive impairment (p = 0.004). The probability of cognitive impairment increases 1.16 times for each year of life. Significant depression predictor was female gender (p = 0.014). The probability of depression was 3.5 times greater for female gender.

Results There was no statistical difference in terms of operating time and intraoperative bleeding between the two groups (p = 0.16 and p = 0.6). The conversion rate was 8% (2 out of 25 cases) in group A and 23.8% (5 out of 21 cases) in group B (p = 0.002). Evaluation of vascular injury showed no difference in the conversion rate (p = 0.56). The median length of the drainage and of hospital stay were 4 days and 7 days in group A and 4 days and 8 days in group B, respectively (p = 0.36 and p = 0.24). The complication rate was 44% in group A and 47.6% in group B (p = 0.52). A.B. had performed 139 and L.O. 70 operations as first operator before starting their VATS lobectomy training; the surgical experience had an impact only on the conversion rate. Conclusion Our study showed that a training program in VATS lobectomy is feasible, and previous surgical training has a minimal impact on intraoperative and postoperative outcomes.","Billè, Andrea; Okiror, Lawrence; Harrison-Phipps, Karen; Routledge, Tom",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1396094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25463356/,386

We discuss the overall prevalence of HPV infection as detected in normal cytological samples stratified by age, different types of infection, and oncogenic capacity. One of the most important findings was that common HPV genotypes detected in healthy women were the genotype numbers: 6, 31, 16, and 56, likewise, smoking and having a history of more than three sexual partners over their lifetime, represented the main risk factors in this study. Furthermore, we found a low frequency of cytological abnormalities and CIN 1-3 in women with HR-HPV.","Hernández-Rosas, Fabiola; Orozco-Hernández, Erika; Maza-Sánchez, Liliana; Salgado-García, Pamela Citlalli; Navarro-Vidal, Enrique; León-Bautista, Mercedes Piedad de",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220959747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962407/,386

This study evaluated predictive factors for favorable treatment outcome in patients with intracranial noncavernous DAVFs treated by transarterial Onyx embolization. METHODS Between August 2008 and August 2014, 55 patients who underwent transarterial Onyx embolization for noncavernous DAVFs were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' demographic, clinical, and procedural data were analyzed to find statistically significant predictive factors for favorable treatment outcomes after Onyx embolization. Fistulas were classified angiographically according to the relationship between fistulas and dural venous sinuses and the presence of leptomeningeal venous reflux. RESULTS Sixty-eight Onyx embolizations were performed in 55 patients. Immediate angiographic cure was achieved in 28 patients, and 14 of 27 patients with residual shunts showed progressive occlusion at follow-up imaging studies. Therefore, the overall favorable treatment outcome was 76.4% (42/55). The remaining 13 patients (23.6%) showed persistent residual shunts, and 3 (5.5%) of them showed aggravation of residual lesion on follow-up studies. Of 25 patients with non-sinus fistulas, 23 patients (92%) showed favorable treatment outcomes, and 19 of 30 patients (63.3%) with sinus fistulas showed favorable outcomes. Among the evaluated variables, non-sinus DAVFs was a statistically significant predictive factor for favorable response to transarterial Onyx embolization (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Transarterial Onyx embolization is a highly effective treatment method for non-sinus DAVFs. Careful consideration of angiographic features and multimodal embolization strategies are required for treatment of sinus DAVFs.","Kim, Byungjun; Jeon, Pyoung; Kim, Keonha; Kim, Sungtae; Kim, Hyungjin; Byun, Hong Sik; Jo, Kyung-Il",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2015.10.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26548817/,386

Such an environment would be expected to affect behavioral change in animals housed therein. However, few studies have specifically addressed the nature or magnitude of this change. The current study sought to characterize the behavioral time budget of rats in metabolic cage housing in comparison to that of individually housed animals in standard open-top cages. Rats in metabolic cages spent less time moving, manipulating enrichment, and carrying out rearing behaviors, and there was a corresponding shift toward inactivity. In an applied Social Interaction Test, behavioral scoring implied that metabolic cage housing had an anxiogenic effect. In conclusion, metabolic cage housing produces measurable effects on spontaneous and evoked behavior in rats in the laboratory. These behavioral changes may lead to a negative emotional state in these animals, which could have negative welfare consequences. Further research is needed to quantify the existence and magnitude of such an effect on rat well being.","Whittaker, Alexandra L; Lymn, Kerry A; Howarth, Gordon S",Journal of applied animal welfare science : JAAWS,https://doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2016.1164048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27057787/,386
78587,Minimally invasive adrenal surgery: an update.,2011,"During the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), immune response and inflammation reactions are dynamic events that develop rapidly and are associated with the severity of disease. Here, we aimed to develop a predictive model based on the immune and inflammatory response to discriminate patients with severe COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and their demographic and immune inflammatory reaction indicators were collected and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors, which were further used to construct a predictive model. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve, and optimal diagnostic threshold was calculated; these were further validated by 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. We screened three key indicators, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and IgA, for predicting severe COVID-19 and obtained a combined neutrophil, eosinophil, and IgA ratio (NEAR) model (NEU [109/liter] - 150×EOS [109/liter] + 3×IgA [g/liter]). NEAR achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.961, and when a threshold of 9 was applied, the sensitivity and specificity of the predicting model were 100% and 88.89%, respectively. Thus, NEAR is an effective index for predicting the severity of COVID-19 and can be used as a powerful tool for clinicians to make better clinical decisions. IMPORTANCE The immune inflammatory response changes rapidly with the progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and is responsible for clearance of the virus and further recovery from the infection. However, the intensified immune and inflammatory response in the development of the disease may lead to more serious and fatal consequences, which indicates that immune indicators have the potential to predict serious cases. Here, we identified both eosinophils and serum IgA as prognostic markers of COVID-19, which sheds light on new research directions and is worthy of further research in the scientific research field as well as clinical application. In this study, the combination of NEU count, EOS count, and IgA level was included in a new predictive model of the severity of COVID-19, which can be used as a powerful tool for better clinical decision-making.","Sun, Caiyu; Xue, Mingshan; Yang, Min; Zhu, Lihui; Zhao, Yunxue; Lv, Xiaoting; Lin, Yueke; Ma, Dapeng; Shen, Xuecheng; Cheng, Yeping; Xuan, Haocheng; Jia, Xiaoqing; Li, Tao; Han, Lihui",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00752-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643417/,386

The treatment of choice in the majority of cases is laparoscopic appendectomy. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a concern for a delayed referral of patients and thus a more advanced presentation of the disease leading to a prolonged and complicated course. METHODS Retrospective review of a computerized database of patients who were admitted with acute appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy during the COVID pandemic in a single tertiary center in Israel. Patients were compared with those who were admitted and operated for appendicitis in the same period in the previous year. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy in the study period in 2020, compared with 109 who had surgery in 2019. During the COVID pandemic 41 patients presented with complicated appendicitis versus 22 patients in 2019 (P=0.0174). The placement of peritoneal drains was more prevalent during the pandemic, 5.5% versus 11.4%, and the use of stapler device for appendicular stump closure (P=0.0105). CONCLUSIONS During the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the rate of complicated appendicitis.

MIE's limitation is embedded in the construction of intrathoracic anastomosis. Various anastomotic techniques have been reported; however, the mechanical one remains the most commonly adopted. This pilot study aims to describe an efficient, safe, and reproducible way of performing a hand-sewn intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis in conjunction with short-term results using 2D and 3D thoracoscopic approaches. METHODS A total of n = 13 patients (mean age 67.4) underwent MIE for distal esophageal or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma between January and September 2016. Resection was performed in prone position, and the esophagogastric anastomosis was constructed in an end-to-side manner in two layers with barbed knotless suture. A 2D thoracoscopic approach was used in n = 10 patients (77%) and a 3D approach in n = 3 (23%). RESULTS n = 8 patients (61.5%) had neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and n = 5 (38.5%) had primary surgery. The mean operating time was 420 min, and the average length of stay was 10 days with no associated mortality. n = 1 (7.7%) developed a radiological leak that did not require an intervention. Thoracoscopic approach with the glasses-based 3D optical system using the angulating-tip 100° camera provided a far superior view for precise lymphadenectomy in combination to an efficient and safe construction of the anastomosis. CONCLUSION The barbed knotless suturing technique in MIE is an efficient and safe method of constructing the esophagogastric anastomosis with promising short-term outcomes. A 3D thoracoscopic approach appears to be superior in performing the anastomosis to that of a 2D technique.","Charalabopoulos, Alexandros; Lorenzi, Bruno; Kordzadeh, Ali; Tang, Cheuk-Bong; Kadirkamanathan, Sritharan; Jayanthi, Naga Venkatesh",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-017-1570-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28251360/,386

The catenin beta interacting protein 1 (CTNNBIP1) is an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whose role in osteogenesis remains elusive. This study aimed to reveal the effects of miR-486-3p/CTNNBIP1 in osteogenesis. METHODS Bone marrow samples from healthy individuals and osteoporosis patients and mice with sham or ovariectomy (OVX) surgeries were collected. Levels of CTNNBIP1 and miR-486-3p were assessed. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interactions between CTNNBIP1 and miR-486-3p. MiR-486-3p mimics/inhibitor or CTNNBIP1 overexpression lentiviruses were transfected to human BMSCs (hBMSCs) and an osteogenic assay was performed. Alizarin red S (ARS) and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) intensity and expression of osteogenic genes Runx2, Alp, Cola1 and Bglap were measured. Key proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway including active β-catenin, Bcl-2, and Cyclin D1 were assessed. RESULTS CTNNBIP1 was upregulated while miR-486-3p was downregulated in osteoporosis patients and OVX mice. CTNNBIP1 was confirmed as a target of miR-486-3p. MiR-486-3p overexpression promoted, while miR-486-3p knockdown suppressed, osteogenic differentiation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Rescue experiments confirmed the negative effects of CTNNBIP1 overexpression on osteoblastic differentiation and that miR-486-3p mimics could reverse canonical Wnt signaling. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that miR-486-3p targets CTNNBIP1, thus activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote osteogenesis of BMSCs.","Zhang, Zheng; Jiang, Weiwei; Hu, Miao; Gao, Rui; Zhou, Xuhui",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.05.098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118593/,386

METHODS From April through December 2009, we obtained 12,217 serum specimens from blood donors (aged 16-59 years), 2520 specimens from hospital outpatients (aged 5-59 years), and 917 specimens from subjects involved in a community pediatric cohort study (aged 5-14 years). We estimated infection attack rates by comparing the proportions of specimens with antibody titers ≥ 1:40 by viral microneutralization before and after the first wave of the pandemic. Estimates were validated using paired serum samples from 324 individuals that spanned the first wave. Combining these estimates with epidemiologic surveillance data, we calculated the proportion of infections that led to hospitalization, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and death. RESULTS We found that 3.3% and 14% of persons aged 5-59 years had antibody titers ≥ 1:40 before and after the first wave, respectively. The overall attack rate was 10.7%, with age stratification as follows: 43.4% in persons aged 5-14 years, 15.8% in persons aged 15-19 years, 11.8% in persons aged 20-29 years, and 4%-4.6% in persons aged 30-59 years. Case-hospitalization rates were 0.47%-0.87% among persons aged 5-59 years. Case-ICU rates were 7.9 cases per 100,000 infections in persons aged 5-14 years and 75 cases per 100,000 infections in persons aged 50-59 years, respectively. Case-fatality rates were 0.4 cases per 100,000 infections in persons aged 5-14 years and 26.5 cases per 100,000 infections in persons aged 50-59 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Almost half of all school-aged children in Hong Kong were infected during the first wave.

Objective To identify which clinical characteristics are related to COVID-19 severity and to determine whether age acts a modifier of the relationship between cardio-metabolic comorbidities (CMC) and COVID-19 progression. Method Data on ≥ 20-year-old confirmed cases (n = 159,017) were analyzed. Hospitalization, development of pneumonia, intubation requirement, intensive care unit admission and death were the dependent variables in Poisson regression models estimation, whereas the interaction between age and different CMCs were the independent variables. Results Having CMCs, as well as other comorbidities, was directly related to COVID-19 progression, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was only related to an increase in the risk of dying. The risk for COVID-19 severity was lower as age was more advanced. Asthma and smoking were not risk factors for the progression of COVID-19.

Additionally, thermal stability of polymer powders was examined and their glass transition temperature was determined. Optical properties (extinction coefficient and refractive index) were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) combined with absorbance measurements. Photoresponsive behavior was investigated by determination of photoisomerization rates under irradiation with unpolarized 365 nm light, as well as by conduction of holographic grating inscription experiment. Thin film quality was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Thermal analysis was performed by thermogravimetric (TG), derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. We found that optical properties as well as photoisomerization rates of investigated polymers are dependent on the substituent in the para position of the phenyl ring. Surface relief grating inscription was successfully generated only for materials with chromophores containing dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) and methyl (CH3) substituents, but all materials exhibited birefringence grating in the bulk. Surface of most thin films was very smooth, but its quality was impaired by neutral (H) as well as carboxyl (COOH) substituent.

This retrospective single center cohort study evaluated the outcomes of SOT recipients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who received bamlanivimab monotherapy. Eighteen SOT recipients (15 kidney, 2 liver, and 1 heart) received the medication between November 9, 2020 and February 10, 2021 with no reported infusion reactions. One patient experienced headache and fatigue following the infusion that resolved within 3 days. Fourteen patients continued their recovery as an outpatient with no further escalation in care. Three patients required hospitalization: two for suspected bacterial pneumonia 9 and 32 days post-infusion respectively, and one for acute kidney injury 7 days post-infusion. One patient had an emergency room visit for gastrointestinal symptoms 24 days post-infusion. In this small cohort of SOT recipients, bamlanivimab monotherapy appeared to be a well-tolerated option for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19, but it was not completely effective in preventing hospitalization. One month following the end of this cohort, COVID-19 treatment guidance changed due to the rising prevalence of resistant variants. For this reason, bamlanivimab is now recommended to be used only in combination with etesevimab. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of this therapy in SOT recipients.","Kutzler, Heather L; Kuzaro, Hillary A; Serrano, Oscar K; Feingold, Andrew; Morgan, Glyn; Cheema, Faiqa",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081820/,386

The Obstetrics and Neonatology disciplines needed to be revised to suit the institutional need to expand intensive care beds to care for confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19 in the state of São Paulo, following the recommendations of the Institutional Crisis Committee. Three different actions were needed: the structuring of teams and advanced medical post to attend COVID-19-free patients and those with suspect or confirmed COVID-19; elaborating the protocols from the delivery room throughout hospitalization. Some special considerations about breastfeeding and rooming-in were needed. The third action was the drafting of a protocol to admit infants from other hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 as the unit never admitted outpatients before.","Carvalho, Werther Brunow de; Gibelli, Maria Augusta Bento Cicaroni; Krebs, Vera Lucia Jornada; Tragante, Carla Regina; Perondi, Maria Beatriz Moliterno",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.7.894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844944/,386

METHODS A cross-sectional study was performed using prospectively collected data. Survivors completed questionnaires assessing quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and symptoms (Distress Thermometer, Patient's Disease and Treatment Assessment Form)). Survivors were assessed by a clinical psychologist for the presence of fear of cancer recurrence. Clinical and quality of life variables were evaluated for associations with fear of cancer recurrence. RESULTS Overall, 315 survivors (181 breast cancer, 134 colorectal cancer) were included. In total, 201 survivors (64%) had fear of cancer recurrence according to psychology assessment, and of the 118 that had fear of cancer recurrence severity recorded, 64 (54%) were rated as moderate-severe. On univariate analysis, fear of cancer recurrence was associated with younger age (P < 0.001), higher distress thermometer score (P = 0.001) and poorer overall wellbeing (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, younger age (P = 0.043), being bothered by side effects of treatment (P = 0.023), feeling sad (P = 0.020) and greater worry that their condition will get worse (P = 0.017) were independently associated with fear of cancer recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Fear of cancer recurrence is common in breast and colorectal cancer survivors, and moderate-severe in over half. Fear of cancer recurrence was independently associated with younger age, feeling sad, being more bothered by side effects.","Nahm, Sharon H; Blinman, Prunella; Butler, Sue; Tan, S Y Cindy; Vardy, Janette",Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.13434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079491/,386

90611,"Presenting characteristics, smoking versus diabetes and outcome among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.",2020-09-04,"Accurate assembly of viral particles in the potyvirus Plum pox virus (PPV) has been shown to depend on the contribution of the multifunctional viral protein HCPro. In this study, we show that other viral factors, in addition to the capsid protein (CP) and HCPro, are necessary for the formation of stable PPV virions. The CP produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves from a subviral RNA termed LONG, which expresses a truncated polyprotein that lacks P1 and HCPro, together with HCPro supplied in trans, was assembled into virus-like particles and remained stable after in vitro incubation. In contrast, deletions in multiple regions of the LONG coding sequence prevented the CP stabilization mediated by HCPro. In particular, we demonstrated that the first 178 amino acids of P3, but not a specific nucleotide sequence coding for them, are required for CP stability and proper assembly of PPV particles. Using a sequential coagroinfiltration assay, we observed that the subviral LONG RNA replicates and locally spreads in N. benthamiana leaves expressing an RNA silencing suppressor. The analysis of the effect of both point and deletion mutations affecting RNA replication in LONG and full-length PPV demonstrated that this process is essential for the assembly of stable viral particles. Interestingly, in spite of this requirement, the CP produced by a nonreplicating viral RNA can be stably assembled into virions as long as it is coexpressed with a replication-proficient RNA. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of coupling encapsidation to other viral processes to secure a successful infection.IMPORTANCE Viruses of the family Potyviridae are among the most dangerous threats for basically every important crop, and such socioeconomical relevance has made them a subject of many research studies. In spite of this, very little is currently known about proteins and processes controlling viral genome encapsidation by the coat protein. In the case of Plum pox virus (genus Potyvirus), for instance, we have previously shown that the multitasking viral factor HCPro plays a role in the production of stable virions. Here, by using this potyvirus as a model, we move further to show that additional factors are also necessary for the efficient production of potyviral particles. More importantly, a comprehensive screening for such factors led us to the identification of a functional link between virus replication and packaging, unraveling a previously unknown connection of these two key events of the potyviral infection cycle.","Gallo, Araiz; Valli, Adrian; Calvo, María; García, Juan Antonio",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02179-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29444942/,386

Improved technologies for the diagnosis of infectious diseases suggest possible changes to paradigms used in the screening of organ donors to prevent disease transmission with transplantation. Available microbiologic assays, including molecular tests, are generally designed for use as diagnostic tools in individuals believed to have a specific infection based on clinical or epidemiological criteria. By contrast, these assays often lack the performance characteristics required for screening of deceased organ donors. This challenge is apparent with the analysis of assays for human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I and -II in low-risk populations. Changing epidemiologic patterns associated with the spread of novel pathogens or altered patterns of immigration will necessitate flexibility in the ""list"" of potential pathogens. Individual benefits from transplantation generally outweigh the risk of transmission of infection.

92069,Is there any effect of smoking status on severity and mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia?,2020-12-01,"Large amounts of research efforts have been focused on learning gene regulatory networks (GRNs) based on gene expression data to understand the functional basis of a living organism. Under the assumption that the joint distribution of the gene expressions of interest is a multivariate normal distribution, such networks can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance matrix, the so-called precision matrix or concentration matrix. This may not reflect the true connectivity between genes by considering just pairwise linear correlations. To relax this limitative constraint, we employ Gaussian process (GP) model which is well known as computationally efficient non-parametric Bayesian machine learning technique. GPs are among a class of methods known as kernel machines which can be used to approximate complex problems by tuning their hyperparameters. In fact, GP creates the ability to use the capacity and potential of different kernels in constructing precision matrix and GRNs. In this paper, in the first step, we choose the GP with appropriate kernel to learn the considered GRNs from the observed genetic data, and then we estimate kernel hyperparameters using rule-of-thumb technique. Using these hyperparameters, we can also control the degree of sparseness in the precision matrix. Then we obtain kernel-based precision matrix similar to GLASSO to construct kernel-based GRN. The findings of our research are used to construct GRNs with high performance, for different species of Drosophila fly rather than simply using the assumption of multivariate normal distribution, and the GPs, despite the use of the kernels capacity, have a much better performance than the multivariate Gaussian distribution assumption.","Chatrabgoun, H; Soltanian, A R; Mahjub, H; Bahreini, F",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0219720021500074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33930997/,386

We evaluated the relationship between CD117(+) cells and mast cells in the left ventricle of human hearts (n=5 patients, ages 1 week-75 years) with the well-established mast cell markers tryptase, toluidine blue, and thionine. A large number (85-100%) of CD117(+) cells in the human heart were specifically identified as mast cells. In addition, mast cells showed weak or moderate CD45 immunostaining signals. These results indicate that the majority of CD117(+) cells in the heart are mast cells and that these cells are distinctly positive for CD45, although staining was weak or moderate.

This was completed for simulated procedures with validated models, across four grades of junior doctors. RESULTS A total of 1120 judgements on the trainees' intended level of involvement were made. The median involvement score was higher in the simulation group versus the non-simulation group (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.0001), corresponding to a translation in surgical opportunity from a primarily assisting role to an active role.

Furthermore, initial response assessment by conventional imaging is often unable to identify which patients will achieve durable clinical benefit (DCB). Here, we demonstrate that pre-treatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral CD8 T cell levels are independently associated with DCB. We further show that ctDNA dynamics after a single infusion can aid in identification of patients who will achieve DCB. Integrating these determinants, we developed and validated an entirely noninvasive multiparameter assay (DIREct-On, Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-On-treatment) that robustly predicts which patients will achieve DCB with higher accuracy than any individual feature. Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrated ctDNA and circulating immune cell profiling can provide accurate, noninvasive, and early forecasting of ultimate outcomes for NSCLC patients receiving ICIs.","Nabet, Barzin Y; Esfahani, Mohammad S; Moding, Everett J; Hamilton, Emily G; Chabon, Jacob J; Rizvi, Hira; Steen, Chloe B; Chaudhuri, Aadel A; Liu, Chih Long; Hui, Angela B; Almanza, Diego; Stehr, Henning; Gojenola, Linda; Bonilla, Rene F; Jin, Michael C; Jeon, Young-Jun; Tseng, Diane; Liu, Cailian; Merghoub, Taha; Neal, Joel W; Wakelee, Heather A; Padda, Sukhmani K; Ramchandran, Kavitha J; Das, Millie; Plodkowski, Andrew J; Yoo, Christopher; Chen, Emily L; Ko, Ryan B; Newman, Aaron M; Hellmann, Matthew D; Alizadeh, Ash A; Diehn, Maximilian",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007267/,386

98335,Pharmacological Treatment of Methamphetamine/Amphetamine Dependence: A Systematic Review.,2020-03-17,"Acute traumatic coagulopathy is a complex phenomenon following injury and a main contributor to hemorrhage. It remains a leading cause of preventable death in trauma patients. This phenomenon is initiated by systemic injury to the vascular endothelium that is exacerbated by hypoperfusion, acidosis, and hypothermia and leads to systemic activation of the coagulation cascades and resultant coagulopathy. Many previous studies have focused on endotheliopathy with targeted markers such as syndecan-1, soluble thrombomodulin, and plasma adrenaline as potential culprits for initiation and propagation of this state. However, in more recent studies, hyperadhesive von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is released following endothelial injury, and its cleaving metalloprotease ADAMTS13 have emerged as significant targets of the downstream effect of endothelial breakdown and coagulation dysregulation. Elucidation of the mechanism by which the dysregulated VWF-ADAMTS13 axis leads to endothelial dysfunction and coagulopathy after trauma can help identify new targets for therapy and sites for intervention. Much of what is known mechanistically regarding VWF stems from work done in traumatic brain injury. Following localized brain injury, brain-derived extracellular vesicles are released into circulation where they induce a hypercoagulable state that rapidly turns into consumptive coagulopathy. VWF released from injured endothelial cells binds to these extracellular vesicles to enhance their activity in promoting coagulopathy and increasing endothelial permeability. However, there are numerous gaps in our knowledge of VWF following injury, providing a platform for further investigation.","Zeineddin, Ahmad; Dong, Jing-Fei; Wu, Feng; Terse, Pranaya; Kozar, Rosemary A",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33156241/,386

In contrast to other respiratory viral infections, young children seem to be less severely affected. It is now clear that mild to severe acute infection is not the only outcome of COVID-19, and long-lasting symptoms are also possible. In contrast to severe acute COVID-19, such 'long COVID' is seemingly more likely in women than in men.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted on patients who had received thermal ablation for recurrent NSCLC post-curative radiotherapy. Medical records and follow-up imaging with computed tomography (CT) and PET-CT were analysed to determine time to local progression (TTLP) and overall survival (OS). TTLP was determined according to the modified RECIST criteria. RESULTS Twelve patients, mean age 71 ± 7 years, received 17 thermal ablation sessions, with RFA performed for four lesions and MWA for 13. Nine tumours were squamous cell cancers (SCC) and eight were adenocarcinomas. Eleven tumours had recurred post-external beam radiation and one post-stereotactic body radiation therapy. Mean tumour size was 34.2 ± 12.8 mm, tumour stages prior to radiotherapy were Ia (2), Ib (3), IIa (4), IIb (1) and III (2). Follow-up period was 19 ± 11 months. Overall median TTLP was 14 months (95% CI: 8, 19), and median OS was 35 months (95% CI: 12, 58). Mean TTLP for tumours <30 mm was 23 months and for tumours >30 mm 14 months (p = 0.20). Recurrence rates reduced from 50% after initial ablation to 20% with a second ablation. Complication rate for pneumothorax requiring intervention was 17%.

Single and clusters of clinical determinants have been identified as presurgery predictors of postsurgery diabetes remission. Our goal was to assess whether the addition of measured preoperative β-cell function would improve established clinical models of prediction of diabetes remission. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Presurgery clinical characteristics, metabolic markers, and β-cell function after oral and intravenous (IV) glucose challenges were assessed in 73 individuals with severe obesity and type 2 diabetes and again 1 year after gastric bypass surgery. Single and multivariate analyses were conducted with preoperative variables to determine the best predictive models of remission. RESULTS Presurgery β-cell glucose sensitivity, a surrogate of β-cell function, was negatively correlated with known diabetes duration, HbA1c, insulin use, and the diabetes remission scores DiaRem and advanced (Ad)-DiaRem (all P < 0.001). Measured β-cell function after oral glucose was 1.6-fold greater than after the IV glucose challenge and more strongly correlated with preoperative clinical and metabolic characteristics. The addition of preoperative β-cell function to clinical models containing well-defined diabetes remission scores did not improve the model's ability to predict diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

RECENT FINDINGS Robotic and radical prostatectomy has similar outcomes with significant initial worsening of urinary continence and sexual function. External beam radiation has less impact on continence and sexual function but noteworthy bowel toxicity. Brachytherapy results in the most irritative urinary symptoms, with decreased sexual and bowel QoL as well. Cryotherapy greatly reduces sexual function. SUMMARY Every patient has unique pretreatment variables, priorities, and preferences. It is crucial to fully explain the range of oncologic and QoL implications when counseling patients regarding treatment for localized prostate cancer.","Parker, Walter R; Montgomery, Jeffery S; Wood, David P",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0b013e328329eb00; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19300266/,386
105555,Strategies to Prevent Readmissions to Hospital for COPD: A Systematic Review.,2021-08-11,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in 2019 resulted in a pandemic not seen for a century, and there is an urgent need to develop safe and efficacious vaccines. The scientific community has made tremendous efforts to understand the disease, and unparalleled efforts are ongoing to develop vaccines and treatments. Toxicologists and pathologists are involved in these efforts to test the efficacy and safety of vaccine candidates. Presently, there are several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in clinical trials, and the pace of vaccine development has been highly accelerated to meet the urgent need. By 2021, efficacy and safety data from clinical trials are expected, and potentially a vaccine will be available for those most at risk. This review focuses on the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts with emphasis on the nonclinical safety assessment and discusses emerging preliminary data from nonclinical and clinical studies. It also provides a brief overview on vaccines for other coronaviruses, since experience gained from these can be useful in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This review will also explain why, despite this unprecedented pace of vaccine development, rigorous standards are in place to ensure nonclinical and clinical safety and efficacy.","Bennet, Bindu M; Wolf, Jayanthi; Laureano, Rodrigo; Sellers, Rani S",Toxicologic pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0192623320959090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32926660/,386

107001,Environmental safety: Air pollution while using MIRUS™ for short-term sedation in the ICU.,2019,"INTRODUCTION We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of melatonin administered by alternative routes of administration. METHODS This study employed a cross-over design in healthy female volunteers. Twenty-five milligrams of melatonin was administered intravenously, intravesically, rectally, transdermally, and vaginally. Blood samples were collected at specified time points up to 24 h following intravenous, intravesical, rectal, and vaginal administration, and up to 48 h following transdermal administration. Plasma melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Sedation was evaluated by a simple reaction-time test, and sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Adverse events were registered for each route of administration. RESULTS Ten participants were included. We documented a mean (SD) time to maximal concentration of 51 (29) min for intravesical, 24 (20) min for rectal, 21 (8) h for transdermal, and 147 (56) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) elimination half-life was 47 (6) min for intravenous, 58 (7) min for intravesical, 60 (18) min for rectal, 14.6 (11.1) h for transdermal, and 129 (17) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) bioavailability was 3.6 (1.9)% for intravesical, 36.0 (28.6)% for rectal, 10.0 (5.7)% for transdermal, and 97.8 (31.7)% for vaginal administration. No significant changes in reaction times were observed following administration of melatonin by any of the administration routes. Increased tiredness was documented following transdermal administration only. No serious adverse effects were documented. CONCLUSION Rectally and vaginally administered melatonin may serve as relevant alternatives to standard oral melatonin therapy. Transdermal delivery of melatonin displayed an extended absorption and can be applied if prolonged effects are intended. Intravesical administration displayed, as expected, a very limited bioavailability. Melatonin administered by these routes of administration was safe.","Zetner, Dennis; Andersen, Lars Peter Kloster; Alder, Rasmus; Jessen, Majken Lyhne; Tolstrup, Anders; Rosenberg, Jacob",Pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937627/,386

The success of Mohs relies on accurate histopathologic evaluation. Due to law restrictions in some European countries Mohs surgeons are not permitted to report on histopathology, therefore a pathologist evaluates the frozen sections. OBJECTIVE To retrospectively assess the concordance between the certified Mohs surgeon and the pathologist in evaluating the Mohs slides that were intraoperatively evaluated by the pathologist. MATERIALS AND METHODS Frozen section slides of a total of 237 Mohs cases between 2013-2020 were examined by the blinded Mohs surgeon and the tumors were marked on copy maps. The copy maps and the original maps were compared and the non-concordant cases were reevaluated together by the Mohs surgeon and the dermatopathologist. The concordance rate was calculated and the inter-rater agreement was statistically analyzed using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. RESULTS We report high concordance rate (97.9%) and inter-rater agreement (0.96) of Mohs surgeon and dermatopathologist in evaluating Mohs slides. CONCLUSION As a newly settled center, our results are in alignment with experienced centers where the Mohs surgeon evaluates the slides herself and performs the surgery.","Atilla, S; Gököz, Ö; Özer, S; Elçin, G",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.17574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331818/,386

Early successful operations to treat these tumors were pioneered by prominent figures such as Sir William Macewen and Francesco Durante. Following these early reports, Harvey Cushing made significant contributions, allowing a better understanding and treatment of meningiomas in general, but particularly those involving the anterior cranial base. Initially, large-sized unilateral or bilateral craniotomies were necessary to approach these deep-seated lesions. Technical advances such as the introduction of electrosurgery, the operating microscope, and refined microsurgical instruments allowed neurosurgeons to perform less invasive surgical procedures with better results. Today, a wide variety of surgical strategies, including endoscopic surgery and radiosurgery, are used to treat these tumors. In this review, the authors trace the evolution of craniotomy for anterior cranial fossa meningiomas.","Morales-Valero, Saul F; Van Gompel, Jamie J; Loumiotis, Ioannis; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.1.focus13569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684326/,386

METHODS This retrospective study included 32 consecutive patients with chronic lateral ankle instability who underwent surgery from January 2013 to December 2014. All patients had failed to resolve with conservative treatment. A total of 32 ankles underwent AHPLT transfer. Patients returned for a clinical and radiologic follow-up evaluation at an average of 28 (range, 24-35) months postoperatively. Outcomes were assessed by comparison of pre- and postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, visual analog scale pain scores, and Karlsson scores, and the radiographic assessment including talar tilt and anterior talar translation. RESULTS Thirty-two patients (32 ankles) (100%) returned for final evaluation. All patients had an excellent or good outcome on patient subjective self-assessment, pain scores, AOFAS scores, and Karlsson scores at final follow-up. Ankle range of motion was not affected by lateral ankle reconstruction. The talar tilt was significantly reduced from a preoperative mean of 14.1±4.2° to 3.4±1.3° postoperatively (P<.001), and the anterior drawer was significantly reduced from a preoperative mean of 13.8±3.4mm to 3.6±1.5mm after lateral ankle ligamentous reconstruction (P<.001).

The present study purposed to observe the serial skin temperature changes of both hindlimbs following several types of sciatic nerve injury (complete transection and ligation model [CTL], crush injury model [CRI], and chronic constriction injury model [CCI]) in Sprague-Dawley rats and, further, to delineate the possible mechanisms through various evaluation methods. The temperature differences between the intact and injured areas (ΔT) on the plantar surface and toes varied among the CTL, CRI, and CCI injury models during the acute stage (7 days post-injury). During the subacute to chronic stages (7-28 days post-injury), ΔT on the plantar area and toes of the CCI model were higher than those of the CTL and CRI models. The sciatic functional index was gradually restored in the CRI and CCI models, but was unchanged in the CTL model. The CTL model showed constant hypoesthesia; the CRI model, contrastingly, was restored to normal, and the CCI model showed gradual hyperesthesia until 28 days post-injury. The latency and amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in the involved plantar muscle was not found in the CTL group 4 weeks post-injury, but showed gradual restoration in the CRI and CCI models. Regression analysis revealed that the ΔT in the plantar area and toes were affected only by the CMAP amplitude in the involved plantar muscle; therefore, it can be said that the skin temperature on the injured area after sciatic nerve injury was influenced by the functional status of the involved muscle. Measurement of skin temperature can differentiate mild peripheral nerve injury from moderate-to-severe injuries, although its clinical significance might be limited.","Kim, Min Seok; Seo, Dong Hyuk; Lim, Myung Ho; Kim, Tae Uk; Lee, Seong Jae; Hyun, Jung Keun",Journal of neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2012.2414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22989216/,386

The aim was to assess the variation of alcohol drinking habits in a sample of Italian citizens during lockdown and to identify the psychosocial factors surrounding it. METHODS An online anonymous questionnaire was created and submitted from 9th April 2020 to 28th April 2020. Questions were related to personal psychosocial details and alcohol drinking habits during the lockdown, including Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT C) questions. RESULTS On a total of 1234 surveys the increase of both anxiety and fear was largely detected (63% and 61% respectively). The 18% increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown and it showed a significant correlation with anxiety and fear experienced (both p<0.001). The relative risk for 7 to 9 and more than 10 drinks per day consumption were directly linked to these symptoms (p<0.001). The most involved categories of participants showed this harmful association were self-employed workers and participants who live alone, subject aged 30-50 with high level of instruction or students and not occupied people in the age range 18-19 (all p<0.001). Additionally, the subset of the study population that showed low alcohol consumption before the lockdown has demonstrated the worsening of alcohol assumption during the quarantine (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Several psychosocial factors are involved in determining the increase of alcohol consumption during lockdown and need the healthcare support to avoid awful impact on human life.","Mazzarella, Chiara; Spina, Annamaria; Dallio, Marcello; Gravina, Antonietta G; Romeo, Mario; DI Mauro, Maurizio; Loguercio, Carmelina; Federico, Alessandro",Minerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4806.21.07354-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949179/,386

A retrospective cohort study.,2020-07-01,"Background The ACGME Milestone Project created a competency-based trainee assessment tool. Subcompetencies (SCs) are scored on a 5-point scale; level 4 is recommended for graduation. The 2018 Milestones Report found that across subspecialties, not all graduates attain level 4 for every SC. Objective The objective was to describe the number of pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellows who achieve ≥ level 4 in all 23 SCs at graduation and identify SCs where level 4 is not achieved and factors predictive of not achieving a level 4. Methods This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of PEM fellows from 2014 to 2018. Program directors provided milestone reports. Descriptive analysis of SC scores was performed. Subanalyses assessed differences in residency graduation scores, first-year fellowship scores, and the rate of milestone attainment between fellows who did and did not attain ≥ level 4 at graduation. Results Data from 392 fellows were obtained. There were no SCs in which all fellows attained ≥ level 4 at graduation; the range of fellows scoring < level 4 per SC was 7% to 39%. A total of 67% of fellows did not attain ≥ level 4 on one or more SC. While some fellows failed to attain ≥ level 4 on up to all 23 SCs, 26% failed to meet level 4 on only one or two. In 19 SCs, residency graduation and/or first year fellow scores were lower for fellows who did not attain ≥ level 4 at graduation compared to those who did (mean difference = 0.74 points). Among 10 SCs, fellows who did not attain ≥ level 4 at graduation had a faster rate of improvement compared to those who did attain ≥ level 4. Conclusion In our sample, 67% of PEM fellows did not attain level 4 for one or more of the SCs at graduation. Low scores during residency or early in fellowship may predict difficulty in meeting level 4 by fellowship completion.","Roskind, Cindy G; Leonard, Kathryn; Baghdassarian, Aline; Kou, Maybelle; Levasseur, Kelly; Rose, Jerri A; Shabanova, Veronika; Vu, Tien; Zuckerbraun, Noel S; Langhan, Melissa L",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222754/,386

RESULTS The Pompe patients exhibited greater power at frequencies below 60 Hz and reduced power above 100 Hz. They also exhibited a reduced increase in M-wave and prolonged M-wave latency and duration in response to stimulation. CONCLUSIONS These results provide evidence that LOPD individuals have an altered activation pattern of the TA during maximal contractions.

120476,Inflammation-associated factors for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.,2021-01-04,"The issue of the COVID-19 pandemic occupies the agenda of the whole world. The pivot of this pandemic is a crucial element that has become almost as important as the virus itself, namely the lockdown. Although, the rationale for lockdown is well-sustained by strong epidemiological arguments, exploring the 'other' unwanted consequences of the contemporary COVID-19 pandemic is mandatory for coagulating a robust agreed position against the numerous problems generated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Starting from the rationale of the lockdown, in this paper we explored and exposed the other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic measures such as the use or abuse of human rights and freedom restrictions, economic issues, marginalized groups and eclipse of all other diseases. Our scientific attempt is to coagulate a stable position and integrate current opposing views by advancing the idea that rather than applying the uniform lockdown policy, one could recommend instead an improved model targeting more strict and more prolonged lockdowns to vulnerable risk/age groups while enabling less stringent measures for the lower-risk groups, minimizing both economic losses and deaths. Rigorous (and also governed by freedom) debating may be able to synchronize the opposed perspectives between those advocating an extreme lockdown (e.g., most of the epidemiologists and health experts), and those criticizing all restrictive measures (e.g., economists and human rights experts). Confronting the multiple facets of the public health mitigation measures is the only way to avoid contributing to history with yet another failure, as seen in other past epidemics.","Burlacu, Alexandru; Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Covic, Adrian; Raiu, Catalin; Mavrichi, Ionut; Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Lillo-Crespo, Manuel",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2020.04.274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33387996/,386

However, studies of EM physician leadership and ED leadership are in their infancy. As such, there is a lack of clarity about the forms, antecedents, enablers, barriers and consequences of EM physician leadership. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted to reveal the different conceptualisations of EM physician leadership, the activities involved in the practice of leadership, and the knowledge and skills of effective ED leaders. Seven databases were systematically searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies on the topic of EM physicians carrying out a manager or leadership role in an ED setting. Finally, 26 articles were included, and their findings were synthesised and analysed narratively. Two conceptualisations of EM physician leadership were found, reflecting clinical leadership and medical leadership, respectively. Clinical leadership is performed by all EM physicians, often informally, within their daily clinical practice, whereas medical leadership is performed by EM physicians who work at the management level within a hospital, in addition to or instead of their clinical practice. The focus of EM physician leadership and ED leadership research is team leadership, with much less attention given to wider organisation leadership. Consistent with the focus on team leadership, clinical knowledge and skill in orchestrating teams, especially trauma and resuscitation teams, emerged as the most important factors underpinning leadership effectiveness. Future research and training should make better use of existing leadership theory and research designs to illuminate the forms, dynamics, antecedents, moderators and consequences of EM physician leadership.","Wilson, Samuel; Rixon, Andrew; Hartanto, Stephanie; White, Peter; Judkins, Simon",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089650/,386

In addition to the direct effect (e.g., being infected with the virus), this pandemic has negatively ravaged many industries, particularly food retail, food services, and hospitality. Given the novelty of the disease, the true impact of COVID-19 remains to be determined. Because of the nature of their work, and the characteristics of the workers, individuals in the food retail, food service, and hospitality industries are a group whose vulnerability is at its most fragile state during this pandemic. Through this qualitative study, we explored workers' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and coping, including screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Twenty-seven individual interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Four key themes emerged: being infected and infecting others, the unknown, isolation, and work and customer demands. Considering the many uncertainties of COVID-19, workers in these three industries were experiencing heightened levels of mental distress because of where they worked and the already existing disparities they faced on a daily basis before the pandemic started. Yet they remained hopeful for a better future. More studies are needed to fully understand the magnitude, short-term, and long-term effects of COVID-19. Based on this study's findings, programs are critically needed to promote positive coping behaviors among at-risk and distressed workers. Recommendations for employers, occupational health and safety professionals, and policy stakeholders to further support these service workers are discussed.","Rosemberg, Marie-Anne S; Adams, Mackenzie; Polick, Carri; Li, Wei V; Dang, Jenny; Tsai, Jenny Hsin-Chun",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1901905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861938/,386
121947,Adverse reactions of dimethyl sulfoxide in humans: a systematic review.,2018,"Assessing psychophysiological responses of emotion regulation is a cost-efficient way to quantify emotion regulation and to complement subjective report that may be biased. Previous studies have revealed inconsistent results complicating a sound interpretation of these findings. In the present study, we summarized the existing literature through a systematic search of articles. Meta-analyses were used to evaluate effect sizes of instructed downregulation strategies on common autonomic (electrodermal, respiratory, cardiovascular, and pupillometric) and electromyographic (corrugator activity, emotion-modulated startle) measures. Moderator analyses were conducted, with moderators including study design, emotion induction, control instruction and trial duration. We identified k = 78 studies each contributing multiple sub-samples and performed 23 meta-analyses for combinations of emotion regulation strategy and psychophysiological measure. Overall, results showed that effects of reappraisal and suppression on autonomic measures were highly inconsistent across studies with rather small mean effect sizes. Electromyography (startle and corrugator activity) showed medium effect sizes that were consistent across studies. Our findings highlight the diversity as well as the low level of standardization and comparability of research in this area. Significant moderation of effects by study design, trial duration, and control condition emphasizes the need for better standardization of methods. In addition, the small mean effect sizes resulting from our analyses on autonomic measures should be interpreted with caution. Findings corroborate the importance of multi-channel approaches.","Zaehringer, Jenny; Jennen-Steinmetz, Christine; Schmahl, Christian; Ende, Gabriele; Paret, Christian",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372993/,386

While backed by legal authority, the public and even the health care worker community's understanding of the term is murky at best and scientific evidence to support the use of quarantine is frequently lacking. The multiple interpretations and references to quarantine, the inconsistent application of public health quarantine laws across jurisdictional boundaries, and reports of ineffectiveness are further complicated by associated infringement of civil liberties and human rights abuses. Given the need to balance public safety with human rights, we must be more precise about the meaning of quarantine and consider the efficacy and negative secondary effects resulting from its implementation. This article explains quarantine terminology and then uses a case study from Taiwan during the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak to illustrate the key principles associated with quarantine measures taken during the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the potential hazards that can arise from quarantines. Finally, we provide a quarantine and isolation decision tree to assist policy makers and public health officials in applying medically defensible, outcomes-based data and legal authorities to optimize management of emerging infectious diseases.","Barbisch, Donna; Koenig, Kristi L; Shih, Fuh-Yuan",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2015.38; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797363/,386

Telemedicine, which includes medical advice given over telephone, Internet, mobile phone applications or other similar ways, may be an efficient way to reduce transmission and pressure on medical institutions. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases for literature on the use of telemedicine for COVID-19, SARS and MERS from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We included studies about the content of the consultation (such as symptoms, therapy and prevention, policy, public service), screening of suspected cases, the provision of advice given to those people who may have symptoms or contact history. We conducted meta-analyses on the main outcomes of the studies. Results A total of 2,041 articles were identified after removing duplicates. After reading the full texts, we finally included nine studies. People were most concerned about symptoms (64.2%), epidemic situation and public problems (14.5%), and psychological problems (10.3%) during COVID-19 epidemic. During the SARS epidemic, the proportions of people asking for consultation for symptoms, prevention and therapy, and psychological problems were 35.0%, 22.0%, and 23.0%, respectively. Two studies demonstrated that telemedicine can be used to screen the suspected patients and give advice. One study emphasized the limited possibilities to follow up people calling hotlines and difficulties in identifying all suspect cases. Conclusions Telemedicine services should focus on the issues that the public is most concerned about, such as the symptoms, prevention and treatment of the disease, and provide reasonable advice to patients with symptoms or people with epidemic history.","Gao, Yelei; Liu, Rui; Zhou, Qi; Wang, Xingmei; Huang, Liping; Shi, Qianling; Wang, Zijun; Lu, Shuya; Li, Weiguo; Ma, Yanfang; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong; Shu, Chang; Tian, Daiyin",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566563/,386

Also, it is known to harbor quinones that are essential for enzyme catalysis. Here we report structural features of the peptide/membrane interactions obtained by using CD and DEER spectroscopic techniques, both in micelles and in lipid vesicles.

127003,Pulmonary mass-like lesion caused by Toxoplasma gondii in a domestic shorthair cat.,2021-05-04,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D), like other autoimmune diseases, is on the rise since the second half of the 20th century. Hypothetically this has been ascribed to restricted exposure to microbial diversity due to advanced hygienic practices accompanying modernization, and increasing prosperity in urban versus rural habitats. The autoimmune animal model of T1D, inhibited by Bacillus Calmette Guerine (BCG), motivated testing the impact of BCG on T1D incidence in humans. Several epidemiological analyses, short of one, failed to demonstrate a protective effect of BCG against T1D. The present retrospective analysis of two data sets reevaluates the hypothetic inhibitory effect of BCG on human T1D. Reassessment of data from a Swedish study reveals that a single BCG vaccination provided a small but significant protection against T1D. A second data set of T1D prevalence/1000 Israeli military conscripts, from a doctoral thesis presenting 17 birth cohorts at age 17 is evaluated against the national schedule of vaccination related to years of birth. To correct for the annual increasing T1D trend the mean urbanization (census) rate was set as an annual moving average and factored into the prevalence (T1D/1000) of respective birth cohorts. Three groups of cohorts corresponding to BCG vaccination are presently identified; Group A corresponds to the years in which newborns were vaccinated and boosted if necessary, at age 12. Group B corresponds to the period when boosting was discontinued. Group C corresponds to years when newborn BCG vaccination was discontinued. T1D (only in females) was slightly but significantly lower in group B (n = 5 cohorts) versus C (n = 8 cohorts, p = 0.0475, by Mann Whitney U test). T1D in group A (n = 4 cohorts) was lower than in group B (p = 0.02). This analysis supports the hypothesis that in human females postnatal BCG vaccination, reinforced by boosting, has a protective impact on T1D being superior to omitted boosting, which in its turn is still better than stopping vaccination altogether. This analysis further suggests that upon advanced modernization the BCG vaccine compensates for reduced exposure to microbial diversity early in life.","Klein, Benjamin Y",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773242/,386
127336,Lymphocyte percentage and hemoglobin as a joint parameter for the prediction of severe and nonsevere COVID-19: a preliminary study.,2020-10-01,"UNLABELLED Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human gammaherpesvirus with latent and lytic reactivation cycles. The mechanism by which KSHV evades the innate immune system to establish latency has not yet been precisely elucidated. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the first line of defense against viral infections. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a key adaptor that interacts with all TLRs except TLR3 to produce inflammatory factors and type I interferons (IFNs), which are central components of innate immunity against microbial infection. Here, we found that KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA), which is an immediate-early master switch protein of viral cycles, downregulates MyD88 expression at the protein level by degrading MyD88 through the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway. We identified the interaction between RTA and MyD88 in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that RTA functions as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate MyD88. MyD88 also was repressed at the early stage of de novo infection as well as in lytic reactivation. We also found that RTA inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered activation of the TLR4 pathway by reducing IFN production and NF-κB activity. Finally, we showed that MyD88 promoted the production of IFNs and inhibited KSHV LANA-1 gene transcription. Taken together, our results suggest that KSHV RTA facilitates the virus to evade innate immunity through the degradation of MyD88, which might be critical for viral latency control. IMPORTANCE MyD88 is an adaptor for all TLRs other than TLR3, and it mediates inflammatory factors and IFN production. Our study demonstrated that the KSHV RTA protein functions as an E3 ligase to degrade MyD88 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and block the transmission of TLRs signals. Moreover, we found that KSHV inhibited MyD88 expression during the early stage of de novo infection as well as in lytic reactivation. These results provide a potential mechanism for the virus to evade innate immunity.","Zhao, Qinglan; Liang, Deguang; Sun, Rui; Jia, Baosen; Xia, Tian; Xiao, Hui; Lan, Ke",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02591-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320320/,386

Cytokine storms are associated with a wide variety of infectious and noninfectious diseases. The term was popularized largely in the context of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection, bringing the term into popular media. In this review, we focus on the cytokine storm in the context of virus infection, and we highlight how high-throughput genomic methods are revealing the importance of the kinetics of cytokine gene expression and the remarkable degree of redundancy and overlap in cytokine signaling. We also address evidence for and against the role of the cytokine storm in the pathology of clinical and infectious disease and discuss why it has been so difficult to use knowledge of the cytokine storm and immunomodulatory therapies to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with severe acute infections.","Tisoncik, Jennifer R; Korth, Marcus J; Simmons, Cameron P; Farrar, Jeremy; Martin, Thomas R; Katze, Michael G",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.05015-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22390970/,386

In this study, the profiles of 58 key metabolites produced by wheat seedlings in response to drought stress were investigated to determine various physiological processes related to drought tolerance between drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive wheat genotypes. Results showed that the wheat metabolome was dominated by sugars, organic acids and amino acids; the wheat metabolome played important roles to enhance the drought tolerance of shoots. Under drought stress, JD17 exhibited higher growth indices and higher photosynthesis ability than JD8. A high level of compatible solutes and energy in shoots were essential for wheat to develop drought tolerance. Drought also caused system alterations in widespread metabolic networks involving transamination, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, glutamate-mediated proline biosynthesis, shikimate-mediated secondary metabolisms and γ-aminobutyric acid metabolisms. Long-term drought stress resulted in the drought-tolerant wheat genotype JD17, which induced metabolic shifts in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis with the depletion of the γ-aminobutyric acid shut process. In JD17, the prolonged drought stress induced a progressive accumulation of osmolytes, including proline, sucrose, fructose, mannose and malic acid. This research extended our understanding of the mechanisms involved in wheat seedling drought tolerance; this study also demonstrated that gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics could be an effective approach to understand the drought effects on plant biochemistry.","Guo, Rui; Shi, LianXuan; Jiao, Yang; Li, MingXia; Zhong, XiuLi; Gu, FengXue; Liu, Qi; Xia, Xu; Li, HaoRu",AoB PLANTS,https://doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/ply016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29623182/,386

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a scoping review by searching forty literature databases encompassing a broad range of disciplines from inception to April 2016. We included all study types and data extracted on study design, discipline, data collection tools, and phase of the research data lifecycle. RESULTS We included 301 articles plus 10 companion reports after screening 13,002 titles and abstracts and 654 full-text articles. Most articles (85%) were published from 2010 onwards and conducted within the sciences (86%). More than three-quarters of the articles (78%) reported methods that included interviews, cross-sectional, or case studies. Most articles (68%) included the Giving Access to Data phase of the UK Data Archive Research Data Lifecycle that examines activities such as sharing data. When studies were grouped into five dominant groupings (Stakeholder, Data, Library, Tool/Device, and Publication), data quality emerged as an integral element. CONCLUSION Most studies relied on self-reports (interviews, surveys) or accounts from an observer (case studies) and we found few studies that collected empirical evidence on activities amongst data producers, particularly those examining the impact of research data management interventions. As well, fewer studies examined research data management at the early phases of research projects. The quality of all research outputs needs attention, from the application of best practices in research data management studies, to data producers depositing data in repositories for long-term use.","Perrier, Laure; Blondal, Erik; Ayala, A Patricia; Dearborn, Dylanne; Kenny, Tim; Lightfoot, David; Reka, Roger; Thuna, Mindy; Trimble, Leanne; MacDonald, Heather",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28542450/,386

Following identification of high levels of emergency department (ED) reattendance among patients with suspected COVID-19 at our centre, we piloted a rapid remote follow-up service for this patient group. We present our service framework and evaluation of our pilot cohort of 192 patients. We followed up patients by telephone within 36 hours of their ED attendance. Pulse oximetry was used for remote monitoring of a subset of patients. Patients required between one and six consecutive telephone assessments, dependent on illness severity, and 23 patients were recalled for in-person assessment. Approximately half of patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19 required onward referral for respiratory follow-up. This framework reduced unplanned ED reattendances in comparison with a retrospective comparator cohort (4.7% from 22.6%). We reproduced these findings in a validation cohort with a high prevalence of acute COVID-19, managed through the clinic in September-October 2020, where we identified an unplanned ED reattendance rate of 5.2%. We propose that rapid remote follow-up is a mechanism by which ambulatory patients can be clinically supported during the acute phase of illness, with benefits both to patient care and to health service resilience.","Bell, Lucy Ck; Norris-Grey, Caitlin; Luintel, Akish; Bidwell, Gabriella; Lanham, David; Marks, Michael; Baruah, Tim; O'Shea, Luke; Heightman, Melissa; Logan, Sarah",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355255/,386

The objective of this study was to determine whether the morphology of PTFJ has predictive value for the risk of total knee replacement (TKR). Case knees from Osteoarthritis Initiative participants with TKR at 24-60 months follow up (cases) were 1:1 matched with control knees (no TKR throughout 60 months) by baseline age, sex and Kellgren-Lawrence grade. PTFJ morphological parameters, including coronal inclination angle (Angle α), sagittal inclination angle (Angle β), fibular contacting area (S), load-bearing area (Sτ), lateral stress-bolstering area (Sφ) and posterior stress-bolstering area (Sυ) were assessed using coronal and sagittal MRI, respectively. Associations of the morphological measures at baseline and the time point before TKR (T0 ) and their changes with TKR risks were examined using conditional logistic regression analyses. 223 knees of 193 participants received TKR between 12M and 60M and therefore were matched with 223 control knees. Of these, 173 paired knees had MRI readings available both at baseline and T0 time point. While baseline Angle α was positively associated with TKR risk, other measures at baseline and all measures at T0 were not significantly associated with TKR risk. Changes in S, Sτ and Sυ were significantly and negatively associated with the risk of TKR (ΔS, OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.76; ΔSτ, OR=0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.87; ΔSυ, OR=0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.62, respectively). This data shows that morphological changes of PTFJ predict the risk of TKR, suggesting PTFJ may play a role in knee osteoarthritis. This article is protected by copyright.

129761,Six-month changes in ideal cardiovascular health vs. Framingham 10-year coronary heart disease risk among young adults enrolled in a weight loss intervention.,2016,"INTRODUCTION In March 2020, Australian state and federal governments introduced physical distancing measures alongside widespread testing to combat COVID-19. These measures may decrease people's sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behaviour of gay and bisexual men (GBM) in Australia. METHODS Between April 4 and April 29 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19, and whether they engaged in sexual behaviour with regular or casual partners or 'fuckbuddies' in the six months prior to becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as 'before COVID-19'), and following the date they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as 'since COVID-19'). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19. RESULTS Mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the six months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%. CONCLUSION GBM in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioural changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses. If sexual health screenings are undertaken prior to resuming sexual activity, this could present a novel opportunity to interrupt chains of HIV and STI transmission.","Hammoud, Mohamed A; Maher, Lisa; Holt, Martin; Degenhardt, Louisa; Jin, Jeff; Murphy, Dean; Bavinton, Benjamin; Grulich, Andrew; Lea, Toby; Haire, Bridget; Bourne, Adam; Saxton, Peter; Vaccher, Stefanie; Ellard, Jeanne; Mackie, Brent; Batrouney, Colin; Bath, Nicky; Prestage, Garrett",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740374/,386

132391,Most Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 Have Lasting Symptoms.,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Religion and spirituality constitute aspects of diversity that physicians must respect to provide patient-centered care. By seeing patients as individuals and integrating their religious and spiritual needs into their medical care, providers can deliver personalized health care. Their needs become even more critical for the frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most patients want their physicians to address their religious and spiritual needs when it comes to their health (eg, during isolation precautions). Despite increases in educational curricula about this integration, most physicians still do not provide this aspect of patient-centered care. METHODS In this observational study, we examined how medical students responded to a patient experiencing a religious and spiritual issue by having standardized patients (SPs) rate the students' level of engagement with them. We also asked students to reflect on their own spirituality, in terms of their current and ideal levels of spirituality, the difference of which indicates spiritual dissonance. Medical students (n=232) completed the Spiritual Health and Life-Outcome Measure (SHALOM) questionnaire, and their SPs completed the Princess Margaret Hospital Satisfaction With Doctor Questionnaire (PSQ-MD). RESULTS Results indicated a significant, positive correlation between disengagement (from PSQ-MD) and transcendent spirituality dissonance (from SHALOM). CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of disconnection from a patient case with a religious and spiritual issue (portrayed by an SP) were associated with higher levels of incongruity in medical students' responses as to their ideal relationship with the transcendent (eg, God, Allah, peace).","Schmidt, Cindy; Nauta, Loes; Dang, Andrew",Family medicine,https://doi.org/10.22454/fammed.2021.194514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471924/,386
132927,The Impact of Preoperative Intravenous Iron Therapy on Perioperative Outcomes in Cardiac Surgery: A Systematic Review.,2020-12-01,"Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate whether an ante-mortem diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is possible via immunocytochemical staining (ICC) of feline coronavirus antigen (FCoV) within macrophages of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methods Prospectively, CSF samples of 41 cats were investigated, including cats with histopathologically confirmed FIP and neurological signs (n = 10), cats with confirmed FIP without CNS involvement (n = 11), cats with neurological signs but another confirmed CNS disease (n = 17), and cats without neurological signs and a disease other than FIP (n = 3). ICC staining of CSF macrophages was performed in all cats. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of CSF ICC were calculated. Results Of 10 samples from cats with CNS FIP, eight had detectable CSF macrophages, seven of which were positive for FCoV. Ten of 11 samples from cats with confirmed FIP without neurological signs had macrophages in the CSF, with all 10 being ICC-positive. In cats with other CNS disorders, 11/17 had macrophages, two of which stained positively. In cats with diseases other than FIP and without neurological disorders, 2/3 revealed macrophages, with one cat showing positive ICC staining. Diagnosis of FIP via CSF ICC had a sensitivity of 85.0% and a specificity of 83.3%. PPV and NPV were 85.0% and 83.3%. Conclusions and relevance CSF ICC is a highly sensitive test for ante-mortem diagnosis of FIP manifesting in the CNS. However, CNS ICC specificity is too low to confirm FIP and the method should only be applied in conjunction with other features such as CSF cytology. CNS ICC could be helpful to discover pre-neurological stages of CNS FIP.","Gruendl, Stefanie; Matiasek, Kaspar; Matiasek, Lara; Fischer, Andrea; Felten, Sandra; Jurina, Konrad; Hartmann, Katrin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x16640839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27095828/,386
132947,One Disaster After Another or a Timely Help? The Role of ECMO for COVID-19 Patients.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to identify indicated homeopathic remedies based on the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in India. METHODS In this retrospective, cohort study, confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at a COVID Health Centre in New Delhi between April 29 and June 17, 2020 were given conventional and homeopathic treatment. Patients were grouped into mild, moderate or severe categories of disease. Their symptomatologic profiles were analyzed to identify indicated homeopathic medicines. RESULTS A total of 196 COVID-19 patients were admitted. One hundred and seventy-eight patients had mild symptoms; eighteen patients had moderate symptoms; no patients with severe symptoms were included as they were referred to tertiary care centers with ventilatory support. The mean age of patients with mild symptoms was significantly lower (38.6 years; standard deviation or SD ± 15.8) compared with patients in the moderate category (66.0 years; SD ± 9.09). The most important symptoms identified were fever (43.4%), cough (47.4%), sore throat (29.6%), headache (18.4%), myalgia (17.9%), fatigue (16.8%), chest discomfort (13.8%), chills (12.6%), shortness of breath (11.2%) and loss of taste (10.2%). Twenty-eight homeopathic medicines were prescribed, the most frequently indicated being Bryonia alba (33.3%), Arsenicum album (18.1%), Pulsatilla nigricans (13.8%), Nux vomica (8%), Rhus toxicodendron (7.2%) and Gelsemium sempervirens (5.8%), in 30C potency. CONCLUSION Data from the current study reveal that Arsenicum album, Bryonia alba, Pulsatilla nigricans, Nux vomica, Rhus toxicodendron and Gelsemium sempervirens are the most frequently indicated homeopathic medicines. A randomized controlled clinical trial based on this finding is the next step.","Jethani, Bipin; Gupta, Meeta; Wadhwani, Parul; Thomas, Rekha; Balakrishnan, Thankaraj; Mathew, George; Mathur, Mohit; Rao, Bachha Pompi; Shukla, Dhananjay; Khullar, Aashima; Khera, Meghna; Sharma, Himani; Kumar, Ravinder; Kumar, Sudeep; Jaggi, Sayami; Sinha, Robin; Rawal, Kamal; Kapoor, Anu; Manchanda, Raj Kumar",Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1718584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567460/,386
134694,Unrecognized failed airway management using a supraglottic airway device.,2017,"This paper evaluates the aggregation behavior of a potential drug and gene delivery system that combines branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), a positively-charged polyelectrolyte, and elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), a recombinant polymer that exhibits lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The LCST behavior of ELP has been extensively studied, but there are no quantitative ways to control the size of aggregates formed after the phase transition. The aggregate size cannot be maintained when the temperature is lowered below the LCST, unless the system exhibits hysteresis and forms irreversible aggregates. This study shows that conjugation of ELP with PEI preserves the aggregation behavior that occurs above the LCST and achieves precise aggregate radii when the solution conditions of pH (3, 7, 10), polymer concentration (0.1, 0.15, 0.3 mg/mL), and salt concentration (none, 0.2, 1 M) are carefully controlled. K-means cluster analyses showed that salt concentration was the most critical factor controlling the hydrodynamic radius and LCST. Conjugating ELP to PEI allowed crosslinking the aggregates and achieved stable particles that maintained their size below LCST, even after removal of the harsh (high salt or pH) conditions used to create them. Taken together, the ability to control aggregate sizes and use of crosslinking to maintain stability holds excellent potential for use in biological delivery systems.","Cobb, Jared S; Engel, Alexandra; Seale, Maria A; Janorkar, Amol V",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85601-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737605/,386

It is known that many transplanted islets failed to engraft, and thus, new approaches for overcoming graft loss that may improve the outcome of future clinical islet transplantations are necessary. Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A, member 3 (PHLDA3) is a known suppressor of neuroendocrine tumorigenicity, yet deficiency of this gene increases islet proliferation, prevents islet apoptosis, and improves their insulin-releasing function without causing tumors. In this study, we examined the potential use of PHLDA3-deficient islets in transplantation. We observed that: 1) transplanting PHLDA3-deficient islets into diabetic mice significantly improved their glycometabolic condition, 2) the improved engraftment of PHLDA3-deficient islets resulted from increased cell survival during early transplantation, and 3) Akt activity was elevated in PHLDA3-deficient islets, especially under hypoxic conditions. Thus, we determined that PHLDA3-deficient islets are more resistant against stresses induced by islet isolation and transplantation. We conclude that use of islets with suppressed PHLDA3 expression could be a novel and promising treatment for improving engraftment and consequent glycemic control in islet transplantation.","Sakata, Naoaki; Yamaguchi, Yohko; Chen, Yu; Shimoda, Masayuki; Yoshimatsu, Gumpei; Unno, Michiaki; Sumi, Shoichiro; Ohki, Rieko",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29121094/,386

The effect of ADHD treatment on the risk of obesity was controlled. Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 58 subjects aged from 8 to 17 years with ADHD. Control group consisted of 62 healthy age- and sex-matched children and adolescents. Overweight and obesity were assessed according to International Obesity Task-Force (IOTF), World Health Organization (WHO) and European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG) criteria. Results: There was a significantly higher incidence of obesity in ADHD group according to WHO (ADHD vs. Control: 17.2% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.01) and IOTF criteria (ADHD vs. Control: 10.3% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.04), but no significant difference according to ECOG criteria. There was significantly higher occurrence of overweight (20.7% vs. 12.8%, p < 0.001), obesity (10.3% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.001), and overweight and obesity (31.0% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.001) in the ADHD group compared to the Polish population. The analysis did not show a statistically significant relationship between the amount of taken psychostimulant and the occurrence of overweight and obesity. Conclusions: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the group of ADHD children and adolescents varies depending on the choice of diagnostic criteria. At the same time, it is significantly more frequent than in the general population. We suggest that future studies should give a clear rationale for the selection of cutoff points to minimize errors that could confound data analysis and interpretation.","Racicka-Pawlukiewicz, Ewa; Hanć, Tomasz; Kuć, Katarzyna; Bielecki, Maksymilian; Zaorska, Justyna; Wolańczyk, Tomasz; Bryńska, Anita",Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2020.0075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411571/,386

METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery at Galaxy Care Laparoscopic Institute, Pune, India, between January 2007 and December 2010 were selected for participation. All procedures were performed using conventional laparoscopic instruments and trocars. Operative data-including operative time (from incision to port closure), blood loss, additional ports used, energy sources used, and intraoperative complications-were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-three procedures were performed during the study period. All procedures were completed via single incision only. Operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay were comparable with those associated with conventional laparoscopy. CONCLUSION It is debatable whether laparoscopic surgery via a single incision would threaten the position of the current gold standard of conventional laparoscopic procedures. The present study showed that single-incision laparoscopic surgery using conventional instruments is feasible and effective.","Puntambekar, Shailesh; Rayate, Neeraj; Nadkarni, Akshay; Joshi, Saurabh; Agrawal, Geetanjali; Desai, Riddhi",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2011.11.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261133/,386

A 71-year-old man with Hodgkin's lymphoma presented with severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and was intubated upon admission and the initial standard treatment for COVID-19 was started for him. The patient subsequently developed superimposed bacterial pneumonia with S. maltophilia. According to that, the patient's intubation tube was removed and a tracheostomy was performed for him. Also, antibiotic treatment was replaced with Colistin and Co-trimoxazole drugs. Finally, after 31 days of hospitalization in the ICU and the aappropriate drug treatment, he was discharged with reduced symptoms and partial recovery. It should be noted that the occurrence of co-infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens such as S. maltophilia requires proper management to select appropriate treatment methods and drugs so that in addition to proper effectiveness, it does not lead to side effects and complications associated with COVID-19 disease.","Darvishnia, David; Sadeghi, Mahdieh; Sharifpour, Ali; Zakariaei, Zakaria; Banimostafavi, Elham Sadat; Fakhar, Mahdi; Tabaripour, Rabeeh",Infectious disorders drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526521666210203220718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538678/,386

Methods: A search was conducted on the US Clinical Trials Database and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Center. The search date was from the establishment of the database to May 26, 2020, and the registration trials of new drugs for curing hepatitis B at home and abroad were included. Two researchers independently searched and screened the literature and extracted the data. Results: A total of 106 registered clinical trials of new drugs for curing hepatitis B were included (94 English registration websites and 12 Chinese registration websites), and the number of registrations had increased year by year. Among them, the proportion of therapeutic vaccines and core protein inhibitors were the highest, accounting for 27.4% (n = 29) and 22.6% (n = 24), respectively. The vast majority of clinical trials (n = 96, 90.6%) were in the early stages (Phase I and II). The subjects in phase I clinical trial were mainly healthy people and treated CHB patients, while the subjects in phase II clinical trial were mainly CHB patients who had achieved viral suppression after initial or post-treatment. The main evaluation indicators of Phase I clinical trials were the safety and tolerability of new drugs. The main evaluation indicators in about half of Phase II clinical trials were HBsAg negative conversion/quantitative decline. Overall, the number of clinical trials with the new design was small, accounting for 3.8% (4 / 106). There were relatively few trials of new drugs for curing hepatitis B on domestic registration websites, and the information provided was incomplete. Conclusion: The number of clinical trials of new hepatitis B drugs at home and abroad is increasing year by year, but most of them are in phase I and II, with few adopting new designs. In addition, the information integrity of the domestic website registration center needs to be improved.","Chen, S; Zhao, L H; Shan, S; Li, M; Sun, Y M; Zhou, J L; Wu, X N; Dong, R H; Kong, Y Y; Ou, X J; Ma, H; You, H; Jia, J D",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501113-20200609-00305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911904/,386

RECENT FINDINGS In Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand, medical use has been approved, whereas it is limited in South Korea and Singapore and illegal in other countries. Except Australia, none of the Asia-Pacific region countries allows recreational use. China and Japan are expected to approve medical use, whereas Australia and New Zealand work on decriminalization. Most cultivation is allowed and regulated for medical use. Cannabis seizures have changed in accordance with these policies. Although the national surveys of four countries, that is, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Thailand were conducted in different years, the use of cannabis among the general population has increased.

Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the anti-hyperalgesic mechanism of fentanyl in a mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy. The antinociceptive response was assessed by recording the latency in a tail-flick test. The tail-flick latency in diabetic mice was significantly shorter than that in non-diabetic mice. Fentanyl, at doses of 3 and 10 μg/kg, s.c., produced a dose-dependent increase in the tail-flick latencies in diabetic mice. While fentanyl (3 μg/kg, s.c.) did not produce a significant inhibition of the tail-flick response in non-diabetic mice, it significantly prolonged the tail-flick latency in diabetic mice to the same level as the baseline latency in non-diabetic mice. Although pretreatment with naloxone (3mg/kg, s.c.) completely antagonized fentanyl-induced antinociception in non-diabetic mice, it had no effect on the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl in diabetic mice. Pretreatment with either of the voltage-gated sodium channel openers fenvarelarte and veratridine practically abolished the antinociceptive effects of fentanyl in diabetic mice. However, neither fenvarelate nor veratridine affected the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl in non-diabetic mice. These results suggest that the anti-hyperalgesic effect of fentanyl is mediated through the blockade of sodium channels in diabetic mice, whereas opioid receptors mediate the antinociceptive effect of fentanyl in non-diabetic mice.","Tanaka, Ken-ichiro; Nakanishi, Yuki; Sekino, Shyota; Ikegami, Megumi; Ikeda, Hiroko; Kamei, Junzo",European journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.03.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704555/,386

Since the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol is released during stress situations, the present study was conducted to investigate the influence of serum cortisol (SC) on cardiac and pulmonary parameters in patients after aSAH within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 104 patients with aSAH admitted to our emergency department between January 2008 and April 2017. Blood samples were taken to determine SC and TNI. Demographics, initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) score, and Fisher grade were evaluated retrospectively. Mean norepinephrine application rate (NAR) in µg/kg/min and mean inspiratory oxygen fraction (OF) within the first 24 hours were defined as cardiopulmonary parameters. RESULTS: An elevated SC value was found in 44 (42%) patients, and 27 (26%) patients showed an increased TNI value. In patients with initially increased SC value, a significant higher NAR ( P = .04) was needed. Furthermore, patients with initially elevated TNI value had a lower GCS score ( P = .0013) and a higher WFNS score ( P = .003) on admission and required a higher NAR ( P = .02) as well as OF ( P = .0008) within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, initially elevated SC values were associated with a higher need of NAR within the first 24 hours of ICU treatment after aSAH. Moreover, patients with initially elevated TNI values required an increased NAR and a higher OF so that these biomarkers could be useful to improve ICU treatment.","Bender, Michael; Stein, M; Uhl, E; Reinges, M H T",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066619837910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30913956/,386

This study explores the impact of political distrust on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. The study utilised qualitative dominant mixed methods approach comprising telephone interviews and a survey of 120 educated Nigerians purposively selected from four COVID-19 most affected states including Lagos, Oyo, Kano and Rivers as well as the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The study also relied on secondary data on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria sourced from Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control from 27 February to 31st August 2020. The study found that political corruption motivates large-scale political distrust. This undermines public compliance to government protocols, limits the outcomes of government responses to COVID-19 and facilitates the spread of the virus in Nigeria. The paper concludes that improving government accountability in the public sector management is relevant for building public trust, promoting citizens' compliance to COVID-19 safety measure and mitigating the spread of the pandemic in Nigeria and beyond.","Ezeibe, Christian C; Ilo, Chukwudi; Ezeibe, Ezinwanne N; Oguonu, Chika N; Nwankwo, Nnamdi A; Ajaero, Chukwuedozie K; Oasadebe, Nnabuike",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1828987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33019916/,386

Methods A systematic review was undertaken guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 checklist. Medline OVID, PsycINFO, Embase, EconLit and Scopus were searched to identify articles published from 1946 to December 2014. Information on publication year, state(s) involved, type of data linkage, disease area and purpose was extracted. Results The search identified 3314 articles, of which 606 were included; these generated 629 records of hospital data linkage use across all Australian states and territories. The major contributions were from Western Australia (WA; 51%) and New South Wales (NSW; 32%) with the remaining states and territories having significantly fewer publications (total contribution only 17%). WA's contribution resulted from a steady increase from the late 1990s, whereas NSW's contribution is mostly from a rapid increase from 2010. Current data linkage is primarily used in epidemiological research (73%). Conclusion More than 80% of publications were from WA and NSW, whereas other states significantly lag behind. The observable growth in these two states clearly demonstrates the underutilised opportunities for data linkage to add value in health services research in the other states. What is known about the topic? Linking administrative hospital data to other data has the potential to be a cost-effective method to significantly improve health policy. Over the past two decades, Australia has made significant investments in improving its data linkage capabilities. However, several articles have highlighted the many barriers involved in using linked hospital data. What does this paper add? This paper quantitatively evaluates the performance across all Australian states in terms of the use of their administrative hospital data for research purposes. The performance of states varies considerably, with WA and NSW the clear stand-out performers and limited outputs currently seen for the other Australian states and territories. What are the implications for practitioners? Given the significant investments made into data linkage, it is important to continue to evaluate and monitor the performance of the states in terms of translating this investment into outputs. Where the outputs do not match the investment, it is important to identify and overcome those barriers limiting the gains from this investment. More generally, there is a need to think about how we improve the effective and efficient use of data linkage investments in Australia.","Tew, Michelle; Dalziel, Kim M; Petrie, Dennis J; Clarke, Philip M",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,https://doi.org/10.1071/ah16034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27444270/,386

Visual impairment could lead to psychosis or the converse, or they may share underlying pathology or risk factors. In the first evidence synthesis in this area for over 25 years, we collated studies measuring the association between visual acuity impairment and psychosis. METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases for studies published from 1992 to 2020, using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias. We narratively synthesized findings, and meta-analysed sufficiently homogenous results. RESULTS We included 40 papers which reported on 31 studies. Evidence from seven cohort studies was inconsistent, which precluded meta-analysis of this study design. These contradictory results also made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding a temporal association. We found evidence for an association from eight cross-sectional studies treating visual acuity impairment as the exposure and psychosis as the outcome [pooled Odds Ratio (OR) =1.76, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.34 - 2.31], and four with the reverse exposure and outcome (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.17 - 2.92). Seven case control studies with mixed findings were found, but only two primarily addressed our research question, and these findings were mixed. CONCLUSIONS Although evidence supports a cross-sectional association between visual acuity impairment and psychosis, further research is needed to clarify the temporal direction, given the mixed findings in cohort studies. Understanding the association may give insights into prevention strategies for people at risk of visual acuity impairment and psychosis.","Shoham, Natalie; Eskinazi, Michelle; Hayes, Joseph F; Lewis, Gemma; Theodorsson, Magnus; Cooper, Claudia",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028803/,386
147460,2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Patients With Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.,2017,"From the beginning of 2020, the alarming news from Italy and the first known cases arrived in Greece, along with travelers from the Holy Land. Spain, France and all other countries followed. From the first week of March, restrictive measures began in Greece and then confinement in order to limit the spread of the pandemic and not drown the National Health System by serious cases. The policy of restrictive measures to stop the pandemic was the internationally accepted response1 and the generalized adherence proved effective, despite the shock and the various reactions from the unprecedented, generalized state of restriction, different scale from epidemics of other times.2-4 In other countries, the loose restrictive measures have cost thousands of deaths. The general restrictive measures, however, have serious consequences for people's mental equilibrium, economy and employment, and for this reason they can only be of limited duration.5 The gradual return to normal life rhythms began gradually from May. But the test of the holiday time and the gradual opening of the tourist season, that is, the open communication of moving populations with limited, random checks for the virus and only local restrictions of the gathering of citizens. We are experiencing now the gradual and severe increase in cases, with an uncertain spreading, with asymptomatic and younger in age likely playing a central role in the spread of the virus, while the fear of a potential large increase in serious cases remains. At the time of this writing, the only means of coping is to maintain and locally strengthen the protective measures, while we gradually realize that these measures came to stay for many more months.6,7 A major problem is that the initial small number of cases favored the underestimation of risk by part of the population, and the serious consequences on people's jobs and lives, along with the deregulation of employment and social security relations legislated in recent months, have provided substantial material to conspiracy theories. We carefully monitor the research on the epidemiological behavior of covid-19 and the clinical data, the discussion on the drugs that make the symptoms milder, the effect of the virus on the CNS and the expected vaccine or vaccines. Our role from the beginning concerned the enormous psychological burden of a global health crisis, with serious consequences on people's working and social lives and equally avoiding the deregulation of the management of our patients and of the units that provide it. At the time of confinement, the telephone contact, familiar to all generations, offered valuable information and support, the lines 10306 and 1110, as well as many local or voluntary help-lines. Telepsychiatry was used more widely - being also an initiative of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association - and seems to have entered impetuously in our work, as well as in education. Its central or complementary role and its safe use are issues that are widely discussed at the moment.8 Protection measures against the virus seriously affect the normal functioning of health and mental health services. The solution should be sought in the urgent operational upgrade, the very necessary reinforcement of the staff and its effective protection from the virus and stress from exposure to danger, which has emerged as important factors for the normal operation of the mental health units.9 The use of telepsychiatry has solved a number of operational problems, but in many cases, it remains complementary, as it cannot replace physical presence in more specific care operations. The need not only to normalize, but to improve the follow up of our patients, the need to strengthen the units that provide basic, community mental health services, is shown by the increase in cases of involuntary hospitalization in the psychiatric hospitals of Athens and Thessaloniki during the last two months. A health crisis that affects almost the entire planet and the working and social life of most is a major social and political problem that concerns all of us,10 while mental health professionals are called to offer their scientific tools for people to face a multifaceted threat and in particular to claim and ensure the continuation of the treatment of our patients and the normal operation of our units.","Ploumpidis, D",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2020.313.197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33099460/,386

147665,The Evolution of Prenatal Care Delivery Guidelines in the United States.,2020-12-11,"The pharmaceutical approach to skin disease has been hugely successful, but despite effective drugs being available and used, there are still vast numbers of people who continue to have some level of persisting skin disease and continue to experience quality of life (QoL) impairment. So the question that needs to be answered, while we await further advances in our drug-based armamentarium, is how can we improve patients' QoL, beyond drugs? A working group was formed from members of the EADV Task Force on QoL and Patient Oriented Outcomes. Participants were asked to suggest all the ways in which they considered patients' QoL may be improved beyond medicines. Four groups of management approaches that may improve QoL in dermatology were identified: interventions within the dermatology service (hospitalization, multidisciplinary teams, patch testing and establishing relevant allergens and education), external services (corrective make-up, climatotherapy and balneotherapy), psychological (psychological intervention, cognitive therapy, hypnosis), lifestyle (lifestyle behavioural changes, religion and spirituality and music). The ultimate aim of therapy is to eradicate a disease in an individual and return the person's life to normal. But until the day comes when this has been achieved for every skin disease and for every patient there will be a need to support and assist many patients in additional non-pharmaceutical ways. These 'adjuvant' approaches receive too little attention while dermatologists and researchers strive for better pharmacological therapy. The different ways in which patients may benefit have been reviewed in our paper, but the reality is that most have a very poor evidence base. The research challenges that we have to meet are to identify those approaches that might be of value and to provide evidence for their optimal use. In the meantime, clinicians should consider the use of these approaches where QoL remains impaired despite optimal use of standard therapy.","Finlay, A Y; Chernyshov, P V; Tomas Aragones, L; Bewley, A; Svensson, A; Manolache, L; Marron, S; Suru, A; Sampogna, F; Salek, M S; Poot, F",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.16914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33094518/,386

We propose the use of a socially assistive robot with arms, a torso, and a face to play games with and guide patients, coupled with a telepresence platform, to maintain the patient-clinician interaction, and a computer vision system, to aid in automated objective assessments, as a tool for achieving more effective telerehab. In this paper, we outline the design of such a system, Lil'Flo, and present a uniquely large perceived usefulness evaluation of the Lil'Flo platform with 351 practicing therapists in the United States. We analyzed responses to the question of general interest and 5 questions on Lil'Flo's perceived usefulness. Therapists believe that Lil'Flo would significantly improve communication, motivation, and compliance during telerehab interactions when compared to traditional telepresence. 27% of therapists reported that they were interested in using Lil'Flo. Therapists interested in using Lil'Flo perceived it as having significantly higher usefulness across all measured dimensions than those who were not interested in using it.","Sobrepera, Michael J; Lee, Vera G; Garg, Suveer; Mendonca, Rochelle; Johnson, Michelle J",IEEE robotics and automation letters,https://doi.org/10.1109/lra.2021.3062349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748417/,386
148375,The impact of cholecalciferol on markers of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients: A randomized placebo controlled study.,2021-02-08,"BACKGROUND Ambient PM1 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤1 μm) is an important contribution of PM2.5 mass. However, little is known worldwide regarding the PM1-associated health effects due to a wide lack of ground-based PM1 measurements from air monitoring stations. METHODS We collected daily records of hospital admission for respiratory diseases and station-based measurements of air pollution and weather conditions in Shenzhen, China, 2015-2016. Time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate hospitalization risks associated with short-term exposures to PM1 and PM2.5. RESULTS PM1 and PM2.5 showed significant adverse effects on respiratory disease hospitalizations, while no evident associations with PM1-2.5 were identified. Admission risks for total respiratory diseases were 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.14) and 1.06 (1.02 to 1.10), corresponding to per 10 μg/m3 rise in exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 at lag 0-2 days, respectively. Both PM1 and PM2.5 were strongly associated with increased admission for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, but exhibited no effects on asthma and upper respiratory tract infection. Largely comparable risk estimates were observed between male and female patients. Groups aged 0-14 years and 45-74 years were significantly affected by PM1- and PM2.5-associated risks. PM-hospitalization associations exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with significantly larger risks in cold season than those in warm season among some subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggested that PM1 rather than PM1-2.5 contributed to PM2.5-induced risks of hospitalization for respiratory diseases and effects of PM1 and PM2.5 mainly occurred in cold season.","Zhang, Yunquan; Ding, Zan; Xiang, Qianqian; Wang, Wei; Huang, Li; Mao, Feiyue",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31753527/,386

Cardiovascular manifestations are being increasingly recognised with the improved understanding of the disease. Acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy; heart failure and thromboembolic disease have all been described. The elderly and those with prior cardiac diseases are at an increased risk of mortality. Overlapping symptomatology, ability of drugs to cause QTc interval (start of Q wave to the end of T wave) prolongation on electrocardiogram and arrhythmias, potential drug interactions, the need to recognise patients requiring urgent definitive management and provide necessary bedside interventions without increasing the risk of nosocomial spread have made the management challenging. In the background of a pandemic, non-Covid-19 cardiac patients are affected by delayed treatment and nosocomial exposure. Triaging using telemedicine and artificial intelligence along with utilization of bedside rapid diagnostic tests to detect Covid-19 could prove helpful in this aspect.","Keri, Vishakh C; Hooda, Amit; Kodan, Parul; R L, Brunda; Jorwal, Pankaj; Wig, Naveet",Reviews in medical virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128859/,386

The 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios ranged between 0.11 and 0.21 with the earliest recorded 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios being the lowest, suggesting an influence of low atom ratio fallout from nuclear testing in Australia.

151313,Virtually all Complications of Active Infective Endocarditis Occurring in a Single Patient.,2020-09-26,"INTRODUCTION The fourth sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, COVID-19, emerged in late 2019, leading to the most devastating pandemic since the Spanish influenza (H1N1) of 1918, which seized 50 million lives worldwide (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html). Elected officials must make critical system-level decisions for stymieing the spread of the virus. Businesspersons must make personnel, financial, and operational decisions to minimize transmission while preserving their business's vitality. Members of the public must make personal decisions about personal protective equipment and changing social, recreational, occupational, and spiritual behavior to protect themselves and others. The scientific community can shift how they illustrate the virus's behavior to the public in an appropriate and understandable way so that the public can make informed decisions. This article suggests the use of a single-case design and logarithmic analyses to improve the current methodologies for COVID-19 analysis and illustration. METHOD The Standard Celeration Chart was used with Theil's incomplete regression and a 7-point change analysis; the authors demonstrate a suitable virus-tracking and mitigation methodology. RESULTS Analysis and data visualization are standardized, providing an accurate depiction of the virus's growth for public dissemination and decision-making. An analytic strategy is demonstrated for retrospectively detecting meaningful changes in viral growth or prospectively measuring such changes that coincide with known mitigation strategies. DISCUSSION The authors suggest improvements in bridging science to application by making COVID-19 informatics more meaningful and actionable by lawmakers, businesspersons, and the public. Limitations and future directions for COVID-19 informatics are discussed.

This single-centre observational study reports data from a UK renal transplant centre with regards to seroprevalence amongst staff members. Members of staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) with Abbott International assays. Electronic records were accessed for PCR RNA and antibody results, with data anonymised by hospital number. IgA antibodies were not tested due to test kit availability during this period. 200 members of staff (25% male, 75% female, mean age 45.3 ± 12.0 years) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with 24/200 (12.0%) positive. Most interestingly, 2/30 (6.6%) co-workers had positive nose/throat RNA PCR but negative antibody tests. This study demonstrates that frontline healthcare workers have a relatively low seroprevalence rate of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. To further evaluate this, larger patient populations, multicentre studies and different antibody assays are needed to better understand whether detection of antibodies is suggestive of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure.","Black, J T; Haroon, U; Barnes, S C; Mayaleh, S; Bagul, A",Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/tri.13791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320975/,386

METHODS Fifteen semistructured interviews with practicing primary care physicians and physicians-in-training from a Southern California academic health system and group-model health maintenance organization were conducted to assess physician perspectives regarding the benefits and challenges of telemedicine. RESULTS Physicians indicated that telemedicine improved patient access to care by providing greater convenience, although some expressed concern that certain groups of vulnerable patients were unable to navigate or did not possess the technology required to participate in telemedicine visits. Physicians noted that telemedicine visits offered more time for patient counseling, opportunities for better medication reconciliations, and the ability to see and evaluate patient home environments and connect with patient families. Challenges existed when visits required a physical examination. Physicians were very concerned about the loss of personal connections and touch, which they believed diminished expected rituals that typically strengthen physician-patient relationships. Physicians also observed that careful consideration to physician workflows may be needed to avoid physician burnout. CONCLUSIONS Physicians reported that telemedicine visits offer new opportunities to improve the quality of patient care but noted changes to their interactions with patients. Many of these changes are positive, but it remains to be seen whether others such as lack of physical examination and loss of physical presence and touch adversely influence provider-patient communication, patient willingness to disclose concerns that may affect their care, and, ultimately, patient health outcomes.","Gomez, Teresita; Anaya, Yohualli B; Shih, Kevin J; Tarn, Derjung M",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622820/,386

Our aim was to validate the BASIC classification system among the USA based endoscopy experts. METHODS Participants utilized a web-based interactive learning system where the group was asked to characterize polyps using the BASIC criteria: polyp surface (presence of mucus, regular/irregular and [pseudo]depressed), pit appearance (featureless, round/non-round with/without dark spots; homogeneous/heterogeneous distribution with/without focal loss), and vessels (present/absent, lacy, peri-cryptal, irregular). The final testing consisted of reviewing BLI images/videos to determine whether the criteria accurately predicted the histology results. Confidence in adenoma identification (rated '1' to '5'), agreement in polyp (adenoma vs non-adenoma) identification and characterization per BASIC criteria were derived. Strength of interobserver agreement with kappa(k) value was reported for adenoma identification. RESULTS Ten endoscopy experts from the USA identified conventional adenoma (vs non-adenoma) with 94.4% accuracy, 95.0% sensitivity, 93.8% specificity, 93.8% positive predictive value, and 94.9% negative predictive value using BASIC criteria. Overall strength of inter-observer agreement was high: kappa 0.89 [0.82-0.96]. Agreement for the individual criteria was as follows: surface mucus(93.8%), regularity(65.6%), type of pit(40.6%), pit-visibility(66.9%), pit-distribution(57%), vessel visibility(73%), and being lacy(46%) and peri-cryptal(61%). The confidence in diagnosis was rated at high >4 in 67% of the cases.

Rotavirus VP8 subunit is the major determinant of the viral infectivity and neutralization. Spike glycoprotein of coronavirus is responsible for induction of neutralizing antibody response. METHODS In the present study, several prediction programs were used to predict B and T-cells epitopes, secondary and tertiary structures, antigenicity ability and enzymatic degradation sites. Finally, a chimeric antigen was designed using computational techniques. The chimeric VP8-S2 antigen was constructed. It was cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+) expression vector. The recombinant pET32a(+)-VP8-S2 vector was transferred into E.oli BL21CodonPlus (DE3) as expression host. The recombinant VP8-S2 protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography column. RESULTS The results of colony PCR, enzyme digestion and sequencing showed that the VP8-S2 chimeric antigen has been successfully cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+).The results showed that E.coli was able to express VP8-S2 protein appropriately. This protein was expressed by induction of IPTG at concentration of 1mM and it was confirmed by Ni-NTA column, dot-blotting analysis and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. CONCLUSION The results of this study showed that E.coli can be used as an appropriate host to produce the recombinant VP8-S2 protein. This recombinant protein may be suitable to investigate to produce immunoglobulin, recombinant vaccine and diagnostic kit in future studies after it passes biological activity tests in vivo in animal model and or other suitable procedure.","Nasiri, Khadijeh; Nassiri, Mohammadreza; Tahmoorespur, Mojtaba; Haghparast, Alireza; Zibaee, Saeed",Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,https://doi.org/10.15171/apb.2016.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123423/,386
157463,Prognostic capabilities of coronary computed tomographic angiography before non-cardiac surgery: prospective cohort study.,2015,"Radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFA) is widely used for local solitary liver tumor control. However, the benefit of RFA for colorectal cancer with liver metastases, which is refractory to chemotherapy, remains unknown.We retrospectively enrolled 70 consecutive colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, who had synchronous liver metastases, who were refractory to chemotherapy, and whose life expectancy was >6 months, into this study to investigate the outcomes of RFA and associated prognostic factors. RFA was introduced to all of these patients during the enrollment. The time interval from RFA to recurrence of liver metastases and overall survival was recorded. Age, sex, carcinoembryonic antigen level, primary tumor location, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, and the size and number of metastatic liver lesions were recorded. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the prognostic significance.Thirty-nine patients accepted RFA during chemotherapy, whereas 31 chose to receive chemotherapy alone. Patients with ≤5 and >5 liver metastases had median survival durations of 28 and 17 months, respectively (P = 0.018). The dominant liver tumor size (<5 vs ≥5 cm) was significantly associated with median survival (30 vs 17 months, respectively; P = 0.038), as was the carcinoembryonic antigen level (35 vs 16 months for ≤200 vs >200 ng/mL respectively; P = 0.029). Besides, radiofrequency thermal ablation plus chemotherapy was associated with a better median overall survival than chemotherapy alone (29 vs 12 months, respectively; P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, only radiofrequency thermal ablation treatment and number of liver tumors were significant prognostic factors for survival. Our result further revealed that patients treated with radiofrequency thermal ablation had longer progression-free intervals than those treated with chemotherapy alone (18 vs 9 months, respectively; P = 0.001). Hence, radiofrequency thermal ablation is a safe and effective adjunct treatment to chemotherapy.","Yang, Po-Chih; Lin, Been-Ren; Chen, Yi-Chang; Lin, Yu-Lin; Lai, Hong-Shiee; Huang, Kai-Wen; Liang, Jin-Tung",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000003338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27057913/,386

158056,Use of Saliva Swab for Detection of Influenza Virus in Patients Admitted to an Emergency Department.,2021-08-25,"Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) represent a promising class of nanomaterials for lasing applications. Currently, one of the key challenges facing the development of high-performance NC optical gain media lies in enhancing the lifetime of biexciton populations. This usually requires the employment of charge-delocalizing particle architectures, such as core/shell NCs, nanorods, and nanoplatelets. Here, we report on a two-dimensional nanoshell quantum dot (QD) morphology that enables a strong delocalization of photoinduced charges, leading to enhanced biexciton lifetimes and low lasing thresholds. A unique combination of a large exciton volume and a smoothed potential gradient across interfaces of the reported CdSbulk/CdSe/CdSshell (core/shell/shell) nanoshell QDs results in strong suppression of Auger processes, which was manifested in this work though the observation of stable amplified stimulated emission (ASE) at low pump fluences. An extensive charge delocalization in nanoshell QDs was confirmed by transient absorption measurements, showing that the presence of a bulk-size core in CdSbulk/CdSe/CdSshell QDs reduces exciton-exciton interactions. Overall, present findings demonstrate unique advantages of the nanoshell QD architecture as a promising optical gain medium in solid-state lighting and lasing applications.","Porotnikov, Dmitry; Diroll, Benjamin T; Harankahage, Dulanjan; Obloy, Laura; Yang, Mingrui; Cassidy, James; Ellison, Cole; Miller, Emily; Rogers, Spencer; Tarnovsky, Alexander N; Schaller, Richard D; Zamkov, Mikhail",Nanoscale,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0nr03582c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797122/,386
158141,Ischemia-modified albumin and total antioxidant status in patients with slow coronary flow: a pilot observational study.,2011,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS Investigations for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) include flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and angiography. All may be used to direct endoscopic, radiological or surgical treatment, although their optimal use is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic and therapeutic yields of endoscopy, CTA, and angiography for managing LGIB, and their influence on rebleeding, transfusion, and hospital stay. PATIENTS AND METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL was undertaken to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies of intervention (NRSIs) published between 2000 and 12 November 2015 in patients hospitalized with LGIB. Separate meta-analyses were conducted, presented as pooled odds (ORs) or risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Two RCTs and 13 NRSIs were included, none of which examined flexible sigmoidoscopy, or compared endotherapy with embolization, or investigated the timing of CTA or angiography. Two NRSIs (57 - 223 participants) comparing colonoscopy and CTA were of insufficient quality for synthesis but showed no difference in diagnostic yields between the two interventions. One RCT and 4 NRSIs (779 participants) compared early colonoscopy (< 24 hours) with colonoscopy performed later; meta-analysis of the NRSIs demonstrated higher diagnostic and therapeutic yields with early colonoscopy (OR 1.86, 95 %CI 1.12 to 2.86, P = 0.004 and OR 3.08, 95 %CI 1.93 to 4.90, P < 0.001, respectively) and reduced length of stay (mean difference 2.64 days, 95 %CI 1.54 to 3.73), but no difference in transfusion or rebleeding. CONCLUSIONS In LGIB there is a paucity of high-quality evidence, although the limited studies on the timing of colonoscopy suggest increased rates of diagnosis and therapy with early colonoscopy.","Oakland, Kathryn; Isherwood, Jennifer; Lahiff, Conor; Goldsmith, Petra; Desborough, Michael; Colman, Katherine S; Guy, Richard; Uberoi, Raman; Murphy, Michael F; East, James E; Hopewell, Sally; Jairath, Vipul",Endoscopy international open,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-117958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28975147/,386

The PCRs, or reverse transcriptase-PCRs, may be general, designed to detect all or most variants of a pathogen, or to be serotype, genotype or pathotype specific. Progress is being made with respect to making nucleic acid approaches more suitable for use in diagnostic laboratories. Robotic workstations are now available for extraction of nucleic acid from many samples in a short time, for routine diagnosis. Following general PCR, the DNA products are commonly analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping (restriction fragment length polymorphism), using a small number of restriction endonucleases, based on a large body of sequence data. Increasingly, however, nucleotide sequencing is being used to analyze the DNA product, in part due to the expanding use of non-radioactive sequencing methods that are safe and enable high throughout. In this review, I highlight some recent developments with many avian viruses: Newcastle disease virus; circoviruses in canary and pigeon; infectious bursal disease virus (Gumboro disease virus); avian adenoviruses, including Angara disease/infectious hydropericardium virus, haemorrhagic enteritis virus of turkeys, and egg drop syndrome virus; avian herpesviruses, including infectious laryngotracheitis virus, duck plague virus, psittacine herpesvirus (Pacheco's parrot disease virus), Marek's disease virus and herpesvirus of turkeys; avian leukosis virus (associated with lymphoid leukosis or myeloid leukosis, and egg transmission); avian pneumoviruses (turkey rhinotracheitis virus); avian coronaviruses, including infectious bronchitis virus, turkey coronavirus and pheasant coronavirus; astrovirus, in the context of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome, and avian nephritis virus; and avian encephalomyelitis virus, a picornavirus related to hepatitis A virus.","Cavanagh, D",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450120092071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19184952/,386

ISKNV is one of the major agents that cause mortality and economic losses to the freshwater fish culture industry in Asian countries, particularly for mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi). In the present study, we report that the interaction of mandarin fish caveolin 1 (mCav-1) with the ISKNV major capsid protein (MCP) was detected by using a virus overlay assay and confirmed by pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation. This interaction was independent of the classic caveolin 1 scaffolding domain (CSD), which is responsible for interacting with several signaling proteins and receptors. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that ISKNV MCP colocalized with mCav-1 in the perinuclear region of virus-infected mandarin fish fry (MFF-1) cells, which appeared as soon as 4 h postinfection. Subcellular fractionation analysis showed that ISKNV MCP was associated with caveolae in the early stages of viral infection. RNA interference silencing of mCav-1 did not change virus-cell binding but efficiently inhibited the entry of virions into the cell. Taken together, these results suggested that mCav-1 plays an important role in the early stages of ISKNV infection.","Jia, Kun-Tong; Wu, Yan-Yan; Liu, Zhao-Yu; Mi, Shu; Zheng, Yi-Wen; He, Jian; Weng, Shao-Ping; Li, Shengwen Calvin; He, Jian-Guo; Guo, Chang-Jun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00552-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23283951/,386

161123,Recent Evidence Regarding the Association Between Migraine and Suicidal Behaviors: A Systematic Review.,2020,"PURPOSE Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a rare disorder resulting in absent puberty and infertility. The genetic architecture is complex with multiple loci involved, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. The majority of cases are sporadic, consistent with a disease affecting fertility. The current study aims to investigate mosaicism as a genetic mechanism for CHH, focusing on de novo rare variants in CHH genes. METHODS We evaluated 60 trios for de novo rare sequencing variants (RSV) in known CHH genes using exome sequencing. Potential mosaicism was suspected among RSVs with altered allelic ratios and confirmed using customized ultradeep sequencing (UDS) in multiple tissues. RESULTS Among the 60 trios, 10 probands harbored de novo pathogenic variants in CHH genes. Custom UDS demonstrated that three of these de novo variants were in fact postzygotic mosaicism-two in FGFR1 (p.Leu630Pro and p.Gly348Arg), and one in CHD7 (p.Arg2428*). Statistically significant variation across multiple tissues (DNA from blood, buccal, hair follicle, urine) confirmed their mosaic nature. CONCLUSIONS We identified a significant number of de novo pathogenic variants in CHH of which a notable number (3/10) exhibited mosaicism. This report of postzygotic mosaicism in CHH patients provides valuable information for accurate genetic counseling.","Acierno, James S; Xu, Cheng; Papadakis, Georgios E; Niederländer, Nicolas J; Rademaker, Jesse D; Meylan, Jenny; Messina, Andrea; Kolesinska, Zofia; Quinton, Richard; Lang-Muritano, Mariarosaria; Bartholdi, Deborah; Halperin, Irene; De Geyter, Christian; Bouligand, Jérôme; Bartoloni, Lucia; Young, Jacques; Santoni, Federico A; Pitteloud, Nelly",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-020-0896-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724172/,386
161670,An Update on the Precious Metals.,2020-10-30,"This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of two-lung (TL) ventilation with low tidal volume anaesthesia compared with one-lung (OL) ventilation for needlescopic bleb resection. Patients with spontaneous pneumothorax that underwent bleb resection with a 2-mm thoracoscope were enrolled. During the operation, the tidal volume was set at 4.0 mL·kg⁻¹ in the TL group and 8.0 mL·kg⁻¹ in the OL group; the respiration rate was set at 23 and 12 breaths·min⁻¹, respectively, at the same inspiratory oxygen fraction (50%). A total of 108 patients (55 patients in the TL group and 53 in the OL group) were included in this study. Airway pressure was significantly lower in the TL group (mean ± sd 8.0 ± 3.3 versus 24.0 ± 3.9 mmHg in the OL group; p<0.001). The time from endotracheal intubation to the incision was 17.1 ± 4.0 min in the TL group and 35.3 ± 7.6 min in the OL group, which was significantly different (p<0.001). However, the operation time was not different in comparisons between the two groups. Therefore, the total anaesthesia time was significantly longer in the OL group (77.9 ± 21.6 versus 64.9 ± 14.7 min in the TL group; p = 0.002). Needlescopic bleb resection using TL ventilation anaesthesia with low tidal volume was technically feasible, cost-effective and time-saving compared with OL ventilation anaesthesia.","Kim, H; Kim, H K; Kang, D-Y; Lee, D-K; Choi, Y H; Lim, S H",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00056810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20693245/,386

We show that employee retention positively affects the likelihood of a return to profitability in firms with family CEOs, who are typically averse to employee dismissals for reasons mainly related to preserving socioemotional wealth. This effect is more pronounced for firms with transitory (i.e., less severe) losses. Further analysis suggests that productivity improvement following employee retention is the main economic channel of our results. A lack of socioemotional wealth also helps explain the negative association between employee retention and loss reversal in firms with outside CEOs. This pronounced duality of performance responses to employee retention supports prior findings on the importance of socioemotional wealth for family firms. In light of the crisis induced by COVID-19, our findings can provide insights that may enhance the efficacy of employee retention-related government schemes assisting firm recovery.","Kettunen, Jukka Martikainen Minna Voulgaris Georgios",Journal of Business Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.06.029,386

We estimated the accuracy of five risk-stratification tools recommended to predict severe illness and compare accuracy to existing clinical decision-making in a pre-hospital setting. Methods An observational cohort study using linked ambulance service data for patients attended by EMS crews in the Yorkshire and Humber region of England between 18th March 2020 and 29th June 2020 was conducted to assess performance of the PRIEST tool, NEWS2, the WHO algorithm, CRB-65 and PMEWS in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was death or need for organ support. Results Of 7549 patients in our cohort, 17.6% (95% CI:16.8% to 18.5%) experienced the primary outcome. The NEWS2, PMEWS, PRIEST tool and WHO algorithm identified patients at risk of adverse outcomes with a high sensitivity (>0.95) and specificity ranging from 0.3 (NEWS2) to 0.41 (PRIEST tool). The high sensitivity of NEWS2 and PMEWS was achieved by using lower thresholds than previously recommended. On index assessment, 65% of patients were transported to hospital and EMS decision to transfer patients achieved a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.85) and specificity of 0.39 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.40). # Conclusion Use of NEWS2, PMEWS, PRIEST tool and WHO algorithm could improve sensitivity of EMS triage of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Use of the PRIEST tool would improve sensitivity of triage without increasing the number of patients conveyed to hospital.","Marincowitz, C.; Sutton, L.; Stone, T.; Pilbery, R.; Campbell, R.; Thomas, B.; Turner, J.; Bath, P.; Bell, F.; Biggs, K.; Hasan, M.; Hopfgartner, F.; Mazumdar, S.; Petrie, J.; Goodacre, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.27.21261031v1?rss=1,386

The Observatory uses a single science operational mode capturing the x-ray data from the targets. This paper summarizes the IXPE Mission System: Observatory, Launch Segment and Ground System. The IXPE Observatory consists of spacecraft and payload modules built up in parallel to form the Observatory during system integration and test. The payload includes three x-ray telescopes each consisting of a polarization-sensitive, gas pixel x-ray detector, paired with its corresponding grazing incidence mirror module assembly (MMA), x-ray optics set. A deployable boom provides the correct separation (focal length) between the detector units (DU) and MMAs. These payload elements are supported by the IXPE spacecraft which is derived from the BCP-small spacecraft architecture. IXPE is launched to a circular LEO orbit at an altitude of 600 km and an inclination of -0.2 degrees by a Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The ground system consists of three major elements: the ground stations for data receipt and command upload to the Observatory;the Mission Operations Center (MOC) at University of Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (CU/LASP);and Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).

The interaction between microbes and hosts is a reciprocal relationship, which remains largely under-explored. Current computational resources lack manually and consistently curated data to connect metagenomic data to pathogenic microbes, microbial core genes, and disease phenotypes. We developed the MicroPhenoDB database by manually curating and consistently integrating microbe-disease association data. MicroPhenoDB provides 5677 non-redundant associations between 1781 microbes and 542 human disease phenotypes across more than 22 human body sites. MicroPhenoDB also provides 696,934 relationships between 27,277 unique clade-specific core genes and 685 microbes. Disease phenotypes are classified and described using the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO). A refined score model was developed to prioritize the associations based on evidential metrics. The sequence search option in MicroPhenoDB enables rapid identification of existing pathogenic microbes in samples without running the usual metagenomic data processing and assembly. MicroPhenoDB offers data browsing, searching and visualization through user-friendly web interfaces and web service application programming interfaces. MicroPhenoDB is the first database platform to detail the relationships between pathogenic microbes, core genes, and disease phenotypes.

Tests available to make an early and effective diagnosis of viral diseases are mainly based on PCR, the gold-standard method, or in the detection of virus antigens or antibodies against them. The need for rapid diagnostic tests postulates aptamers as an alternative to antibodies. Aptamers are short single-stranded nucleic acid molecules that are selected through an in vitro process called SELEX. They show numerous advantages over antibodies, such as greater stability and chemical synthesis that minimizes variability between batches. However, they still have some limitations, for example, their low commercial availability, or the absence of standardized protocols for their characterization. In this work, different approaches for selecting aptamers against viruses are presented, as well as their targets, sequences, and binding affinities. Recent efforts aimed to develop aptamer-based methods for viral detection, using optical, electrochemical and piezoelectric transduction, are critically reviewed.","Báscones, Elena Sánchez Parra Francisco Lobo-Castañón María Jesús",TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2021.116349,386

Patients recovering from COVID-19 ARDS had significantly higher mass, AGE-glycated HSA and higher mass IgG3 levels. This would indicate that increased levels and/or ratios of hyper-glycosylation (probably terminal sialic acid) IgG3 and AGE glycated HSA may be predisposition markers for development of ARDS as a result of COVID-19 infection.

We aimed to investigate the impact of infection on clinical severity of illness, including the need for oxygen or ventilation in a national cohort study. Methods In this prospective clinical cohort study, 1475 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from patients infected in Scotland, UK between the 1st November 2020 and 30th January 2021 and matched to clinical outcomes as the lineage became dominant in Scotland. We modelled the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease using a cumulative generalised linear mixed model employing a 4-point scale of maximum severity based on requirement of respiratory support at 28 days. We also estimated the growth rate of B.1.1.7-associated infections as it emerged in Scotland using a phylogenetic exponential growth rate population model. Results The B.1.1.7 lineage was responsible for a third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Scotland in association with a transmission rate 5-fold higher than the preceding second wave B.1.177 lineage. Of 1475 patients, 364 were infected with B.1.1.7, 1030 with B.1.177 and 81 with other lineages. Our analysis found a positive association between increased clinical severity and lineage (B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7; cumulative odds ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.93). Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) value (mean Ct change: -2.46, 95% CI: -4.22, -0.70).

This study aims to use the case of blockchain to evaluate whether the five characteristics determined from the literature to be required for effective digital risk resilience (specifically, integration, flexibility, reliability, relevance, and timeliness) have an impact on effectiveness in addressing the requirements of the European Union’s proposed Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). To achieve this, we developed a survey with 29 statements, which participants were required to answer using a five-point Likert scale. In total, 513 valid responses were received from participants. These were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results show that in the case of blockchain, reliability, flexibility, and relevance were found to significantly relate to its effectiveness in addressing DORA’s requirements, but relationships of effectiveness with integration and timeliness were found to be insignificant.

Our empirical evidence shows that such manipulations play an important role in students' attention towards virtual peer-learners, instructors, and lecture material. This research may contribute to understanding of how visual attention relates to social dynamics in the virtual classroom, including significant considerations for the design of virtual learning spaces.","Bozkir, E.; Stark, P.; Gao, H.; Hasenbein, L.; Hahn, J.

Several laboratories have started recently clinical trials to develop vaccines and drugs, however these solutions require more time to evaluate and validate them. As an alternative and in order to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our objective is to implement preventive and corrective actions to reduce the infectious/transmission risk of SARS-COV-2 during hospital retrocession, using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method. The criticality of each failure mode was assessed by calculating the criticality index (CI). The obtained data showed 12 fault modes with a total criticality index (CI) of 480, two acceptable risks, four significant risks and six critical risks. Ten risks were identified as priorities (CI &gt; 15): four related to patient reception, two related to personnel, two during dispensation, one related to the end of dispensation and the last related to traceability. These risks were corrected by improvement actions proposed by FMEA and then re-evaluated effectively. This study assessed the feasibility and relevance of the use ofFMEA in the hospital retrocession dispensing process related to the infectious/transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, FMEA seems to be an effective method to reduce the infectious/transmission risk of SARS-COV-2 during hospital retrocession.","Latt, E. E.

The economic improvement was driven by external sectors, but the pace of the recovery differed considerably across sectors. This Survey looks at the balance sheets of corporations and the banking sector in the midst of the pandemic. We find that the worsening of corporate balance sheets may require government intervention to prevent liquidity problems from turning into solvency problems. While the banks’ capital position remains adequate, the deterioration of loan quality, reflecting real sector conditions, is worse than it appears. Recent stress testing of the banking sector confirms the potential vulnerabilities in the sector.

This age-stratified, serological survey was aimed to measure the COVID-19 distribution and determinants in district Islamabad of Pakistan. Methodology: Three-stage cluster sampling, using population proportionate to size technique, starting with a random number was used. A structured, pretested questionnaire was used after taking informed written consent, to gather demographic, risk factor information. Results: Seroprevalence was found 16.5% (AR: 16.5%/100,000). The mean age was 35 (sd:16 Years). The majority were male (64%), self-employed (29%), and had primary level education (33%). The highest seroprevalence was found in the 21-30 years age group (24.8%) while the 41-50 years age group showed the highest attack rate (112.9/100,000 population). The proportion of the population tested that were asymptomatic was 69% (n=711) while the most frequently reported sign/symptom was cough (99%) followed by fever (20%). No known co-morbidity was reported in 86% (n=884) of respondents while hypertension remained the most reported condition (8%). High seroprevalence was observed in urban areas (12.3%) compared to rural union councils (6.4%). Visiting a house where COVID-19 case was isolated (OR 2, CI 1.38-2.84, P< 0.001), history of contact with a known case of COVID-19 (OR 1.42, CI 1.11-1.82, P=0.005), and attending a mass gathering (OR 1.21, CI: 1.02-1.42, p=0.02) were significant risk factors associated with contracting an infection. A Chi-Square test of independence showed significant protection while using regular hand hygiene practices (6.5; p<0.05) and regular usage of face masks (8.6; p<0.05). Conclusion: Seroprevalence gives a direct estimation of population groups exposed to the virus. A remarkable difference in prevalence is found in urban and rural areas, extreme age groups, and socioeconomic statuses, suggesting targeted public health interventions. Sero-studies are affordable counterparts of molecular testing where quick estimation, prevention effectiveness, and data-driven public health policies are priorities.","Baig, M. A.; Ansari, J.

175452,The Role of Tracheotomy in Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with Covid-19,2021,"Purpose: This paper adds to the growing body of research examining the impacts of COVID-19 physical distancing measures on the everyday lives of young people. It draws on theories of “digital intimacies” and “relationship maintenance” to argue that young people’s reflections on COVID-19, physical distancing and online relationships expose larger gaps in sex, relationships and health education pedagogies. Design/methodology/approach: Five semi-structured online focus groups were conducted with Canadian adolescents aged 16–19 probing their experiences of dating and platonic relationships during COVID-19. Narrative thematic analysis methods were used to develop themes outlining how physical distancing measures have affected young people’s relationship norms, expectations and values. Findings: COVID-19 physical distancing measures and school closures appeared to create the conditions for some young people to productively reflect on the labor involved in the maintenance of their relationships in relation to considerations of proximity, reciprocity and distance. This labor was particularly articulated by female participants, many of whom expressed that life disruptions caused by COVID-19 catalyzed learning about their own relationship needs, desires and boundaries. Research limitations/implications: Results from this research are not widely generalizable, as each participant had a unique experience with COVID-19 physical distancing measures, schooling and in-person contact. Due to anonymity measures implemented, participant narratives cannot be confidently associated with demographic surveys that hampered the ability to offer an intersectional analysis of participant experience. Originality/value: Discussions of relationship maintenance and digital intimacies elucidate the limitations of health education’s tendency to construct adolescent relationships as existing along binaries of “healthy” and “unhealthy.” Health education might benefit from more meaningful integration of these concepts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Goldstein, A.; Flicker, S.",Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1108/he-01-2021-0010,386

It is found that the physical structure of the waterways of Hongcun Village has been well preserved, but the water pollution caused by tourism, with a combination of changes of land use and demographic structure, has changed the functions and cultural meanings of waterways. Although there remains quite a daunting task towards sustainability in terms of technology, heritage protection, and desire for development, we claim the waterways environmental governance in which local governments play a crucial role in resilience strategies by controlling the sewage from homestays, restaurants, and pigment sewage from sketches. However, the ways in which landscape animates, including the daily lives, processual daily practices, and mundane activities of different social actors related to waterways, deserve further implementation to build the resilience of cultural landscape from the perspective of non-representational theory. This paper adds to a new narrative to the waterway landscape research by presenting a water utilization pattern that could profitably coexist with a specific environment in the Huizhou region in the agricultural society of ancient China and discussing how the non-representational theory contributes to analyzing and managing waterway landscapes in modern times. It also sheds light on the connection between cultural landscape and resilience.","Chen, Pinyu Zhao Yizheng Zuo Di Kong Xiang",Land,https://doi.org/10.3390/land10080795,386
177849,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on global contributions to the European heart failure congress: Do we need more diversity?,2021,"The key aim of this paper is to construct a modified version of the SEIQR essential disease dynamics model for the COVID-19 emergence. The modified SEIQR pandemic model takes a groundbreaking approach to evaluate and monitor the COVID-19 epidemic. The complex studies presented in this paper are based on real-world data from Saudi Arabia. A reproduction number and a systematic stability analysis are included in the new version of SEIQR model dynamics. Using the Jacobian linearization process, we can obtain the domain of the solution and the state of equilibrium based on the modified SEIQR model. The equilibrium and its importance have been identified, and the disease-free stability of the equilibrium has been investigated. The reproduction number was calculated using internal metrics, and the global stability of the current model's equilibrium was demonstrated using Lyapunov's stability theorem. To see how well the SEIQR proposed model went, it was compared to real COVID-19 spread data in Saudi Arabia. According to the results, the new SEIQR proposed model is a good match for researching the spread of epidemics like COVID-19. In the end, we presented an optimal protocol to prevent the dissemination of COVID-19. Staying at home and transporting sick people as far as possible to a safe region is the most effective strategy to prevent COVID-19 spread. It is critical to offer infected people safe and effective treatment, as well as antibiotics and nutrients to non-affected people. To detect confirmed infections, we must provide more effective and reliable diagnostic methods.

Even though with the spread of unprecedented pandemic of COVID 19, the industry of solar photovoltaic (PV) is surviving at a very promising rate compared to the oil industry. Malaysia has a high potential to be successful at harnessing solar energy as this country is located within the equatorial region. The government of Malaysia (GoM) introduced various policies, acts and incentives programs for the purpose of increasing this country’s potential to harness solar energy. Along with the efforts, goals and aims have also been set as a benchmark to measure Malaysia’s success in utilizing sunlight as an energy source. This study reviews the roadmap programs executed by GoM to elucidate the significant roles played in the development of solar PV starting from a few pilot projects in1980s until present. The roadmap focuses on incentive programs namely Feed-in Tariff (FiT), Net Energy Metering (NEM), Self-Consumption Scheme (SELCO), Large Solar Scale (LSS), Supply Agreement with Renewable Energy (SARE) and ‘Peer-to-Peer’ (P2P), which complement all the projects and solar PV applications in Malaysia. The contributing result of this roadmap is the highlights on the continuous solar PV programs stimulated by GoM, the identification and effort to improve the less performing GoM incentive programs combined with the positive responses from communities and industries, have laid a strong platform to forecast a promising future of solar PV industry in Malaysia. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Zainuddin, H.; Salikin, H.

Materials and Methods: A total of 100 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (49 males, 51 females;age range 19-88 years) were retrospectively collected. Firstly, computed tomography (CT) images were evaluated by two radiologists independently and blinded to clinical notes and laboratory and radiological reports and they gave their impressions independently according to four COVID-19 reporting systems, then all CTs were interpreted again by the two radiologists for extracting CT features at the same session by consensus. Results: Bilateral, lower lobe, peripheral, dorsal and multifocal lung involvements were predominantly seen, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were the most common CT imaging finding in the current study. Reporting systems showed fair to moderate agreements between senior and junior raters (0.246-0.490, p&lt;0.001). According to the assigned three-category coding system as similar to that of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Expert Consensus Statement on Reporting and other reporting systems and guidance, strength of inter-rater agreement values was increased (0.365-0.576, p&lt;0.001) and inter-system agreements were substantial to almost perfect in both raters.

180740,Migration and Outbreaks of Vaccine-Preventable Disease in Europe: A Systematic Review,2021-01-09,"Abstract Alumina as a substrate is being explored in the upcoming 5th generation radio-frequency micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) applications due to its superior electrical insulation, excellent wear resistance, and higher thermal conductivity. However, due to its brittle nature, its micromachining capabilities by the conventional contact-based processes has remained a challenge. This work reports the fabrication of deep micro-holes in hard-to-machine alumina substrates by the electrochemical discharge machining process. The effects of machining voltage and tool feed rate on the geometrical characteristics such as depth, overcut, sidewall profile of the micro-holes along with tool wear are reported. A high carbon steel needle having a tip size of 150 µm was used as a tool electrode, and 30wt% aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was used as an electrolyte. The experimental results reveal the optimal machining performance in terms of higher depth of micro-hole, lower overcut, and minimum tool consumption at a machining voltage of 50 V and a feed rate of 0.25 µm/s. A deep micro-holes (>300 µm) were achieved at a machining voltage of 55 V using a combined feed mechanism. The experimental results were compared to the numeric results obtained by using the finite-element method. The experimental results confirmed that machining of alumina is more difficult than glass-based materials and requires higher machining voltage; however, higher tool wear takes place at higher voltage, which in turn requires the usage of tool electrodes having a higher melting point. The research outcome of this work can be used in ceramic micromachining.","Sharma, Priyaranjan; Mishra, Dileep Kumar; Dixit, Pradeep",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314955; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314955,386
182293,"Incidence, risk factors and impact of seasonal influenza in pregnancy: A national cohort study",2020-07-27,"Infections caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens are increasingly resistant to first-line azole antifungal drugs. However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about the extent to which susceptible patients acquire infection from drug resistant genotypes in the environment. Here, we present a population genomic analysis of the mould Aspergillus fumigatus from across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. First, we show occurrences where azole resistant isolates of near identical genotypes were obtained from both environmental and clinical sources, indicating with high confidence the infection of patients with resistant isolates transmitted from the environment. Second, we find that the fungus is structured into two clades (‘A’ and ‘B’) with little interclade recombination and the majority of environmental azole resistance genetically clustered inside Clade A. Genome-scans show the impact of selective sweeps across multiple regions of the genome. These signatures of positive selection are seen in regions containing canonical genes encoding fungicide resistance in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, whilst other regions under selection have no defined function. Phenotyping identified genes in these regions that could act as modifiers of resistance showing the utility of reverse genetic approaches to dissect the complex genomic architecture of fungal drug resistance. Understanding the environmental drivers and genetic basis of evolving fungal drug resistance needs urgent attention, especially in light of increasing numbers of patients with severe viral respiratory tract infections who are susceptible to opportunistic fungal superinfections.","Rhodes, Johanna; Abdolrasouli, Alireza; Dunne, Katie; Sewell, Thomas R.; Zhang, Yuyi; Ballard, Eloise; Brackin, Amelie P.; van Rhijn, Norman; Tsitsopoulou, Alexandra; Posso, Raquel B.; Chotirmall, Sanjay H; McElvaney, Noel G; Murphy, Philip G; Talento, Alida Fe; Renwick, Julie; Dyer, Paul S.; Szekely, Adrien; Bromley, Michael J.; Johnson, Elizabeth M.; White, P.

In shelter environments one is unable to effectively physically distance, maintain hygiene, obtain a test, or isolate. As a result, unique strategies are required for this population to protect them and those who serve them. Recommendations are provided to reduce or prevent further negative consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic for people experiencing homelessness. These recommendations were informed by a systematic review of the literature, as well as a jurisdictional scan. Where evidence did not exist, expert consensus from key providers and those experiencing homelessness throughout Canada was included. These recommendations recognize the need for short-term interventions to mitigate the immediate risk to this community, including coordination of response, appropriate precautions and protective equipment, reducing congestion, cohorting, testing, case and contact management strategies, dealing with outbreaks, isolation centres, and immunization. Longer-term recommendations are also provided with a view to ending homelessness by addressing the root causes of homelessness and by the provision of adequate subsidized and supportive housing through a Housing First strategy. It is imperative that meaningful changes take place now in how we serve those experiencing homelessness and how we mitigate specific vulnerabilities. These recommendations call for intersectoral, collaborative engagement to work for solutions targeted towards protecting the most vulnerable within our community through both immediate actions and long-term planning to eliminate homelessness.","Baral, S.; Bond, A.; Boozary, A.; Bruketa, E.; Elmi, N.; Freiheit, D.; Ghosh, S.

Social networks provide a constantly updated pool of news to the end-users but the absence of systematic control and moderation of the posts easily leads to spread unverified news with an instrumental value and likely to be dangerous, which are referred to as rumours. To tackle this issue various systems for automatic rumour detection among conversations, i.e. an aggregated set of posts, have been recently presented in the literature. However, few efforts have been directed towards rumour detection at the level of single posts (micro-level), which is the challenging scenario that we tackle in this work. Moving at a finer scale is an urgent need since both rumour and non-rumour posts are included in the same conversation. Here the rumour detection issue is addressed presenting a novel feature selection approach, which characterizes the feature space aiming at minimizing samples in unreliable configurations. This approach is compared with other state-of-the-art methods using a pool of different learning algorithms on two health-related Twitter datasets, labelled at the micro-level. Our proposal yields promising results: it outperforms other feature selection approaches with a best accuracy of 96.8% and enhances the performance of our previous work up to 5%. These findings prove the potential of the feature selection method introduced, which gives access to samples distribution in the feature space, providing privileged information for the construction of the classifier decision boundaries. Nonetheless they also bring a step forward the micro-level rumour detection analysis.","Sicilia, Rosa Merone Mario Valenti Roberto Soda Paolo",Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2021.104389,386

We analyzed variables with Kaplan Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. RESULTS All-cause mortality was 8% at 30 days. Independent variables associated with higher risk of mortality were age over 50 years, a Barthel index score less than 90, altered mental status, the ratio of arterial oxygen saturation to the fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FIO2), abnormal lung sounds, platelet concentration less than 100 000/mm3, a C-reactive protein concentration of 5 mg/dL or higher, and a glomerular filtration rate less than 45 mL/min. Each independent predictor was assigned 1 point in the score except age, which was assigned 2 points. Risk was distributed in 3 levels: low risk (score of 4 points or less), intermediate risk (5 to 6 points), and high risk (7 points or above). Thirty-day risk of mortality was 1.7% for patients who scored in the low-risk category, 28.2% for patients with an intermediate risk score, and 67.3% for those with a high risk score. CONCLUSION This mortality risk stratification tool for patients with COVID-19 could be useful for managing the course of disease and assigning health care resources in the emergency department.","García-Martínez, Ana; López-Barbeito, Beatriz; Coll-Vinent, Blanca; Placer, Arrate; Font, Carme; Rosa Vargas, Carmen; Sánchez, Carolina; Piñango, Daniela; Gómez-Angelats, Elisenda; Curtelin, David; Salgado, Emilio; Aya, Francisco; Martínez-Nadal, Gemma; Alonso, José Ramón; García-Gozalbes, Julia; Fresco, Leticia; Galicia, Miguel; Perea, Milagrosa; Carbó, Miriam; Iniesta, Nerea; Escoda, Ona; Perelló, Rafael; Cuerpo, Sandra; Flores, Vanesa; Alemany, Xavier; Miró, Òscar; Ortega Romero, Mª Del Mar",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251140/,386

To assess progress toward the Healthy People objective and to examine characteristics of motor vehicle--related death rates, CDC analyzed data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) for the period 1999--2005. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that, during 1999--2005, although annual age-adjusted motor vehicle--related death rates overall were nearly unchanged (range: 15.2--15.7 per 100,000 population), substantial differences were observed by state, U.S. Census region, sex, race, and age group. Among states, the average annual death rate ranged from 7.9 per 100,000 population in Massachusetts to 31.9 in Mississippi. Among regions, the rate ranged from 9.8 per 100,000 population in the Northeast to 19.5 in the South.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the presence of protocols, management in the emergency department (ED) and the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds for severe COVID-19 patients attended in Spanish hospital EDs during the first peak of the 2020 pandemic. METHODS Questionnaire collecting data regarding ED care in March-April 2020 aimed at all Spanish public health care EDs. The respondents were the Chiefs of EDs. The variables of interest were: 1) Presence and of compliance with ED protocols for decision making and adequacy of therapeutic effort; 2) management of COVID-19 patients with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in the ED; and 3) ICU bed accessibility for ED patients. The results were compared based on the characteristics of the hospital, impact of the pandemic and autonomous community. A descriptive and inferential analysis of the variables studied was performed using the chi-square test and analysis of variance. RESULTS A total of 246 questionnaires (89%) were received. Protocols were available in 136 EDs (57.1%). Globally, the protocol was applied in >95% of the EDs, although this was less frequent (76%) in EDs with high impact of the pandemic. 53% of the EDs managed patients with severe COVID-19 with NIMV/HFNC in the ED itself, and 19.4% suffered from lack of ICU beds. The lack of ICU beds for severe COVID-19 patients in the ED significantly differed among periods, and more marked in hospitals with ICU and with high pandemic impact.

Dengue circulates as a number of quasispecies, which can be divided by serology into four groups or serotypes. An interesting feature of Dengue, recognized over five decades ago, is that most severe cases that show hemorrhagic fever are not suffering from a primary infection. Instead, they are reinfected with a virus of different serotype. This observation poses considerable problems in vaccine design, and it is therefore imperative to gain a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying this immunological enhancement of disease. In this study, we examined a T cell epitope restricted by HLA-A*24, a major MHC class I allele, in Southeast Asia in a cohort of children admitted to a hospital with acute Dengue infection. The cytokine profiles and the degranulation capacity of T cells generated to this epitope are defined and compared across different viral serotypes. Cross-reactive Dengue-specific T cells seem to show suboptimal degranulation but high cytokine production, which may contribute to the development of the vascular leak characteristic of Dengue hemorrhagic fever.","Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Duangchinda, Thaneeya; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Vasanawathana, Sirijit; Avirutnan, Panisadee; Jairungsri, Aroonroong; Khemnu, Nuanpan; Tangthawornchaikul, Nattaya; Chotiyarnwong, Pojchong; Sae-Jang, Kanokwan; Koch, Michael; Jones, Yvonne; McMichael, Andrew; Xu, Xiaoning; Malasit, Prida; Screaton, Gavin",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16517753/,386

The coalescent is used to model the genealogy that represents the sample ancestral relationships. The basic assumption is that coalescent events occur at a rate inversely proportional to the effective population size $N_{e}(t)$, a time-varying measure of genetic diversity. When the sampling process (collection of samples over time) depends on $N_{e}(t)$, the coalescent and the sampling processes can be jointly modeled to improve estimation of $N_{e}(t)$. Failing to do so can lead to bias due to model misspecification. However, the way that the sampling process depends on the effective population size may vary over time. We introduce an approach where the sampling process is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate equal to the product of $N_{e}(t)$ and a time-varying coefficient, making minimal assumptions on their functional shapes via Markov random field priors. We provide scalable algorithms for inference, show the model performance vis-a-vis alternative methods in a simulation study, and apply our model to SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties.

Purpose To determine the value of chest radiographic findings together with patient history and laboratory markers at admission to predict critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods In this retrospective study including patients from 7th March 2020 to 24th April 2020, a consecutive cohort of hospitalized patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from two large Dutch community hospitals was identified. After univariable analysis, a risk model to predict critical illness (i.e. death and/or ICU admission with invasive ventilation) was developed, using multivariable logistic regression including clinical, CXR and laboratory findings. Distribution and severity of lung involvement was visually assessed using an 8-point scale (chest radiography score). Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping. Performance is presented as an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Decision curve analysis was performed, and a risk calculator was derived. Results The cohort included 356 hospitalized patients (69 ±12 years, 237 male) of whom 168 (47%) developed critical illness. The final risk model's variables included gender, chronic obstructive lung disease, symptom duration, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein level, lactate dehydrogenase level, distribution of lung disease and chest radiography score at hospital presentation. The AUC of the model was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72-0.81, P < .001). A risk calculator was derived for individual risk assessment; Dutch COVID-19 risk model (see Appendix E2). At an example threshold of 0.70, 71 of 356 patients would be predicted to develop critical illness of which 59 (83%) would be true-positives. Conclusion A risk model based on chest radiographic and laboratory findings obtained at admission was predictive of critical illness in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

Valid measurement of this construct can better inform research, assessment, and intervention designed to promote well-being in this population. The present study aims to evaluate the validity of the Brief Sense of Community Scale (BSCS) among sexual minority individuals. The scale was administered to 219 LGB participants within a larger assessment of health needs in a southern lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) population. Validity evidence was evaluated using the Downing model. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed good fit for a second-order model, supporting internal structure validity. Acceptable to excellent internal validity was demonstrated. Correlational analyses revealed negative relations with loneliness, internalized homophobia, and poor mental health. This study provides evidence for the use of the BSCS in an LGB population and demonstrates the utility in measuring the sense of community in sexual minority individuals.","Griffin, James A; Eldridge-Smith, Elizabeth D; Kridel, Matthew M; Draheim, Amanda A; Stepleman, Lara M",,,386
202471,Heartbeat: empowering patients with digital home management,2020,"Background: We present the case of two brothers with identical mechanisms of injury presenting simultaneously, one with SARS-Cov-2 respiratory failure and the other in hemorrhagic shock. Summary: Healthcare globally and in the United States met novel challenges during the unprecedented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) health crisis. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on hospital and health care delivery systems has been widely reported. Elective surgical procedures were suspended; however, trauma and acute care services remained active and faced unique challenges during this pandemic. Trauma patients by their nature of injury require rapid assessment and treatment to include invasive emergency operations. Not only do trauma centers have to adapt to limited resources and new procedures limiting exposure, they are also met with the confounding issue of trauma patients concomitantly presenting with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory illness. Conclusion: Trauma care providers must now contend with SARS-CoV-2 on the differential for patients presenting with trauma. This is demonstrated by our case of two brothers with identical mechanisms of injury presenting simultaneously, one in shock from respiratory failure and the other hemorrhagic.","Rawlinson, Dustin; Vega, Jorge; Lottenberg, Lawrence; Borrego, Robert; Rueda, Mario; Azar, Faris",Trauma Case Rep,,386

METHODS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19, diagnosed in a university hospital referral laboratory in northern India, were evaluated for clinical manifestations including GI symptoms, their predictors, and the relationship between the presence of these symptoms, disease severity, and outcome on univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of 16,317 subjects tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in their oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs during April-May 2020, 252 (1.5%) were positive. Of them, 208 (82.5%) were asymptomatic; of the 44 symptomatic patients, 18 (40.9%) had non-GI symptoms, 15 (34.1%) had a combination of GI and non-GI symptoms, and 11 (25.0%) had GI symptoms only. Thirty-three had mild-to-moderate disease, 8 severe, and 5 critical. Five patients (1.98%) died. On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with the presence of GI symptoms included the absence of contact history and presence of non-GI symptoms and comorbid illnesses. Patients with GI synptoms more often had severe, critical illness and fatal outcome than those without GI symptoms. DISCUSSION: Eighty-two percent of patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic, and 10.3% had GI symptoms; severe and fatal disease occurred only in 5% and 2%, respectively. The presence of GI symptoms was associated with a severe illness and fatal outcome on multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of GI symptoms included the absence of contact history, presence of non-GI symptoms, and comorbid illnesses.(Equation is included in full-text article.).","Ghoshal, Uday C; Ghoshal, Ujjala; Mathur, Akash; Singh, Ratender K; Nath, Alok; Garg, Atul; Singh, Dharamveer; Singh, Sanjay; Singh, Jasmeet; Pandey, Ankita; Rai, Sushmita; Vasanth, Shruthi; Dhiman, Radha Krishan",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,,386

204007,Use of Remdesivir in the Management of COVID-19: A Systematic Review on Current Evidences,2020,"Nowadays, humanity is facing one of the most dangerous pandemics known as COVID-19. Due to its high inter-person contagiousness, COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the world. Positive patients are often suffering from different symptoms that can vary from mild to severe including cough, fever, sore throat, and body aches. In more dire cases, infected patients can experience severe symptoms that can cause breathing difficulties which lead to stern organ failure and die. The medical corps all over the world are overloaded because of the exponentially myriad number of contagions. Therefore, screening for the disease becomes overwrought with the limited tools of test. Additionally, test results may take a long time to acquire, leaving behind a higher potential for the prevalence of the virus among other individuals by the patients. To reduce the chances of infection, we suggest a prediction model that distinguishes the infected COVID-19 cases based on clinical symptoms and features. This model can be helpful for citizens to catch their infection without the need for visiting the hospital. Also, it helps the medical staff in triaging patients in case of a deficiency of medical amenities. In this paper, we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to select the interesting features by finding the best trade-offs between two conflicting objectives: minimizing the number of features and maximizing the weights of selected features. Then, a classification phase is conducted using an AdaBoost classifier. The proposed model is evaluated using two different datasets. To maximize results, we performed a natural selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier using the genetic algorithm. The obtained results prove the efficiency of NSGA-II as a feature selection algorithm combined with AdaBoost classifier. It exhibits higher classification results that outperformed the existing methods.","Soui, Makram; Mansouri, Nesrine; Alhamad, Raed; Kessentini, Marouane; Ghedira, Khaled",Nonlinear Dyn,,386

Despite this, they had still to go to hospital to receive chemotherapy during lockdown. In this context, we have evaluated the psychological status of onco-hematological outpatients receiving infusion and not deferrable anti-neoplastic treatment for lymphoproliferative neoplasms, with the aim of both measuring the levels of post-traumatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic and also of investigating the perception of risk of potential nosocomial infection. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to all patients. Moreover, patients were investigated about their worries regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their lives as onco-hematologic patients. Since the 2nd to the 29th April 2020 (during the first phase of the lockdown period in Italy), 77 outpatients were prospectively evaluated. They were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/Small lymphocytic lymphoma. The mean age was 56.6 (range 22–85). We found that 36% of patients had anxiety (HADS-A), 31% depression (HADS-D), and 43% were above the cut-off for the HADS-General Scale; 36% fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Women and younger patients were found to be more vulnerable to anxiety and PTSD. The study firstly analyzes the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frail population of patients affected by lymphoproliferative neoplasms, to underly the importance of screening patients for emotional and distress conditions and then offering them psychological support.","Romito, Francesca; Dellino, Miriam; Loseto, Giacomo; Opinto, Giuseppina; Silvestris, Erica; Cormio, Claudia; Guarini, Attilio; Minoia, Carla",Front.

However, reported VTE-rates differ substantially. Objectives: We aimed at evaluating available data and estimating the prevalence of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, WHO COVID-19 database) to identify studies reporting VTE-rates in COVID-19 patients. Studies with suspected high risk of bias were excluded from quantitative synthesis. Pooled outcome rates were obtained within a random effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed for different settings (intensive care unit (ICU) vs. non-ICU hospitalization and screening vs. no screening) and the association of D-dimer levels and VTE-risk was explored. Results: Eighty-six studies (33,970 patients) were identified and 66 (28,173 patients, mean age: 62.6 years, 60% men, 20% ICU-patients) were included in quantitative analysis. The overall VTE-prevalence estimate was 14.1% (95%CI 11.6-16.9), 40.3% (95%CI 27.0-54.3) with ultrasound-screening and 9.5% (95%CI 7.5-11.7) without screening. Subgroup analysis revealed high heterogeneity, with a VTE-prevalence of 7.9% (95%CI 5.1-11.2) in non-ICU and 22.7% (95%CI 18.1-27.6) in ICU patients. Prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in non-ICU and ICU patients was 3.5% (95%CI 2.2-5.1) and 13.7% (95%CI 10.0-17.9). Patients developing VTE had higher D-dimer levels (weighted mean difference 3.26 µg/ml (95%CI 2.76-3.77) than non-VTE patients. Conclusion: VTE occurs in 22.7% of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, but VTE risk is also increased in non-ICU hospitalized patients. Patients developing VTE had higher D-dimer levels. Studies evaluating thromboprophylaxis strategies in patients with COVID-19 are needed to improve prevention of VTE.","Nopp, Stephan; Moik, Florian; Jilma, Bernd; Pabinger, Ingrid; Ay, Cihan",,,386

212448,Survival of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and remdesivir: Bayesian re-analysis and meta-analysis of two clinical trials,2020,"Evidence has emerged that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can be transmitted airborne in aerosol particles as well as in larger droplets or by surface deposits. This minireview outlines the underlying aerosol science, making links to aerosol research in other disciplines. SARS-CoV-2 is emitted in aerosol form during normal breathing by both asymptomatic and symptomatic people, remaining viable with a half-life of up to about an hour during which air movement can carry it considerable distances, although it simultaneously disperses. The proportion of the droplet size distribution within the aerosol range depends on the sites of origin within the respiratory tract and on whether the distribution is presented on a number or volume basis. Evaporation and fragmentation reduce the size of the droplets, whereas coalescence increases the mean droplet size. Aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 can also coalesce with pollution particulates, and infection rates correlate with pollution. The operation of ventilation systems in public buildings and transportation can create infection hazards via aerosols, but provides opportunities for reducing the risk of transmission in ways as simple as switching from recirculated to outside air. There are also opportunities to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol form with sunlight or UV lamps. The efficiency of masks for blocking aerosol transmission depends strongly on how well they fit. Research areas that urgently need further experimentation include the basis for variation in droplet size distribution and viral load, including droplets emitted by ""superspreader"" individuals; the evolution of droplet sizes after emission, their interaction with pollutant aerosols and their dispersal by turbulence, which gives a different basis for social distancing.","Jarvis, Michael C",Front Public Health,,386

In this paper, the transfer learning technique has been applied to clinical images of different types of pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. It is found that COVID-19 is very much similar to pneumonia lung disease. Further findings are made to identify the type of pneumonia similar to COVID-19. Transfer Learning makes it possible for us to find out that viral pneumonia is same as COVID-19. This shows the knowledge gained by model trained for detecting viral pneumonia can be transferred for identifying COVID-19. Transfer Learning shows significant difference in results when compared with the outcome from conventional classifications. It is obvious that we need not create separate model for classifying COVID-19 as done by conventional classifications. This makes the herculean work easier by using existing model for determining COVID-19. Second, it is difficult to detect the abnormal features from images due to the noise impedance from lesions and tissues. For this reason, texture feature extraction is accomplished using Haralick features which focus only on the area of interest to detect COVID-19 using statistical analyses. Hence, there is a need to propose a model to predict the COVID-19 cases at the earliest possible to control the spread of disease.

The majority of individuals infected are multiplying. The government takes aggressive steps to quarantine people, people exposed to infection, and clinical trials for treatment. Subsequently recommends critical care for the aged, children, and health-care personnel. While machine learning methods have been previously used to augment clinical decisions, there is now a demand for ""Emergency ML."" With rapidly growing datasets, there also remain important considerations when developing and validating ML models. METHODS: This paper reviews the recent study that applies machine-learning technology addressing Corona virus-related disease issues' challenges in different perspectives. The report also discusses various treatment trials and procedures on Corona virus-related disease infected patients providing insights to physicians and the public on the current treatment challenges. RESULTS: The paper provides the individual with insights into certain precautions to prevent and control the spread of this deadly disease. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the utility of evidence-based machine learning prediction tools in several clinical settings, and how similar models can be deployed during the Corona virus-related disease pandemic to guide hospital frontlines and health-care administrators to make informed decisions about patient care and managing hospital volume. Further, the clinical trials conducted so far for infected patients with Corona virus-related disease addresses their results to improve community alertness from the viewpoint of a well-known saying, ""prevention is always better.""","Reyana, A; Kautish, Sandeep",,,386

220163,A review of Ciclesonide in COVID-19. Still a long way to go,2021,"All animal life on earth is thought to have a common origin and have common genetic mechanisms. Evolution has enabled differentiation of species. Pathogens likewise have evolved within various species and mostly come to a settled dynamic equilibrium such that co-existence results (pathogens ideally should not kill their hosts). Problems arise when pathogens jump species because the new host had not developed any resistance. These infections from related species are known as zoonoses. COVID-19 is the latest example of a virus entering another species but HIV (and various strains of influenza) were previous examples. HIV entered the human population from monkeys in Africa. These two papers outline the underlying principle of HIV and the differing epidemiologies in Africa, the USA and in Edinburgh. The underlying immunosuppression of HIV in Africa was initially hidden behind common infections and HIV first came to world awareness in focal areas of the USA as a disease seemingly limited to gay males. The epidemic of intravenous drug abuse in Edinburgh was associated with overlapping epidemics of bloodborne viruses like hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.","Welsby, Philip D",Postgrad Med J,,386

221178,The Role of Imaging in the Management of Suspected or Known COVID-19 Pneumonia. A Multidisciplinary Perspective,2020,"The COVID-19 has originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has been affecting the public health system, society, and economy in an unheard-of manner. There is no specific treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19. Previous data showed that men are more affected than women by COVID-19, then we hypothesized whether sex hormones could be protecting the female organism against the infection. VERO E6 cells have been commonly used as in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our experimental approach, we have treated VERO E6 cells with 17ß-estradiol to evaluate the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cell line. Here we demonstrated that estrogen protein receptors ER&#945;, ERß, and GPER1 are expressed by VERO E6 cells and could be used to study the effects of this steroid hormone. Previous and 24-hours post-infection, cells treated with 17ß-estradiol revealed a reduction in the viral load. Afterward, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection per se results in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 increased gene expression in VERO E6-cell, which could be generating a cycle of virus infection in host cells. The estrogen treatment reduces the levels of the TMPRSS2, which are involved with SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness capacity, and hence, reducing the pathogenicity/genesis. These data suggest that estrogen could be a potential therapeutic target promoting cell protection against SARS-CoV-2. This opens new possibilities for further studies on 17ß-estradiol in human cell lines infected by SARS-CoV-2 and at least in part, explain why men developed a more severe COVID-19 compared to women.","Lemes, Robertha Mariana Rodrigues; Costa, Angelica Jardim; Bartolomeo, Cynthia Silva; Bassani, Taysa Bervian; Nishino, Michelle Sayuri; Pereira, Gustavo Jose da Silva; Smaili, Soraya Soubhi; Maciel, Rui Monteiro de Barros; Braconi, Carla Torres; da Cruz, Edgar Ferreira; Ramirez, Ana Lopez; Maricatto, Juliana Terzi; Janini, Luiz Mario Ramos; Prado, Carla Máximo; Stilhano, Roberta Sessa; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes",Physiol Rep,,386
221284,The impact of socioeconomic status on 30-day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging healthcare systems. Surgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic presents numerous challenges regarding not only patient and community safety, but also the safety of physicians and operating room (OR) staff. In the OR, general anaesthesia poses a risk of aerosolization during the intubation process. There is also concern about minimally invasive surgery due to aerosol formation. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was also identified in the faeces, so this is a possible pathway for transmission. This article presents the role of spinal anaesthesia (SA) and AirSeal® device in reducing the risk of COVID-19 contamination while performing transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS). A 59-year-old patient, diagnosed with a T1 rectal adenocarcinoma, was submitted to TAMIS. The surgery was done during COVID-19 pandemic due to the risk of oncological progression with delayed treatment, under SA and using the AirSeal® system and adequate personnel protective equipment (PPE). Laparoscopic smoke evacuation systems with appropriate filters, like AirSeal®, minimize the aerosol formation and may reduce the risk associated with surgical smoke exposure. This case is unique because the patient was safely submitted to TAMIS using proper PPE and AirSeal® under SA, in order to minimize aerosol formation which is crucial during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

221285,The impact of socioeconomic status on 30-day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The current study's main objective was to measure the prevalence of psychological distress and its associated factors among Egyptian physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceived stressors and coping strategies were also explored. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 714 physicians was carried out using an online administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and occupational data, data related to the current pandemic, Kessler psychological distress scale, and the brief resilient coping scale. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors. RESULTS: About 50% of physicians had severe psychological distress. Among studied physicians, the significant predictors were being female, having a pre-existing illness, having an elderly family member, and being in close contact with a case (AOR 1.6, 1.6, 1.4 and 1.7, respectively). Meanwhile, significant occupational predictors were less experienced and frontline physicians (AOR 2.0 and 1.8, respectively). The most distressful concern was fear for families and personal health and safety, while religious coping was the most effective coping strategy. CONCLUSION: During the current pandemic, Egyptian physicians have a high prevalence of psychological distress. Frontline, low-experienced, female, previously ill physicians are more likely to have severe psychological distress. Therefore, psychological preparedness and psychological support services should be implemented and made easily accessible during pandemics.","Sehsah, Radwa; Gaballah, Mohammed Hassan; El-Gilany, Abdel-Hady; Albadry, Ahmed A",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,,386
221561,Myopericarditis in a previously healthy adolescent male following COVID-19 vaccination: A case report,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Individuals routinely perform cognitive tasks concurrent to balance functions. The attention is one of the most important cognitive functions and it has effects on vestibular system. This study aims to investigate the connection between balance and cognitive tasks under different conditions. METHODS: Visual attention tasks (VAT) and auditory attention tasks (AAT) were given to 30 healthy adults (40.42â¯±â¯11.22â¯years) during functional balance tasks. Sensory Organization Test (SOT) and Adaptation Test (ADT) were used for the evaluation of postural stability and adaptation. The sounds were presented from the computer speakers in AATs, and VATs were presented in the virtual reality (VR) environment. RESULTS: The first SOT condition had a statistically significant difference between all dual VAT (DT-VAT) and single task (ST) (pâ¯<â¯0.001), but there was no statistically significant difference between ST and DT-AAT (pâ¯=â¯1.00). In the fourth SOT condition, there was a statistically significant difference between all DT-VATs versus ST and DT-VA (pâ¯<â¯0.001); there was no statistically significant difference between ST and DT-AA scores (pâ¯=â¯0.80). While there was a significant difference between DT-VA and ST and DT-AA (pâ¯<â¯0.001), no statistically significant difference was observed between ST and DT-AA in the ADT (pâ¯=â¯0.321). CONCLUSIONS: Balance performance gets worse with VAT in a VR environment. VR technology can be used to effectively evaluate balance and cognitive performance. The use of experimental environments in standard postural evaluations increases the efficiency of the postural stability tests.","Altin, Büsra; Aksoy, Songül",Am J Otolaryngol,,386

These challenges include restriction of family visitation, use of third-party providers as essential workers, staffing guidelines, transfer policies, and rural AL hospitalizations. To meet these challenges we recommend that AL providers incorporate digital technology to maintain family-resident communication. We also recommend that states adopt protocols that limit the number of AL communities visited by home health care workers in a 14-day period, appeal to the federal government for hazard pay for direct care workers, and to extend the personal care attendant program to AL. It is further recommended that states work with AL communities to implement COVID-19 comprehensive emergency management plans that are well-coordinated with local emergency operation centers to assist with transfers to COVID-19 specific locations and to assist in rural areas with hospital transfers. Together, these recommendations to AL providers and state and federal agencies address the unique structure and needs of AL and would enable AL communities to be better prepared to care for and reduce those infected with COVID-19.","Dobbs, Debra; Peterson, Lindsay; Hyer, Kathryn",J Aging Soc Policy,,386

A polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of animals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural network. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation. Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer, and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images, achieving an average symmetric surface distance of [Formula: see text] mm and Dice coefficient of [Formula: see text]. Hierarchical clustering identified four radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation without requiring COVID-19 cases for training.","Gerard, Sarah E; Herrmann, Jacob; Xin, Yi; Martin, Kevin T; Rezoagli, Emanuele; Ippolito, Davide; Bellani, Giacomo; Cereda, Maurizio; Guo, Junfeng; Hoffman, Eric A; Kaczka, David W; Reinhardt, Joseph M",Sci Rep,,386
222958,Psychophysical Evaluation of the Olfactory Function: European Multicenter Study on 774 COVID-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Drug shortages have a negative impact on individual health outcomes for patients and health care systems more broadly. In recent years, regulatory bodies, such as the Therapeutic Good Administration in Australia, have provided information about an increasing number of drug shortages. It is reported that 90% of medicines in Australia are imported; this leaves Australia vulnerable to international drug shortages. It has been suggested that Australia is heavily reliant on the US as its primary source of medicines. OBJECTIVE(S): To determine whether there are significant trends in the quantity, frequency, and nature of drug shortages between the US and Australia in a pre-pandemic and pandemic climate. METHODS: This study mapped and analyzed drug shortages reported by both the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: In 2019 (pre-COVID19), only 4% of US drug shortages were reported in Australia; this rose to 7% in 2020. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of US drug shortages increased by 37%, whilst the number of Australian drug shortages increased by 300%. CONCLUSIONS: The Australian pharmaceuticals market is indeed more vulnerable to drug shortages, particularly in the event of a global pandemic such as COVID-19. However, these shortages are not significantly influenced by the US drug market.","Cameron, Eliza E; Bushell, Mary-Jessimine A",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,386

Sera were obtained near the onset of RI and 3 to 4 weeks later as part of a prospective study of 200 subjects evaluated for RI from 2009 to 2013. Antibodies against common HCoV strains were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization assay comparing older adults with cardiopulmonary diseases (99 subjects) to younger, healthy adults (101 subjects). Virus shedding was detected in respiratory secretions by polymerase chain reaction. Of 43 HCoV-associated illnesses, 15 (35%) occurred in 14 older adults (aged &#8805;60 years) and 28 (65%) in 28 younger adults (aged 21-40 years). Binding and neutralizing antibodies were higher in older adults. Only 16 (35.7%) of RI with increases in binding antibodies also had increases in neutralizing antibodies to HCoV. Increases in binding antibodies with RI were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and virus shedding, and more frequent in younger compared to older adults. Functional neutralizing antibodies were not stimulated as often as binding antibodies, explaining in part a susceptibility to reinfection with HCoV. Monitoring binding antibodies may be more sensitive for the serologic detection of HCoV infections.","Gorse, Geoffrey J; Donovan, Mary M; Patel, Gira B",J Med Virol,,386

230459,Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19: Risk Factors for Early Oxygen Requirement after Hospitalization,2021,"There are no studies which have compared the risk of severe Covid-19 and related mortality between transplant recipients and non-transplant patients. We enrolled two groups of patients hospitalized for Covid-19, i.e., kidney transplant recipients from the French Registry of Solid Organ Transplant (n=306) and a single-center cohort of non-transplant patients (n=795). An analysis was performed among subgroups matched for age and risk factors for severe Covid-19 or mortality. Severe Covid-19 was defined as admission (or transfer) to an intensive care unit, need for mechanical ventilation, or death.Transplant recipients were younger and had more comorbidities compared to non-transplant patients. They presented with higher creatinine levels and developed more episodes of acute kidney injury. After matching, the 30-day cumulative incidence of severe Covid-19 did not differ between KTR and non-transplant patients; however, 30-day Covid-19-related mortality was significantly higher in KTR (17.9% versus 11.4%, respectively, p=0.038). Age >60 years, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, fever, lymphopenia, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with severe Covid-19 in univariate analysis, whereas transplant status and serum creatinine levels were not. Age >60 years, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, CRP >60 mg/L, lymphopenia, kidney transplant status (HR=1.55), and creatinine level >115 µmol/L (HR=2.32) were associated with Covid-19-related mortality in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, and fever were associated with severe disease, whereas age >60 years, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, fever, and creatinine level>115 µmol/L retained their independent associations with mortality. Kidney transplant recipients had a higher Covid-19-related mortality compared to non-transplant hospitalized patients.","Caillard, Sophie; Chavarot, Nathalie; Francois, Hélène; Matignon, Marie; Greze, Clarisse; Kamar, Nassim; Gatault, Philippe; Thaunat, Olivier; Legris, Tristan; Frimat, Luc; Westeel, Pierre Francois; Goutaudier, Valentin; Snanoudj, Renaud; Colosio, Charlotte; Sicard, Antoine; Bertrand, Dominique; Mousson, Christiane; Bamoulid, Jamal; Masset, Christophe; Thierry, Antoine; Couzi, Lionel; Chemouny, Jonathan M; Duveau, Agnes; Moal, Valerie; Blancho, Gilles; Grimbert, Philippe; Durrbach, Antoine; Moulin, Bruno; Anglicheau, Dany; Ruch, Yvon; Kaeuffer, Charlotte; Benotmane, Ilies; Solis, Morgane; Le Meur, Yannick; Hazzan, Marc; Danion, Francois",Am. j. transplant,,386
231184,The first cohort of the COVID-19 patients in Vietnam and the national response to the pandemic,2020,"Hook-up apps are an increasingly popular way for women to meet other people for sex, dating, relationships, and more. As a mundane and habitual form of media, the multiple uses of hook-up apps allow for the production of intimacy in surprising and complex ways. This paper draws on narrative interviews with 15 self-identifying women to explore how dating and hook-up apps help produce 'intimate publics' for women. The field of intimate publics available to women users of hook-up apps is broader than those afforded by in-app interactions; there is an entire network of intimacy, sociality, and publicity that forms around hook-up apps. Our findings show that while both queer and straight women use hook-up apps to find sex, hook-ups, dates, and relationships, they are also central to building community, friendship, and sociality between women.","Petrychyn, Jonathan; Parry, Diana C; Johnson, Corey W",Health Sociol Rev,,386
231866,Hematologic predictors of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a comparative study,2020,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has challenged healthcare systems globally. The health inequities experienced by immigrants, refugees, and racial/ethnic minorities have been aggravated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The socioeconomic, political, and demographic profile of these vulnerable populations places them at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionally higher among these at-risk groups. The purpose of this perspective is to: (1) highlight the interactions among the social determinants of health (SDoH) and their bi-directional relationship with the COVID-19 pandemic which results in the current syndemic and; (2) offer recommendations that consider an integrated approach to mitigate COVID-19 risk for marginalized populations in general. For these at-risk populations, we discuss how individual, structural, sociocultural, and socioeconomic factors interact with each other to result in a disparate risk to contracting and transmitting COVID-19. Marginalized populations are the world's collective responsibility. We recommend implementing the Essential Public Health Services (EPHS) framework to promote those systems and policies that enable optimal health for all while removing systemic and structural barriers that have created health inequities. The pledge of ""Health for All"" is often well-accepted in theory, but the intricacy of its practical execution is not sufficiently recognized during this COVID-19 syndemic and beyond.","Caron, Rosemary M; Adegboye, Amanda Rodrigues Amorim",Front Public Health,,386
232704,Anticoagulation and Covid-19: a Meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Medications already available to treat other conditions are presently being studied in clinical trials as potential treatments for COVID-19. Given that pregnant women are excluded from these trials, we aimed to investigate their safety when used during pregnancy within a unique population source. METHODS: Using the population-based Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, we identified women who delivered a singleton liveborn (1998-2015). Taking potential confounders into account including indications for use, the risk of prematurity, low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), and major congenital malformation (MCM) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drug use during pregnancy were quantified using generalized estimation equations. RESULTS: Of the 231,075 eligible pregnancies, 107 were exposed to dexamethasone (0.05%), 31 to interferons (0.01%), 1,398 to heparins (0.60%), 24 to angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) (0.01%), 182 to chloroquine (0.08%), 103 to hydroxychloroquine (0.05%), 6,206 to azithromycin (2.70%), 230 to oseltamivir (0.10%), and 114 to HIV medications (0.05%). Adjusting for potential confounders, we observed an increased risk of prematurity related to dexamethasone (aOR 1.92, 95%CI 1.11-3.33; 15 exposed cases), anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.58, 95%CI 1.31-1.91; 177 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.04, 95%CI 1.01-4.11; 20 exposed cases) use. An increased risk for LBW associated with anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.72, 95%CI 1.41-2.11; 152 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.48, 95%CI 1.25-4.90; 21 exposed cases) use were also found. Gestational exposure to anti-thrombotics (aOR 1.20, 95%CI 1.00-1.44; 176 exposed cases), and HIV medications (aOR 2.61, 95%CI 1.51-4.51; 30 exposed cases) were associated with SGA. First-trimester dexamethasone (aOR 1.66, 95%CI 1.02-2.69; 20 exposed cases) and azithromycin (aOR 1.10, 95%CI 1.02-1.19; 747 exposed cases) exposures were associated with MCM. CONCLUSIONS: Many available medications considered as treatments for COVID-19 are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Caution is warranted when considering these medications during the gestational period.","Bérard, Anick; Sheehy, Odile; Zhao, Jin-Ping; Vinet, Evelyne; Quach, Caroline; Kassai, Behrouz; Bernatsky, Sasha",PLoS One,,386
233375,Surgical Support for Severe COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study in a French High-Density COVID-19 Cluster,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to develop and evaluate a theoretical model to explain the relationships among participation in individual and social activities, compliance with prevention guidelines, and the perception of fatalism and fear of COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 1,067 participants who were >18 years of age living in different provinces of Turkey recruited between August 15, 2020 and October 15, 2020. We used covariant structural analysis to assess the relationships of the constructs of the theoretical model. RESULTS: Significant fits were detected for Model 1 (&#967;2 = 924,389, p < .001, comparative fit index or CFI = 0.944), and for Model 2 (&#967;2 = 2,253,751, p < .001, CFI = 0.926). The predetermination and luck subdimensions reduce the fear of COVID-19, while the pessimism subdimension and compliance with preventive measures increase the fear. CONCLUSION: In public health crises such as COVID-19, it is important to plan scientific knowledge-based public education; take initiatives in accordance with the cultural, social, economic, religious, and local characteristics of the societies; and conduct public health studies covering the whole society.","Özdil, Kamuran; Bulucu Büyüksoy, Gizem D; Çatiker, Aslihan",Public health nurs,,386

Children seemed to be infected less frequently than adults, and family clusters seemed to play an important role in the spread of the pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the serological profile of children and young adults between 4 and 16 years of age in order to assess the transmission patterns of COVID-19 between cohabitants. The subjects lived with at least one cohabitant who tested positive for the disease using a nasopharyngeal swab. To avoid contact with the disease, families were interviewed by telephone. Forty-nine children and adolescents with a mean age of 11 years were then subjected to a rapid lateral flow chromatographic test. Of them, seven (14.3%) were immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive, and four (8.2%) were immunoglobulin M (IgM)-positive. In total, 16.3% of the tested sample had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2: this may confirm the lower vulnerability of children to COVID-19, despite the small sample size. The time from the negativization of the cohabitant until the test day may have influenced the results, especially when this timeframe is wide.","Farronato, Marco; Dolci, Carolina; Boccalari, Elisa; Izadi, Sara; Salvatierra Rios, Luis Hernan; Festa, Maurizio; Panetta, Valentina; De Vito, Danila; Tartaglia, Gianluca Martino",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,386

Methods: The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. Results: A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi. Most cases were mild (87.76%). As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase. The case number in Xi'an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province. The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission. The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi. After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. Conclusions: At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated. However, considering the approaching of return to work and study and the increasing of imported cases from other countries, the prevention and control of COVIS-19 in Shaanxi will face new challenges.","Zhu, N; Li, C; Ning, S S; Chen, S; Cao, L; Yang, G J; Li, X X; Nian, Y P; Wang, W H; Liu, Y Z; Wang, L; Lei, F L; Zhang, Y; Zhuang, G H",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,386

METHODS: All patients with KD admitted between February and April in 2015-2020, were classified into before (group 1, in 2015-2019) and after (group 2, in 2020) isolation groups. A total of 4742 patients [with KD (n = 98) and non-KD (n = 4644)] referred to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and virus detection were analyzed in 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and 13 pathogens were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Group 2 had a significantly increased incidence of KD (0.11%) with 107 patients compared to that of group 1 (0.03%) with 493 patients. The comparisons of oral mucosal change, strawberry tongue, desquamation of the fingertips, cervical lymphadenopathy and neutrophil percentage decreased in group 2 compared to group 1. The infection rate of MP increased significantly in group 2 (34.7%) compared to group 1 (19.3%), while the positive rate of viruses decreased significantly in group 2 (5.3%) compared to group 1 (14.3%). In 2020, the positive rate of MP infection increased significantly in patients with KD compared to the increase in patients with non-KD. The infection rate of MP for younger children aged less than 3 years old was higher in group 2 than in group 1. CONCLUSION: Compared with the characteristics of KD from 2015 to 2019 years, the incidence of KD was increased in 2020 and was accompanied by a high incidence of MP infection, especially in younger children (less than 3 years old) during the isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Ding, Yue-Yue; Ren, Yan; Qin, Jie; Qian, Guang-Hui; Tang, Yun-Jia; Chen, Ye; Li, Xuan; Xu, Lei; Qiao, Chun-Hong; Sun, Ling; Lv, Hai-Tao",World J Pediatr,,386

Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19. The underlying associated comorbidity and diminished immune function of some pituitary patients (whether caused by the disease and its sequelae or treatment with excess glucocorticoids) increases their risk of contracting and developing complications from COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A review of studies in PubMed and Google Scholar published between January 2020 to the time of writing (May 1, 2020) was conducted using the search terms 'pituitary,' 'coronavirus,' 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'diabetes mellitus', 'obesity', 'adrenal,' and 'endocrine.' RESULTS: Older age and pre-existing obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. Men tend to be more severely affected than women; fortunately, most men, particularly of younger age, survive the infection. In addition to general comorbidities that may apply to many pituitary patients, they are also susceptible due to the following pituitary disorder-specific features: hypercortisolemia and adrenal suppression with Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus with hypopituitarism, and sleep-apnea syndrome and chest wall deformity with acromegaly. CONCLUSION: This review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 in patients with pituitary disorders. As most countries are implementing mobility restrictions, we also discuss how this pandemic has affected patient attitudes and impacted our decision-making on management recommendations for these patients.

In the current work, reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-LAMP assays were performed on extracted RNA of 7 wastewater samples. RT{square}LAMP assay was also performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction. Current detection of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly by RT-qPCR of ORF (ORF1ab) and N genes so we targeted both to find the best surrogate marker for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We also performed RT-LAMP with/without RNA extraction inside microfluidic device to target both genes. Positivity rates of RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP performed on extracted RNA were 100.0% (7/7) and 85.7% (6/7), respectively. RT-qPCR results revealed that all 7 wastewater samples were positive for N gene (Ct range 37-39), and negative for ORF1ab, suggesting that N gene could be used as a surrogate marker for detection of SARS-CoV-2. RT-LAMP of N and ORF (ORF1a) genes performed on wastewater samples without RNA extraction indicated that all 7 samples remains pink (negative). The color remains pink in all microchannels except the one which subjected to RT-LAMP for targeting N region after RNA extraction (yellowish/orange color). This study shows for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 was successfully detected from wastewater samples using RT-LAMP in microfluidic chips.","Donia, Ahmed; Shahid, Muhammad Furqan; Hassan, Sammer-ul; Ahmad, Aftab; Javed, Aneela; Nawaz, Muhammad; Yaqub, Tahir; Bokhari, Habib",,,386

238797,Incidence of osteoporosis and fragility fractures in asthma: a UK population-based matched cohort study,2020,"PURPOSE: Current treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung disease have limited efficacy. Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has received both interest and criticism as a potential treatment for this condition. In this qualitative study we explored clinicians' perspectives to identify barriers to testing LDRT in clinical trials and implementing it in clinical practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Semistructured interviews were undertaken with 6 clinicians from 3 medical disciplines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically, using a framework approach. Common themes regarding barriers to using LDRT for COVID-19 lung disease were identified from the data. RESULTS: Three categories of barriers emerged: (1) the potential to do harm to the patient, including difficulty in predicting harm and lack of existing data to inform quantification of risks; (2) the feasibility of trialing this novel treatment strategy in the clinical setting, in particular trial design and recruitment, patient selection and buy-in from relevant clinician groups; and (3) the logistics of delivering the treatment, in particular risks of transmission to other patients and resources required for patient transfer. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several barriers that may impede the evaluation and subsequent implementation of LDRT as a treatment for COVID-19 lung disease, from the perspectives of clinicians in 3 relevant specialties. By documenting and articulating these concerns, we hope to enhance discussion of why these barriers exist, and enable them to be addressed in a proactive manner to facilitate research into the potential benefits of radiation treatment for patients with COVID-19 lung disease going forward.","Hanna, Catherine R; Robb, Kathryn A; Blyth, Kevin G; Jones, Robert J; Chalmers, Anthony J",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,386

METHODS: We use provisional vital statistics data for births occurring in the central region of New Jersey. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is employed to assess depressive symptoms. Our focal analysis uses linear regression models to test whether giving birth during the pandemic is associated with elevated depressive symptoms. All analyses are performed using time-matched (September 2019-April 2020; n = 18,531) and month-matched (January 2019-April 2019 and January 2020- April 2020; n = 18,346) samples. RESULTS: Women who gave birth in March and not in April reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who gave birth prior to the pandemic in our time-matched (b = 0.09) and month-matched (b = 0.09) samples. The magnitude of this association is approximately one-third the magnitude of the association between preterm birth and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that researchers and practitioners should pay special attention to signs of postpartum depression and women's adaptive coping responses in the early stages of pandemics.","McFarland, Michael J; McFarland, Cheryl A S; Hill, Terrence D; D039,; Oria, Robyn",Matern Child Health J,,386

240630,Persistent Post-COVID-19 Interstitial Lung Disease. An Observational Study of Corticosteroid Treatment,2021,"BACKGROUND: A compulsory school entrance examination of pre-school children (SEU) is administered in the German state of Bavaria. Every second year since 2004, the examinations are expanded in six study regions using a cross-sectional survey design (GME). However, the extent to which the results of the GME surveys are generalizable to the SEU population is unknown. Therefore, this study carried out a poststratification of two different GME surveys. The aim was to observe the impact of poststratification on an exemplary analysis of influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma, wheezing) and thus to better understand this important question. METHODS: First, poststratification was applied to correct for deviances of the GME sample in comparison to the SEU population. Logistic regression was used to determine the auxiliary variables for the poststratification. Following this, a composite variable as a linear combination was created to calculate weighting factors. Next, logistic regression analyses were applied to analyze possible influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma and wheezing) in two GME surveys (2005/2006 and 2012/2013). Subsequently, the differences arising from poststratification were examined in more detail. RESULTS: This study supports the hypothesis that the GME sample deviates from the SEU population. Mother tongue other than German of at least one parent, complete vaccination status and conspicuous visuomotor test results were positively associated with participation in both GME surveys. The prevalence for hay fever, asthma and frequent wheeze did not change statistically significant from 2005/2006 to 2012/2013. In the twelve analyses before and after poststratification, male sex was statistically significant associated with the three allergy and asthma related outcomes (e.g. asthma 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 2.06, 95%-CI: 1.56-2.71). A high body mass index was positively associated with asthma (e.g. 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 1.12, 95%-CI: 1.05-1.20). Poststratification caused a significant change in the sample composition. CONCLUSIONS: It might be suggested that a poststratification should be performed for each GME survey. Poststratification tended to make results more comparable with previous research. In accordance with previous research, this study confirmed that male sex and high BMI are associated with asthma.","Kass, Bernhard; Kutzora, Susanne; Weinberger, Alisa; Nennstiel, Uta; Heißenhuber, Annette; Herr, Caroline; Heinze, Stefanie",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,386

Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare. METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020. RESULTS: The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters. The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare. Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia. Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare. Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce. Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults.

The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreak, starts on 2nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it more difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. Our proposed model is fitted to the daily new reported cases in India during the period 2nd March, 2020 to 12th November, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of implementing preventive measures in reducing the new cases. Our model projects the daily new COVID-19 cases in India during 13th November, 2020 to 25th February, 2021 for a range of intervention strength. We also investigate that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention should be increased over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.","Senapati, Abhishek; Rana, Sourav; Das, Tamalendu; Chattopadhyay, Joydev",J Theor Biol,,386

""COVID (coronavirus disease) toes"" became a hallmark of the disease in young and largely asymptomatic patients, who may have negative test results for SARS-CoV-2. Pernio (chilblains)-like lesions are seen mostly in infected pediatric patients and are purple painful, frequently bilateral, ill-defined plaques with prominent inflammation on histological examination. In contrast to pernio-like presentation in children, critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 develop ""purple"" digits that may be sharply demarcated and may demonstrate asymmetric areas of ischemia. These 2 contrasting entities are sometimes grouped together as ""COVID toes"" due to some similarities in clinical appearance and presentation. Here, we summarize histopathologic examination from an autopsy, including the cutaneous lesions from the affected and normal contralateral toes and correlate them with systemic findings. In contrast to pernio-like lesions, the skin of the affected necrotic toes contained thrombi in vessels without prominent inflammation, suggestive of an embolic event. This is further supported by the clinical history of and autopsy findings of popliteal artery thrombus and multiple subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Our findings suggest that critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 have different pathological processes affecting skin at peripheral sites (ie, fingers, toes, ears, and nose), which may be due to thromboembolic events. The skin is a mirror of the body and skin pathology may shed light into overall pathogenesis of systemic illness and processes.","Yilmaz, Mine M; Szabolcs, Matthias J; Geskin, Larisa J; Niedt, George W",Am. j. dermatopathol,,386

Projected for the treatment of chronic diseases, it has been technologically updated for the management of Covid-19 patients with the support of a group of doctors in the territory when the pandemic arrived, introducing new sensors and functionalities (e.g., the familiar use and video calls). In Tuscany (Central Italy), during the first wave of outbreak, a model for enrolling patients was created and tested. Because of the positive results, the latter has been then adopted in the second current wave. The Tel.Te.Covid19 platform has been used by 40 among general practitioners and doctors of continuity care and about 180 symptomatic patients since March 2020.

RESULTS: A total of 81 patients &#8804;21 years old were admitted with positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and/or serum immunoglobulin testing. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were admitted for management of acute COVID-19 infection, whereas 14 (17.3%) were admitted for management of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Of the 81 hospitalized patients, 28 (34.6%) required intensive care. A majority of patients (42 [51.9%]) admitted for both acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C were Hispanic. Underlying chronic health conditions were not present in most patients. Obesity (mean BMI of 41.1) was noted in the patients with MIS-C requiring ICU care, although not statistically significant. Absolute lymphopenia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers were statistically significant in the patients with MIS-C treated in the ICU.

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Revised, and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to assess anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, quality of life, and resilience, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-nine ICU HCWs completed the survey (37 from the team of regular staff members, i.e., from the public health service, and 32 from a reinforcement pool, either from non-ICU public health service or from private healthcare interim employment agencies). Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms was high, at 19%, 9%, and 16%, respectively, with limited impairment in quality of life or resilience scores. Depression symptoms were observed more in regular staff members than in welcomed reinforcement workers, at 16% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results revealed that during the pandemic, HCWs from the team of regular staff members were at greater risk of developing psychological disorder compared with reinforcement workers, with higher levels of depressive symptoms.","Altmayer, Victor; Weiss, Nicolas; Cao, Albert; Marois, Clémence; Demeret, Sophie; Rohaut, Benjamin; Le Guennec, Loïc",Aust. crit. care,,386
246577,Telemedicine and eConsults for Hospitalized Patients During COVID-19,2020,"The BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, consisting of mRNA, have recently become available. The absolute novelty of these vaccines introduces questions about their safety and efficacy, especially in patients who are treated with biological drugs in dermatology. The aim of our review was to provide a broad overview of the current use of all available vaccinations in concomitance with biological therapy and to suggest indications for the new mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. We conducted a narrative review of the literature regarding the indications and safety of the various types of vaccines currently available in dermatological patients treated with biological therapy. The safety and efficacy of administering inactivated vaccines in patients undergoing biological therapy with inhibitors of TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-12/23, and IL-4/13 was confirmed. Inactivated vaccines can be administered during therapy with inhibitors of IL-23 and IgE, taking into account that the level of evidence is lower due to the lack of specific studies. Live attenuated vaccines were contraindicated in concomitance with all biological therapies considered, except omalizumab. According to this evidence, we assume that there are currently no contraindications to the administration of the new Covid-19 BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines during biological therapy with inhibitors of TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-12/23, IL-23, and IL-4/13, since these vaccines are comparable to inactivated ones. For patients with chronic urticaria or allergic asthma treated with omalizumab, we currently recommend caution in using the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines (30 min observation). The only contraindications were a previous history of hypersensitivity to the Covid-19 vaccines themself or to their excipients. In conclusion, further randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the antibody response in these patients.","Simonetti, O.; Rizzetto, G.; Molinelli, E.; Diotallevi, F.; Radi, G.; Cirioni, O.; D039,; Errico, M.

Since then, several studies have been conducted on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by potential vaccines and drugs. Although, the governments and global population have been attracted by some vaccine production projects, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral drugs would be an urge necessity in parallel with the efficient preventive vaccines. Various nonspecific drugs produced previously against other bacterial, viral, and parasite infections were recently evaluated for treating patients with COVID-19. In addition to therapeutic properties of these anti-COVID-19 compounds, some adverse effects were observed in different human organs as well. Not only several attentions were paid to antiviral therapy and treatment of COVID-19, but also nanomedicine, immunotherapy, and cell therapy were conducted against this viral infection. In this review study, we planned to introduce the present and potential future treatment strategies against COVID-19 and define the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment strategy.","Mirtaleb, Mona Sadat; Mirtaleb, Amir Hossein; Nosrati, Hassan; Heshmatnia, Jalal; Falak, Reza; Zolfaghari Emameh, Reza",Biomed Pharmacother,,386

249964,Comparison of Serologic Response of Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients Using 8 Immunoassays,2021,"Introduction: Diagnostic tests play a critical role in the management of Sars-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. There are two groups of tests, which are in widespread use to identify patients who have contracted the virus. The commonly used reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test becomes negative once viral shedding ceases by approximately 2-3weeks. Antibody tests directed to viral antigens become positive after the second week of infection. IgG antibody responses to the virus are muted in children, pregnant females, and those with mild symptoms. IgA and IgM antibodies rapidly wane, although IgG antibodies directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein are more durable. Current data show variability in the sensitivity of commercial and in-house antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2.Areas covered: The role of T cells in acute illness is uncertain, but long-term protection against the virus may rely on memory T cell responses. Measuring memory T cell responses is important for retrospective confirmation of cases, who may have been infected early in the pandemic before reliable RT-qPCR tests were available and whose SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have become undetectable. Relevant peer-reviewed published references from PubMed are included up to 15 March 2021.Expert opinion: After surveying the literature, the authors present the case for urgent development of diagnostic T cell assays for SARS-CoV-2 by accredited laboratories.","Ameratunga, Rohan; Woon, See-Tarn; Jordan, Anthony; Longhurst, Hilary; Leung, Euphemia; Steele, Richard; Lehnert, Klaus; Snell, Russell; Brooks, Anna E S",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,386

In many buildings periodic disinfection is performed manually; this has several disadvantages: it is expensive, limited in the number of times it can be done over a day, and poses an increased risk to the workers performing the task. To solve these problems, we developed an automated decontamination system that uses ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation for disinfection, coupled with occupancy detection for its safe operation. UVC irradiation is a well-established technology for the deactivation of a wide range of pathogens. Our proposed system can deactivate pathogens both on surfaces and in the air. The coupling with occupancy detection ensures that occupants are never directly exposed to UVC lights and their potential harmful effects.

251446,Incidence of Venous Thromboembolic Events in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review,2020,"Airborne transmission is a pathway of contagion that is still not sufficiently investigated despite the evidence in the scientific literature of the role it can play in the context of an epidemic. While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking, whispering), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The results showed that high quanta emission rates (>100 quanta h-1) can be reached by an asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV-2 subject performing vocalization during light activities (i.e. walking slowly) whereas a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in resting conditions mostly has a low quanta emission rate (<1 quantum h-1). The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.","Buonanno, G; Stabile, L; Morawska, L",Environ Int,,386

This observational retrospective study aims to further investigate the potential pathophysiology through assessing the pattern of microhaemorrhage and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and microhaemorrhage. By comparing with similar patterns of microhaemorrhage in other non-COVID-19 disease, this study aims to propose possible common pathogenic mechanisms. METHODS: A retrospective observational case series was performed identifying all patients with COVID-19 complicated by cerebral microhaemorrhage on MRI. The distribution and number of microhaemorrhages were recorded using the microbleed anatomical scale, and patients' baseline characteristics and salient test results were also recorded. RESULTS: Cerebral microhaemorrhages were noted to have a predilection for the corpus callosum, the juxtacortical white matter and brainstem. All patients had a preceding period of critical illness with respiratory failure and severe hypoxia necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a pattern of cerebral microhaemorrhage that is similar to the pattern reported in patients with non-COVID-19 related critical illness and other causes of severe hypoxia. This raises questions regarding whether microhaemorrhage occurs from endothelial dysfunction due the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection or from the secondary effects of critical illness and hypoxia.","Dixon, Luke; McNamara, Cillian; Gaur, Pritika; Mallon, Dermot; Coughlan, Christopher; Tona, Francesca; Jan, Wajanat; Wilson, Mark; Jones, Brynmor",,,386

Building on the Job Demands-Resources model, we examined day-level relationships between job demands, home demands and emotional exhaustion during telework. Moreover, we tested if leisure crafting (i.e., the proactive pursuit and enactment of leisure activities targeted at goal setting, socializing, growth and development) is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. We expected that proactive personality would be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was predicted to relate negatively to job performance. METHODS: We tested our assumptions using a daily diary study on seven consecutive days with 178 employees (964 observations in total). RESULTS: Multilevel path analysis supports the assumptions that daily job demands as well as daily home demands during telework are positively related to emotional exhaustion. As predicted, we found leisure crafting to be negatively related to emotional exhaustion, and proactive personality to be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was negatively related to job performance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study supports a health-promoting role of leisure crafting above the unfavorable relationships between job demands and home demands with emotional exhaustion.","Abdel Hadi, Sascha; Bakker, Arnold B; Häusser, Jan A",Anxiety Stress Coping,,386

The link between receptor tetramerization and the mechanism of kinase activation, however, has not been elucidated. Here, using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, combined with analysis of SMAD signaling, we show that the kinase domain of the type I receptor ALK2 and type II receptor BMPR2 form a heterodimeric complex via their C-terminal lobes. Formation of this dimer is essential for ligand-induced receptor signaling and is targeted by mutations in BMPR2 in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We further show that the type I/type II kinase domain heterodimer serves as the scaffold for assembly of the active tetrameric receptor complexes to enable phosphorylation of the GS domain and activation of SMADs.","Agnew, Christopher; Ayaz, Pelin; Kashima, Risa; Loving, Hanna S; Ghatpande, Prajakta; Kung, Jennifer E; Underbakke, Eric S; Shan, Yibing; Shaw, David E; Hata, Akiko; Jura, Natalia",Nat Commun,,386

In-fact, owing to its quick spread across international boundaries and the resulting caseload, the disease has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. It is worth noting that out of the 395 cases detected in other nations, 165 (41.8%) have a positive history of travel to China. As of now, the World Health Organization has not recommended for any restrictions on the travel or trade aspects, but has clearly specified that implementation of International Health Regulations should be strictly done at the airports and seaports. In conclusion, the COVID- 19 outbreak has created an alarm across the globe as the causative virus is novel in nature.

253836,Preexisting respiratory diseases and clinical outcomes in COVID-19: a multihospital cohort study on predominantly African American population,2021,"COVID-19 is a clinical syndrome ranging from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia that often leads to respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. Most of the lung damage is driven by a surge in inflammatory cytokines [interleukin-6, interferon-Î³, and granulocyte-monocyte stimulating factor (GM-CSF)]. Blunting this hyperinflammation with immunomodulation may lead to clinical improvement. GM-CSF is produced by many cells, including macrophages and T-cells. GM-CSF-derived signals are involved in differentiation of macrophages, including alveolar macrophages (AMs). In animal models of respiratory infections, the intranasal administration of GM-CSF increased the proliferation of AMs and improved outcomes. Increased levels of GM-CSF have been recently described in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. While GM-CSF might be beneficial in some circumstances as an appropriate response, in this case the inflammatory response is maladaptive by virtue of being later and disproportionate. The inhibition of GM-CSF signaling may be beneficial in improving the hyperinflammation-related lung damage in the most severe cases of COVID-19. This blockade can be achieved through antagonism of the GM-CSF receptor or the direct binding of circulating GM-CSF. Initial findings from patients with COVID-19 treated with a single intravenous dose of mavrilimumab, a monoclonal antibody binding GM-CSF receptor &#945;, showed oxygenation improvement and shorter hospitalization. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are ongoing. Anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies, TJ003234 and gimsilumab, will be tested in clinical trials in patients with COVID-19, while lenzilumab received FDA approval for compassionate use. These trials will help inform whether blunting the inflammatory signaling provided by the GM-CSF axis in COVID-19 is beneficial.","Bonaventura, Aldo; Vecchié, Alessandra; Wang, Tisha S; Lee, Elinor; Cremer, Paul C; Carey, Brenna; Rajendram, Prabalini; Hudock, Kristin M; Korbee, Leslie; Van Tassell, Benjamin W; Dagna, Lorenzo; Abbate, Antonio",Front Immunol,,386

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serology assays are the most available techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, they suffer from either less sensitivity and accuracy or low instrument accessibility for screening. To balance the sensitivity, specificity, and test availability, here, we developed enhanced colorimetry, which is termed as a magnetic pull-down-assisted colorimetric method based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system (M-CDC), for SARS-CoV-2 detection. By this method, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from synthetic sequences and cultured viruses can be detected by the naked eye based on gold nanoparticle (AuNP) probes, with a detection limit of 50 RNA copies per reaction. With CRISPR/Cas12a-assisted detection, SARS-CoV-2 can be specifically distinguished from other closely related viruses.

261188,An Experimental Pre-Post Study on the Efficacy of Respiratory Physiotherapy in Severe Critically III COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Plumbagin is a pharmacologically active naphthoquinone present in the Plumbago zeylanica L. having important medicinal properties. The root of P. zeylanica is rich and primary tissue of the plumbagin biosynthesis and accumulation. The complete biosynthetic pathway of plumbagin in plant is still obscure. The present study attempts to understand the plumbagin biosynthetic pathway with the help of differential transcriptome and metabolome analysis of P. zeylanica leaf and root. The transcriptome data showed co-expression of Aldo-keto reductase (PzAKR), Polyketide cyclase (Pzcyclase) and Cytochrome P450 (PzCYPs) transcripts along with the Polyketide synthase (PzPKS) transcripts. Their higher expression in root as compared to leaf supports their possible involvement in plumbagin biosynthesis. The metabolome data of leaf and root revealed naphthalene derivative isoshinanolone that could be potential precursor of plumbagin. Pathway elucidation and transcriptome data of P. zeylanica, will enable and accelerate research on naphthoquinone biosynthesis in plants.","Vasav, Arati P; Pable, Anupama A; Barvkar, Vitthal T",Fitoterapia,,386

261277,Pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19: the potential role for antifibrotic therapy,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Diabetes is one of the most frequent comorbidities in people with COVID-19 with a prevalence that varies between 7 and 30%. Diabetics infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a higher rate of hospital admission, severe pneumonia, and higher mortality compared to non-diabetic subjects. Chronic hyperglycemia can compromise innate and humoral immunity. Furthermore, diabetes is associated with a low-grade chronic inflammatory state that favors the development of an exaggerated inflammatory response and therefore the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recent evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of causing direct damage to the pancreas that could worsen hyperglycemia and even induce the onset of diabetes in previously non-diabetic subjects. Therapeutic strategies should be aimed at facilitating patient access to the healthcare system. Control of blood glucose and comorbidities must be individualized in order to reduce the incidence of complications and decrease the burden on health systems. In this article we will review the pathophysiological mechanisms that explain the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus, its implication in the prognosis and management of hyperglycemia in this group of patients.","Lima-Martínez, Marcos M; Carrera Boada, Carlos; Madera-Silva, Marialaura D; Marín, Waleskha; Contreras, Miguel",Clin. investig. arterioscler.

They have many pharmaceutical and/or nutritional functions, and have been widely applied in medical, food, and cosmetics industries. Recently, terpenoids have been used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 due to the good antiviral activities. The increasing demand for terpenoids in international markets poses a serious threat to many plant species. For environmentally sustainable development, microbial cell factories have been utilized as the promising platform to produce terpenoids. Nevertheless, the bioproduction of most terpenoids cannot meet commercial requirements due to the low cost-benefit ratio until now. The biosynthetic potential of endophytes has gained attention in recent decades owing to the continual discovery of endophytes capable of synthesizing plant bioactive compounds. Accordingly, endophytes could be alternative sources of terpenoid-producing strains or terpenoid synthetic genes. In this review, we summarized the research progress describing the main and supporting roles of endophytes in terpenoid biosynthesis and biotransformation, and discussed the current problems and challenges which may prevent the further exploitation. This review will improve our understanding of endophyte resources for terpenoid production in industry in the future. The four main research interests on endophytes for terpenoid production. A: Isolation of terpenoid-producing endophytes; B: The heterologous expression of endophyte-derived terpenoid synthetic genes; C: Endophytes promoting their hosts' terpenoid production.

263340,Testing olfactory dysfunction in acute and recovered COVID-19 patients: a single center study in Italy,2021,"It is true that the world we have today is not the world we use to know. The Covid-19 pandemic has paralyzed all sector, hence the need for safety and enabling environment for mankind is of high importance. Adsorption technology is far the best and cheapest treatment technology for water and has extensively proven its worth for the uptake of micro-pollutant from surface, ground and water which are the major channels of home water. Over the years activated carbon is considered as the most common and universally used adsorbent for the eradication of different types of micro-pollutants from water. The contamination of surface water by micro-pollutant is a potential threat for the production of high quality and safe drinking water. Adsorption operation onto granulated activated carbon (GAC) in fixed-bed filters is often applied as a remedying step in the synthesis of safe and drinkable water. Activated carbon actively tends to act as a carrier material for a thin usually resistant layer of microorganisms (mostly bacteria) that forms on the coat of various surfaces (biofilm), hence biological simplification can be an alternative removal approach that can be adopted in granulated activated carbon filters. To evaluate the capacity of biofilm to biologically simplify micro-pollutants, it is very imperative to distinguish adsorption from biological simplification (biodegradation) as a removal mechanism. Experiment was carried out under the operating condition of a temperature range of 6?C to 20?C with biologically activated and autoclaved GAC to assess the biological simplification by the biofilm adsorbed on the GAC surface. Five micro-pollutants were selected as model compounds, of which some of them were biologically simplified by the GAC biofilm. Additionally, we observed that temperature can increase or decrease adsorption. Conclusively, comparison was made on the adsorption capacity of granulated activated carbon used for more than 50,000 beds.","Tanimola, H.; Owolabi, J.; Awoyemi, E.; Kayode, B.",Journal of Environmental Protection,,386

Specifically, we studied the antibody response ofâ¯three solid organ transplant recipient patients, three patients who take daily inhaled fluticasone, and a patient on etanercept and daily inhaled fluticasone, and compared them to five patients not on exogenous immunosuppression. RESULTS: We found that the solid organ transplant patients on full immunosuppression are at risk of having a delayed antibody response and poor outcome. We did not find evidence that inhaled steroids nor etanercept predisposeâ¯patientsâ¯to delayed immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

Thirty-six NP/OP specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and subjected to thermal inactivation (60°C for 30 min) or the RNA extraction processes to activate the form. Here, our data showed that the concentration of extracted-RNA increases upon thermal inactivation compared to the active form (p = .028). Significantly higher levels of RNA copy number were obtained in inactivated compared to the active samples for both N and ORF1ab genes (p = .009, p = .032, respectively).

The relentless spread and pathogenicity of the virus have become a global public health emergency. One of the striking features of this pandemic is the pronounced impact on specific regions and ethnic groups. In particular, compared with East Asia, where the virus first emerged, SARS-CoV-2 has caused high rates of morbidity and mortality in Europe. This has not been experienced in past global viral infections, such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and is unique to SARS-CoV-2. For this reason, we investigated the involvement of genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related genes, because ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We found that the ACE1 II genotype frequency in a population was significantly negatively correlated with the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Similarly, the ACE1 II genotype was negatively correlated with the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data suggest that the ACE1 II genotype may influence the prevalence and clinical outcome of COVID-19 and serve as a predictive marker for COVID-19 risk and severity.","Yamamoto, Naoki; Ariumi, Yasuo; Nishida, Nao; Yamamoto, Rain; Bauer, Georg; Gojobori, Takashi; Shimotohno, Kunitada; Mizokami, Masashi",Gene,,386

To define whether patients under treatment with biologics suffer from increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, compared to psoriatic patients treated only with topical drugs, we designed an observational monocentric prevalence study recording the personal and clinical data of psoriatic patients, with focus on the presentation of signs and symptoms related to COVID-19 in the period of time ranging from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. A total of 180 patients were enrolled into two groups: 100 patients in the topical therapy group and 80 patients in the biological therapy group. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 infection and symptoms at a bivariable analysis with adjustment for confounders.

266805,Outcomes of Patients Presenting with Headaches Hospitalized with COVID-19,2020,"A small number of individuals infected within a community can lead to the rapid spread of the disease throughout that community, leading to an epidemic outbreak. This is even more true for highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19, known to be caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Mathematical models of epidemics allow estimating several impacts on the population and, therefore, are of great use for the definition of public health policies. Some of these measures include the isolation of the infected (also known as quarantine), and the vaccination of the susceptible. In a possible scenario in which a vaccine is available, but with limited access, it is necessary to quantify the levels of vaccination to be applied, taking into account the continued application of preventive measures. This work concerns the simulation of the spread of the COVID-19 disease in a community by applying the Monte Carlo method to a Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) stochastic epidemic model. To handle the computational effort involved, a simple parallelization approach was adopted and deployed in a small HPC cluster. The developed computational method allows to realistically simulate the spread of COVID-19 in a medium-sized community and to study the effect of preventive measures such as quarantine and vaccination. The results show that an effective combination of vaccination with quarantine can prevent the appearance of major epidemic outbreaks, even if the critical vaccination coverage is not reached.","Balsa, Carlos; Lopes, Isabel; Guarda, Teresa; Rufino, José",Comput Math Organ Theory,,386

As a result, many pathology residency programs offered preinterview virtual open-house events to meet prospective applicants before the interview season. This article aims to understand applicants' perspective on those events during the residency recruitment season of 2020 to 2021. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey-based study involving 95 pathology residency applicants. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that applicants generally have a positive perception of open house events; 91% found virtual open-house events beneficial, 63.2% attended open-house events for programs they were not considering applying to. Considering the high number of offered virtual open house events, 17% of applicants felt overwhelmed by attendance and 30% felt obligated to attend. CONCLUSIONS: This brief report demonstrates the generally positive impact of these events.","Salah, Haneen T; Mirza, Kamran M",Am. j. clin. pathol,,386

We aimed to assess which intervention components and contextual factors may contribute to the successful delivery and implementation of primary care-led post-diagnostic dementia care. METHODS: Mixed-methods systematic review. We searched five databases (inception-March 2019) with reference list screening and citation tracking. We included studies evaluating post-diagnostic dementia care interventions where primary care had a significant role in dementia care, which assessed one or more implementation elements (acceptability, feasibility, adoption, sustainability, reach, costs, appropriateness or fidelity). Two authors independently critically appraised studies. RESULTS: Out of 4528 unique references, we screened 380 full texts and included 49 evaluations of services collecting implementation process data. Most services had high acceptability ratings. The most acceptable components were information provision, social and emotional support and links to community organisations. Feasibility was chiefly influenced by provider engagement and leadership, building dementia care capacity, sufficient resources/funding and collaboration. Care quality was maximised through adding capacity from a dementia-specific health professional. On the basis of limited data, costs for various primary care-led models did not substantially differ from each other. CONCLUSION: A range of primary care-led dementia care models appear feasible and acceptable. Future services should: add dementia-focussed health professionals into primary care, develop primary care leadership and provide sufficient funding and collaboration opportunities. Information, community service links and social and ongoing support should be part of services. Further exploration of service reach and formalised fidelity assessment are needed.","Frost, Rachael; Rait, Greta; Aw, Su; Brunskill, Greta; Wilcock, Jane; Robinson, Louise; Knapp, Martin; Hogan, Nicole; Harrison Dening, Karen; Allan, Louise; Manthorpe, Jill; Walters, Kate",Aging Ment Health,,386

Their ability to be agile and adaptive has been stressed, particularly in regard to the timing of policy measures, the level of decision centralization, the autonomy of decisions and the balance between change and stability. In this contribution we use our observations of responses to COVID-19 to reflect on agility and adaptive governance and provide tools to evaluate it after the dust has settled. Whereas agility relates mainly to the speed of response within given structures, adaptivity implies system-level changes throughout government. Existing institutional structures and tools can enable adaptivity and agility, which can be complimentary approaches. However, agility sometimes conflicts with adaptability. Our analysis points to the paradoxical nature of adaptive governance. Indeed, successful adaptive governance calls for both decision speed and sound analysis, for both centralized and decentralized decision-making, for both innovation and bureaucracy, and both science and politics.","Janssen, Marijn; van der Voort, Haiko",Int J Inf Manage,,386
273926,PORTABLE SINGLE-LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM DEVICE IS ACCURATE FOR QTc EVALUATION IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS,2021,"Introduction Postoperative delirium (POD) affects 10-70% of patients 60 years or older and has been linked to increasing length of hospitalization, mortality, and morbidity. Pre-existing cognitive impairment is a predictor of POD. COVID-19 restricted use of in-person cognitive screens. The Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) can screen for cognitive dysfunction remotely. We evaluated the feasibility of administering T-MoCA in a multiethnic population during pre-operative testing televisits. Methods Patients scheduled for surgery between July 2020 and August 2020 were asked to participate in the T-MoCA at the end of their preadmission testing (PAT) televisit. A retrospective chart review was conducted to collect patient comorbidities and demographics. Patients were stratified by negative (T-MoCA≥19) or positive (T-MoCA&lt;19) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and compared using 2-tailed χ2-tests. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify associations between patient characteristics and positive T-MoCA result. Results Fifty out of 65 (77%) patients who consented to the T-MoCA completed the test. The average time to complete the assessment was 10.5 mins. Twenty two (44%) had a negative score and 28 (56%) had a positive score. Patients who had a positive T-MoCA were older (70.04±7.61 yrs) compared to those with a negative T-MoCA (67.68±4.69 yrs, p=0.007), although the distribution of patients above and below age 65 was not different (p=0.243). The two groups did not vary by gender, race/ethnicity, obesity, surgery type, or medical co-morbidities. When we examined our population for predictors of a positive T-MoCA, we found a trend toward men being less likely to score positive on T-MoCA (OR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.10-1.10, p=0.07) compared to women;and that patients with Hispanic race/ethnicity were more likely to test positive on the T-MoCA (OR=4.13, 95% CI: 0.84-20.28, p=0.08) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Conclusions Implementation of the T-MoCA in a telemedicine-based PAT setting is feasible. In our cohort, most people who consented to the assessment completed it, and more than half scored positively, which may have important implications on the surgical plan and post-operative recovery. There may be limitations in using T-MoCA in certain populations, such as non-English preferred language, hearing difficulties, lack of focus, and use of external aids, which would need to be explored in a larger sample size.","Yu, Nick C.; Zhu, Denzel Watts Kara L.; Abraham, Nitya Choice Curtis",Perioperative Care and Operating Room Management,,386

This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on access to and utilization of various HIV prevention services among PWID with opioid use disorder (OUD). We interviewed 110 PWID enrolled in medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) treatment (e.g., methadone) between May and October, 2020 to identify if this sample experienced changed in access to the following services due to the COVID-19 pandemic: (a) HIV or sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, (b) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services, (c) HIV counselor or doctor appointments, and (d) clean injection equipment. A majority of the sample reported that COVID-19 had not changed their access to HIV testing or access to STI testing. Almost half of the sample reported that getting an appointment with a doctor decreased due to COVID-19. Participants reported that access to a lab or blood testing, access to injection equipment, and sessions with a case manager or counselor decreased. One-fourth of the 32 participants who were taking PrEP before the onset of COVID-19 reported that they had trouble getting their PrEP prescription due to COVID-19, and some reported that they had difficulty getting the PrEP prescription filled at their pharmacy. Our results indicate that PWID did not experience reduced access to HIV or STI testing, but difficulties in obtaining appointments with HIV counselors or doctors and limited access to PrEP were presented. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce the adverse effects of COVID-19 on HIV prevention among PWID.","Mistler, Colleen B; Curley, Christine M; Rosen, Aviana O; El-Krab, Renee; Wickersham, Jeffrey A; Copenhaver, Michael M; Khati, Antoine; Shrestha, Roman",J. community health,,386

275437,Lung Ultrasound as a Triage Tool in an Emergency Setting during the Covid-19 Outbreak: comparison with CT Findings,2020,"BACKGROUND: Los Angeles County is a hub for COVID-19 cases in the United States. Academic health centers rapidly deployed and leveraged telemedicine to permit uninterrupted care of patients. Telemedicine enjoys high patient satisfaction, yet little is known about the level of satisfaction during a crisis and to what extent patient- or visit-related factors and trust play when in-person visits are eliminated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine correlates of patients' satisfaction with a telemedicine visit. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study conducted in our single-institution, urban, academic medical center in Los Angeles, internal medicine patients aged &#8805;18 years who completed a telemedicine visit between March 10th and April 17th, 2020, were invited for a survey (n=1624). Measures included patient demographics, degree of interpersonal trust in patient-physician relationships (using the Trust in Physician Scale), and visit-related concerns. Statistical analysis used descriptive statistics, Spearman rank-order correlation, and linear and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1624 telemedicine visits conducted during this period, 368 (22.7%) patients participated in the survey. Across the study, respondents were very satisfied (173/365, 47.4%) or satisfied (n=129, 35.3%) with their telemedicine visit. Higher physician trust was associated with higher patient satisfaction (Spearman correlation r=0.51, P<.001). Visit-related factors with statistically significant correlation with Trust in Physician score were technical issues with the telemedicine visit (r=-0.16), concerns about privacy (r=-0.19), concerns about cost (r=-0.23), satisfaction with telemedicine convenience (r=0.41), and amount of time spent (r=0.47; all P<.01). Visit-related factors associated with patients' satisfaction included fewer technical issues (P<.001), less concern about privacy (P<.001) or cost (P=.02), and successful face-to-face video (P<.001). The only patient variable with a significant positive association was income and level of trust in physician (r=0.18, P<.001). Younger age was associated with higher satisfaction with the telemedicine visit (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: There have been calls for redesigning primary care after the COVID-19 pandemic and for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Their satisfaction is shaped by the degree of trust in physician and visit-related factors more so than patient factors. This has widespread implications for outpatient practices and further research into visit-related factors and the patient-provider connection over telemedicine is needed.","Orrange, Sharon; Patel, Arpna; Mack, Wendy Jean; Cassetta, Julia",JMIR Hum Factors,,386

This study aims to identify specific lab markers, complications, and treatments that may be associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. This study is retrospective in nature; it included 217 COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to a ProMedica Health System hospital in Northwest Ohio, United States, between March 25 and June 16, 2020. We collected various laboratory values, complications, and treatment courses. T test and &#967;2 analyses were used to predict mortality. COVID-19 test was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction. Of 217 patients included in the study, the mean age of the population was 63.13 (SD, 17.8), of which 194 (89.4%, mean age 61.7 years) survived while 23 (10.6%, mean age 74.6 years) died. Among them, 53% were females and 47% male. Laboratory values that were associated with mortality were low hemoglobin (p = .0046), elevated INR (p = .0005), low platelets (p = .0246) and elevated procalcitonin (p = .0472). Marginally significant laboratory values included elevated troponin (p = .0661), and elevated creatinine (p = .0741). Treatment with either antibiotic, antifungals, antivirals, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation were all statistically significant for mortality. COVID-19 related complications with either ARDS, myocarditis, elevated INR, septic shock, or age greater than 63 were significant predictors of mortality. Low hemoglobin, elevated INR, Low platelet, elevated procalcitonin, treated with either antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation are associated with high mortality related to COVID-19 infection. Healthcare professionals must be aware of these predictors.","Merugu, Ganesh Prasad; Nesheiwat, Zeid; Balla, Mamtha; Patel, Mitra; Fatima, Rawish; Sheikh, Taha; Kotturi, Vinay; Bommana, Venugopala; Pulagam, Gautham; Kaminski, Brian",J Med Virol,,386

India has also achieved a significant reduction in malaria burden in 2018 and has committed to eliminate malaria by 2030. The Mandla Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) was started in 2017 in 1233 villages of District Mandla to demonstrate malaria elimination in a tribal district with hard-to-reach areas was possible using active and passive surveillance, case management, vector control, and targeted information, education and communication campaigns. An operational plan was developed to strengthen the existing surveillance and malaria elimination systems, through fortnightly active case detection to ensure that all cases including those that are introduced into the communities are rapidly identified and treated promptly. The plan also focused on the reduction of human-mosquito contact through the use of Long-Lasting Insecticial Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spray (IRS). The operational plan was modified in view of the present COVID-19 pandemic by creating systems of assistance for the local administration for COVID-related work while ensuring the operational integrity of malaria elimination efforts. RESULTS: The use of MEDP study design and operational plan, with its built-in management control systems, has yielded significant (91%) reduction of indigenous cases of malaria during the period from June 2017 to May 2020. The malaria positivity rate was 0.33% in 2017-18, 0.13% in 2018-19, and 0.06% in 2019-20. Mass screening revealed 0.18% malaria positivity in September-October 2018, followed by 0.06% in June 2019, and 0.03% in December 2019, and these were mostly asymptomatic cases in the community. The project has been able to sustain the gains of the past three years during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: This paper provides the study design and the operational plan for malaria elimination in a high-burden district of Central India, which presented difficulties of hard to reach areas, forest malaria, and complex epidemiology of urban and rural malaria. The lessons learned could be used for malaria elimination efforts in rest of the country and other parts of South Asia with comparable demography and epidemiology.","Rajvanshi, Harsh; Bharti, Praveen K; Nisar, Sekh; Jain, Yashpal; Jayswar, Himanshu; Mishra, Ashok K; Sharma, Ravendra K; Saha, Kalyan B; Shukla, Man Mohan; Das, Aparup; Kaur, Harpreet; Wattal, Suman L; Singh, Neeru; Lal, Altaf A",Malar J,,386

METHODS: Databases were searched in using terms ""trauma"" or ""violence"" and ""COVID-19,"" yielding 4,473 records (2,194 de-duplicated). Exclusion criteria included non-hospital based studies and studies not reporting on violent trauma. 44 studies were included in the final review. RESULTS: Most studies reported no change in violent trauma incidence. Studies predominately assessed trends with violent trauma as a proportion of all trauma. All studies demonstrating an increase in violent trauma were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: A disproportionate rise in violence has been reported within the US. However, most studies examined violent trauma as a proportion of all trauma; results may reflect relative changes from lockdowns. Future studies should examine rates of violent trauma to provide additional context.","Beiter, Kaylin; Hayden, Ellery; Phillippi, Stephen; Conrad, Erich; Hunt, John",Am. j. surg,,386

As a cost-effective and powerful method, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays an important role in numerically solving environmental fluid mechanics. Besides, with the development of computer science, an increasing number of researchers start to analyze pathogen transmission by using CFD methods. Inspired by the impact of COVID-19, this review summarizes research works of pathogen transmission based on CFD methods with different models and algorithms. Defining the pathogen as the particle or gaseous in CFD simulation is a common method and epidemic models are used in some investigations to rise the authenticity of calculation. Although it is not so difficult to describe the physical characteristics of pathogens, how to describe the biological characteristics of it is still a big challenge in the CFD simulation. A series of investigations which analyzed pathogen transmission in different environments (hospital, teaching building, etc) demonstrated the effect of airflow on pathogen transmission and emphasized the importance of reasonable ventilation. Finally, this review presented three advanced methods: LBM method, Porous Media method, and Web-based forecasting method. Although CFD methods mentioned in this review may not alleviate the current pandemic situation, it helps researchers realize the transmission mechanisms of pathogens like viruses and bacteria and provides guidelines for reducing infection risk in epidemic or pandemic situations.","Peng, Shanbi; Chen, Qikun; Liu, Enbin",Sci Total Environ,,386

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is the first edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19. We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review is based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines, and our 8-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and nonserious adverse events. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until August 7, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 33 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 13,312 participants. All trials were at overall high risk of bias. We identified one trial randomizing 6,425 participants to dexamethasone versus standard care. This trial showed evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.93; p < 0.001; low certainty) and on mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.62-0.95; p = 0.021; low certainty). It was possible to perform meta-analysis of 10 comparisons. Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between remdesivir versus placebo on all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37; p = 0.34, I2 = 58%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80-1.11; p = 0.48, I2 = 29%; 2 trials; low certainty). Meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect of remdesivir versus placebo on serious adverse events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p = 0.009, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) mainly driven by respiratory failure in one trial. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses showed that we could exclude the possibility that hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.97-1.19; p = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) and serious adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96-1.18; p = 0.21; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) by 20% or more, and meta-analysis showed evidence of a harmful effect on nonserious adverse events (RR 2.40; 95% CI 2.01-2.87; p < 0.00001; I2 = 90%; 6 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between lopinavir-ritonavir versus standard care on serious adverse events (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.39-1.04; p = 0.07, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.85-1.53; p = 0.38, I2 = 75%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between convalescent plasma versus standard care on all-cause mortality (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.33-1.10; p = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Five single trials showed statistically significant results but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. None of the remaining trials showed evidence of a difference on our predefined outcomes. Because of the lack of relevant data, it was not possible to perform other meta-analyses, network meta-analysis, or individual patient data meta-analyses. The main limitation of this living review is the paucity of data currently available. Furthermore, the included trials were all at risks of systematic errors and random errors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that dexamethasone and remdesivir might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients, but the certainty of the evidence was low to very low, so more trials are needed. We can exclude the possibility of hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reducing the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20% or more. Otherwise, no evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of COVID-19.","Juul, Sophie; Nielsen, Emil Eik; Feinberg, Joshua; Siddiqui, Faiza; Jørgensen, Caroline Kamp; Barot, Emily; Nielsen, Niklas; Bentzer, Peter; Veroniki, Areti Angeliki; Thabane, Lehana; Bu, Fanlong; Klingenberg, Sarah; Gluud, Christian; Jakobsen, Janus Christian",PLoS Med,,386

Notwithstanding, the relationship between health systems and the magnitude of COVID-19 in African countries have not received research attention. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the pervasiveness of the pandemic across African countries and their Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 54 countries in five regions viz Western (16); Eastern (18); Middle (8); Northern (7); and Southern (5) Africa. The outcome variables in this study were the total confirmed COVID-19 cases (per million); total recoveries (per million); and the total deaths (per million). The data were subjected to Spearman's rank-order (Spearman's rho) correlation to determine the monotonic relationship between each of the predictor variables and the outcome variables. The predictor variables that showed a monotonic relationship with the outcome were used to predict respective outcome variables using multiple regressions. The statistical analysis was conducted at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Our results indicate that total number of COVID-19 cases (per million) has strong correlations (rs >0.5) with the median age; aged 65 older; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; number of hospital beds per thousand; Human Development Index (HDI); recoveries (per million); and the overall risk environment of a country. All these factors including the country's commitments to improving national capacity were related to the total number of deaths (per million). Also, strong correlations existed between the total recoveries (per million) and the total number of positive cases; total deaths (per million); median age; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; the number of hospital beds (per thousand); and HDI. The fitted regression models showed strong predictive powers (R-squared>99%) of the variances in the total number of COVID-19 cases (per million); total number of deaths (per million); and the total recoveries (per million). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that patient-level characteristics such as ageing population (i.e., 65+), poverty, underlying co-morbidities-cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension), and diabetes through unhealthy behaviours like smoking as well as hospital care (i.e., beds per thousand) can help explain COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality rates in Africa. Aside from these, other determinants (e.g., population density, the ability of detection, prevention and control) also affect COVID-19 prevalence, deaths and recoveries within African countries and sub-regions.","Amadu, Iddrisu; Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku; Afitiri, Abdul-Rahaman; Seidu, Abdul-Aziz; Ameyaw, Edward Kwabena; Hagan, John Elvis; Duku, Eric; Aram, Simon Appah",PLoS One,,386

Specific primers were designed based on the conserved region of the FeAstV ORF1b gene. Experiments for specificity, sensitivity, and repeatability of the assay were carried out. In addition, the assay was evaluated using clinical samples. Specificity analysis indicated that the assay showed negative results with samples of Feline Parvovirus, Feline Herpesvirus, Feline Calicivirus, Feline Bocavirus, and Feline Coronavirus, indicating good specificity of the assay. Sensitivity analysis showed that the SYBR Green I-based real-time RT-PCR method could detect as low as 3.72 × 101 copies/µL of template, which is 100-fold more sensitive compared to the conventional RT-PCR. Both intra-assay and inter-assay variability were lower than 1 %, indicating good reproducibility. Furthermore, an analysis of 150 fecal samples showed that the positive detection rate of SYBR Green I-based real-time RT-PCR was higher than that of the conventional RT-PCR, indicating the high reliability of the method. The assay is cheap and effective. Therefore, it could provide support for the detection of FeAstV in large-scale clinical testing and epidemiological investigation.","Wang, Yong; Fu, Ziteng; Guo, Xu; Zhang, Da; Bai, Caixia; Li, Wei; Liu, Guangqing; Li, Yongdong; Jiang, Shudong",J Virol Methods,,386

One major concern for viral transmission to both patients and providers is performing aerosol-generating procedures such as endoscopy. As such, we performed a prospective study to examine the extent of viral contamination present in the local environment before and after endoscopic procedures on COVID-19 positive patients. Materials and methods A total of 82 samples were collected from 23 surfaces in the procedure area of four COVID-positive patients undergoing upper endoscopic procedures. Samples were collected both before and after the procedure. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was extracted and quantified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction with primers to detect nucleocapsid RNA, and results reported as the number of viral copies per square centimeter of contaminated surface. Results A total of six positive samples were detected from three of the four patients. The floor beneath the patient bed was the most common site of viral RNA, but RNA was also detected on the ventilator monitor prior to the procedure and the endoscope after the procedure. Conclusions The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with upper endoscopy procedures is low based on the low rate of surface contamination. Some surfaces in close proximity to the patient and endoscopist may pose a higher risk for contamination. Patient positioning and oxygen delivery methods may influence the directionality and extent of viral spread. Our results support the use of appropriate personal protection to minimize risk of viral transmission.","Somerville, C. C.; Shoaib, M.; Kuschner, C. E.; Brune, Z.; Trindade, A. J.; Benias, P.

It is unknown if these patients should be considered a vulnerable group in healthcare delivery and healthcare recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the following question: In which hospitalised patients with proven COVID-19 and with underlying CVD and cardiovascular risk factors should doctors be alert to a poor outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality and intensive care unit admission. Medline and Embase databases were searched using relevant search terms until 9 June 2020. After systematic analysis, 8 studies were included. RESULTS: Based on the literature search, there was insufficient evidence that CVD and cardiovascular risk factors are significant predictors of mortality and poor outcome in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Due to differences in methodology, the level of evidence of all studies was graded 'very low' according to the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. It is expected that in the near future, two multinational and multicentre European registries (CAPACITY-COVID and LEOSS) will offer more insight into outcome in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: This literature review demonstrated there was insufficient evidence to identify CVD and cardiovascular risk factors as important predictors of poor outcome in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. However, patients with CVD and cardiovascular risk factors remain vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. As such, governmental and public health COVID-19 recommendations for vulnerable groups apply to these patients.","Jewbali, L S D; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Belfroid, E; Jansen, C W; Asselbergs, F W; Siebelink, H J",Neth Heart J,,386

293880,A storm off the charts: a case of thyroid storm due to thyrotoxicosis factitia,2021,"The literature on the approach/avoidance training (AAT) effect has focused on its evaluative consequences (with approached stimuli evaluated as more positive than avoided ones). Building on a grounded cognition framework, we investigated AAT effects on the visual representation of stimuli (here, neutral faces). We formulated specific predictions regarding the facial features that should be the most biased and the conditions under which the effect should be the strongest. We tested these predictions in five preregistered experiments using a reverse correlation paradigm. In Experiments 1-2, the facial representations resulting from an AAT looked more ""approachable"" and ""avoidable,"" respectively. Specifically, we observed more bias on facial traits related to approach/avoidance (e.g., trustworthiness) than on traits less relevant for these actions (e.g., cleverness). Experiment 2 additionally tested the unique contribution of both approach and avoidance as compared to control actions. Experiments 3A-4 showed that this effect depends on experiencing the AAT (compared to the mere instructions of approach/avoidance) and on the sensory aspects of approach/avoidance that are mimicked in the AAT. Finally, Experiment 5 supported the idea that the AAT effect still emerges in the absence of explicit instructions of approach/avoidance (i.e., by only leaving the sensory aspects of approach/avoidance). The present research enriches the literature by revealing AAT effects that extend beyond mere evaluative consequences to the visual representation of the target stimuli. Our results also inform existing theoretical views on AAT effects.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at a university outpatient clinic of obstetric and gynecology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group, who was prescribed a mobile meditation app for 30 days, or the control group, which received standard care. The primary outcome was self-reported perceived stress. Secondary outcomes included self-reported depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and satisfaction with the meditation app. A sample size of 80 participants (40 per group) was calculated to achieve 84% power to detect a 3-point difference in the primary outcome. RESULTS: From April to May 2020, 101 women were randomized in the study-50 in the meditation app group and 51 in the control group. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Most characteristics were similar between groups. Perceived stress was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (mean difference 4.27, 95% CI 1.30-7.24, P=.005, d=0.69 and mean difference 4.28, 95% CI 1.68-6.88, P=.002, d=0.69, respectively). Self-reported depression and anxiety were significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (depression: P=.002 and P=.04; anxiety: P=.01, and P=.04, respectively). Sleep disturbance was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (P=.001 and P=.02, respectively). More than 80% of those in the intervention group reported high satisfaction with the meditation app, and 93% reported that mindfulness meditation improved their stress. CONCLUSION: Outpatient obstetric and gynecology patients who used the prescribed consumer-based mobile meditation app during the COVID-19 pandemic had significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance compared with standard care.

How should we train a language model in this scenario? Most language modeling research considers either a small dataset with a closed vocabulary (like the standard 1 million token Penn Treebank), or the whole web with byte-pair encoding. We show that for our target setting in English, initialising and freezing input embeddings using in-domain data can improve language model performance by providing a useful representation of rare words, and this pattern holds across several different domains. In the process, we show that the standard convention of tying input and output embeddings does not improve perplexity when initializing with embeddings trained on in-domain data.","Welch, Charles; Mihalcea, Rada; Kummerfeld, Jonathan K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14109v2.pdf,386

295983,Prolonged nucleic acid conversion and false-negative RT-PCR results in patients with COVID-19: A case series,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is considerable evidence of widespread emotional distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing number of studies have assessed posttraumatic growth related to the current pandemic; but, none have considered whether reported growth is real or illusory (i.e., characterized by avoidant or defensive coping that results in higher levels of distress). The purpose of this study was to extend this literature by assessing growth specific to the pandemic in people reporting high levels of COVID-related stress and estimating the extent of real and illusory COVID-19-related growth. METHODS: Participants were 893 adults from Canada and the United States with high levels of COVID-related stress who provided complete responses on measures of posttraumatic growth, disability, and measures of general and COVID-related distress as part of a larger longitudinal survey. RESULTS: Approximately 77 % of participants reported moderate to high growth in at least one respect, the most common being developing greater appreciation for healthcare workers, for the value of one's own life, for friends and family, for each day, as well as changing priorities about what is important in life and greater feelings of self-reliance. Consistent with predictions, cluster analysis identified two clusters characterized by high growth, one comprising 32 % of the sample and reflective of real growth (i.e., reporting little disability and stable symptoms across time) and the other comprising 17 % of the sample and reflective of illusory growth (i.e., reporting high disability and worsening symptoms). These clusters did not differ in terms of socially desirable response tendencies; but, the illusory growth cluster reported greater increases in alcohol use since onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Consistent with research regarding personal growth in response to prior pandemics and COVID-19, we found evidence to suggest moderate to high levels of COVID-related growth with respect to appreciation for healthcare workers, life, friends and family, and self-reliance. Findings from our cluster analysis support the thesis that many reports of COVID-related personal growth reflect ineffectual pandemic-related coping as opposed to true growth. These findings have important implications for developing strategies to optimize stress resilience and posttraumatic growth during chronically stressful events such as pandemics.","Asmundson, Gordon J G; Paluszek, Michelle M; Taylor, Steven",J Anxiety Disord,,386

299183,Lung Ultrasound vs. Chest X-Ray Study for the Radiographic Diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia in a High-Prevalence Population,2021,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is spreading worldwide. To date, no specific treatment has convincingly demonstrated its efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir have potential interest, but virological and clinical data are scarce, especially in critically ill patients. METHODS: The present report took the opportunity of compassionate use and successive drug shortages to compare the effects of two therapeutic options, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, as compared to standard of care only. The primary outcomes were treatment escalation (intubation, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support, or renal replacement therapy) after day 1 until day 28. Secondary outcomes included ventilator-free days at day 28, mortality at day 14 and day 28, treatment safety issues and changes in respiratory tracts, and plasma viral load (as estimated by cycle threshold value) between admission and day 7. RESULTS: Eighty patients were treated during a 4-week period and included in the analysis: 22 (28%) received standard of care only, 20 (25%) patients received lopinavir/ritonavir associated to standard of care, and 38 (47%) patients received hydroxychloroquine and standard of care. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 3 groups. Treatment escalation occurred in 9 (41%), 10 (50%), and 15 (39%) patients who received standard of care only, standard of care and lopinavir/ritonavir, and standard of care and hydroxychloroquine, respectively (p = 0.567). There was no significant difference between groups regarding the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 and mortality at day 14 and day 28. Finally, there was no significant change between groups in viral respiratory or plasma load between admission and day 7. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, no difference was found between hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir as compared to standard of care only on the proportion of patients who needed treatment escalation at day 28. Further randomized controlled trials are required to demonstrate whether these drugs may be useful in this context.","Lecronier, Marie; Beurton, Alexandra; Burrel, Sonia; Haudebourg, Luc; Deleris, Robin; Le Marec, Julien; Virolle, Sara; Nemlaghi, Safaa; Bureau, Côme; Mora, Pierre; De Sarcus, Martin; Clovet, Olivier; Duceau, Baptiste; Grisot, Paul Henri; Pari, Marie Hélène; Arzoine, Jérémy; Clarac, Ulrich; Boutolleau, David; Raux, Mathieu; Delemazure, Julie; Faure, Morgane; Decavele, Maxens; Morawiec, Elise; Mayaux, Julien; Demoule, Alexandre; Dres, Martin",Crit Care,,386

However, studies quantifying the benefit of specific distancing strategies to prevent transmission, such as keeping aircraft cabin middle seats vacant, are limited. Using bacteriophage MS2 virus as a surrogate for airborne SARS-CoV-2, CDC and Kansas State University (KSU) modeled the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 exposure and aircraft seating proximity, including full occupancy and vacant middle seat occupancy scenarios. Compared with exposures in full occupancy scenarios, relative exposure in vacant middle seat scenarios was reduced by 23% to 57% depending upon the modeling approach. A 23% exposure reduction was observed for a single passenger who was in the same row and two seats away from the SARS-COV-2 source, rather than in an adjacent middle seat. When quantifying exposure reduction to a full 120-passenger cabin rather than to a single person, exposure reductions ranging from 35.0% to 39.4% were predicted. A 57% exposure reduction was observed under the vacant middle seat condition in a scenario involving a three-row section that contained a mix of SARS-CoV-2 sources and other passengers. Based on this laboratory model, a vacant middle seat reduces risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from nearby passengers. These data suggest that increasing physical distance between passengers and lowering passenger density could help reduce potential COVID-19 exposures during air travel. Physical distancing of airplane passengers, including through policies such as middle seat vacancy, could provide additional reductions in SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk.","Dietrich, Watts L; Bennett, James S; Jones, Byron W; Hosni, Mohammad H",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,386

Few studies have highlighted the prognostic value of blood findings such as lymphopenia, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, LDH, CRP, cardiac troponin, low-density lipoproteins and chest radiographic abnormality. A study of progressions of blood and radiological results may help to identify patients at high risk of severe outcomes. This systematic review aimed to assess the temporal progression of blood and radiology findings of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted on Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify articles published for peripheral blood investigation and radiological results of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included in this review. The common laboratory features reported include lymphopenia, elevated levels of C-reactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase. For radiological signs, ground-glass opacifications, consolidations, and crazy paving patterns were frequently reported. There is a correlation between lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and biomarkers such as C-reactive proteins and lactate dehydrogenase; at a later phase of the disease (more than 7 days since onset of symptoms), lymphopenia worsens while neutrophil count, C-reactive protein levels and lactate dehydrogenase levels increase. Frequencies of ground-glass opacifications and ground-glass opacifications with consolidations decrease at a later phase of the disease while that of consolidation and crazy paving pattern rises as the disease progresses. More extensive lung involvement was also seen more frequently in the later phases. CONCLUSION: The correlation between temporal progression and the reported blood and radiological results may be helpful to monitor and evaluate disease progression and severity.","Lim, Albert Yick Hou; Goh, Jun Leng; Chua, Mae Chui Wei; Heng, Bee Hoon; Abisheganaden, John Arputham; George, Pradeep Paul",BMC Pulm Med,,386

Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has frequently been reported in patients with COVID-19, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and hematological alterations. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly recommended for patients who require chronic anticoagulation to continue therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. To avoid regular and frequent blood tests and unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during contacts with medical personnel, direct oral anticoagulants should be strongly preferred whenever possible. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine pharmacological antithrombotic prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are suspected of VTE or in whom the diagnosis is confirmed, parenteral therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in the absence of contraindications. If heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected, nonheparin anticoagulants should be used such as bivalirudin or fondaparinux. In case of confirmed acute pulmonary embolism, treatment should be guided by risk stratification as defined in the current guidelines.","Kosior, Dariusz A; Undas, Anetta; Kopec, Grzegorz; Hryniewiecki, Tomasz; Torbicki, Adam; Mularek-Kubzdela, Tatiana; Windyga, Jerzy; Pruszczyk, Piotr",Kardiol Pol,,386

Personal protective equipment (PPE) was recommended for workers in many professions that did not previously require wearing masks leading to new headaches, or the exacerbation of past headaches, especially among health workers. A 57-year-old female working in a secondary care hospital had a history of migraine twice/month without aura and allodynia symptom checklist (ASC12) scored as 7 before COVID-19 outbreak. She began to work with PPE (surgical masks, face shield and surgical cap) and migraines became daily (bifrontal, pulsatile, with photophobia, nausea, vomiting and of severe intensity, visual analog scale: 7), starting after 1 h of wearing protective equipment and lasted for at least 6 h during the day. There was no adequate response to treatment. The headache frequency retuned to twice/month after the patient stayed home 45 days due to another condition. It is hypothesized here that people with allodynia symptoms when exposed to PPE are more susceptible to the development of new headaches or to the worsening of existing primary headaches. The relationship between previous allodynia determined with the ASC12 questionnaire and new headaches, or past primary headaches that have become worse during the COVID-19 pandemic in workers using PPE, should be better investigated in order to clarify this hypothesis. Cutaneous allodynia could be related with the sensitivity to PPE and headache progression.","Dos Santos Ferreira, K.; Velly, A. M.",J Med Cases,,386

309377,Is there any effect of smoking status on severity and mortality of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia?,2020,"How the impact of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders is influencing physical, mental and financial health among vulnerable populations, including those with obesity is unknown. The aim of the current study was to explore the health implications of COVID-19 among a sample of adults with obesity. A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from an obesity medicine clinic and a bariatric surgery (MBS) practice. Patients completed an online survey from April 15, 2020 to May 31, 2020 to assess COVID-19 status and health behaviours during stay-at-home orders. Logistic regression models examined the impact of these orders on anxiety and depression by ethnic group. A total of 123 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2 years [SD 13.0]), mean BMI 40.2 [SD 6.7], 49.2% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 28.7% non-Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity and 33.1% completed MBS were included. Two patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and 14.6% reported symptoms. Then, 72.8% reported increased anxiety and 83.6% increased depression since stay-at-home orders were initiated. Also 69.6% reported more difficultly in achieving weight loss goals, less exercise time (47.9%) and intensity (55.8%), increased stockpiling of food (49.6%) and stress eating (61.2%). Hispanics were less likely to report anxiety vs NHWs (adjusted odds ratios 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05-0.49; P = .009). Results here showed the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on patients with obesity regardless of infection status. These results can inform clinicians and healthcare professionals about effective strategies to minimize COVID-19 negative outcomes for this vulnerable population now and in post-COVID-19 recovery efforts.","Almandoz, Jaime P; Xie, Luyu; Schellinger, Jeffrey N; Mathew, Matthew Sunil; Gazda, Chellse; Ofori, Ashley; Kukreja, Sachin; Messiah, Sarah E",Clin Obes,,386

310120,Bowling together by bowling alone: Social capital and COVID-19,2020,"Temporal inference from laboratory testing results and their triangulation with clinical outcomes as described in the associated unstructured text from the providers notes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is integral to advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.","Pawlowski, Colin; Wagner, Tyler; Puranik, Arjun; Murugadoss, Karthik; Loscalzo, Liam; Venkatakrishnan, AJ; Pruthi, Rajiv K.; Houghton, Damon E.; OHoro, John C.; Morice, William G.; Halamka, John; Badley, Andrew D.; Barnathan, Elliot S.; Makimura, Hideo; Khan, Najat; Soundararajan, Venky",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10938v1.pdf,386

312958,Response to letter entitled: Re: A systematic review and meta-analysis: The effect of active cancer treatment on severity of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). While many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China, an increasing number of cases with or without travel background to China are confirmed daily. These developments support concerns on possible unidentified and unreported international COVID-19 cases, which could lead to new local disease epicenters. METHODS: We have analyzed all available data on the development of international COVID-19 cases from January 20th, 2020 until February 18th, 2020. COVID-19 cases with and without travel history to China were divided into cohorts according to the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ-Index) of each country. Chi-square and Post-hoc testing were performed. RESULTS: While COVID-19 cases with travel history to China seem to peak for each HAQ-cohort, the number of non-travel related COVID-19 cases seem to continuously increase in the HAQ-cohort of countries with higher medical standards. Further analyses demonstrate a significantly lower proportion of reported COVID-19 cases without travel history to China in countries with lower HAQ (HAQ I vs. HAQ II, posthoc p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that countries with lower HAQ-index may either underreport COVID-19 cases or are unable to adequately detect them. Although our data may be incomplete and must be interpreted with caution, inconsistencies in reporting COVID-19 cases is a serious problem which might sabotage efforts to contain the virus.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Schubert, Justyna; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,386
313917,"Preparing for the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Vaccination: Evidence, Plans, and Implications",2021,"PURPOSE: Little evidence of increased thrombotic risk is available in COVID-19 patients. Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.","Helms, Julie; Tacquard, Charles; Severac, François; Leonard-Lorant, Ian; Ohana, Mickaël; Delabranche, Xavier; Merdji, Hamid; Clere-Jehl, Raphaël; Schenck, Malika; Fagot Gandet, Florence; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Castelain, Vincent; Schneider, Francis; Grunebaum, Lélia; Anglés-Cano, Eduardo; Sattler, Laurent; Mertes, Paul-Michel; Meziani, Ferhat",Intensive Care Med,,386

But the growing demand for COVID-19 vaccination within a short span of time has raised doubts about the efficacy and acceptance among common man. Although immunization coverage will be administered by the government in India but there is a need to understand the acceptability among individuals. The aim of this paper was to analyze the individual's acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccine. This data driven analysis has examined the individual's perceived acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination by considering various potential factors;risk perception, perceived knowledge of vaccine, perceived social influence, perceived source of trust based on online survey data from 832 respondents across India using a Liket scale based questionnaire. The survey was done between the months of October 1st, 2020 to December 15th, 2020 across India. Our findings suggested that the acceptance of vaccine is influenced majorly by the Risk perception of COVID-19, followed by Knowledge of its vaccine, Social influence and Source of trust. It was also observed that the highest percentage of individuals believes that vaccination is must, seconded by the thought that it will save them from getting infected and reduce the fear from COVID-19.

315055,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of 74 Patients With Severe or Critical COVID-19,2020,"The most common type of pituitary neoplasms is benign pituitary adenoma (PA). Clinically significant PAs affect around 0.1% of the population. Currently, there is no established human PA cell culture available and when PA tumor cells are cultured they form two distinct types depending on culturing conditions either free-floating aggregates also known as pituispheres or cells adhering to the surface of cell plates and displaying mesenchymal stem-like properties. The aim of this study was to trace the origin of sphere-forming and adherent pituitary cell cultures and characterize the potential use of these surgery derived cell lines as PA model. We carried out a paired-end exome sequencing of patients' tumor and germline DNA using Illumina NextSeq followed by characterization of corresponding PA cell cultures. Variation analysis revealed a low amount of somatic mutations (mean = 5.2, range 3-7) in exomes of PAs. Somatic mutations of the primary surgery material can be detected in the exomes of respective pituispheres, but not in exomes of respective mesenchymal stem-like cells. For the first time, we show that the genome of pituispheres represents genome of PA while mesenchymal stem cells derived from the PA tissue do not contain mutations characteristic to PA in their genome, therefore, most likely representing normal cells of pituitary or surrounding tissues. This finding indicates that pituispheres can be used as a human model of PA cells, but combination of cell culturing techniques and NGS needs to be employed to adjust for disability to propagate spheres in culturing conditions.","Peculis, Raitis; Mandrika, Ilona; Petrovska, Ramona; Dortane, Rasma; Megnis, Kaspars; Nazarovs, Jurijs; Balcere, Inga; Stukens, Janis; Konrade, Ilze; Pirags, Valdis; Klovins, Janis; Rovite, Vita",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,386

In terms of clinical manifestations, although it starts as an acute respiratory disorder, it could eventually lead to death by causing damage to many organs such as: lung, liver, kidney and heart. It has been shown that COVID-19 pathology is mediated by an excessive inflammation, oxidation and an aggravated immune response. Vitamin D is a an immunomodulator hormone and has receptors in many tissues and organs. In many studies, vitamin D was shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, since COVID-19 infection causes a cytokine storm, vitamin D can have a protective effect on many tissues and organs by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D has a high safety profile, and thus could be beneficial against multiple organ damage in COVID-19 patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed lung ultrasonography on 48 COVID-19 patients in an ICU (Wuhan, China) using a 12-zone method. The associations between lung ultrasonography score, PaO2/FiO2, APACHE II, SOFA, and PaCO2 with 28-day mortality were analyzed and the receiver operator characteristic curve was plotted. RESULTS: 25.9% areas in all scanning zones presented with B7 lines and 23.5% with B3 lines(B-pattern) on lung ultrasonography; 13% areas with confluent B lines(B-pattern), 24.9% in areas with consolidations, and 9.9% in areas with A lines. Pleural effusion was observed in 2.8% of areas. Lung ultrasonography score was negatively correlated with PaO2/FiO2 (nâ=â48, râ=â-0.498, Pâ<â0.05) andpositively correlated with APACHE II (nâ=â48, râ=â0.435, Pâ<â0.05). Lung ultrasonography score was independently associated with 28-day mortality. The areas under ROC curves of lung ultrasonography score was 0.735 (95% CI: 0.586-0.844). The sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values were 0.833, 0.722, and 22.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasonography could be used to assess the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and it could also reveal the pathological signs of the disease.

We consider a mixed supply and demand shock, and show that depending on the shock parameters (amplitude and duration), our toy economy can display V-shaped, U-shaped or W-shaped recoveries, and even an L-shaped output curve with permanent output loss. This is due to the existence of a self-sustained""bad""state of the economy. We then discuss two policies that attempt to moderate the impact of the shock: giving easy credit to firms, and the so-called helicopter money, i.e. injecting new money into the households savings. We find that both policies are effective if strong enough, and we highlight the potential danger of terminating these policies too early. While we only discuss a limited number of scenarios, our model is flexible and versatile enough to allow for a much wider exploration, thus serving as a useful tool for the qualitative understanding of post-Covid recovery.

We measured and analysed the correlation of the stimulated saliva volume, serum amylase, and cytokines in resting saliva at baseline and 1 month after chemoradiotherapy with oral mucositis levels. RESULTS: We observed a negative correlation between the serum amylase level at the beginning of chemoradiotherapy and the stimulated saliva volume at 1 month after chemoradiotherapy (p=0.03). Epidermal growth factor in resting saliva was significantly reduced after chemoradiotherapy (p<0.01). The incidence of severe oral mucositis during chemoradiotherapy was significantly higher and negatively associated with the epidermal growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor levels (p=0.04, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The serum amylase level at the beginning of chemoradiotherapy may be a predictor of the recovery of the saliva volume. Furthermore, cytokines such as epidermal growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor in resting saliva affect the development of oral mucositis during chemoradiotherapy.","Kawahara, Kenta; Hiraki, Akimitsu; Arita, Hidetaka; Takeshita, Hisashi; Hirosue, Akiyuki; Matsuoka, Yuichiro; Sakata, Junki; Obayashi, Yuko; Nakashima, Hikaru; Hirayama, Mayumi; Nagata, Masashi; Yoshida, Ryoji; Shinohara, Masanori; Nakayama, Hideki",Oral dis,,386

Thus, we sought to analyze the temporal profiles of specific antibodies, as well as the correlations between the antibodies, proinflammatory cytokines, and survival of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 1830 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were recruited. The temporal profiles of the virus, antibodies, and cytokines of the patients until 12 weeks since illness onset were fitted by the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS) method. The mediation effect of cytokines on the associations between antibody responses and survival were explored by mediation analysis. Of the 1830 patients, 1435 were detectable for SARS-CoV-2, while 395 were positive in specific antibodies only. Of the 1435 patients, 2.4% presented seroconversion for neither immunoglobulin G (IgG) nor immunoglobulin M (IgM) during hospitalization. The seropositive rates of IgG and IgM were 29.6% and 48.1%, respectively, in the first week, and plateaued within five weeks. For the patients discharged from the hospital, the IgM decreased slowly, while high levels of IgG were maintained at around 188 AU·mL-1 for the 12 weeks since illness onset. In contrast, in the patients who subsequently died, IgM declined rapidly and IgG dropped to 87 AU·mL-1 at the twelfth week. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), interleukin-2R (IL-2R), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) levels were observed in the deceased patients in comparison with the discharged patients, and 12.5% of the association between low IgG level and mortality risk was mediated by these cytokines. Our study deciphers the temporal profiles of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies within the 12 weeks since illness onset and indicates the protective effect of antibody response on survival, which may help to guide prognosis estimation.","Liu, Li; Chen, Heng-Gui; Li, Ying; Li, Huijun; Li, Jiaoyuan; Wang, Yi; Yao, Shuang; Qin, Chuan; Tong, Shutao; Yuan, Xu; Luo, Xia; Miao, Xiaoping; Pan, An; Liu, Zheng; Cheng, Liming",,,386

331075,Contribution of Atrial Fibrillation to In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With COVID-19,2021,"cis- and trans-Platinum(iv) complexes with diaminetetracarboxylate coordination spheres possess the highly desirable property of exhibiting unusual resistance to reduction by blood serum components and endogenous reductants such as ascorbate. At the same time they are rapidly reduced in the intracellular environment of cancer cells. Consequently, they can potentially be tuned to remain intact in vivo until arrival at the tumour target where they are rapidly reduced to yield the active platinum(ii) species. However, in order to achieve this, uptake must be largely restricted to tumour cells and therefore uptake by healthy cells including red blood cells must be prevented. In this proof of concept study, we report on the effect of net charge as a means of controlling the uptake by red blood cells. Using 1H NMR spectroscopy we found that modifying the net charge of the complex does not influence the rate of reduction of the complexes by an excess of ascorbate. Using XANES spectroscopy we found that modifying the net charge of the platinum(iv) complexes decreased the extent of reduction in whole blood, although probably not to the degree needed for the optimal delivery to tumours. Therefore, it is likely to be necessary to adopt higher charges and/or additional strategies to keep platinum(iv) prodrugs out of blood cells.","Chen, Catherine K J; Gui, Xiao; Kappen, Peter; Renfrew, Anna K; Hambley, Trevor W",Metallomics,,386

332363,"Letter regarding ""High rates of 30-day mortality in patients with cirrhosis and COVID-19""",2020,"OBJECTIVE: In the current pandemic, Health Care Workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of developing COVID-19. Preventive methods like the use of personal protective equipment, isolation, social distancing, and chemoprophylaxis show limited benefit. Despite standard prophylaxis, many of the HCWs develop COVID-19. Medical ozone therapy has immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antiviral effect, and, therefore, it can be explored as prophylaxis for COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective controlled cohort study. IV ozonized saline was administered once a day for a total of 4 days in one month in addition to standard prophylaxis for COVID-19 to HCWs in a dedicated COVID hospital. Fresh ozonized saline was prepared for every administration and was given over 1 hour. RESULTS: There were 235 HCWs, 64 received the ozone prophylaxis and 171 did not. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (p=0.04) lesser in HCWs that received ozone prophylaxis (4.6%) as compared to those who did not (14.03%). The benefit was seen irrespective of the risk of exposure. In the red zone, 8.69% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive as opposed to 15.3% of those who did not. In the orange zone, 4.34% of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive, remarkably lesser than those who did not (20%). In the green zone, none of the HCWs who received ozone prophylaxis tested positive; however, 3.4% of the HCWs who did not receive ozone prophylaxis tested positive. No major adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: IV ozonized saline can be used in addition to the standard prophylactic regimen for the prevention of COVID-19 in HCWs. Prospective larger studies are required to establish the potency of IV ozonized saline as prophylaxis.","Sharma, A; Shah, M; Sane, H; Gokulchandran, N; Paranjape, A; Khubchandani, P; Captain, J; Shirke, S; Kulkarni, P",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,386

The primary objective of our study was to establish the effectiveness of TCZ in patients with severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia.We retrospectively analyzed 25 consecutive patients, admitted in the Academic Emergency Hospital Sibiu, Romania from April 1, 2020 until May 25, 2020, all with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe pneumonia. All patients were treated off-label with TCZ, beside their standard care. Adjuvant iron chelator was associated in 11 patients.Six female and 19 male patients admitted in our hospital all with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe pneumonia as defined by Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were enrolled in this study. Seventeen of the 25 enrolled patients (68%) were seriously ill requiring noninvasive ventilation or oxygen mask, and 8 cases (32%) were critically ill requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients received TCZ, and also received hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50âmg for 10âdays. Adjuvant iron chelator (deferasirox - marketed as Exjade) was associated in 11 patients who had ferritin serum levels above 1000âng/mL. No side effects were encountered during infusions or after TCZ. We observed a rapid increase in arterial oxygen saturation for 20 of the 25 cases (80%) with a favorable evolution toward healing. Survivors were younger than 60âyears old (80%), had less comorbidities (10% no comorbidities, 70% with 1 or 2 comorbidities), lower serum ferritin levels (30% under 1000âng/mL), and 50% had no serum glucose elevation. Our patients with CRS had no response to corticosteroid therapy. Five out of the 25 patients had an unfavorable evolution to death. The off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe or critically ill form of SARS-CoV-2 infection had good results in our study.Off-label use of TCZ in severe and critical cases of COVID-19 pneumonia is effective in managing the ""cytokine storm."" Better outcomes were noted in younger patients. Associated adjuvant iron chelators may contribute to a good outcome and needs to be confirmed in larger studies.","Birlutiu, Victoria; Birlutiu, Rares Mircea; Chicea, Liana",Medicine (Baltimore),,386

A systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to characterize the transmission chains and clusters of COVID-19 infection in Tunisia. METHODS: All cases were confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction of a nasopharyngeal specimen. Contact tracing is undertaken for all confirmed cases in order to identify close contacts that will be systematically screened and quarantined. Transmission chains were identified based on field investigation, contact tracing, results of screening tests and by assessing all probable mode of transmission and interactions. RESULTS: As of May 18, 2020, 656 cases out of a total of 1043 confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 belong to 127 transmission chains identified during the epidemic (mean age 42.36 years, Standard deviation 19.56 and sex ratio 0.86). The virus transmission is the most concentrated in the governorate of Tunis (31.5%), Ariana (10.2%) and Ben Arous (10.2%). Virus transmission occurred 50 times (9.72% of secondary transmission events) between two different governorates. A maximum of seven generations of secondary infection was identified, whereas 62% of these secondary infections belong the first generation. A total of 11 ""super spreader"" cases were identified in this investigation. Four large clusters have been identified. The evolution of secondary cases highlighted two peaks: one in 2nd April and a second in 16 th April whereas imported cases caused local transmission of virus during the early phase of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Correct contact tracing and early active case finding is useful to identify transmission chains and source of infection in order to contain the widespread transmission in the community.","Safer, Mouna; Letaief, Hejer; Hechaichi, Aicha; Harizi, Chahida; Dhaouadi, Sonia; Bouabid, Leila; Darouiche, Sondes; Gharbi, Donia; Elmili, Nawel; Ben Salah, Hamida; Hammami, Mongi; Talmoudi, Khouloud; Moussa, Rim; Charaa, Nejib; Termiz, Hasna; Ltaief, Fethi; Tounekti, Habib; Makhlouf, Mohamed; Belguith Sriha, Asma; Ben Fredj, Manel; Khalfallah, Sonia; Jabrane, Houcine; Mchirgui, Selma; Amich, Chedli; Dabghi, Radhia; Anez, Zid; Abdelkader, Latifa; Mhamdi, Moncef; Ouerfeli, Nabil; Zoghlami, Salah; Bougatef, Souha; Chahed, Mohamed Kouni; Bouafif Ben Alaya, Nissaf",BMC Infect Dis,,386

340924,Childhood appendectomy and adult mental disorders: A population-based cohort study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Teleradiology has become one of the most important approaches to virtual clinical diagnosis; its importance has only grown during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. In developing countries, asking patients to take photographs of their images using a smartphone can facilitate the process and help keep its costs down. However, the images taken by patients with smartphones often are of poor quality, and there is no regulation or standard instruction about how to use smartphones to take photographs of medical examination images effectively. These problems limit the use of smartphones in remote diagnosis and treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To formulate a set of guidelines for the most appropriate and effective use of smartphones to capture images (radiographs, CT images, and MR images), and to determine whether these guidelines are more effectively adopted by patients of differing ages and genders. METHODS: In this prospective study, a set of step-by-step instructions was created with the goal of helping patients take better smartphone photographs of orthopaedic diagnostic images for transfer to telemedicine services. Following the advice of surgeons, experts in smartphone technology, imaging experts, and suggestions from patients, the instructions were modified based on clinical experience and finalized with the goals of simplicity, clarity, and convenience. Potentially eligible patients were older than 18 years, had no cognitive impairment, and used smart phones. Based on that, 256 participants (patients or their relatives and friends) who visited the orthopaedic department of our hospital from June to October 2020 potentially qualified for this study. A total of 11% (29) declined to participate, leaving 89% (227) for analysis here. Their mean age was 36 ± 11 years, 50% were women (113 of 227), and the patient himself/herself represented in 34% (78 of 227) of participants while relatives or friends of patients made up 66% (149 of 227) of the group. In this study, the diagnoses included spinal stenosis (47% [107 of 227]), disc herniation without spinal stenosis (31% [71 of 227]), vertebral fractures (14% [32 of 227]), and other (7% [17 of 227]). Each study participant first took photographs of their original medical images based on their own knowledge of how to use the smartphone camera function; each participant then took pictures of their original images again after receiving our instructional guidance. Three senior spine surgeons (YZ, TQL, TCM) in our hospital analyzed, in a blinded manner, the instructed and uninstructed imaging files based on image clarity (the content of the image is complete, the text information in the image is clearly visible, there is neither reflection nor shadow in the image) and image position (it is not tilted, curled, inverted, or reversed). If either of these conditions was not satisfied, the picture quality was deemed unacceptable; two of three judges' votes determined the outcome. Interobserver reliability with kappa values for the three judges were 0.89 (YZ versus TQL), 0.92 (YZ versus TCM), and 0.90 (TQL versus TCM). RESULTS: In this study, the overall proportion of smartphone medical images deemed satisfactory increased from 40% (91 of 227) for uninstructed participants to 86% (196 of 227) for instructed participants (risk ratio 2.15 [95% CI 1.82 to 2.55]; pï¼0.001). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in different age groups improved after instruction, except for in patients aged 51 years or older (3 of 17 uninstructed participants versus 8 of 17 instructed participants; RR 2.67 [95% CI 0.85 to 8.37]; p = 0.07). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in both genders improved after instruction, but there was no difference between the genders. CONCLUSION: We believe our guidelines for patients who wish to take smartphone photographs of their medical images will decrease image transmission cost and facilitate orthopaedic telemedicine consultations. However, it appears that patients older than 50 years are more likely to have difficulty with this approach, and if so, they may benefit from more hands-on assistance from clinic staff or younger relatives or friends. The degree to which our findings are culture-specific should be verified by other studies in other settings, but on the face of it, there is little reason to believe our findings would not generalize to a reasonable degree. Other studies in more heterogeneous populations should also evaluate factors related to levels of educational attainment and wealth differences, but in the meantime, our findings can give clinical teams an idea of which patients may need a little extra assistance.

341271,Assessment of activities of daily living in patients post COVID-19: a systematic review,2021,"Fast fashion trends have led to an enormous local brand proliferation in India. Brand proliferation has further led to an overchoice effect among the Indian consumers due to which, they are now increasingly less satisfied with their apparel purchases. These factors have created immense stress on the small fashion retailers (SFR) which are currently responsible for about 80% of retailing in India. In the pre-COVID times, SFR's followed the practice of overstocking many brands for capturing the maximum market and then clearing the inventory at the end of the season through heavy discounting. This strategy became ineffective after the COVID-19 disruption. SFR's must now optimize their brand portfolio to minimize the overchoice effect and maximize the inventory turnover ratio. To this effect, we propose an efficient fuzzy probability-based brand portfolio optimization model, which relies on primary data analysis to classify brands in groups of substitutes. Brands with maximum market share from each group must be included in the portfolio. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model through a case study on SFR. Our results show that the inventory turnover ratio was increased from 2 to 4. We further show that our grouping strategy can be used to identify competitive brands for a local band. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Sinha, P.; Sainy, R.",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,,386

The estimated frequency is around 10% and signs and symptoms may last for months. The main long-term manifestations observed in other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) are very similar to and have clear clinical parallels with SARS-CoV-2: mainly respiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric. The growing number of patients worldwide will have an impact on health systems. Therefore, the main objective of these clinical practice guidelines is to identify patients with signs and symptoms of long COVID-19 in primary care through a protocolized diagnostic process that studies possible etiologies and establishes an accurate differential diagnosis. The guidelines have been developed pragmatically by compiling the few studies published so far on long COVID-19, editorials and expert opinions, press releases, and the authors' clinical experience. Patients with long COVID-19 should be managed using structured primary care visits based on the time from diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The aim of the study was to analyse the prognostic value of two different frailty scores in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult (&#8805;18 years) inpatients with COVID-19 and took place from 3 March to 2 May 2020. Patients were categorised by Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were tocilizumab treatment, length of hospital stay, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Results were analysed by multivariable logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for age, sex, kidney function and comorbidity. RESULTS: Of the 290 included patients, 54 were frail according to the CFS (&#8805;5 points; prevalence 18.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-23.7) vs 65 by HFRS (&#8805;5 points; prevalence: 22.4%, 95% CI 17.8-27.7). Prevalence of frailty increased with age according to both measures: 50-64 years, CFS 1.9% vs HFRS 12.3%; 65-79 years, CFS 31.5% vs HFRS 40.0%; and &#8805;80 years, CFS 66.7% vs HFRS 40.0% (P < .001). CFS-defined frailty was independently associated with risk of death (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.49-9.04) and less treatment with tocilizumab (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.93). HFRS-defined frailty was independently associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.53-5.44), ICU admission (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.84-9.52) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.93, 95% CI 2.33-15.10). CONCLUSION: In the spring 2020 wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, CFS-defined frailty was an independent predictor for death, while frailty as measured by the HFRS was associated with length of hospital stay over 10 days, ICU admission and use of invasive mechanical ventilation.","Ramos-Rincon, Jose-Manuel; Moreno-Perez, Oscar; Pinargote-Celorio, Hector; Leon-Ramirez, Jose-Manuel; Andres, Mariano; Reus, Sergio; Herrera-García, Cristian; Martí-Pastor, Ana; Boix, Vicente; Gil, Joan; Sanchez-Martinez, Rosario; Merino, Esperanza",Int J Clin Pract,,386
342716,Identification of risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: The enormous health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has refocused attention on measures to optimize immune function and vaccine response. Dietary deficiencies of micronutrients can weaken adaptive immunity. The aim of this review was to examine links between micronutrients, immune function and COVID-19 infection, with a focus on nutritional risks in subgroups of the Swiss population. METHODS: Scoping review on the associations between selected micronutrients (vitamins D and C, iron, selenium, zinc, and n-3 PUFAs) and immunity, with particular reference to the Swiss population. These nutrients were chosen because previous EFSA reviews have concluded they play a key role in immunity. RESULTS: The review discusses the available knowledge on links between sufficient nutrient status, optimal immune function, and prevention of respiratory tract infections. Because of the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, controlled intervention studies of micronutrients in the context of COVID-19 infection are now underway, but evidence is not yet available to draw conclusions. The anti-inflammatory properties of n-3 PUFAs are well established. In Switzerland, several subgroups of the population are at clear risk of nutrient deficiencies; e.g., older adults, multiple comorbidities, obesity, pregnancy, and institutionalized. Low intakes of n-3 PUFA are present in a large proportion of the population. CONCLUSION: There are clear and strong relationships between micronutrient and n-3 PUFA status and immune function, and subgroups of the Swiss population are at risk for deficient intakes. Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a complement to a healthy and balanced diet, it may be prudent to consider supplementation with a combination of moderate doses of Vitamins C and D, as well as of Se, Zn and n-3 PUFA, in risk groups.","Berger, Mette M; Herter-Aeberli, Isabelle; Zimmermann, Michael B; Spieldenner, Jörg; Eggersdorfer, Manfred",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,386

COVID-19 is associated with viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome causing significant morbidity and mortality. The proposed treatments for COVID-19 have shown little or no effect in the clinic so far. Additionally, bacterial and fungal pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pneumonia disease complex. The antibiotic resistance in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. Therefore, carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs), such as fullerene, carbon dots, graphene, and their derivatives constitute a promising alternative due to their wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and capacity to induce tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the antimicrobial mode of action is mainly physical (e.g., membrane distortion), characterized by a low risk of antimicrobial resistance. In this Review, we evaluated the literature on the antiviral activity and broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of CBNs. CBNs had antiviral activity against 13 enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. CBNs with low or no toxicity to humans are promising therapeutics against the COVID-19 pneumonia complex with other viruses, bacteria, and fungi, including those that are multidrug-resistant.","Serrano-Aroca, Ángel; Takayama, Kazuo; Tuñón-Molina, Alberto; Seyran, Murat; Hassan, Sk Sarif; Pal Choudhury, Pabitra; Uversky, Vladimir N; Lundstrom, Kenneth; Adadi, Parise; Palù, Giorgio; Aljabali, Alaa A A; Chauhan, Gaurav; Kandimalla, Ramesh; Tambuwala, Murtaza M; Lal, Amos; Abd El-Aziz, Tarek Mohamed; Sherchan, Samendra; Barh, Debmalya; Redwan, Elrashdy M; Bazan, Nicolas G; Mishra, Yogendra Kumar; Uhal, Bruce D; Brufsky, Adam",ACS Nano,,386

A key factor is to ensure that services and policies are in synched with the state of wellness dimensions. This study examined the state of wellness of the thirty purposively selected families in five slum communities in Cebu, Philippines in times of pandemic. One-on-one semi-structured interview was used in order to gather significant data. Discourse analysis was applied which brought about their tales of survival in synched with their eight wellness dimensions. The findings elaborated that the pandemic and the different mitigation measures to curb it, had taken a heavy toll on the wellness of Filipino families in slum communities. However, this did not topple their resiliency and survivability as the social services and other crisis mitigation policies and strategies afforded by the national government and private sectors, albeit insufficient, including the peculiar Filipino attributes and individual initiatives they manifested and done were instrumental. Furthermore, noting that the essential support and services provided for the families in the slum communities were not holistic enough to address the multi-faceted issues hounding their different wellness dimensions, hence, stemming some non-conforming behaviors despite strict quarantine measures. This study recommends that pandemic mitigation measures including essential support and services be reviewed and enhanced in high consideration of human wellness dimensions for them to be more inclusive and holistic. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.","Tanucan, J.

PM2.5 and NO2 are the most significant pollutant agents responsible for facilitating COVID-19 attributed death rates. Besides, we found only six out of many tested causal inferences to be significant and true within the AUPRC analysis. In line with the causal findings, a unidirectional causal effect is found from PM2.5 to Deaths, NO2 to Deaths, and economic growth to both PM2.5 and NO2. Corroborating the first experiment, the causal results confirmed the capability of polluting variables (PM2.5 to Deaths, NO2 to Deaths) to accelerate COVID-19 deaths. In contrast, we found evidence that unsustainable economic growth predicts the dynamics of air pollutants. This shows how unsustainable economic growth could increase environmental pollution by escalating emissions of pollutant agents (PM2.5 and NO2) in New York state.","Magazzino, Cosimo; Mele, Marco; Sarkodie, Samuel Asumadu",J Environ Manage,,386
344633,Pneumomediastinum in critically ill adult with COVID-19,2020,"Paracetamol is the most commonly used antipyretic and analgesic drug in the world. The key challenge in paracetamol therapy is associated with the frequency of the dosing. Depending on the gastric filling within 10-20 min paracetamol is released and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it must be taken three or four times a day. To address the dose challenge it is desirable that the paracetamol release profile follows the zero-order kinetic model (constant rate of drug release per unit time). This goal can be achieved by using a suitable porous carrier system. Herein, non-toxic wrinkled mesoporous carbons with unique morphology were synthesized via the hard template method as new carriers for paracetamol. These particles can precisely modulate the release of paracetamol over 24 h in a simulated gastric fluid according to the zero-order kinetic model completely eliminating the initial burst release. Overall, these systems could significantly enhance the bioavailability of paracetamol and prolong its therapeutic effect in numerous diseases such as cold, flu, COVID-19, and severe pain.","Goscianska, Joanna; Olejnik, Anna; Ejsmont, Aleksander; Galarda, Aleksandra; Wuttke, Stefan",J. colloid interface sci,,386

Material and methods. Sixty patients with severe COVID-19 and manifestations of acute respiratory failure admitted to the infectious disease hospitals of Nizhny Novgorod were enrolled in the study. The study included patients with transcutaneous saturation (SpO2) below 93% on spontaneous breathing, who required correction of respiratory alterations according to the Interim Clinical Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with COVID-19. All patients were divided into 2 groups of 30 patients each according to the nature of respiratory impairment. Group 1 included patients without breathing difficulties who had respiratory rate up to 25 per minute. Group 2 patients had breathing difficulties and respiratory rate over 25 per minute. In addition to SpO2, severity of respiratory difficulties, respiratory rate (RR), forced breathing (FB), heart rate (HR), acid-base balance (ABB) and arterial and venous blood gases, capillary refill time, blood lactate level were assessed. The severity of lung involvement was determined using chest computed tomography, and severity of disease was assessed using the NEWS score. Respiratory treatment required for ARF correction and the outcome of hospitalization were also considered. Results. In group 1, the mean age was 66 (56;67) years and the disease severity was 8 (7;10) points. Group 1 patients had minor tachycardia and tachypnoea, there were no lactate elevation or prolonged capillary refill time. Mean SpO2 was as low as 86 (83;89)%. Venous blood pH and pCO2 values were within normal reference intervals, mean BE was 6 (4;9) mmol/l, pO2 was 42 (41;44) mm Hg, and SO2 was 67 (65;70)%. Mean arterial blood pO2 was 73 (69;75) mm Hg, SО2 was 86 (83;90)%, and O2 was 37 (35;39) mm Hg. Oxygen therapy with the flow rate of 5–15 l/min in prone position helped correct ARF. All patients of this group were discharged from hospital. In group 2, the mean age was 76 (70;79) years and the disease severity was 14 (12;18) points. Anxiety was observed in 15 patients, prolonged capillary refill time was seen in 13 patients, and increased lactate level in 18 patients. Mean RR was 34 (30;37) per minute, HR was 110 (103;121) per minute, and SpO2 was 76 (69;83)%. Mean venous blood pH was 7.21 (7.18;7.27), pCO2 was 69 (61;77) mm Hg, BE was-5 (-7;2) mmol/l, pO2 was 25 (22;28) mm Hg, SO2 was 47 (43;55)%. Mean arterial blood pO2 was 57 (50;65) mm Hg, SО2 was 74 (69;80)%, and pCO2 was 67 (58;74) mm Hg. In the group 2 patients, the standard oxygen therapy in prone position failed to correct ARF, and high flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive CPAP with FiO2 of 50–90% or noninvasive CPAP+PS were administered. Fourteen patients were started on invasive lung ventilation. There were 10 fatal outcomes (33%) in this group. Conclusion. Two clinical phenotypes of hypoxia in patients with COVID-19 can be distinguished. The first pattern is characterized by reduced SpO2 (80–93%), no tachypnoea (RR &gt;25 per minute) and moderate arterial hypoxemia without tissue hypoxia and acidosis («silent hypoxia»). It is typical for younger patients and asso-ciates with less lung damage and disease severity than in patients with severe ARF. Hypoxemia can be corrected by prone position and oxygen therapy and does not require switching to mechanical ventilation. The second pattern of hypoxia is characterized by significant arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia with tissue hypoxia and acidosis. Its correction requires the use of noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation.","Voennov, О V.; Тurentinov, А V.; Моkrov, К V.; Zubееv, P. S.; Аbramov, S. А",Obshchaya Reanimatologiya,,386

346456,Anticoagulation and bleeding risk in patients with COVID-19,2020,"With the purpose of defending against lateral movement in todays borderless networks, Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) adoption is gaining momentum. Considering a full scale ZTA implementation, it is unlikely that adversaries will be able to spread through the network starting from a compromised endpoint. However, the already authenticated and authorised session of the compromised endpoint can be leveraged to perform limited, though malicious activities, ultimately rendering the endpoints the Achilles heel of ZTA. To effectively detect such attacks, distributed collaborative intrusion detection systems with attack scenario-based approach have been developed. Nonetheless, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have demonstrated their ability to bypass this approach with high success ratio. As a result, adversaries can pass undetected or potentially alter the detection logging mechanisms to achieve a stealthy presence. Recently, blockchain technology has demonstrated solid use cases in the cyber security domain. Motivated by the convergence of ZTA and blockchain-based intrusion detection and prevention, in this paper, we examine how ZTA can be augmented onto endpoints. Namely, we perform a systematic review of ZTA models, real-world architectures with the focus on endpoints, and blockchain-based intrusion detection systems. We discuss the potential of blockchains immutability fortifying the detection process, and the identified open challenges as well as the possible solutions and future directions.","Alevizos, Lampis; Ta, Vinh Thong; Eiza, Max Hashem",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00460v3.pdf,386

The contributions of the implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies and the COVID-19 pandemic to major air pollutant emission reductions were studied, and their impacts on the regional air quality under adverse meteorological conditions were simulated using an air quality model. The results showed that from the 'New Year Haze' in Dec 2016-Jan 2017 to the 'Pandemic Haze' in Jan-Feb 2020, the major air pollutant emissions in the region had dropped by approximately 50%, and the average concentration of PM2.5 was potentially reduced by more than 40% under adverse meteorological conditions. The most effective emission reduction measures included the clean heating project and raising the standards in key industrial sectors, such as the iron and steel industry, coal-fired boilers, and power plants, which contributed 67.1% and 53.4% of the emission reductions in SO2 and PM2.5, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic predominantly affected the mobile sources and light industry, which contributed 71.9% and 68.2% of the emission reductions in NOx and VOCs, respectively. The implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies contributed substantially to the improvement of regional air quality, which effectively reduced the intensity and extent of the heavy pollution process under unfavorable meteorological conditions. The regional average PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 26%, and the number of days experiencing heavy pollution decreased by 44%. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average PM2.5 concentration in the region was reduced by an additional 24%, and the duration and extent of heavy pollution decreased even further.","Tang, Qian; Zheng, Bo; Xue, Wen-Bo; Zhang, Qiang; Lei, Yu; He, Ke-Bin",Huan Jing Ke Xue,,386

349730,Cardiac injury and prognosis in COVID-19: Methodological considerations and updated meta-analysis,2020,"We present an automatic non-invasive way of detecting cough events based on both accelerometer and audio signals. The acceleration signals are captured by a smartphone firmly attached to the patient's bed, using its integrated accelerometer. The audio signals are captured simultaneously by the same smartphone using an external microphone. We have compiled a manually-annotated dataset containing such simultaneously-captured acceleration and audio signals for approximately 6000 cough and 68000 non-cough events from 14 adult male patients in a tuberculosis clinic. LR, SVM and MLP are evaluated as baseline classifiers and compared with deep architectures such as CNN, LSTM, and Resnet50 using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. We find that the studied classifiers can use either acceleration or audio signals to distinguish between coughing and other activities including sneezing, throat-clearing, and movement on the bed with high accuracy. However, in all cases, the deep neural networks outperform the shallow classifiers by a clear margin and the Resnet50 offers the best performance by achieving an AUC exceeding 0.98 and 0.99 for acceleration and audio signals respectively. While audio-based classification consistently offers a better performance than acceleration-based classification, we observe that the difference is very small for the best systems. Since the acceleration signal requires less processing power, and since the need to record audio is sidestepped and thus privacy is inherently secured, and since the recording device is attached to the bed and not worn, an accelerometer-based highly accurate non-invasive cough detector may represent a more convenient and readily accepted method in long-term cough monitoring.","Pahar, Madhurananda; Miranda, Igor; Diacon, Andreas; Niesler, Thomas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00103v1.pdf,386
350178,Cardiology and COVID: a bidirectional association!,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Acute presentations of COVID-19 infection vary, ranging from asymptomatic carriage through to severe clinical manifestations including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Longer term sequelae of COVID-19 infection includes lung fibrosis in a proportion of patients. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a mucin like glycoprotein that has been proposed as a marker of pulmonary epithelial cell injury. We sought to determine whether KL-6 was a marker of 1) the severity of acute COVID-19 infection, or 2) the persistence of symptoms/radiological abnormalities at medium term follow up. METHODS: Prospective single centre observational study. RESULTS: Convalescent KL-6 levels were available for 93 patients (male 63%, mean age 55.8 years) who attended an 12-week follow up appointment after being admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For 67 patients a baseline KL-6 result was available for comparison. There was no significant correlations between baseline KL-6 and the admission CXR severity score or clinical severity NEWS score. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the baseline KL-6 level and an initial requirement for oxygen on admission or the severity of acute infection as measured at 28 days. There was no significant difference in the 12-week KL-6 level and the presence or absence of subjective breathlessness but patients with abnormal CT scans at 12 weeks had significantly higher convalescent KL-6 levels compared to the remainder of the cohort (median 1101 IU/ml vs 409 IU/ml). CONCLUSIONS: The association between high KL-6 levels at 12 weeks and persisting CT abnormalities (GGO/fibrosis), is a finding that requires further exploration. Whether KL-6 may help differentiate those patients with persisting dyspnoea due to complications rather than deconditioning or dysfunctional breathing alone, is an important future research question.","Arnold, David T; Donald, Charmaine; Lyon, Max; Hamilton, Fergus W; Morley, Anna J; Attwood, Marie; Dipper, Alexandra; Barratt, Shaney L",PLoS One,,386

This study aimed to investigate all the reported COVID-19 clusters in Seoul Metropolitan area from January 23 to September 24, 2020. METHODS: Publicly available COVID-19 data was collected from the Seoul Metropolitan city and Gyeonggi Province. Community clusters with &#8805; 5 cases were characterized by size and duration and then categorized using K-means clustering, and the correlation between the types of clusters and the level of social distancing was investigated. RESULTS: A total of 134 clusters including 4,033 cases were identified. The clusters were categorized into small (Type I, II), medium (type III), and large (type IV) clusters. With the same number of daily confirmed cases, cases were composed of different types of clusters by different periods of time. Raising social distancing was related with shifting types of clusters from large to small sized clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Classification of clusters may provide opportunities to better portray the pattern of COVID-19 outbreaks and implement more effective strategies. Social distancing administered by the government may be effective in suppressing large clusters but may not be effective in controlling small and sporadic clusters.","Choi, Yoon-Jung; Park, Mi-Jeong; Park, Soo Jin; Hong, Dongui; Lee, Sohyae; Lee, Kyung-Shin; Moon, Sungji; Cho, Jinwoo; Jang, Yoonyoung; Lee, Dongwook; Shin, Aesun; Hong, Yun-Chul; Lee, Jong-Koo",Int. j. infect. dis,,386

OBJECTIVE: This single centre cross-section study aimed to grade the severity of pneumonia by bed-side lung ultrasound (LUS). METHODS: A scoring system discriminates 5 levels of lung opacities: A-lines (0 points),&#8805;3 B-Line (1 point), coalescent B-Lines (2 points), marked pleural disruptions (3 points), consolidations (4 points). LUS (convex 1-5âMHz probe) was performed at 6 defined regions for each hemithorax either in supine or prone position. A lung aeration score (LAS, maximum 4 points) was allocated for each patient by calculating the arithmetic mean of the examined lung areas. Score levels were correlated with ventilation parameters and laboratory markers. RESULTS: LAS of 20 patients with ARDS reached from 2.58 to 3.83 and was highest in the lateral right lobe (Mean 3.67). Ferritin levels (Mean 1885µg/l; râ=â0.467; pâ=â0.051) showed moderate correlation in spearman roh calculation.

METHODS: We surveyed 725 full-time college students aged 18-22 years recruited via Instagram promotions on April 25-30, 2020. We inquired about their COVID-19-related experiences and perspectives, documented opportunities for transmission, and assessed COVID-19's perceived impacts to date. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of participants experienced any COVID-19-related symptoms from February to April 2020, but less than 5% of them got tested, and only 46% stayed home exclusively while experiencing symptoms. Almost all (95%) had sheltered in place/stayed primarily at home by late April 2020; 53% started sheltering in place before any state had an official stay-at-home order, and more than one-third started sheltering before any metropolitan area had an order. Participants were more stressed about COVID-19's health implications for their family and for American society than for themselves. Participants were open to continuing the restrictions in place in late April 2020 for an extended period of time to reduce pandemic spread. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial opportunity for improved public health responses to COVID-19 among college students, including for testing and contact tracing. In addition, because most participants restricted their behaviors before official stay-at-home orders went into effect, they may continue to restrict movement after stay-at-home orders are lifted, including when colleges reopen for in-person activities, if they decide it is not yet prudent to circulate freely. The public health, economic, and educational implications of COVID-19 are continuing to unfold; future studies must continue to monitor college student experiences and perspectives.","Cohen, Alison K; Hoyt, Lindsay T; Dull, Brandon",J Adolesc Health,,386

This contact with conspecifics is essential for their evolution and survival. Among the recommendations to reduce transmission of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19 are social distancing and home confinement. These measures may negatively affect the social life and, consequently, the emotional state and eating behavior of individuals. We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the anxiety, premenstrual symptoms, and eating behavior of young women. Data collection was conducted in person (prepandemic-from March to December 2019) and online (during the pandemic-August 2020). A total of 71 participants, average age of 21.26 years (SD = 0.41), took part in the study. Trait anxiety during the pandemic was significantly lower than in the prepandemic period. Investigation of the ""anxiety/stress"" symptom of the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) revealed that this symptom was more severe before the pandemic. There was a decline in the desire for sweet and fatty foods during the pandemic. However, craving for traditional foods rose significantly in the same period. Uncontrolled and emotional eating were significantly lower during the pandemic. The results suggest that the pandemic may have had a positive impact on anxiety and eating behavior of the participants, which may be due to differences between urban and rural populations and the latter living with their families. These findings are important for raising a discussion regarding the effects of the current environment on the regulation of cognitive and dietary adaptations.","Freitas, F. D.; de Medeiros, A. C.

353318,Should lCU COVID-19 patients empirically receive therapeutic doses of anticoagulant?,2020,"CONTEXT: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that erupted in December 2019 has affected more than a million people from over 200 countries, claiming over 70 000 lives (by April 7, 2020). As the viral infection is driven by increased angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression, with the kidney exhibiting the highest expression, it is crucial to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study considers up-to-date information on the biological determinants shared by COVID-19 and renal disease, and aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of RCC patients with COVID-19. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was performed using all sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Libraries, and Web of Science). As of March 31, 2020, the Center for Disease Control reported that of the adults hospitalized for COVID-19 with underlying conditions in the USA, 74.8% had chronic renal disease. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence is discussed from epidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and molecular studies on the role of kidney in facilitating routes for SARS-CoV-2 entry, leading to increased virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical manifestation of symptoms in RCC. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis will advance our understanding of (1) the molecular signatures shared by RCC and COVID-19 and (2) the clinical implications of overlapping signaling pathways in the therapeutic management of RCC and COVID-19 patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: Amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma and infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may receive complimentary treatment modalities to enhance therapeutic response.","Mihalopoulos, Meredith; Dogra, Navneet; Mohamed, Nihal; Badani, Ketan; Kyprianou, Natasha",Eur Urol Focus,,386
354538,A Case of COVID-19 with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Cardiogenic Shock,2020,"BACKGROUND: Comparative optimism, the belief that negative events are more likely to happen to others rather than to oneself, is well established in health risk research. It is unknown, however, whether comparative optimism also permeates people's health expectations and potentially behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Data were collected through an international survey (N = 6485) exploring people's thoughts and psychosocial behaviours relating to COVID-19. This paper reports UK data on comparative optimism. In particular, we examine the belief that negative events surrounding risk and recovery from COVID-19 are perceived as more likely to happen to others rather than to oneself. METHODS: Using online snowball sampling through social media, anonymous UK survey data were collected from N = 645 adults during weeks 5-8 of the UK COVID-19 lockdown. The sample was normally distributed in terms of age and reflected the UK ethnic and disability profile. FINDINGS: Respondents demonstrated comparative optimism where they believed that as compared to others of the same age and gender, they were unlikely to experience a range of controllable (eg accidentally infect/ be infected) and uncontrollable (eg need hospitalization/ intensive care treatment if infected) COVID-19-related risks in the short term (P < .001). They were comparatively pessimistic (ie thinking they were more at risk than others for developing COVID-19-related infection or symptoms) when thinking about the next year. DISCUSSION: This is one of the first ever studies to report compelling comparative biases in UK adults' thinking about COVID-19.","Asimakopoulou, Koula; Hoorens, Vera; Speed, Ewen; Coulson, Neil S; Antoniszczak, Dominika; Collyer, Fran; Deschrijver, Eliane; Dubbin, Leslie; Faulks, Denise; Forsyth, Rowena; Goltsi, Vicky; Harsløf, Ivan; Larsen, Kristian; Manaras, Irene; Olczak-Kowalczyk, Dorota; Willis, Karen; Xenou, Tatiana; Scambler, Sasha",Health expect,,386

355054,Genetic regulation of OAS1 nonsense-mediated decay underlies association with risk of severe COVID-19,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by pulmonary edema, viral pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, coagulopathy, and inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to infect and damage ciliated epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. In alveoli, gas exchange occurs across an epithelial-endothelial barrier that ties respiration to endothelial cell (EC) regulation of edema, coagulation, and inflammation. How SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates vascular functions to cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients remains an enigma focused on dysregulated EC responses. Whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects functions of the endothelium remains to be resolved and is critical to understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that primary human ECs lack ACE2 receptors at protein and RNA levels and that SARS-CoV-2 is incapable of directly infecting ECs derived from pulmonary, cardiac, brain, umbilical vein, or kidney tissues. In contrast, pulmonary ECs transduced with recombinant ACE2 receptors are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and result in high viral titers (â¼1 × 107/ml), multinucleate syncytia, and EC lysis. SARS-CoV-2 infection of ACE2-expressing ECs elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. The inability of SARS-CoV-2 to directly infect and lyse ECs without ACE2 expression explains the lack of vascular hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients and indicates that the endothelium is not a primary target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with SARS-CoV-2 indirectly activating EC programs that regulate thrombosis and endotheliitis in COVID-19 patients and focus strategies on therapeutically targeting epithelial and inflammatory responses that activate the endothelium or initiate limited ACE2-independent EC infection.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 infects pulmonary epithelial cells through ACE2 receptors and causes ARDS. COVID-19 causes progressive respiratory failure resulting from diffuse alveolar damage and systemic coagulopathy, thrombosis, and capillary inflammation that tie alveolar responses to EC dysfunction. This has prompted theories that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects ECs through ACE2 receptors, yet SARS-CoV-2 antigen has not been colocalized with ECs and prior studies indicate that ACE2 colocalizes with alveolar epithelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, not ECs. Here, we demonstrate that primary human ECs derived from lung, kidney, heart, brain, and umbilical veins require expression of recombinant ACE2 receptors in order to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 lytically infects ACE2-ECs and elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenesis resulting from indirect EC activation, or infection of a small subset of ECs by an ACE2-independent mechanism, that transforms rationales and targets for therapeutic intervention.","Nascimento Conde, Jonas; Schutt, William R; Gorbunova, Elena E; Mackow, Erich R",mBio (Online),,386

In response, consumers have embraced a variety of digital technologies that facilitate in-home or contactless shopping. This study examines the emerging presence of technologies in shopping activities under social distancing by: 1) conceptualising the structures of shopper-facing technologies, and 2) examining the interplay between task-technology fit and technology-trust that influences shoppers' adoption of the multi-dimensional technologies. Exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modelling are used for data analysis (n = 508). Our findings reveal three distinctive dimensions of shopper-facing technologies which are labelled as shopper-dominant (pre-)shopping technologies, shopper-dominant post-shopping technologies, and technology-dominant automations. Shoppers' adoption intention depends on their evaluations of the technology fit in performing shopping tasks characterised by contact avoidance/bstracttminimisation. The impacts of task-technology fit are further moderated by shoppers' trust in those technologies. More importantly, task-technology fit and technology trust are found to demonstrate differentiated explanatory powers toward shoppers’ adoption of the different categories of technologies.","Wang, Xueqin Wong Yiik Diew Chen Tianyi Yuen Kum Fai",Computers in Human Behavior,,386

Given the current lack of an effective vaccine, several drugs have been repurposed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in an attempt to find an effective cure. AREAS COVERED: The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) initially garnered widespread attention following the publication of preliminary results showing that this drug exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. EXPERT OPINION: To date, clinical evidence suggests lack of benefit from HCQ use for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In such patients, HCQ also appears to be associated with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, FDA has recently revoked the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of HCQ and chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Conversely, whether HCQ use may represent an effective prophylactic strategy against COVID-19 is a separate question that still remains to be answered. In addition, relevant aspects regarding the potential risks and benefits of HCQ need to be clarified, in pursuit of a rational use of this drug in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","Infante, Marco; Ricordi, Camillo; Alejandro, Rodolfo; Caprio, Massimiliano; Fabbri, Andrea",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,386

Therefore, several modern techniques including point-of-care diagnosis with a biosensor, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-affiliated proteins that function as nuclease enzyme (Cas) technology, next-generation sequencing, and serological, digital, and imaging approaches have delivered improved and noteworthy success compared to that using traditional strategies. Conventional drug treatment, plasma therapy, and vaccine development are also ongoing. However, alternative medicines including Ayurveda, herbal drugs, homeopathy, and Unani have also been enlisted as prominent treatment strategies for developing herd immunity and physical defenses against COVID-19.

Here, we observed a similar process after Sputnik V vaccination. We examined the longitudinal antibody responses and viral neutralizing capacity to variants of concern (VOCs: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) and a broadly spread variant of interest (VOI: Lambda) in volunteers up to 6 months after receiving the Sputnik V vaccine in Argentina. A collection of 1,800 serum samples obtained between January and August 2021 was used. The analysis indicates that while anti-spike IgG levels significantly wane over time, the neutralizing potency to the first-wave linages of SARS-CoV-2 and VOC increases within four months of vaccination, suggesting that antibody maturation occurs. This increase was more evident for the Beta and Gamma variants, which showed the highest propensity for neutralization escape. Our observations suggest that protection increases over the six months following vaccination as a consequence of antibody maturation, resulting in improved potency of antibodies to viral escape mutations.","Ledesma, Maria M.

Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein cross-linking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3' segment of the product RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product RNA 3' end frays and enters the NTP entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking.

A total of 744 pregnant women registered at the Peking University International Hospital between March 2017 and March 2019 were included in this study. Data on personal characteristics and biochemical indicators of the pregnant women were collected during the first trimester. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups has adopted specific diagnostic criteria as the gold standard for the diagnosis of GDM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve statistics were used to assess the predictive value of first-trimester HbA1c levels in the diagnosis of GDM. HbA1c levels in the first trimester were significantly higher in the GDM group than in the non-GDM group (5.23% ± 0.29% vs. 5.06 ± 0.28%, P < 0.05). The first-trimester HbA1c level was an independent risk factor for gestational diabetes. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of HbA1c for GDM was 0.655 (95% confidence interval 0.620-0.689, P < 0.001). The positive likelihood ratio was the highest at HbA1c = 5.9%, sensitivity was 2.78, and specificity was 99.83%. There was no statistical difference in AUC between fasting blood glucose and HbA1c (P = 0.407). First-trimester HbA1c levels can be used to predict GDM. The risk of GDM was significantly increased in pregnant women with first-trimester HbA1c levels > 5.9%. There was no statistical difference between first-trimester HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels in predicting GDM.","Sun, Jianbin; Chai, Sanbao; Zhao, Xin; Yuan, Ning; Du, Jing; Liu, Yufang; Li, Zhi; Zhang, Xiaomei",J Diabetes Res,,386

Recent studies showed that COVID-19 induces the production of factors previously implicated in the reawakening of dormant breast cancer cells such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The presence of NETs and of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment may therefore promote breast cancer reactivation, increasing the risk of pulmonary metastasis. Further studies will be required to confirm the link between COVID-19 and cancer recurrence. However, an increased awareness on the potential risks for breast cancer patients with COVID-19 may lead to improved treatment strategies to prevent metastatic relapse.","Francescangeli, Federica; De Angelis, Maria Laura; Zeuner, Ann",Breast Cancer Res,,386

METHODS: The mortality rate was evaluated using conditional probability to identify the significant factors, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a multivariable logistic regression analysis were estimated. RESULTS: The mortality rate of patients with underlying health conditions was 12%, which was 4 times higher than that of patients without underlying health conditions. Furthermore, the mortality rates of women and men with underlying health conditions were 5.5 and 3.4 times higher than the mortality rates of patients without underlying health conditions, respectively. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis including sex, age, and underlying health conditions, male sex (OR: 1.83), age &#8805; 41 y (ORs > 2.70), and underlying health conditions (OR: 2.20) were confirmed as risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: More attention should be paid to older patients with underlying diseases and male patients with underlying diseases as the probability of death in this population was significantly higher.","Choi, Won-Young",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,386

In total, 1954 respondents were recruited from a Facebook advertisement. The survey inquired changes in sex life during the pandemic, including satisfaction with the individual's sex life, frequency of sexual activity, frequency of sex-seeking activity, and frequency of using protection for sex. The associations of change in sex life with risk perception of COVID-19, general anxiety, gender, age, and sexual orientation were also examined. For each aspect of their sex life, 1.4%-13.5% of respondents reported a decrease in frequency or satisfaction, and 1.6%-2.9% reported an increase in frequency or satisfaction. Risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly and negatively associated with frequencies of sexual and sex-seeking activities. Higher general anxiety was significantly and negatively associated with satisfaction of sex life and frequencies of sexual and sex-seeking activities. Sexual minority respondents were more likely to report decreased satisfaction with sex life and frequencies of sexual activity and sex-seeking activities during COVID-19. Health care providers should consider these factors when developing strategies for sexual wellness amid respiratory infection epidemics.","Ko, Nai-Ying; Lu, Wei-Hsin; Chen, Yi-Lung; Li, Dian-Jeng; Chang, Yu-Ping; Wu, Chia-Fen; Wang, Peng-Wei; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,386

368395,A systematic review of outcomes of remote consultation in ENT,2021,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a pandemic. Currently, data on changes in sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak are limited. AIM: The present study aimed to obtain a preliminary understanding of the changes in people's sexual behavior, as a result of the pandemic, and explore the context in which they manifest. METHODS: A convenience sample of 270 men and 189 women who completed an online survey consisting of 12 items plus an additional question were included in the study. OUTCOMES: The study outcomes were obtained using a study-specific questionnaire to assess the changes in people's sexual behavior. RESULTS: While there was a wide range of individual responses, our results showed that 44% of participants reported a decrease in the number of sexual partners and about 37% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. Multiple regression analysis showed that age, partner relationship, and sexual desire were closely related to sexual frequency. In addition, we found that most individuals with risky sexual experiences had a rapid reduction in risky sexual behavior. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The current findings contribute to identifying another potential health implication associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and report preliminary evidence of the need to provide potential interventions for the population. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This study is the first to perform a preliminary exploration of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak. The generalizability of the results is limited, given that only a small convenience sample was used. CONCLUSION: During the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, overall sexual activity, frequency, and risky behaviors declined significantly among young men and women in China. Li W, Li G, Xin C, et al.

368396,A systematic review of outcomes of remote consultation in ENT,2021,"There are limited proven therapies for COVID-19. Vitamin C's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects make it a potential therapeutic candidate, both for the prevention and amelioration of COVID-19 infection, and as an adjunctive therapy in the critical care of COVID-19. This literature review focuses on vitamin C deficiency in respiratory infections, including COVID-19, and the mechanisms of action in infectious disease, including support of the stress response, its role in preventing and treating colds and pneumonia, and its role in treating sepsis and COVID-19. The evidence to date indicates that oral vitamin C (2-8 g/day) may reduce the incidence and duration of respiratory infections and intravenous vitamin C (6-24 g/day) has been shown to reduce mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and time on mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory infections. Further trials are urgently warranted. Given the favourable safety profile and low cost of vitamin C, and the frequency of vitamin C deficiency in respiratory infections, it may be worthwhile testing patients' vitamin C status and treating them accordingly with intravenous administration within ICUs and oral administration in hospitalised persons with COVID-19.","Holford, Patrick; Carr, Anitra C; Jovic, Thomas H; Ali, Stephen R; Whitaker, Iain S; Marik, Paul E; Smith, A David",Nutrients,,386

Algorithmic bias is a well-known notion, but what does bias mean in the context of ontologies that provide a structuring mechanism for an algorithm's input? What are the sources of bias there and how would they manifest themselves in ontologies? We examine and enumerate types of bias relevant for ontologies, and whether they are explicit or implicit. These eight types are illustrated with examples from extant production-level ontologies and samples from the literature. We then assessed three concurrently developed COVID-19 ontologies on bias and detected different subsets of types of bias in each one, to a greater or lesser extent.

In this article we recapitulate the molecular mechanisms of host cell entry of SARS-CoV­2 and discuss the current evidence for a potential conjunctival transmission of SARS-CoV­2. The current body of evidence indicates that SARS-CoV­2 requires the membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the membrane-bound serine protease TMPRSS2 to enter cells. Recent studies suggest that COVID-19 patients rarely exhibit viral RNA in tear film and conjunctival smears and that, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are only expressed in small amounts in the conjunctiva, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV­2 via these mediators unlikely. Nevertheless, we consider the current evidence to be still too limited to provide a conclusive statement and recommend appropriate protective measures for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients.","Lange, Clemens; Wolf, Julian; Auw-Haedrich, Claudia; Schlecht, Anja; Boneva, Stefaniya; Lapp, Thabo; Agostini, Hansjürgen; Martin, Gottfried; Reinhard, Thomas; Schlunck, Günther",Ophthalmologe,,386
371665,Finding the real COVID-19 case-fatality rates for SAARC countries,2021,"PURPOSE: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, efforts by radiology departments to protect patients and healthcare workers and mitigate disease spread have reduced imaging volumes. This study aims to quantify the pandemic's impact on physician productivity across radiology practice areas as measured by physician work Relative Value Units (wRVUs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: All signed diagnostic and procedural radiology reports were curated from January 1st to July 1st of 2019 and 2020. Physician work RVUs were assigned to each study type based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Utilizing divisional assignments, radiologist schedules were mapped to each report to generate a sum of wRVUs credited to that division for each week. Differential impact on divisions were calculated relative to a matched timeframe in 2019 and a same length pre-pandemic time period in 2020. RESULTS: All practice areas saw a substantial decrease in wRVUs from the 2020 pre- to intra-pandemic time period with a mean decrease of 51.5% (range 15.4%-76.9%). The largest declines were in Breast imaging, Musculoskeletal, and Neuroradiology, which had decreases of 76.9%, 75.3%, and 67.5%, respectively. The modalities with the greatest percentage decrease were mammography, MRI, and non-PET nuclear medicine. CONCLUSION: All radiology practice areas and modalities experienced a substantial decrease in wRVUs. The greatest decline was in Breast imaging, Neuroradiology, and Musculoskeletal radiology. Understanding the differential impact of the pandemic on practice areas will help radiology departments prepare for the potential depth and duration of the pandemic by better understanding staffing needs and the financial effects.","Poyiadji, Neo; Klochko, Chad; Palazzolo, Josie; Brown, Manuel L; Griffith, Brent",Clin Imaging,,386
371681,Insights from compassionate use of tocilizumab for COVID-19 to inform appropriate design of randomised controlled trials,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive disruption to economies and societies across the world. In terms of demographic processes, mortality has risen in many countries, international migration and mobility has been widely curtailed, and rising unemployment and job insecurity is expected to lower fertility rates in the near future. This paper attempts to examine the possible effects of COVID-19 on Australia's demography over the next two decades, focusing in particular on population ageing. Several population projections were prepared for the period 2019-41. We formulated three scenarios in which the pandemic has a short-lived impact of 2-3 years, a moderate impact lasting about 5 years, or a severe impact lasting up to a decade. We also created two hypothetical scenarios, one of which illustrates Australia's demographic future in the absence of a pandemic for comparative purposes, and another which demonstrates the demographic consequences if Australia had experienced excess mortality equivalent to that recorded in the first half of 2020 in England & Wales. Our projections show that the pandemic will probably have little impact on numerical population ageing but a moderate effect on structural ageing. Had Australia experienced the high mortality observed in England & Wales there would have been 19,400 excess deaths. We caution that considerable uncertainty surrounds the future trajectory of COVID-19 and therefore the demographic responses to it. The pandemic will need to be monitored closely and projection scenarios updated accordingly.","Wilson, Tom; Temple, Jeromey; Charles-Edwards, Elin",J Popul Res (Canberra),,386

A reduction of in-person office visits was planned with provider appointments scheduled to coincide with routine maternal blood tests and obstetric ultrasounds. Dating scans were combined with nuchal translucency assessments to reduce outpatient ultrasound visits. Telehealth was quickly adopted for selected prenatal visits and consultations when deemed appropriate. The more sensitive cell-free fetal DNA test was commonly used to screen for aneuploidy in an effort to decrease return visits for diagnostic genetic procedures. Antenatal testing guidelines were modified with a focus on providing evidence-based testing for maternal and fetal conditions. For complex pregnancies, fetal interventions were undertaken earlier to avoid serial surveillance and repeated in-person hospital visits. These rapid adaptations to traditional prenatal care were designed to decrease the risk of coronavirus exposure of patients, staff, and physicians while continuing to provide safe and comprehensive obstetric care.","Aziz, Aleha; Fuchs, Karin; Nhan-Chang, Chia-Ling; Zork, Noelia; Friedman, Alexander M; Simpson, Lynn L",Semin Perinatol,,386

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of ED health care personnel in 20 geographically diverse university-affiliated EDs from May 13, to July 8, 2020, including case counts of prior laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnoses among all ED health care personnel, and then point-in-time serology (with confirmatory testing) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing in a sample of volunteers without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Health care staff were categorized as clinical (physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses) and nonclinical (clerks, social workers, and case managers). Previously undiagnosed infection was based on positive SARS-CoV-2 serology or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction result among health care personnel without prior diagnosis. RESULTS: Diagnosed COVID-19 occurred in 2.8% of health care personnel (193/6,788), and the prevalence was similar for nonclinical and clinical staff (3.8% versus 2.7%; odds ratio 1.5; 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.2). Among 1,606 health care personnel without previously diagnosed COVID-19, 29 (1.8%) had evidence of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most (62%; 18/29) who were seropositive did not think they had been infected, 76% (19/25) recalled COVID-19-compatible symptoms, and 89% (17/19) continued to work while symptomatic. Accounting for both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections, 4.6% (95% confidence interval 2.8% to 7.5%) of ED health care personnel were estimated to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 38% of those infections undiagnosed. CONCLUSION: In late spring and early summer 2020, the estimated prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was 4.6%, and greater than one third of infections were undiagnosed. Undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection may pose substantial risk for transmission to other staff and patients.","Mohr, Nicholas M; Harland, Karisa K; Krishnadasan, Anusha; Eyck, Patrick Ten; Mower, William R; Willey, James; Chisolm-Straker, Makini; Lim, Stephen C; McDonald, L Clifford; Kutty, Preeta K; Hesse, Elisabeth; Santibanez, Scott; Talan, David A",Ann Emerg Med,,386

And what is the potential of these practices to shape alternatives to development post-COVID-19? We analyze reciprocity practices as hybrid spaces that combine Andean worldviews, market and non-market motivations and political claims against the state Based on the case studies of the Cauca Regional Indigenous Council in Colombia (CRIC) and The National Campesino Movement (FECAOL) in Ecuador, this paper develops three arguments First, as a socio-natural actor, the pandemic forces Andean communities and their organizations to coordinate their efforts to mantain life Second, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzes long-standing recognition of grassroots processes and claims in the Colombian and Ecuadorian Andes The revitalization by the CRIC of reciprocity-based practices such as barters and local markets strongly links self-provisioning with the mobilization of its Indigenous identity and struggles for autonomy These practices also forge a horizontal ‘solidarity’ with other social movements, consolidating a common framework of self-protection against the neoliberal state For example, FECAOL does politics and builds coalitions through reciprocity-based action as an expression of its desire to engage with the state at different scales Fair markets and agroecological baskets are combined with barter and gifts to provide for populations in need and to shift oppressive power-relations in the agro-chain and towards a holistic, bottom-up construction of the ‘public’ to address societal needs Finally, studied grassroots organizations build coalitions and present their visions of a diverse or mixed economy to the society at large to erode the dominance of capitalism To become a ‘counter-movement’ post-COVID-19, we conclude, they need to scale up to broader levels of society","Córdoba, Diana Peredo Ana Maria Chaves Paola",World Development,,386

Due to their tunable dimensions, abundant selection of materials, mechanical stability, high porosity, and enlarged pore surface, the formed porous interfaces show specific significance in bio-related systems. In this study, recent achievements related to applications of porous interfaces and a focus into biological and medical-related systems are summarized. The discussion involves the preparation of porous interfaces, and porous interface-induced cell behaviors including culture, growth, proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation of cells. The inhibitory effect of bacteria and separated features of microorganisms supported by porous interfaces, the immobilization of biomolecules related to proteins, DNA and enzymes, and the controllable drug delivery are also discussed. The summary of recent advances pointed out in the study, are suggestive of insights for motivating unique potential applications including their extension to porous interfaces in biomedical materials.","Liang, Jing; Li, Bao; Wu, Lixin",,,386
377181,Clinical Features of Patients with COVID-19: is Temperature Screening Useful?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical characteristics of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Southeast Michigan. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eight hospitals in Southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: 3219 hospitalised patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal PCR test from 13 March 2020 until 29 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes were discharge from the hospital or in-hospital death. Examined predictors included patient demographics, chronic diseases, home medications, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital medications and timeframe of hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 3219 (90.4%) patients were discharged or died in the hospital. The median age was 65.2 (IQR 52.6-77.2) years, the median length of stay in the hospital was 6.0 (IQR 3.2-10.1) days, and 51% were female. Hypertension was the most common chronic disease, occurring in 2386 (74.1%) patients. Overall mortality rate was 16.0%. Blacks represented 52.3% of patients and had a mortality rate of 13.5%. Mortality was highest at 18.5% in the prepeak hospital COVID-19 volume, decreasing to 15.3% during the peak period and to 10.8% in the postpeak period. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.05, p<0.001) for every increase in 1 year of age and being male (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.81, p<0.001). Certain chronic diseases increased the odds of in-hospital mortality, especially chronic kidney disease. Administration of vitamin C, corticosteroids and therapeutic heparin in the hospital was associated with higher odds of death. CONCLUSION: In-hospital mortality was highest in early admissions and improved as our experience in treating patients with COVID-19 increased. Blacks were more likely to get admitted to the hospital and to receive mechanical ventilation, but less likely to die in the hospital than whites.","Mulhem, Elie; Oleszkowicz, Andrew; Lick, David",BMJ Open,,386

Here, in contrast, we describe real-time, seconds-resolved measurements of plasma phenylalanine collected in situ in the body via electrochemical aptamer-based (EAB) sensors, a platform technology that is independent of the reactivity of its targets and thus is generalizable to many. Specifically, using indwelling EAB sensors, we have monitored plasma phenylalanine in live rats with a few micromolar precision and a 12 s temporal resolution, identifying a large-amplitude, few-seconds phase in the animals' metabolic response that had not previously been reported. Using the hundreds of individual measurements that the approach provides from each animal, we also identify inter-subject variability, including statistically significant differences associated with the feeding status. These results highlight the power of in vivo EAB measurements, an advancement that could dramatically impact our understanding of physiology and provide a valuable new tool for the monitoring and treatment of metabolic disorders.","Idili, Andrea; Gerson, Julian; Kippin, Tod; Plaxco, Kevin W",Anal. chem,,386

This group includes the mooneyes (Hiodontidae), knifefishes (Notopteridae), the abu (Gymnarchidae), elephantfishes (Mormyridae), arawanas and pirarucu (Osteoglossidae), and the African butterfly fish (Pantodontidae). This morphologically heterogeneous group also has a long and diverse fossil record, including taxa from all continents and both freshwater and marine deposits. The phylogenetic relationships among most extant osteoglossomorph families are widely agreed upon. However, there is still much to discover about the systematic biology of these fishes, particularly with regard to the phylogenetic affinities of several fossil taxa, within Mormyridae, and the position of Pantodon. In this paper we review the state of knowledge for osteoglossomorph fishes. We first provide an overview of the diversity of Osteoglossomorpha, and then discuss studies of the phylogeny of Osteoglossomorpha from both morphological and molecular perspectives, as well as biogeographic analyses of the group.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the impact on contamination characteristics before and after the second partial lockdown in France to adapt public health restrictions to further prevent pandemic surges. METHODS: Between December 15 and 24, 2020, after a national media campaign, users of the sourcecovid.fr web application were asked questions about their own or a close relative's COVID-19 contamination after August 15, 2020, in France. The data of the contamination's circumstances were assessed and compared before and after the second partial lockdown, which occurred on October 25, 2020, during the second wave of the pandemic and was ongoing on December 24, 2020. RESULTS: As of December 24, 2020, 441,000 connections on the web application were observed. A total of 2218 questionnaires were assessable for analysis. About 61.8% (n=1309) of the participants were sure of their contamination origin, and 38.2% (n=809) thought they knew it. The median age of users was 43.0 (IQR 32-56) years, and 50.7% (n=1073) were male. The median incubation time of the assessed cohort was 4.0 (IQR 3-5) days. Private areas (family's or friend's house) were the main source of contamination (1048/2090, 50.2%), followed by work colleagues (579/2090, 27.7%). The main time of day for the contamination was the evening (339/961, 35.3%) before the lockdown and was reduced to 18.2% (86/473) after the lockdown (P<.001). The person who transmitted the virus to the user before and after the lockdown was significantly different (P<.001): a friend (382/1317, 29% vs 109/773, 14.1%), a close relative (304/1317, 23.1% vs 253/773, 32.7%), or a work colleague (315/1317, 23.9% vs 264/773, 34.2%). The main location where the virus was transmitted to the users before and after the lockdown was significantly different too (P<.001): home (278/1305, 21.3% vs 194/760, 25.5%), work (293/1305, 22.5% vs 225/760, 29.6%), collective places (430/1305, 33% vs 114/760, 15%), and care centers (58/1305, 4.4% vs 74/760, 9.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Modalities of transmissions significantly changed before and after the second lockdown in France. The main sources of contamination remained the private areas and with work colleagues. Work became the main location of contamination after the lockdown, whereas contaminations in collective places were strongly reduced.

SARS-CoV-2 has a similar structure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1(SARS-CoV-1). The S protein on the surface of the virus is cleaved by host proprotein convertases (PCs) to expose the active N-terminal S1 extracellular domain. Its receptors are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the C-terminal S2 membrane anchoring protein is responsible for translocating the virus into the cell. Among patients with COVID-19, there is a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and more than 7% of patients have suffered myocardial damage due to the infection, but the internal mechanism is still poorly understood. There is currently no specific and effective targeted treatment. Reduction of the patient's morbidity and mortality is an urgent problem that needs to be solved clinically.

Methods: We included all consecutive patients referred for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or NSTEMI during the first 3 weeks of April 2020 in 5 university hospitals (Paris, south and north of France), all performing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Results: The study included 237 patients (67±14, 69% of male), 116 (49%) with STEMI and 121 (51%) with NSTEMI. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 associated ACS was 11% (n=26) and 11 patients had severe hypoxemia on presentation (mechanical ventilation or nasal oxygen >6L/min). Patients were comparable regarding medical history and risk factors, except a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in SARS-CoV-2 patients (53.8% vs 25.6%, p=0.003). In SARS-CoV-2 patients, cardiac arrest on admission was more frequent (26.9% vs. 6.6%, p<0.001). The presence of significant coronary artery disease and culprit artery occlusion in SARS-CoV-2 patients, was 92% and 69.4% for STEMI, 50% and 15.5% for NSTEMI. PCI was performed in the same percentage of STEMI (84.6%) and NSTEMI (84.8%) cases, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but no-reflow (19.2% vs. 3.3%, p<0.001) was greater in SARS-CoV-2 patients. In-hospital death occurred in 7 SARS-CoV-2 patients (5 from cardiac cause) and was higher compared to non-infected patients (26.9% vs 6.2%, p<0.001).

A Single-Centre Observational Study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Presently, evidence guiding clinicians on the optimal approach to safely screen patients for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to a nonemergent hospital procedure is scarce. In this report, we describe our experience in screening for SARS-CoV-2 prior to semiurgent and urgent hospital procedures. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: A single tertiary-care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Our study cohort included patients &#8805;18 years of age who had semiurgent or urgent hospital procedures or surgeries. METHODS: Overall, 625 patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a combination of phone questionnaire (7 days prior to the anticipated procedure), RT-PCR and chest computed tomography (CT) between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 625 patients, 520 scans (83.2%) were interpreted as normal; 1 (0.16%) had typical features of COVID-19; 18 scans (2.88%) had indeterminate features of COVID-19; and 86 (13.76%) had atypical features of COVID-19. In total, 640 RT-PCRs were performed, with 1 positive result (0.15%) in a patient with a CT scan that yielded an atypical finding. Of the 18 patients with chest CTs categorized as indeterminate, 5 underwent repeat negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab 1 week after their initial swab. Also, 1 patient with a chest CT categorized as typical had a follow-up repeat negative RT-PCR, indicating that the chest CT was likely a false positive. After surgery, none of the patients developed signs or symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 that would indicate the need for a repeated RT-PCR or CT scan. CONCLUSION: In our experience, chest CT scanning did not prove provide valuable information in detecting asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in our low-prevalence population.","Shah, Aditya S; Walkoff, Lara A; Kuzo, Ronald S; Callstrom, Matthew R; Brown, Michael J; Kendrick, Michael L; Narr, Bradly J; Berbari, Elie",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,386
384934,"Clinical Course of COVID-19 Patients Treated with ECMO: a Multicenter Study in Daegu, South Korea",2020,"Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is an essential method for specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, false negative test results are often reported. In this study, we attempted to determine the principal causes leading to false negative results of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in respiratory tract specimens. Multiple sputum and throat swab specimens from 161 confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested with a commercial fluorescent RT-PCR kit targeting the ORF1ab and N regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RNA level of a cellular housekeeping gene ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30 (RPP30) in these specimens was also assessed by RT-PCR. Data for a total of 1052 samples were retrospectively re-analyzed and a strong association between positive results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and high level of RPP30 RNA in respiratory tract specimens was revealed. By using the ROC-AUC analysis, we identified Ct cutoff values for RPP30 RT-PCR which predicted false negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with high sensitivity (95.03%-95.26%) and specificity (83.72%-98.55%) for respective combination of specimen type and amplification reaction. Using these Ct cutoff values, false negative results could be reliably identified. Therefore, the presence of cellular materials, likely infected host cells, are essential for correct SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR in patient specimens. RPP30 could serve as an indicator for cellular content, or a surrogate indicator for specimen quality. In addition, our results demonstrated that false negativity accounted for a vast majority of contradicting results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA test by RT-PCR.","Zhang, Yafei; Wang, Changtai; Han, Mingfeng; Ye, Jun; Gao, Yong; Liu, Zhongping; He, Tengfei; Li, Tuantuan; Xu, Mengyuan; Zhou, Luping; Zou, Guizhou; Lu, Mengji; Zhang, Zhenhua",Virol. sin.

387267,"Clinical outcome, risk assessment, and seasonal variation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients-Results from the CORONA Germany study",2021,"A life-threatening respiratory illness (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 coronavirus was first described in December 2019 in Wuhan (China), rapidly evolving into a pandemic. In the first phase, when the viral replication plays a pivotal pathogenetic role, antiviral drugs could be crucial in limiting viral-induced organ damage. Unfortunately, there are no specific antivirals of proven efficacy for COVID-19, and several drugs have been repurposed to face this dramatic pandemic. In this paper we review the studies evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir association (LPV/r) use in COVID-19, and previously in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We searched PubMed to identify all relevant clinical and laboratory studies published up to 15 May 2020; the guidelines on the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 were further directly searched on the website of the main international scientific societies and agencies. Available evidence is currently scarce and of low quality. The recommendations issued for COVID-19 vary from positions clearly against the use of LPV/r to other positions that are more favorable. In our opinion, despite the controversial results of an important randomized clinical trial, and some recommendations, clinicians should not abandon the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID-19, possibly using this drug inside a prospective randomized trial, waiting for the results of the numerous ongoing trials evaluating its efficacy.","Meini, Simone; Pagotto, Alberto; Longo, Benedetta; Vendramin, Igor; Pecori, Davide; Tascini, Carlo",J.

A particular activity impacted by this pandemic is leisure. Within leisure, an important activity to enhance social outcomes (e.g., civic participation) and the survival of organizations and events is volunteering. However, and given social distancing measures and the combination of postponements or cancelations of organizational or event operations, the traditional form of in-person volunteering is threatened. The purpose of this essay is to discuss opportunities and challenges for organizations and events to apply virtual volunteering as a strategy during the pandemic and beyond. Both opportunities (i.e., creating accessibility) and challenges (i.e., management process) are discussed according to pertinent literature. From this, an understanding of virtual volunteering’s value to create leisure opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond is presented to advance its implementation in organization and events by leisure practitioners.","Lachance, Erik L.",Leis.

392958,Association Analysis of Hyperlipidemia with the 28-Day All-Cause Mortality of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients,2021,"Insular epilepsy is increasingly recognized in epilepsy surgery centers. Recent studies suggest that resection of an epileptogenic zone that involves the insula as a treatment for drug-resistant seizures is associated with good outcomes in terms of seizure control. However, despite the existing evidence of a role of the insula in emotions and affective information processing, the long-term psychological outcome of patients undergoing these surgeries remain poorly documented. A group of 27 adults (18 women) who underwent an insulo-opercular resection (in combination with a part of the temporal lobe in 10, and of the frontal lobe in 5) as part of epilepsy surgery at our center between 2004 and 2019 completed psychometric questionnaires to assess depression (Beck Depression Inventory - 2nd edition; BDI-II), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait Version; STAI-T), and quality of life (Patient Weighted Quality of Life In Epilepsy; QOLIE-10-P). Scores were compared to those of patients who had standard temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery with similar socio-demographic and disease characteristics. Seizure control after insular epilepsy surgery was comparable to that observed after TLE surgery, with a majority of patients reporting being seizure free (insular: 63.0%; temporal: 63.2%) or having rare disabling seizures (insular: 7.4%; temporal: 18.4%) at the time of questionnaire completion. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant group difference on scores of depression, anxiety, or quality of life. Hemisphere or extent of insular resection had no significant effect on the studied variables. In the total sample, employment status and seizure control, but not location of surgery, significantly predicted quality of life. Self-reported long-term psychological status after insulo-opercular resection as part of epilepsy surgery thus appears to be similar to that observed after TLE surgery, which is commonly performed in epilepsy surgery centers.","Gravel, Victoria; Boucher, Olivier; Citherlet, Daphné; Hébert-Seropian, Benjamin; Bouthillier, Alain; Nguyen, Dang Khoa",Epilepsy Behav,,386

The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions, feelings and unmet needs of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who experienced the 2-month lockdown in a ""red zone"" in the northern part of Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: The study had a descriptive design that used a cross-sectional online survey which included open-ended questions to elicit responses on the participant's feelings concerning their risk of contracting coronavirus, how their physical activity had changed, and their personal needs, dictated by their condition, which were not met in this pandemic period as compared to previous periods. Demographic data were analysed using descriptive frequencies, while the open-ended questions were analysed using thematic framework analysis. RESULTS: The study included 103 participants (63 men/40 women [61.17 vs. 38.83%]). Framework analysis led to the identification of four main themes: (i) fearing the risk of contracting coronavirus; (ii) reduction of physical activity; (iii) perception of the risk of not being able to access outpatient clinics or support services; and (iv) negative experiences of the important reduction in socialization. The perceptions of unmet needs appeared to be greater than the actual experience, particularly for the reduction in physical activity and the interruption of contacts with the neurologist and other specialists. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how perceptions and actual experience shape the meaning of living with PD during the pandemic. Worth noting is the divergence between perceptions and real impact in some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Cavallieri, Francesco; Sireci, Francesca; Fioravanti, Valentina; Toschi, Giulia; Rispoli, Vittorio; Antonelli, Francesca; Costantini, Massimo; Ghirotto, Luca; Valzania, Franco",Eur. j. neurol,,386

394397,The first fatal post-COVID-19 adult patient with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in Israel,2021,"Several microRNAs (miRNA/miR) have been reported to serve critical roles in tumorigenesis. The present study aimed to investigate miR-518b expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and determine its clinical significance and biological function in this malignancy. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to assess miR-518b expression in NSCLC. The diagnostic value of miR-518b was determined via a receiver operating characteristic curve, while its prognostic value was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine the functional role of miR-518b in NSCLC progression. The results demonstrated that miR-518b expression was upregulated in NSCLC serum, tissues and cell lines compared with the corresponding normal controls. Furthermore, high miR-518b expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage, as well as poor overall survival in patients with NSCLC. Serum miR-518b expression was identified as a candidate diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC, with sensitivity of 88.1% and specificity of 81.7%. Furthermore, the cell experiments indicated that NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were enhanced following overexpression of miR-518b; however, these effects were reversed following miR-518b knockdown. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that elevated miR-518b expression in NSCLC serves a potential oncogenic role by facilitating tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and thus may serve as a candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.","Zhang, Xinfang; Hu, Ying; Gong, Cuixue; Zhang, Chunjie",Oncol Lett,,386

CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Rehabilitation psychologists and other professionals should be aware of the potential for trauma and stress among disabled clients and work with them to mitigate its effects. Additionally, psychologists should also work with the disability community and disabled colleagues to address systemic and institutional ableism and its intersections with other forms of oppression.

399647,Early recovery patterns of olfactory disorders in COVID-19 patients; a clinical cohort study,2020,"Coronaviruses are contagious pathogens primarily responsible for respiratory and intestinal infections. Research efforts to develop antiviral agents against coronavirus demonstrated the main protease (Mpro) protein may represent effective drug target. X-ray crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV2 Mpro protein demonstrated the significance of Glu166, Cys141, and His41 residues involved in protein dimerization and its catalytic function. We performed in silico screening of compounds from Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae family) against Mpro protein inhibition. Employing a combination of molecular docking, scoring functions, and molecular dynamics simulations, 267 compounds were screened by docking on Mpro crystallographic structure. Docking score and interaction profile analysis exhibited strong binding on the Mpro catalytic domain with compounds C1 (1E,6E)-1,2,6,7-tetrahydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)hepta-1,6-diene-3,5-dione) and C2 (4Z,6E)-1,5-dihydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)hepta-4,6-dien-3-one as lead agents. Compound C1 and C2 showed minimum binding score (-9.08 and -8.07 kcal/mole) against Mpro protein in comparison to shikonin and lopinavir (&#8776; -5.4 kcal/mole) a standard Mpro inhibitor. Furthermore, principal component analysis, free energy landscape and protein-ligand energy calculation studies revealed that these two compounds strongly bind to the catalytic core of the Mpro protein with higher efficacy than lopinavir, a standard antiretroviral of the protease inhibitor class. Taken together, this structure based optimization has provided lead on two natural Mpro inhibitors for further testing and development as therapeutics against human coronavirus.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In this work, a decomposable cellulose-based wet wipe substrate is demonstrated by introducing a synthetic N-vinyl pyrrolidone-glycidyl methacrylate (NVP-GMA) adhesive on the cellulose surface. Experimental results reveal that the NVP-GMA adhesive not only significantly facilitates the chemical bonding between cellulose fibers in the wet state, but also increase the surface wettability and water retention. The as-fabricated cellulose-based wet wipe substrate displays a superb water retention capacity of 1.9 times, an excellent water absorption capacity (completely wetted with 0° water contact angle), and a perfect wet tensile index of 3.32 N.m.g-1. It is far better than state-of-the-art wet toilet wipe on the market (non-woven). The prepared renewable and degradable cellulose-based substrate with excellent mechanical strength has potential application prospects in diverse commercially available products such as sanitary and medical wet wipes.","Yun, Tongtong; Cheng, Peng; Qian, Fang; Cheng, Yi; Lu, Jie; Lv, Yanna; Wang, Haisong",Int J Biol Macromol,,386

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children (MIS-C), with symptoms similar to Kawasaki syndrome, was described in young minors testing positive for COVID-19. The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined MIS-C as occurring in <21-year-olds, triggering hundreds of PubMed-listed papers. However, postpubertal adolescents are no longer children biologically; the term MIS-C is misleading. Furthermore, MIS also occurs in adults, termed MIS-A by the CDC. Acute and delayed inflammations can be triggered by COVID-19. The 18th birthday is an administrative not a biological age limit, whereas the body matures slowly during puberty. This blur in defining children leads to confusion regarding MIS-C/MIS-A. United States and European Union (EU) drug approval is handled separately for children, defined as <18-year-olds, ascribing non-existent physical characteristics up to the 18th birthday. This blur between the administrative and the physiological meanings for the term child is causing flawed demands for pediatric studies in all drugs and vaccines, including those against COVID-19. Effective treatment of all conditions, including COVID-19, should be based on actual physiological need. Now, the flawed definition for children in the development of drugs and vaccines and their approval is negatively impacting prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in minors. This review reveals the necessity for redefining pediatric age groups to rapidly establish recommendations for optimal prevention and treatment in minors.","Rose, Klaus; Grant-Kels, Jane M; Ettienne, Earl B; Tanjinatus, Oishi; Striano, Pasquale; Neubauer, David",,,386

The results of recent studies have suggested that neonates may present symptoms of COVID-19. Although the presentation of the disease in neonates is known to vary, only a limited number of studies have investigated newborns infected with COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: This study presents two Asian cases of newborns with COVID-19. Maternal-fetal or postnatal transmission was suggested based on the simultaneity of maternal infection. Chest radiography in one of the neonates showed severe lung involvement. Despite support and resuscitation attempts, the poor clinical condition of the neonate led to his death. However, the two mothers and one of the neonates were discharged from the hospital in good general condition. CONCLUSION: The neonates had worse clinical conditions than the mothers, and the intensity of pneumonia and level of lung involvement in the newborns were not associated with the stage and severity of the disease in the mothers with COVID-19.","Moeindarbary, Somayeh; Pourhoseini, Azam; Layegh, Parvaneh; Shahriari, Zahra; Fayyaz, Faezeh; Bahrami, Milad; Rafiee, Mahdi",J Med Case Rep,,386

Secondary aims were to determine predictors of COVID-19 status on presentation and later in the admission; the rate of hospital acquired COVID-19; and the predictive value of negative swabs on admission. METHODS: A nationwide multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted of all patients presenting with a hip fracture to 17 Scottish centres in March and April 2020. Demographics, presentation blood tests, COVID-19 status, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, management, length of stay, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: In all, 78/833 (9.4%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The 30-day survival of patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower than for those without (65.4% vs 91%; p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 within seven days of admission (likely community acquired) was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio (OR) 2.34, p = 0.040, confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 5.25) and symptoms of COVID-19 (OR 15.56, CI 6.61 to 36.60, p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 made between seven and 30 days of admission to hospital (likely hospital acquired) was independently associated with male sex (OR 1.73, CI 1.05 to 2.87, p = 0.032), Nottingham Hip Fracture Score &#8805; 7 (OR 1.91, CI 1.09 to 3.34, p = 0.024), pulmonary disease (OR 1.68, CI 1.00 to 2.81, p = 0.049), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade &#8805; 3 (OR 2.37, CI 1.13 to 4.97, p = 0.022), and length of stay &#8805; nine days (OR 1.98, CI 1.18 to 3.31, p = 0.009). A total of 38 (58.5%) COVID-19 cases were probably hospital acquired infections. The false-negative rate of a negative swab on admission was 0% in asymptomatic patients and 2.9% in symptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was independently associated with a three times increased 30-day mortality rate. Nosocomial transmission may have accounted for approximately half of all cases during the first wave of the pandemic. Identification of risk factors for having COVID-19 on admission or acquiring COVID-19 in hospital may guide pathways for isolating or shielding patients respectively. Length of stay was the only modifiable risk factor, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality and timely care in this patient group.","Hall, Andrew J; Clement, Nick D; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; White, Tim O; Duckworth, Andrew D",Bone Joint J,,386

The outbreak started in China and spread rapidly to almost every country, culminating in woefully overwhelmed health-care systems in most countries. The only approved diagnostic test to accompany radiographic evaluation is reverse transcription PCR. However, the applicability of this test in diagnosis and surveillance is challenged by a global shortage of reagents and the lack of well-equipped laboratories with specialized staff in several low- and middle-income countries. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification and CRISPR-based diagnostic assays have developed and expected to play a role however, their accuracy is still inferior to the recommended PCR approach. The need for the development of accurate and rapid diagnostic assays became apparent. Immunodiagnostic tests and other molecular approaches were developed and tested. Other recently developed point-of-care molecular tests are expected to be helpful in pandemic management as no particular skills are required from the operator. Fortunately, a number of serological tests have been granted authorization for use under the emergency situation by the US FDA for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The majority of recently authorized serological tests detect IgG and IgM in blood of infected individuals by on ELISA, chemiluminescence platforms or lateral flow cassettes.","Abduljalil, J.

The experimental setup and its automation and control approach are described in detail. A characterization of the optical density of the atomic ensemble as well as the basic statistical measurements of the generated light are reported. The non-classical nature of the photons pairs is confirmed by observing a violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by a factor of 5.6 $\times 10^5$ in a Hanbury Brown - Twiss interferometer. A $1/e$ coherence time for the heralded, idler photons of $4.4 \pm 0.1$ ns is estimated from our observations. We are able to achieve a value of $10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$ pair-detection-rate, which results in a spectral brightness of 280 (MHz s)$^{-1}$. The combination of high brightness and narrow-band spectrum makes this photon-pair source a viable tool in fundamental studies of quantum states and opens the door to use them in quantum technologies.","Arias-T'ellez, N.; 'Angeles-Aguill'on, I.

409084,D-dimer in patients infected with COVID-19 and suspected pulmonary embolism,2020,"BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown whether exergaming is efficacious in people with major neurocognitive disorder (MNCD) residing in long-term care facilities. This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the efficacy of a stepping exergame program on gait speed, balance, mobility, reaction time, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes, quality of life, and daily life functioning in people with MNCD residing in long-term care facilities. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weeks, three times weekly, 15 min of exergaming versus watching preferred music videos. The exergame device consisted of a pressure-sensitive step training platform on which participants performed stepping movements to play the games. The device automatically adapted the training level to the participants' capabilities. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), step reaction time test (SRTT), Montréal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Dementia Quality of Life (DQoL), and Katz Activities of Daily Living (Katz ADL) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. A Quade's non-parametric ANCOVA controlling for baseline values with post hoc Bonferroni correction (p < 0.00625) was used to analyze pre- and post-differences between the groups. Partial eta-squared (Î·2p) effect sizes were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-five of 55 randomized inpatients with mild to moderate MNCD (Mini-Mental State Examination score = 17.2 ± 4.5; aged 70-91; 35 women) completed the study. The exergame group (n = 23) demonstrated improvements in gait speed (p < 0.001, Î·2p = 0.41), total SPPB (p < 0.001, Î·2p = 0.64), SRTT (p<0.001, Î·2p = 0.51), MoCA (p<0.001, Î·2p = 0.38), and reductions in CSDD (p<0.001, Î·2p = 0.43) compared to the control group (n = 22). There were no differences in NPI (p = 0.165, Î·2p = 0.05), DQoL (p = 0.012, Î·2p = 0.16), and ADL (p = 0.008, Î·2p = 0.16) post-intervention scores between the experimental and control group, albeit DQol and ADL measures showed large effect sizes in the exergame group. The mean attendance rate was 82.9% in the exergame group and 73.7% in the music control group. There were no study-related adverse events reported by the participants, nor observed by the research team.

409086,High-frequency vs. conventional ventilation at the time of CDH repair is not associated with higher mortality and oxygen dependency: a retrospective cohort study,2020,"Education has traditionally been classroom-oriented with a gradual growth of online courses in recent times. However, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically accelerated the shift to online classes. Associated with this learning format is the question: what do people think about the educational value of an online course compared to a course taken in-person in a classroom? This paper addresses the question and presents a Bayesian quantile analysis of public opinion using a nationally representative survey data from the United States. Our findings show that previous participation in online courses and full-time employment status favor the educational value of online courses. We also find that the older demographic and females have a greater propensity for online education. In contrast, highly educated individuals have a lower willingness towards online education vis-\`a-vis traditional classes. Besides, covariate effects show heterogeneity across quantiles which cannot be captured using probit or logit models.","Ojha, Manini; Rahman, Mohammad Arshad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06994v1.pdf,386

However, there is now cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In the present paper, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.","Scholkopf, Bernhard; Locatello, Francesco; Bauer, Stefan; Ke, Nan Rosemary; Kalchbrenner, Nal; Goyal, Anirudh; Bengio, Yoshua",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11107v1.pdf,386
409174,Vitamin D supplementation to prevent COVID-19 in patients with COPD: a research perspective,2020,"Although the development of successful vaccines against coronaviruses may be achieved, for some individuals the immune response that they stimulate may prove to be insufficient for effective host defence. The principle that a relatively strong contact allergen will have an enhancing effect on sensitization compared with a less potent contact allergen if they are co-administered, may not, at first, appear relevant to this issue. However, this augmentation effect is thought to be due to the sharing of common or complementary pathways. Here, we briefly consider aspects of the shared and complementary pathways between skin sensitization induced by exposure to a contact allergen and the immune response to viruses, with particular reference to COVID-19. The relationship leads us to explore whether this principle, which we name here as ""co-operative immune augmentation"" may be extended to include viral vaccination. We consider evidence that even relatively weak contact allergens, used in vaccines for other purposes, can show enhanced sensitization, which is in keeping with a co-operative augmentation principle. Finally, we consider how the potent contact allergen diphenylcyclopropenone could be employed safely as an enhancer of vaccine responses.","Cunningham, Louise S; McFadden, John P; Basketter, David A; Ferguson, Felicity J; White, Ian R; Kimber, Ian",Contact Dermatitis,,386

Studies in South Africa (1) and the United Kingdom (2) found an independent association between HIV infection and COVID-19 mortality; however, other studies have not found an association between poor COVID-19 outcomes and either HIV status among hospitalized patients (3-5) or HIV-associated factors such as CD4 count, viral load, or type of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (6). The effect of HIV infection on COVID-19 outcomes remains an urgent question in sub-Saharan Africa, where many countries are experiencing dual HIV and COVID-19 epidemics, and capacity to treat severe COVID-19 is limited. Using data from patients with probable or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to specialized treatment centers during March-December 2020 in Zambia, the Zambian Ministry of Health and CDC assessed the relationship between HIV infection and severe COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated death. Among 443 patients included in the study, 122 (28%) were HIV-positive, and of these, 91 (89%) were receiving ART at the time of hospitalization. HIV status alone was not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 at admission or during hospitalization or with COVID-19-associated death. However, among HIV-positive persons, those with severe HIV disease were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 and were at increased risk for COVID-19-associated death. Ensuring that persons maintain HIV disease control, including maintaining ART continuity and adherence, achieving viral suppression, and addressing and managing underlying medical conditions, could help reduce COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.","Chanda, Duncan; Minchella, Peter A; Kampamba, Davies; Itoh, Megumi; Hines, Jonas Z; Fwoloshi, Sombo; Boyd, Mary Adetinuke; Hamusonde, Kalongo; Chirwa, Lameck; Nikoi, Kotey; Chirwa, Robert; Siwingwa, Mpanji; Sivile, Suilanji; Zyambo, Khozya D; Mweemba, Aggrey; Mbewe, Nyuma; Mutengo, Katongo H; Malama, Kennedy; Agolory, Simon; Mulenga, Lloyd B",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,386

METHODS: A total of 207 of the 318 Black participants (65%) in the RAND American Life Panel, a nationally representative internet panel, were surveyed about COVID-19 vaccine intentions in November-December 2020. Participants' census tracts were geocoded using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index. RESULTS: Overall, 35% agreed or strongly agreed that they would not get a COVID-19 vaccine, 40% agreed or strongly agreed that they would get vaccinated, and 25% reported ""don't know."" Significant multivariable predictors of not wanting to get vaccinated included high mistrust of the vaccine itself (e.g., concerns about harm and side effects), OR (95% CI)â¯=â¯2.2 (1.2-3.9), pâ¯=â¯.007, and weak subjective norms for vaccination in one's close social network, OR (95% CI)â¯=â¯0.6 (0.4-0.7), p < .001. Residence in an area of higher socioeconomic vulnerability was a marginally significant predictor, OR (95% CI)â¯=â¯3.1 (0.9-11.0), pâ¯=â¯.08. CONCLUSIONS: High mistrust around COVID-19 vaccines may lower vaccine confidence. Social network members' attitudes can be influential in encouraging vaccination. Public health communications could use transparent and clear messaging on safety and efficacy, and acknowledge historical and ongoing discrimination and racism as understandable reasons for low confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Future research is needed to consider vaccine access challenges in tandem with mistrust as contributing to low vaccination rates across health conditions.","Bogart, Laura M; Dong, Lu; Gandhi, Priya; Klein, David J; Smith, Terry L; Ryan, Samantha; Ojikutu, Bisola O",J. natl. med. assoc,,386

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a preliminary report of a prospective observational study performed in four teaching intensive care units. We studied 27 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19. Sublingual microcirculation was assessed by hand-held videomicroscopy. A software-assisted analysis of videos was performed. We also measured capillary refill time. RESULTS: Patients were hemodynamically stable with normal lactate (1.8 [1.6-2.5] mmol/L) and high D-dimer (1.30 [0.58-2.93] µg/mL). Capillary refill time was prolonged (3.5 [3.0-5.0] s). Compared to previously reported normal values, total and perfused vascular density (21.9 ± 3.9 and 21.0 ± 3.5 mm/mm2) and heterogeneity flow index (0.91 ± 0.24) were high; and the proportion of perfused vessels (0.96 ± 0.03), microvascular flow index (2.79 ± 0.10), and red blood cell velocity (1124 ± 161 µm/s) were reduced. The proportion of perfused vessels was inversely correlated with total vascular density (Pearson r = -0.41, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients showed an altered tissue perfusion. Sublingual microcirculation was characterized by decreases in the proportion of perfused vessel and flow velocity along with high vascular densities. This last finding might be related to enhanced angiogenesis or hypoxia-induced capillary recruitment.","Kanoore Edul, Vanina Siham; Caminos Eguillor, Juan Francisco; Ferrara, Gonzalo; Estenssoro, Elisa; Siles, Daniel Shiovan Páez; Cesio, Cristián Emanuel; Dubin, Arnaldo",J Crit Care,,386

419661,Assessment of the Modified CHA2DS2VASc Risk Score in Predicting Mortality in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19,2020,"Covid-19 is a phenomenon of enormous magnitude and relevance. Its impact has affected various social domains, including the media and journalism. Since the beginning of this health crisis, the news has become a valuable resource for citizens. Studying the dynamics of information consumption is highly relevant both for its ability to transform the media system and for its incidence in democracy. The objective of this research is to analyse the influence of the new coro-navirus on news consumption, the credibility given by citizens to the media as well as their ability to detect fake news. To answer these questions, we have conducted an exploratory analysis based on the secondary data from the online surveys of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel in the United States, comparing data before and after the outbreak. The results confirm the impact of Covid-19 on the media system. The findings suggest the emergence of im-portant developments such as the resurgence of the role of legacy media, especially television, and the fact that citizens who usually remain far from the information have reconnected with the news. Therefore, the existing inequalities regar-ding news consumption among citizens have been reduced, in part.

We introduce a resource (website) that provides bibliometric analysis showing the current content and structure of the published literature. As new research is published daily, the analysis is regularly updated to show the status as the research field develops and matures. METHODS: Two bibliometric methods were employed, the first is a keyword co-occurrence analysis, based on published work available from PubMed. The second is a bibliometric coupling analysis, based on articles available through Scopus. The results are presented as clustered network graphs; available as interactive network graphs through the webpage. RESULTS: For research as of March 23rd, keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that research was organized in 4 topic clusters: ""Health and pandemic management"", ""The disease and its pathophysiology"", ""Clinical epidemiology of the disease"" and ""Treatment of the disease"". Coupling analyses resulted in 4 clusters on literature that relates to ""Overview of the new virus"", ""Clinical medicine"", ""On the virus"" and ""Reproduction rate and spread"". CONCLUSION: We introduced a dynamic resource that will give a wide readership an overview of how the structure of the COVID-19 literature is developing. To illustrate what this can look like, we showed the structure as it stands three months after the virus was identified; the structure is likely to change as we progress to later stages of this pandemic.","Andersen, Njål; Bramness, Jørgen G; Lund, Ingunn Olea",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,386

424509,"Anticoagulation, Bleeding, Mortality, and Pathology in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19",2020,"OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized healthcare workers (HCW) with high-risk exposures outside the healthcare system would have less asymptomatic coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease and more symptoms than those without such exposures. DESIGN: A longitudinal point prevalence study during August 17- September 4 2020 and December 2nd - 23rd. SETTING: Community based teaching health system. PARTICIPANTS: All HCS were invited to participate. Among HCW who acquired COVID-19, logistic regression models were used to evaluate the adjusted odds of asymptomatic disease using high-risk exposure outside the healthcare system as the explanatory variable. The number of symptoms between exposure groups was evaluated with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The risk of seropositivity among all HCS by work exposure was evaluated during both periods. INTERVENTIONS: Survey and serological testing. RESULT: Seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.2% - 2.6%) to 13.7% (95% CI 11.9% - 15.5%) during the study. Only during Period 2 did HCW with the highest work exposure (versus low exposure) have an increased risk of seropositivity (RD 7% [95% CI 1% -13%]). Participants who had a high-risk exposure outside of work (compared to those without) had a decreased probability of asymptomatic disease (OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.16 - 0.86]) and demonstrated more symptoms (median of 3 [IQR 5] vs 1 [IQR 2]; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Health care acquired COVID-19 increases the probability of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease compared to community acquired disease. This suggests infection prevention strategies (including masks and eye protection) may be mitigating inoculum and supports the variolation theory in COVID-19.","Fletcher, Jeffrey J; Feucht, Eric C; Hahn, Peter Y; McGoff, Theresa N; Dehart, Del J; El Mortada, Mohamad E; Grifka, Ronald G",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,386
424577,Participatory diagnosis of the tourism sector in managing the crisis caused by the pandemic (COVID-19),2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often continue to test positive for the causative virus by PCR even after clinical recovery, thereby complicating return-to-work plans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load with respect to time. METHODS: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycle (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. Association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of 0.05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. RESULTS: Over six weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-severe COVID-19, viral loads in upper respiratory specimens peak by two or three days from symptom onset and decrease rapidly thereafter. The vast majority of the viral load-time AUC lies within 10 days of symptom onset.","Shrestha, Nabin K; Marco Canosa, Francisco; Nowacki, Amy S; Procop, Gary W; Vogel, Sherilynn; Fraser, Thomas G; Erzurum, Serpil C; Terpeluk, Paul; Gordon, Steven M",Clin. infect. dis,,386

DESIGN: A narrative review was performed. DATA SOURCES: A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted on both Chinese and English electronic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, PsycINFO. Articles published from 1 December 2019 -1 April 2020 were included in this review. REVIEW METHODS: Studies reporting on the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 using TCM regardless of study designs were included. In addition, grey literatures, including media reports on Chinese government websites or official media websites and treatment guidelines were searched for TCM treatment and prevention on COVID-19. RESULTS: Limited research has been published on the use of TCM for COVID-19. We qualitatively described and synthesized the published research and current clinical practice on the use of TCM for COVID-19, and focused on the following areas: TCM treatment used in SARS, MERS, H1N1; TCM treatment plan for COVID-19; TCM in Prevention and Treatment at Early Stage of COVID-19; TCM emotional therapy; and personalized TCM treatment plan. CONCLUSION: The combination of western medicine and TCM in treatment, and treatment based on the local condition, isolation, personal protective measures are of great significance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Relevant laboratory research and clinical evaluation should be continued to collect scientific evidences on the efficacy of TCM. IMPACT: TCM has been used in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in China, and the clinical evidences indicated that TCM regulates immunity and exerts anti-viral effect simultaneously.

DSM-5 proposes a melancholia specifier with phenotypic characteristics that could be associated with clinical progression, biological markers or therapeutic response. The Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (SMPI) is a prototypic scale aimed to improve the diagnosis of melancholia. So far, there is only an English version of the instrument available. The aim of this study is to describe the translation and adaptation of the English version of the SMPI into Brazilian Portuguese. METHODS: Translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the self-report (SMPI-SR) and clinician-rated (SMPI-CR) versions into Brazilian Portuguese were done following recommendations of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). This guideline includes the following steps: preparation, forward translation, reconciliation, back translation, back translation review, harmonization, cognitive debriefing, debriefing results review, proofreading and final report. RESULTS: The Brazilian Portuguese versions of the SMPI were well-accepted by respondents. Changes in about two-thirds of the items were considered necessary to obtain the final Brazilian Portuguese version of the SMPI. CONCLUSIONS: Both versions of the SMPI are now available in Brazilian Portuguese. The instrument could become an important option to enhance studies on melancholia in Portuguese-speaking samples.","Messinger, Mateus Frizzo; Caldieraro, Marco Antonio; Mosqueiro, Bruno Paz; da Costa, Felipe Bauer Pinto; Possebon, Gabriela Maria Pereira; Santos, Pedro Victor de Lima Nascimento; Parker, Gordon; Fleck, Marcelo P",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,,386

The purpose of this study is to evaluate how this novel setting impacted on management of children with trauma, and the use and appropriateness of imaging studies in such patients at the pED. All imaging studies performed in patients with trauma at the pED of a tertiary children’s Hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (between March and May 2020) were reviewed, in comparison with a control time interval (March to May 2019). In the pre-COVID control era, 669 imaging studies documented bone fractures in 145/568 children (25.5%). In the COVID-era, 79/177 (44.6%) pediatric patients showed bone fractures on 193 imaging studies. Comparative analysis shows a 71% decrease in imaging studies, and the proportion of negative imaging studies (with no evidence of bone fractures) dropped in 2020 by 19% compared to the 2019 control era (p &lt;0.001). The sharp decrease of negative studies suggests that the rate of appropriateness was higher during COVID-era, suggesting some attitude toward defensive medicine in the previous control year, as a result of some degree of imaging inappropriateness. The impact of a pandemic on emergency medicine may offer a unique opportunity to revisit diagnostic and therapeutic protocols in pediatrics.","Bottari, Giampiero Stellacci Giandomenico Ferorelli Davide Dell’Erba Alessandro Aricò Maurizio Benevento Marcello Palladino Giuseppe Solarino Biagio",Children,,386

Given these unsustainable relations, this essay asks the question: How can Mexican and multinational corporations enable human flourishing both at work and in the communities where they operate? It answers the question by examining how the Indigenous concept of Buen Vivir (living well) can serve as a basis for reimagining corporate social responsibility (CSR). Methodologically, it draws on ancient and contemporary Nahua poets as sources of ancestral Indigenous knowledge. Using these poets, the paper first establishes the applicability of Buen Vivir for Mexico. Relevant concepts include the quality of life, the relationship of humans to nature, the goal of economic growth, and the value of Indigenous knowledge. Using Buen Vivir as a framework for rethinking CSR, the paper integrates business within nature and dialogues with ancestral knowledge. It also focuses on localism and particularism, on quality in addition to quantity, on alternatives to economic growth, and on community. It ends by examining the implications of Buen Vivir for CSR theory and practice by incorporating Indigenous practices of communal work and conceptualizing the firm as a member of the community.","Husted, Bryan W.",Sustainability,,386
431014,EEG findings and clinical prognostic factors associated with mortality in a prospective cohort of inpatients with COVID-19,2020,"Introduction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) achieved response rates around 20% in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 8% of patients becoming long-term survivors. Outcomes have improved with the addition of chemotherapy to immunotherapy or the combination of anti-PD(L)1 with anti-CTLA-4 agents. Areas covered. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with NSCLC treated with ICIs varied across clinical trials and real-life studies. The onset of irAEs was 10 weeks. Toxic deaths from irAEs following anti-PD(L)1 administration resulted mainly from pneumonitis. Some irAEs such as rash and thyroiditis were probably associated with better clinical outcomes, though confounding biases exist. Investigations are on-going to determine ideal biomarkers to predict the occurrence, to screen for and to diagnose irAEs. Expert opinion. Prevention, anticipation, detection, treatment and careful monitoring are the five principles that characterize our management of irAEs. Distinguishing immune-induced pneumonitis from progression, pseudo progression, hyper progression or other etiologies (COVID-19) can be particularly challenging in lung cancer due to the baseline vulnerable pulmonary function and thus requires caution and teamwork. We treat patients according to institutional and international guidelines and we only rechallenge them with ICIs after resolution of the AE and corticosteroid tapering.","Abdayem, Pamela; Planchard, David",,,386

Current data show that SARS-CoV-2 results in mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of healthy and young patients affected. Nevertheless, the severity of COVID-19 respiratory syndrome and the risk of adverse or catastrophic outcomes are increased in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)-by definition-have underlying cardiovascular disease. Many patients with ACHD are also afflicted with residual haemodynamic lesions such as valve dysfunction, diminished ventricular function, arrhythmias or cyanosis, have extracardiac comorbidities, and face additional challenges regarding pregnancy. Currently, there are emerging data of the effect of COVID-19 on ACHD patients, but many aspects, especially risk stratification and treatment considerations, remain unclear. In this article, we aim to discuss the broad impact of COVID-19 on ACHD patients, focusing specifically on pathophysiology, risk stratification for work, self-isolation, hospitalization, impact on pregnancy, psychosocial health, and longer-term implications for the provision of ACHD care.","Diller, Gerhard-Paul; Gatzoulis, Michael A; Broberg, Craig S; Aboulhosn, Jamil; Brida, Margarita; Schwerzmann, Markus; Chessa, Massimo; Kovacs, Adrienne H; Roos-Hesselink, Jolien",Eur. heart j,,386

While the role of glucose control has been emphasized to improve the prognosis, the impact of different glucose-lowering agents remains largely unknown. Metformin remains the first-line pharmacological choice for the management of hyperglycaemia in T2DM. Because metformin exerts various effects beyond its glucose-lowering action, among which are anti-inflammatory effects, it may be speculated that this biguanide might positively influence the prognosis of patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19. The present concise review summarizes the available data from observational retrospective studies that have shown a reduction in mortality in metformin users compared with non-users, and briefly discusses the potential underlying mechanisms that might perhaps explain this favourable impact. However, given the potential confounders inherently found in observational studies, caution is required before drawing any firm conclusions in the absence of randomized controlled trials.","Scheen, A J",Diabetes Metab,,386

435162,Nutrition guidelines for critically ill adults admitted with COVID-19: Is there consensus?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: As of 13 January 2021, there have been 3 113 963 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 74 619 deaths across the African continent. Despite relatively lower numbers of cases initially, many African countries are now experiencing an exponential increase in case numbers. Estimates of the progression of disease and potential impact of different interventions are needed to inform policymaking decisions. Herein, we model the possible trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in 52 African countries under different intervention scenarios. DESIGN: We developed a compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to estimate the COVID-19 case burden for all African countries while considering four scenarios: no intervention, moderate lockdown, hard lockdown and hard lockdown with continued restrictions once lockdown is lifted. We further analysed the potential impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). RESULTS: In the absence of an intervention, the most populous countries had the highest peaks in active projected number of infections with Nigeria having an estimated 645 081 severe infections. The scenario with a hard lockdown and continued post-lockdown interventions to reduce transmission was the most efficacious strategy for delaying the time to the peak and reducing the number of cases. In South Africa, projected peak severe infections increase from 162 977 to 2 03 261, when vulnerable populations with HIV/AIDS and TB are included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across the African continent. Estimates of the potential impact of interventions and burden of disease are essential for policymakers to make evidence-based decisions on the distribution of limited resources and to balance the economic costs of interventions with the potential for saving lives.","Frost, Isabel; Craig, Jessica; Osena, Gilbert; Hauck, Stephanie; Kalanxhi, Erta; Schueller, Emily; Gatalo, Oliver; Yang, Yupeng; Tseng, Katie K; Lin, Gary; Klein, Eili",BMJ Open,,386

We present the case of a 45-year-old female who, upon emergency intraoperative consultation to a general surgeon while having a right groin exploration by a plastic surgeon, was found to have an appendix incarcerated within a femoral hernia. There was no evidence of appendicitis; thus, appendix was reduced and the hernia was repaired with a mesh plug. The patient did well postoperatively, with no complications and returned to complete activities. This occurred during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Due to the common failure in preoperative diagnosis, it is important for surgeons to have a clinical suspicion for de Garengeot herniae for patients, presenting with a right groin bulge.

The analysis was based on data from the population-based KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry located in the region of Augsburg, Germany. All cases of AMI (n = 210) admitted to one of four hospitals in the city of Augsburg or the county of Augsburg from February 10th, 2020, to May 19, 2020, were included. Patients were divided into three groups, namely pre-lockdown, strict lockdown, and attenuated lockdown period. An additional survey was conducted asking the patients for stress and fears in the 4 weeks prior to their AMI. The AMI rate declined by 44% in the strict lockdown period; in the attenuated lockdown period the rate was 17% lower compared to the pre-lockdown period. The downward trend in AMI rates during lockdown was seen in STEMI and NSTEMI patients, and independent of sex and age. The door-to-device time decreased by 70-80% in the lockdown-periods. In the time prior to the infarction, patients felt stressed mainly due to fear of infection with Sars-CoV-2 and less because of the restrictions and consequences of the lockdown. A strict lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic had a marked impact on AMI care even in a non-hot-spot region with relatively few cases of COVID-19. Fear of infection with the virus is presumably the main reason for the drop in hospitalizations due to AMI.","Schmitz, Timo; Meisinger, Christa; Kirchberger, Inge; Thilo, Christian; Amann, Ute; Baumeister, Sebastian E; Linseisen, Jakob",Eur. j. epidemiol,,386

METHODS: Observational cohort study carried out in an intensive care unit from March 25 to July 17, 2020. Data were obtained from a prospective database and electronic medical records, and were analyzed with the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test or Mann-Whitney's U-test. RESULTS: One hundred patients required mechanical ventilation; median age was 56 years, 31 % were females and 97 % were Latin American. Most common comorbidities were obesity (36 %), diabetes (26 %), hypertension (20 %), and chronic or end-stage kidney disease (10 %). At the end of the analysis, 11 patients remained in the ICU, 31 had been discharged alive and 58 (65.2 %) died; survivors were younger, had lower scores on severity and organ dysfunction scales, lower levels of C-reactive protein at ICU admission, were less likely to receive hemodialysis and vasopressors, and had longer hospital and ICU stays.

We applied the Richards growth model (RGM) to the COVID-19 fatality curves from several countries, where we used the data from the Johns Hopkins University database up to May 8, 2020. Countries selected for analysis with the RGM were China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and Spain. The RGM was shown to describe very well the fatality curves of China, which is in a late stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as of the other above countries, which supposedly are in the middle or towards the end of the outbreak at the time of this writing. We also analysed the case of Brazil, which is in an initial sub-exponential growth regime, and so we used the generalised growth model which is more appropriate for such cases. An analytic formula for the efficiency of intervention strategies within the context of the RGM is derived. Our findings show that there is only a narrow window of opportunity, after the onset of the epidemic, during which effective countermeasures can be taken. We applied our intervention model to the COVID-19 fatality curve of Italy of the outbreak to illustrate the effect of several possible interventions.","Vasconcelos, Giovani L.; Macêdo, Antônio M.S.; Ospina, Raydonal; Almeida, Francisco A.G.; Duarte-Filho, Gerson C.; Brum, Arthur A.; Souza, Inês C.L.",PeerJ,,386

The unavailability of specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates the focus of all scientists in this direction. The reported antiviral activities of guanidine alkaloids encouraged us to run a comprehensive in silico binding affinity of fifteen guanidine alkaloids against five different proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which we investigated. The investigated proteins are COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) (PDB ID: 6lu7), spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYO), membrane glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6M17), and a non-structural protein (nsp10) (PDB ID: 6W4H). The binding energies for all tested compounds indicated promising binding affinities. A noticeable superiority for the pentacyclic alkaloids particularly, crambescidin 786 (5) and crambescidin 826 (13) has been observed. Compound 5 exhibited very good binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -8.05 kcal/mol), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -6.49 kcal/mol), and nsp10 (&#916;G = -9.06 kcal/mol). Compound 13 showed promising binding affinities against Mpro (&#916;G = -7.99 kcal/mol), spike glycoproteins (&#916;G = -6.95 kcal/mol), and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (&#916;G = -8.01 kcal/mol). Such promising activities might be attributed to the long &#969;-fatty acid chain, which may play a vital role in binding within the active sites. The correlation of c Log P with free binding energies has been calculated. Furthermore, the SAR of the active compounds has been clarified. The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) studies were carried out in silico for the 15 compounds; most examined compounds showed optimal to good range levels of ADMET aqueous solubility, intestinal absorption and being unable to pass blood brain barrier (BBB), non-inhibitors of CYP2D6, non-hepatotoxic, and bind plasma protein with a percentage less than 90%. The toxicity of the tested compounds was screened in silico against five models (FDA rodent carcinogenicity, carcinogenic potency TD50, rat maximum tolerated dose, rat oral LD50, and rat chronic lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL)). All compounds showed expected low toxicity against the tested models. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were also carried out to confirm the stable binding interactions of the most promising compounds, 5 and 13, with their targets. In conclusion, the examined 15 alkaloids specially 5 and 13 showed promising docking, ADMET, toxicity and MD results which open the door for further investigations for them against SARS-CoV-2.","El-Demerdash, Amr; Metwaly, Ahmed M; Hassan, Afnan; Abd El-Aziz, Tarek Mohamed; Elkaeed, Eslam B; Eissa, Ibrahim H; Arafa, Reem K; Stockand, James D",Biomolecules,,386

446027,Most Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 Have Lasting Symptoms,2021,"BACKGROUND: Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 17 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered moderate to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation timing. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Hayden, Mary K; Englund, Janet A; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; El Alayli, Abdallah; Altayar, Osama; Patel, Payal; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valery; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Sultan, Shahnaz; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin. infect. dis,,386

SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious.

Non-symptomatic individuals unaware of the infection risk they pose to others, may perceive themselves --and being perceived by others-- as not representing risk of infection. Yet many epidemiological models currently in use do not include a behavioral component, and do not address the potential consequences of risk misperception. To study the impact of behavioral adaptations to the perceived infection risk, we use a mathematical model that incorporates individuals' behavioral decisions based on a projection of the future system's state over a finite planning horizon. We found that individuals' risk misperception in the presence of asymptomatic individuals may increase or reduce the final epidemic size. Moreover, under behavioral response the impact of asymptomatic infections is modulated by symptomatic individuals' behavior. Finally, we found that there is an optimal planning horizon that minimizes the final epidemic size.","Espinoza, B.; Marathe, M.; Swarup, S.; Thakur, M.",,,386
448376,Hepatic encephalopathy increases the risk of hip fracture: a nationwide cohort study,2020,"In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms underlying functional effects of the D614G mutation by exploring atomistic modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as allosteric regulatory machines. We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis with network-based community analysis to examine structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By combining functional dynamics analysis and ensemble-based alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we found that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. Our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions. This study provides atomistic-based view of allosteric communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and communications in the residue interaction networks.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

450501,Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Comprehensive Review of Clinical Presentation,2020,"Introduction: the implementation of neonatal screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The purpose of this study is to determine whether socio-economic factors are associated with acceptability of newborn screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kisangani, DRC. Methods: we conducted an observational study of mothers sensitized to neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborns with hemotypeSCTM (HT401RUO-USA). The study was carried out at the maternity wards in Kisangani from March 21st to June 30th 2020. Collected data were parity, educational level, age, socio-economic level, occupation, awareness and the reason for the denial of screening. Results: out of 55.5% (273/492) of sensitized mothers, 107 (39.19%) accepted and 166 (60.80%) refused neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborn. The reasons for refusal were lack of information (67.5%; 95% CI [59.8-74.5]), lack of money due to confinement (66.3%; 95% CI [58.5-73.4]), blood test to develop a vaccine for protection against COVID-19 (63.2%; 95% CI = [55.4-70.6]). Factors associated with the acceptability of screening were age > 35 years (p = 0.0009; ORa = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.57-5.87) and low socio-economic level (p = 0.0016; ORa = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.37-3.85). Conclusion: the acceptability of neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease during COVID-19 is low in Kisangani. The government should identify effective communication channels to promote health care initiatives.","Kasai, Emmanuel Tebandite; Opara, Jean Pierre Alworong A; Agasa, Salomon Batina; Gulbis, Béatrice; Uvoya, Naura Apio; Nguma, Jean Didier Bosenge; Maloba, Philippe Kasongo; Hubert, Philippe; Etienne, Anne-Marie; Djang Eing A, Roland Marini",Pan Afr Med J,,386
450739,A severe refractory COVID-19 patient responding to convalescent plasma; A case series,2020,"Objective: Acute encephalopathy may occur in COVID-19-infected patients. We investigated whether medically indicated EEGs performed in acutely ill patients under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 report epileptiform abnormalities and whether these are more prevalent in COVID-19 positive than negative patients. Methods: In this retrospective case series, adult COVID-19 inpatient PUIs underwent EEGs for acute encephalopathy and/or seizure-like events. PUIs had 8-channel headband EEGs (Ceribell; 20 COVID-19 positive, 6 COVID-19 negative); 2 more COVID-19 patients had routine EEGs. Overall, 26 Ceribell EEGs, 4 routine and 7 continuous EEG studies were reviewed. EEGs were interpreted by board-certified clinical neurophysiologists (n = 16). EEG findings were correlated with demographic data, clinical presentation and history, and medication usage. Fisher's exact test was used. Results: We included 28 COVID-19 PUIs (30-83 years old), of whom 22 tested positive (63.6% males) and 6 tested negative (33.3% male). The most common indications for EEG, among COVID-19-positive vs COVID-19-negative patients, respectively, were new onset encephalopathy (68.2% vs 33.3%) and seizure-like events (14/22, 63.6%; 2/6, 33.3%), even among patients without prior history of seizures (11/17, 64.7%; 2/6, 33.3%). Sporadic epileptiform discharges (EDs) were present in 40.9% of COVID-19-positive and 16.7% of COVID-19-negative patients; frontal sharp waves were reported in 8/9 (88.9%) of COVID-19-positive patients with EDs and in 1/1 of COVID-19-negative patient with EDs. No electrographic seizures were captured, but 19/22 COVID-19-positive and 6/6 COVID-19-negative patients were given antiseizure medications and/or sedatives before the EEG. Significance_ This is the first preliminary report of EDs in the EEG of acutely ill COVID-19-positive patients with encephalopathy or suspected clinical seizures. EDs are relatively common in this cohort and typically appear as frontal sharp waves. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the potential direct or indirect effects of COVID-19 on activating epileptic activity.","Galanopoulou, Aristea S.; Ferastraoaru, Victor; Correa, Daniel J.; Cherian, Koshi; Duberstein, Susan; Gursky, Jonathan; Hanumanthu, Rajani; Hung, Christine; Molinero, Isaac; Khodakivska, Olga; Legatt, Alan D.; Patel, Puja; Rosengard, Jillian; Rubens, Elayna; Sugrue, William; Yozawitz, Elissa; Mehler, Mark F.; Ballaban-Gil, Karen; Haut, Sheryl R.; Moshé, Solomon L.; Boro, Alexis",Epilepsia Open,,386

However, only a few studies have examined the relationship between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems, and no empirical study has tested the mechanisms between them. METHODS: We conducted a survey in 31 provinces of China during 3-13 March 2020 to test the effect of the exposure level on mental health problems. Our sample comprised 2987 participants who reported their perceived threat, coping efficacy, mental health problems and other demographic variables. Multiple mediators path analysis was used in the data analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the level of exposure to COVID-19 in China was negatively associated with mental health problems, which confirmed the ""Psychological Typhoon Eye"" effect. Further analyses indicated that both perceived threat and coping efficacy partially mediated the relationship between them. However, coping efficacy explained the ""Psychological Typhoon Eye"" effect. Perceived threat mediated the positive relationship between exposure level and mental health problems. CONCLUSION: This study detected the psychological typhoon eye effect and demonstrated the mediating role of coping efficacy and perceived threat between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems. Our findings suggest that policy makers and psychological workers should provide enough psychological services to low-risk areas as the high-risk areas. An important means of alleviating mental health problems is to improve coping efficacy.","Zhang, Li; Ma, Min; Li, Danfeng; Xin, Ziqiang",Global Health,,386

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore risk factors for mortality and ICU admission in patients with COVID­19, using computed tomography (CT) combined with clinical laboratory data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID­19 (n = 63) from university hospitals in Tehran, Iran, were included. All patients underwent CT examination. Subsequently, a total CT score and the number of involved lung lobes were calculated and compared against collected laboratory and clinical characteristics. Univariable and multivariable proportional hazard analyses were used to determine the association among CT, laboratory and clinical data, ICU admission, and in­hospital death. RESULTS: By univariable analysis, in­hospital mortality was higher in patients with lower oxygen saturation on admission (below 88%), higher CT scores, and a higher number of lung lobes (more than 4) involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. By multivariable analysis, in­hospital mortality was higher in those with oxygen saturation below 88% on admission and a higher number of lung lobes involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. The risk of ICU admission was higher in patients with comorbidities (hypertension and ischemic heart disease), arterial oxygen saturation below 88%, and pericardial effusion. CONCLUSIONS: We can identify factors affecting in­hospital death and ICU admission in COVID-19. This can help clinicians to determine which patients are likely to require ICU admission and to inform strategic healthcare planning in critical conditions such as the COVID­19 pandemic.","Sabri, Ali; Davarpanah, Amir H; Mahdavi, Arash; Abrishami, Alireza; Khazaei, Mehdi; Heydari, Saman; Asgari, Reyhane; Nekooghadam, Seyyed Mojtaba; Dobranowski, Julian; Taheri, Morteza Sanei",Pol Arch Intern Med,,386
453857,Association of Vitamin D Status With Hospital Morbidity and Mortality in Adult Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19,2021,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been shown to coincide with, or anticipate, confirmed COVID-19 case numbers. During periods with high test positivity rates, however, case numbers may be underreported, whereas wastewater does not suffer from this limitation. Here we investigated how the dynamics of new COVID-19 infections estimated based on wastewater monitoring or confirmed cases compare to true COVID-19 incidence dynamics. We focused on the first pandemic wave in Switzerland (February to April, 2020), when test positivity ranged up to 26%. SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were determined 2-4 times per week in three Swiss wastewater treatment plants (Lugano, Lausanne and Zurich). Wastewater and case data were combined with a shedding load distribution and an infection-to-case confirmation delay distribution, respectively, to estimate infection incidence dynamics. Finally, the estimates were compared to reference incidence dynamics determined by a validated compartmental model. Incidence dynamics estimated based on wastewater data were found to better track the timing and shape of the reference infection peak compared to estimates based on confirmed cases. In contrast, case confirmations provided a better estimate of the subsequent decline in infections. Under a regime of high-test positivity rates, WBE thus provides critical information that is complementary to clinical data to monitor the pandemic trajectory.","Fernandez-Cassi, Xavier; Scheidegger, Andreas; Bänziger, Carola; Cariti, Federica; Tuñas Corzon, Alex; Ganesanandamoorthy, Pravin; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Ort, Christoph; Julian, Timothy R; Kohn, Tamar",Water Res,,386

It has also stimulated the production of ultraviolet-disinfection robots by companies and institutions. These robots are increasingly advocated as a simple solution for the immediate disinfection of rooms and spaces of all surfaces in one process and as such they seem attractive to hospital management, also because of automation and apparent cost savings by reducing cleaning staff. Yet, there true potential in the hospital setting needs to be carefully evaluated. Presently, disinfection robots do not replace routine (manual) cleaning but may complement it. Further design adjustments of hospitals and devices are needed to overcome the issue of shadowing and free the movement of robots in the hospital environment. They might in the future provide validated, reproducible and documented disinfection processes. Further technical developments and clinical trials in a variety of hospitals are warranted to overcome the current limitations and to find ways to integrate this novel technology in to the hospitals of to-day and the future.","Diab-El Schahawi, Magda; Zingg, Walter; Vos, Margreet; Humphreys, Hilary; Lopez-Cerero, Lorena; Fueszl, Astrid; Zahar, Jean Ralph; Presterl, Elisabeth",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,,386

Following the QI initiative, INOP donor yield rose by 44%, while organs transplanted rose by 29%. These changes tolerated temporary disruption around the COVID-19 pandemic. Improved donor yield was primarily seen in older groups identified by CALC-based methods. Process changes in resource allocation and monitoring were associated with a 57% increase in the number of potential donors approached in the QI period and a subsequent rise in the number of potential donor referrals, suggesting positive feedback at area hospitals. Post-intervention, INOP's projected donation performance rose from 51st to 18th among all OPOs.

Because we recently reported neurophysiological brainstem reflex abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, we here neuropathologically assessed structural brainstem damage in two COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed neuropathological features in two patients who died of COVID-19 and in two COVID-19 negative patients as controls. Neuronal damage and corpora amylacea (CA) numbers /mm2 were histopathologically assessed. Other features studied were the immunohistochemical expression of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and the Iba-1 antigen for glial activation. RESULTS: Autopsies showed normal gross brainstem anatomy. Histopathological examination demonstrated increased neuronal and CA damage in Covid-19 patients' medulla oblongata. Immunohistochemistry disclosed SARS-CoV-2 NP in brainstem neurons and glial cells, and in cranial nerves. Glial elements also exhibited a widespread increase in Iba-1 expression. Sars-Co-V2 was immunohistochemically detected in the vagus nerve fibers. DISCUSSION: Neuropathologic evidence showing SARS-CoV-2 in the brainstem and medullary damage in the area of respiratory centers strongly suggests that the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related respiratory failure includes a neurogenic component. Sars-Co-V2 detection in the vagus nerve, argues for viral trafficking between brainstem and lung.","Bulfamante, Gaetano; Bocci, Tommaso; Falleni, Monica; Campiglio, Laura; Coppola, Silvia; Tosi, Delfina; Chiumello, Davide; Priori, Alberto",J. neurol,,386

458368,Clinical Outcomes in Diabetic Vs Non-diabetic Patients with Severe Covid-19,2020,"The boreal forest is among the largest terrestrial biomes on earth, storing more carbon (C) than the atmosphere. Due to rapid climatic warming and enhanced human development, the boreal region may have begun transitioning from a net C sink to a net source. This raises serious concern that old biogenic soil C can be re-introduced into the modern C cycle in near future. Combining bio-decay experiments, mixing models and the Keeling plot method, we discovered a distinct old pre-bomb organic carbon fraction with high biodegradation rate. In total, 34 ± 12% of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in podzols, one of the dominating boreal soil types, consisted of aged (~ 1000 year) labile C. The omission of this aged (i.e., &#916;14C depleted) WEOC fraction in earlier studies is due to the co-occurrence with &#916;14C enriched modern C formed following 1950s nuclear bomb testing masking its existence. High lability of aged soil WEOC and masking effects of modern &#916;14C enriched C suggests that the risk for mobilization and re-introduction of this ancient C pool into the modern C cycle has gone undetected. Our findings have important implications for earth systems models in terms of climate-carbon feedbacks and the future C balance of the boreal forest.","Hensgens, Geert; Laudon, Hjalmar; Johnson, Mark S; Berggren, Martin",Sci Rep,,386
458936,Growth Arrest-Specific Factor 6 (GAS6) Is Increased in COVID-19 Patients and Predicts Clinical Outcome,2021,"Automatic detection of students' engagement in online learning settings is a key element to improve the quality of learning and to deliver personalized learning materials to them. Varying levels of engagement exhibited by students in an online classroom is an affective behavior that takes place over space and time. Therefore, we formulate detecting levels of students' engagement from videos as a spatio-temporal classification problem. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end Residual Network (ResNet) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) hybrid neural network architecture for students' engagement level detection in videos. The 2D ResNet extracts spatial features from consecutive video frames, and the TCN analyzes the temporal changes in video frames to detect the level of engagement. The spatial and temporal arms of the hybrid network are jointly trained on raw video frames of a large publicly available students' engagement detection dataset, DAiSEE. We compared our method with several competing students' engagement detection methods on this dataset. The ResNet+TCN architecture outperforms all other studied methods, improves the state-of-the-art engagement level detection accuracy, and sets a new baseline for future research.","Abedi, Ali; Khan, Shehroz S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10122v1.pdf,386
459278,Maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19: a systemic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research surrounding COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is rapidly increasing, including the study of biomarkers for predicting outcomes. There is little data examining the correlation between serum albumin levels and COVID-19 disease severity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether admission albumin levels reliably predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 181 patients from two hospitals who had COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and radiologic imaging, who were hospitalized between March and July 2020. We recorded demographics, COVID-19 testing techniques, and day of admission labs. The outcomes recorded included the following: venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, discharge with new or higher home oxygen supplementation, readmission within 90 days, in-hospital mortality, and total adverse events. A multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis was then performed to determine significant predictors for increased adverse events in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients (60.2%) had hypoalbuminemia (albumin level < 3.3 g/dL). Patients with higher albumin levels on admission had a 72% decreased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (adjusted relative risk [RR]:0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.14-0.53, p<0.001) for every 1 g/dL increase of albumin. Moreover, higher albumin levels on admission were associated with a lower risk of developing ARDS (adjusted RR:0.73, 95% CI:0.55-0.98, p = 0.033), admission to the ICU (adjusted RR:0.64, 95% CI:0.45-0.93, p = 0.019), and were less likely to be readmitted within 90 days (adjusted RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.17-0.81, p = 0.012). Furthermore, higher albumin levels were associated with fewer total adverse events (adjusted RR:0.65, 95% CI:0.52-0.80, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission serum albumin levels appear to be a predictive biomarker for outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We found that higher albumin levels on admission were associated with significantly fewer adverse outcomes, including less VTE events, ARDS development, ICU admissions, and readmissions within 90 days. Screening patients may lead to early identification of patients at risk for developing in-hospital complications and improve optimization and preventative efforts in this cohort.","Kheir, Matthew; Saleem, Farah; Wang, Christy; Mann, Amardeep; Chua, Jimmy",PLoS One,,386
459469,Mortality predictors in covid-19 positive patients with fractures: A systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge on bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 is crucial to use antibiotics appropriately. Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence of bacterial co-infections, antibiotic use and application of antimicrobial stewardship principles in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study in four hospitals (1 university, 2 non-university teaching, 1 non-teaching hospital) in the Netherlands from March to May 2020 including consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data on first microbiological investigations obtained at the discretion of the physician and antibiotic use in the first week of hospital admission were collected. RESULTS: Twelve (1.2%) of the 925 patients included had a documented bacterial co-infection (75.0% pneumonia) within the first week. Microbiological testing was performed in 749 (81%) patients: sputum cultures in 105 (11.4%), blood cultures in 711 (76.9%), pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in 202 (21.8%), and Legionella urinary antigen testing in 199 (21.5%) patients, with clear variation between hospitals. On presentation 556 (60.1%; range 33.3-73.4%) patients received antibiotics for a median duration of 2 days (IQR 1-4). Intravenous to oral switch was performed in 41 of 413 (9.9%) patients who received intravenous treatment >48 h. Mean adherence to the local guideline on empiric antibiotic therapy on day 1 was on average 60.3% (range 45.3%-74.7%). CONCLUSIONS: On presentation to the hospital bacterial co-infections are rare, while empiric antibiotic use is abundant. This implies that in patients with COVID-19 empiric antibiotic should be withheld. This has the potential to dramatically reduce the current overuse of antibiotics in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Karami, Zara; Knoop, Bram T; Dofferhoff, Anton S M; Blaauw, Marc J T; Janssen, Nico A; van Apeldoorn, Marjan; Kerckhoffs, Angèle P M; van de Maat, Josephine S; Hoogerwerf, Jacobien J; Ten Oever, Jaap",Infect Dis (Lond),,386

Changes in nutritional status and weight loss during hospitalisation are largely reported in some populations, but still not explored in COVID-19 patients. Considering that patients with COVID-19 show an increased inflammatory response, other signs and symptoms, which can lead to weight and muscle loss, should be monitored. The aim of this article was to establish possible connections between COVID-19, prolonged hospitalisation and muscle wasting, as well as to propose nutritional recommendations for the prevention and treatment of cachexia, through a narrative review. Identification of risk and presence of malnutrition should be an early step in general assessment of all patients, with regard to more at-risk categories including older adults and individuals suffering from chronic and acute disease conditions, such as COVID-19. The deterioration of nutritional status, and consequently cachexia, increases the risk of mortality and needs to be treated with attention as other complications. There is, however, little hard evidence of nutritional approaches in assisting COVID-19 treatment or its management including cachexia.","Virgens, Isabel P A; Santana, Natália M; Lima, Severina C V C; Fayh, Ana P T",Br J Nutr,,386

Considering the different dimensions of space through which an outbreak unfolds, facilitates analysing spatial diffusion of infectious disease in contemporary societies. We attempt to highlight four relevant dimensions of space by applying the TPSN framework to the case of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Germany. By identifying key processes of disease diffusion in space, we can explain the spatial patterns of the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany, which did not feature the well-known patterns of spatially contagious as in or hierarchical diffusion. In contrast, we find superspreading events and especially relocation diffusion based on existing networks, on which the pathogen travelled like a blind passenger, to be more relevant. For us, these findings prove the value of combining relational thinking with geographic analysis for understanding epidemic outbreaks in contemporary societies.","Kuebart, Andreas; Stabler, Martin",Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie,,386

What have we learned?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an e-learning online event, created for supporting resident's training during the slowdown of surgical and clinical activities caused by COVID-19 pandemic. An overview of PubMed literature depicting the state of the art of urology residency in the COVID-19 era was performed as well, to contextualize the issue. METHODS: An online learning event for residents was set up at the beginning of the pandemic; the faculty consisted of experts in urology who provided on-line lectures and videos on surgical anatomy, procedures, updates in guidelines, technology, training. The audience was composed of 30-500 attendees from Italy, USA, India and Belgium. A questionnaire to analyze relevance, satisfaction and popularity of the lessons was mailed to 30 local residents. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Almost all residents defined the web environment suitable to achieve the learning outcomes; the method, the number and the competence of the faculty were appropriate/excellent. Most of the younger residents (81.8%) stated their surgical knowledge would improve after the course; 72.7% declared they would take advantage into routine inpatients clinical activity. Nineteen more expert residents agreed that the course would improve their surgical knowledge and enhance their practical skills; almost all stated that the initiative would change their outpatients and inpatients practice. Overall, 44 articles available in PubMed have addressed the concern of urological learning and training during the pandemic from different standpoints; four of them considered residents' general perception towards web-based learning programs. CONCLUSIONS: The paper confirms residents' satisfaction with e-learning methods and, to our knowledge, is the first one focusing on a specific event promptly settled up at the beginning of the outbreak. Web-based educational experience developed during the pandemic may represent the very basis for the implementation of prospective on-site training and overall scientific update of future urologists.","Calcagnile, Tommaso; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara; Sarchi, Luca; Assumma, Simone; Filippi, Beatrice; Bonfante, Giulia; Cassani, Alessandra; Spandri, Valentina; Turri, Filippo; Puliatti, Stefano; Bozzini, Giorgio; Moschovas, Marcio; Bianchi, Giampaolo; Micali, Salvatore; Rocco, Bernardo",Urologia,,386

However, it is difficult to trace people who came into contact with an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission, and mass infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government Privacy-Preserving Mobile, and Fog computing framework entitled PPMF that can trace infected, and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with contact tracing app, and two types of stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk Checkers (ARC), and Suspected User Data Uploader Node (SUDUN), to trace community transmission alongside maintaining user data privacy. Each user's mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when registering on the central application. The mobile device, and the central application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC), which broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The ARCs are placed at the entry points of buildings, which can immediately detect if there are positive or suspected cases nearby. If any confirmed case is found, the ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the identity of the infected person. The SUDUNs are placed at the health centers that report test results to the central cloud application. The reported data is later used to map between infected, and suspected cases. Therefore, using our proposed PPMF framework, governments can let organizations continue their economic activities without complete lockdown.","Whaiduzzaman, Md; Hossain, Md Razon; Shovon, Ahmedur Rahman; Roy, Shanto; Laszka, Aron; Buyya, Rajkumar; Barros, Alistair",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,,386
464766,Effect of Early Treatment with Fluvoxamine on Risk of Emergency Care and Hospitalization among Patients with Covid-19: the Together Randomized Platform Clinical Trial,2021,"Countries around the world introduced strict restrictions on movement and activities known as 'lockdowns' to restrict the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the end of 2019. A sudden improvement in air quality was observed globally as a result of these lockdowns. To provide insight into the changes in air pollution levels in response to the COVID-19 restrictions we have compared surface air quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase of the restriction easing period (25 March to 30 June 2020) with data from a baseline period (2018-2019). Simultaneously, short-term exposure of PM2.5 and O3 attributed premature mortality were calculated to understand the health benefit of the change in air quality. Ground-level observations in Delhi showed that concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 dropped substantially in 2020 during the overall study period compared with the same period in previous years, with average reductions of ~49%, ~39%, and ~39%, respectively. An overall lower reduction in O3 of ~19% was observed for Delhi. A slight increase in O3 was found in Delhi's industrial and traffic regions. The highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased substantially for all the pollutants at every phase. The decrease in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in 2020, prevented 904 total premature deaths, a 60% improvement when compared to the figures for 2018-2019. The restrictions on human activities during the lockdown have reduced anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality and human health in one of the most polluted cities in the world.Implications: I am submitting herewith the manuscript entitled ""Unprecedented Reduction in Air Pollution and Corresponding Short-term Premature Mortality Associated with COVID-19 Forced Confinement in Delhi, India"" for potential publishing in your journal.The novelty of this research lies in: (1) we utilized ground-level air quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase of unlocking period (25th March to 30th June) for 2020 as well as data from the baseline period (2018-2019) to provide an early insight into the changes in air pollution levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) Chatarize the change of diurnal variation of the pollutants and (3) we assess the health risk due to PM2.5 and O3. Results from ground-level observations in Delhi showed that concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 substantially dropped in 2020 during the overall study period compared to the similar period in previous years, with an average reduction of ~49%, ~39%, and ~39%, respectively. In the case of O3, the overall reduction was observed as ~19% in Delhi, while a slight increase was found in industrial and traffic regions. And consequently, the highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased substantially for all the pollutants. The health impact assessment of the changes in air quality indicated that 904 short-term premature deaths (~60%) were prevented due to the decline in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the study period. The restrictions on human activities during the lockdown have reduced the anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality and human health in one of the most polluted cities in the world.","Maji, Kamal Jyoti; Namdeo, Anil; Bell, Margaret; Goodman, Paul; Nagendra, S M Shiva; Barnes, Joanna H; De Vito, Laura; Hayes, Enda; Longhurst, James W; Kumar, Rakesh; Sharma, Niraj; Kuppili, Sudheer Kumar; Alshetty, Dheeraj",J Air Waste Manag Assoc,,386
465018,Effect of Cancer on Clinical Outcomes of Patients With COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis of Patient Data,2020,"Synthesis and efficient implementation mRNA strands has been shown to have wide utility, especially recently in the development of COVID vaccines. However, the intrinsic chemical stability of mRNA poses a challenge due to the presence of 2'-hydroxyl groups in ribose sugars. The -OH group in the backbone structure enables a base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated hydroxyl on the adjacent phosphorous and consequent self-hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond. As expected for in-line hydrolytic cleavage reactions, the chemical stability of mRNA strands is highly dependent on external environmental factors, e.g. pH, temperature, oxidizers, etc. Predicting this chemical instability using a computational model will reduce the number of sequences synthesized and tested through identifying the most promising candidates, aiding the development of mRNA related therapies. This paper proposes and evaluates three deep learning models (Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Graph Convolutional Networks) as methods to predict the reactivity and risk of degradation of mRNA sequences. The Stanford Open Vaccine dataset of 6034 mRNA sequences was used in this study. The training set consisted of 3029 of these sequences (length of 107 nucleotide bases) while the testing dataset consisted of 3005 sequences (length of 130 nucleotide bases), in structured (Lowest Entropy Base Pair Probability Matrix) and unstructured (Nodes and Edges) forms. The stability of mRNA strands was accurately generated, with the Graph Convolutional Network being the best predictor of reactivity ($RMSE = 0.249$) while the Gated Recurrent Unit Network was the best at predicting risks of degradation ($RMSE = 0.266$). Combining all target variables, the GRU performed the best with 76% accuracy. Results suggest these models can be applied to understand and predict the chemical stability of mRNA in the near future.","Singhal, Ankit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05136v3.pdf,386

Majority of them focus on IgM/IgG despite IgA important role in mucosal immunity. A simultaneous anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG/IgM immunoassay, performed on an automated instrument by ELISA kit coated with native inactivated SARS-CoV-2, was detected on two control groups (negative swab healthcare workers; pre-pandemic healthy or with other viral infections individuals) and on two COVID-19 patient groups (early and late infection). Specificities were 100% in all groups, indicating no cross-reactivity with other infectious or pre-pandemic sera. Sensitivities were 94% in early infection group and 97% in total positive patient group, reaching 100% in late infection group. To our knowledge, this is the first technique based on native SARS-CoV-2. It is able to identify more positive samples than kits using recombinant antigens, therefore virus native epitopes as well as simultaneous anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgM/IgG detection could help to contain COVID-19 spreading.","Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Gisone, Francesca; Sarubbi, Serena; Ciotti, Marco; Andreoni, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",Int Immunopharmacol,,386
468021,Patient-reported outcome measures after COVID-19: a prospective cohort study,2020,"High ambient temperature is one of the most important environmental factors that caused the reduction of livestock productivity and the increase of mortality. It has been shown that heat stress could affect the meat quality characteristics by physiological and metabolic perturbations in live livestock. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic phytochemical compound that has many important biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antitumor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible function and mechanism of RA on myoblast proliferation and differentiation under heat stress condition. The results showed that heat stress reduced the viability of myoblast and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, and it also disrupted myotube formation by altering the expression of myogenic regulatory factors MyoD, myogenin, and MyHC. However, pretreatment of RA can protect C2C12 cells from heat stress-induced apoptosis, and it also increased the expression level of MyoD, myogenin, and MyHC under heat stress, which indicated that RA have protective effect on heat stress-caused failure of myotube formation during myoblast differentiation. Above all, our finding demonstrated that RA can promote the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast and maintain the formation of myotubes even under heat stress condition.","Chen, Kun-Lin; Wang, Yue; Lin, Zhi-Ping; Li, Hui-Xia","In vitr. cel. dev. biol., Anim",,386

Interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³) was, initially discovered as a potent antiviral agent, over 50 years ago, and has recently garnered renewed interest as a promising factor involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. When new disease epidemics appear such as SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), IAV (Influenza A virus), and in particular the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is especially timely to review the complexity of immune system responses to viral infections. Here we consider the controversial roles of effectors like IFNÎ³, discussing its actions in immunomodulation and immunotolerance. We explore the possibility that modulation of IFNÎ³ could be used to influence the course of such infections. Importantly, not only could endogenous expression of IFNÎ³ influence the outcome, there are existing IFNÎ³ therapeutics that can readily be applied in the clinic. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlled by IFNÎ³ suggests that the exact timing for application of IFNÎ³-based therapeutics could be crucial: it should be earlier to significantly reduce the viral load and thus decrease the overall severity of the disease.","Todorovic-Rakovic, Natasa; Whitfield, Jonathan R",Cytokine,,386

To reduce spread of the virus, elective treatments and surgeries have been postponed or canceled. There has been a rise in the use of telemedicine (TM) as an alternative way to carry outpatient consultations. This systematic review aims to evaluate the extent to which TM may be able to support cardiac and vascular surgery patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: We looked into how TM can support the management of patients via triaging, preoperative, and postoperative care. Evaluations targeted the clinical effectiveness of common TM methods and the feasibility of applying those methods in the UK during this pandemic. RESULTS: Several studies have published their evidence on the benefit of TM and its benefit during COVID-19, the data related to cardiovascular surgery and how this will impact future practice of this speciality is emerging and yet larger studies with appropriate timing of outcomes to be published. CONCLUSION: Overall, the use of virtual consultations and remote monitoring is feasible and best placed to support these patients via triaging and postoperative monitoring. However, TM can be limited by the need of sophisticated technological requirement and patients' educational and know-how computer literacy level.","Ajibade, Ayomikun; Younas, Hiba; Pullan, Mark; Harky, Amer",J. card. surg,,386
470962,Congenitally Abnormal Aortic Valve causing Coronary Obstruction and Cardiac Arrest in Infancy,2020,"Background: Strategies for monitoring the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are crucial for combating the pandemic. Detection and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses require separate and complex workflows that rely on highly-specialized facilities, personnel, and reagents. To date, no method can rapidly diagnose multiple viral infections and determine variants in a high-throughput manner. Methods: We describe a method for multiplex isothermal amplification-based sequencing and real-time analysis of multiple viral genomes, termed NIRVANA. It can simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human adenovirus, and human coronavirus, and monitor mutations for up to 96 samples in real-time. Findings: NIRVANA showed high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in 70 clinical samples with a detection limit of 20 viral RNA copies per µl of extracted nucleic acid. It also detected the influenza A co-infection in two samples. The variant analysis results of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples mirror the epidemiology of COVID-19. Additionally, NIRVANA could simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV (an omnipresent virus and water quality indicator) in municipal wastewater samples. Conclusions: NIRVANA provides high-confidence detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 on the fly. We expect it to offer a promising solution for rapid field-deployable detection and mutational surveillance of pandemic viruses.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly designed real-time RT-PCR (Simplexa&#8482; COVID-19 Direct assay), that is established with an all-in-one reagent mix and no separate extraction required. RESULTS: The lower limit of detection (LOD) for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9-3.8) log10 cp/mL and 0.40 (CI: 0.2-1.5) TCID50/mL for S gene while 3.2 log10 (CI: 2.9-3.7) log10 cp/mL and 0.4 (CI: 0.2-1.3) TCID50/mL for ORF1ab. The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log10 cp/mL. Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay. Clinical performances of Simplexa&#8482; COVID-19 Direct assay were assessed in 278 nasopharyngeal swabs tested in parallel with Corman's method. Concordance analysis showed an ""almost perfect"" agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being &#954; = 0.938; SE = 0.021; 95% CI = 0.896-0.980. CONCLUSIONS: The high sensitivity and specificity of this new assay indicate that it is promising for laboratory diagnosis, enabling highspeed detection in just over one hour, which is significantly faster than the up to five hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients.","Bordi, Licia; Piralla, Antonio; Lalle, Eleonora; Giardina, Federica; Colavita, Francesca; Tallarita, Monica; Sberna, Giuseppe; Novazzi, Federica; Meschi, Silvia; Castilletti, Concetta; Brisci, Angela; Minnucci, Giulia; Tettamanzi, Veronica; Baldanti, Fausto; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria",J Clin Virol,,386

By providing an overview of current empirical and guidance literature on the use of participatory approaches within the context of Covid-19, this review not only offers a basis for how a variety of methods may be used and adapted to distanced contexts, but also explicates the challenges associated with the use of these methods and the wider methodological implications posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this review outlines the issues associated with conducting this type of research more generally, providing implications for how distance-based participatory methods may be used in wider contexts where face-to-face interaction may not be appropriate, or fieldwork may be disrupted due to logistical reasons.

The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228 +or- 0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28 +or- 0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of 30 days (12 July-11 August). Possible interventions by the government to reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.041;a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.45%;and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9964. The results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the epidemic size at the peak. The study provides important information for public health providers and the government to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","Abdallah, Alsayed Hayder Sadir Raja Kamil Hasan Sari",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,386

As the climate changes and extreme weather events become more frequent, these methods must be resilient to changes in domain shifts that may occur, for example, due to shifts in planting timelines. In this work, we present an approach for within-season crop type classification using moderate spatial resolution (30 m) satellite data that addresses domain shift related to planting timelines by normalizing inputs by crop growth stage. We use a neural network leveraging both convolutional and recurrent layers to predict if a pixel contains corn, soybeans, or another crop or land cover type. We evaluated this method for the 2019 growing season in the midwestern US, during which planting was delayed by as much as 1-2 months due to extreme weather that caused record flooding. We show that our approach using growth stage-normalized time series outperforms fixed-date time series, and achieves overall classification accuracy of 85.4% prior to harvest (September-November) and 82.8% by mid-season (July-September).","Kerner, Hannah; Sahajpal, Ritvik; Skakun, Sergii; Becker-Reshef, Inbal; Barker, Brian; Hosseini, Mehdi; Puricelli, Estefania; Gray, Patrick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10189v1.pdf,386

Objective: To characterize self-reported experiences and views of hospital capacity managers regarding the 2017-2018 influenza season in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted between April 2018 and January 2019 with a random sample of capacity management administrators responsible for throughput and hospital capacity at short-term, acute care hospitals throughout the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: Each participant's self-reported experiences and views regarding high patient volumes during the 2017-2018 influenza season, lessons learned, and the extent of hospitals' preparedness planning for future pandemic events. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using thematic content analysis. Outcomes included themes and subthemes. Results: A total of 53 key hospital capacity personnel at 53 hospitals throughout the US were interviewed; 39 (73.6%) were women, 48 (90.6%) had a nursing background, and 29 (54.7%) had been in the occupational role for more than 4 years. Participants' experiences were categorized into several domains: (1) perception of strain, (2) effects of influenza and influenza-like illness on staff and patient care, (3) immediate staffing and capacity responses to influenza and influenza-like illness, and (4) future staffing and capacity preparedness for influenza and influenza-like illness. Participants reported experiencing perceived strain associated with concerns about preparedness for seasonal influenza and influenza-like illness as well as concerns about staffing, patient care, and capacity, but future pandemic planning within hospitals was not reported as being a high priority. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this qualitative study suggest that during the 2017-2018 influenza season, there were systemic vulnerabilities as well as a lack of hospital preparedness planning for future pandemics at US hospitals. These issues should be addressed given the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Harris, Gavin H; Rak, Kimberly J; Kahn, Jeremy M; Angus, Derek C; Mancing, Olivia R; Driessen, Julia; Wallace, David J",JAMA Netw Open,,386

A prophylactic vaccine with efficacy against acquisition (VES) &#8805;70% can eliminate the infection. A vaccine with VES <70% may still control the infection if it reduces infectiousness or infection duration among those vaccinated who acquire the infection, if it is supplemented with <20% reduction in contact rate, or if it is complemented with herd-immunity. At VES of 50%, the number of vaccinated persons needed to avert one infection is 2.4, and the number is 25.5 to avert one severe disease case, 33.2 to avert one critical disease case, and 65.1 to avert one death. The probability of a major outbreak is zero at VES &#8805;70% regardless of the number of virus introductions. However, an increase in social contact rate among those vaccinated (behavior compensation) can undermine vaccine impact. In addition to the reduction in infection acquisition, developers should assess the natural history and disease progression outcomes when evaluating vaccine impact.","Makhoul, Monia; Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Seedat, Shaheen; Mumtaz, Ghina R; Al-Omari, Sarah; Abu-Raddad, Laith J",,,386

481911,Non-Invasive versus Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19: One Size Does Not Fit All!,2020,"As COVID-19 vaccines become available, different model-based approach have been developed to evaluate strategic priorities for vaccine allocation to reduce severe illness. One strategy is to directly prioritize groups that are likely to experience medical complications due to COVID-19, such as older adults. A second strategy is to limit community spread by reducing importations, for example by vaccinating members of the mobile labour force, such as rotational workers. This second strategy may be appropriate for regions with low disease prevalence, where importations are a substantial fraction of all cases and reducing the importation rate reduces the risk of community outbreaks, which can provide significant indirect protection for vulnerable individuals. Current studies have focused on comparing vaccination strategies in the absence of importations, and have not considered allocating vaccines to reduce the importation rate. Here, we provide an analytical criteria to compare the reduction in the risk of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission over four months when either older adults or rotational workers are prioritized for vaccination. Vaccinating rotational workers (assumed to be 6,000 individuals and about 1% of the Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) population) could reduce the average risk of hospitalization and ICU admission by 42%, if no community spread is observed at the time of vaccination, because epidemic spread is reduced and vulnerable individuals are indirectly protected. In contrast, vaccinating all individuals aged 75 and older (about 43,300 individuals, or 8% of the NL population) would lead to a 24% reduction in the average risk of hospitalization, and to a 45% reduction in the average risk of ICU admission, because a large number of individuals at high risk from COVID-19 are now vaccinated. Therefore, reducing the risk of hospitalization and ICU admission of the susceptible population by reducing case importations would require a significantly lower number of vaccines. Benefits of vaccinating rotational workers decrease with increasing infection prevalence in the community. Prioritizing members of the mobile labour force should be considered as an efficient strategy to indirectly protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 exposure in regions with low disease prevalence.","Martignoni, Maria M; Rahman, Proton; Hurford, Amy",,,386
481912,Non-Invasive versus Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19: One Size Does Not Fit All!,2020,"Milk kefir (MK) and water kefir (WK) are traditionally produced from different unique probiotic-containing semi-soft particles known as milk kefir grains and water kefir grains. There is significant confusion between these kefir grains, even in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Even though both grains have some similarities, they have significant differences in structure, microbial content, and impact on the finished beverage product. This review compares the two probiotic kefir grains and examines the similarities and differences in these two grains and the products made from them. Microbiological, chemical, and functional properties for two grains are examined. The two different fermented beverages produced from these grains have different physical and chemical characteristics and different microbiological composition. MK and WK also have different functional properties. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the consumption of natural probiotic-containing foods was suggested as beneficial for improving gut health and, consequently, overall health. MK and WK contain broad spectra of probiotic microorganisms, which may help improve overall health and immunity. Consequently, MK and WK may help protect against COVID-19 and especially in the elderly. While milk kefir provides significant amounts of protein as well as probiotics and prebiotics, water kefir can be a significant probiotic and prebiotic source for vegans and people who are allergic to dairy products. Both of these grains are important for their potential health benefits. • Milk kefir and water kefir grains are two unique probiotic starter cultures. • Kefir grains were naturally formed via the symbiotic relationships of inherent microorganisms. • Beverages prepared from these grains are wholly unique among probiotic products. • Each kefir product has significant health promoting properties. • Water kefir has great potential as a probiotic product for those who are allergic to dairy ingredients as well as to vegans.

Among these 23 cases, the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days (range, 6-37 days) from initial viral detection. Eight cases (35%) had another positive PCR result after testing negative once. Although the duration of viral shedding was approximately three weeks, the infectivity and transmissibility period from asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine how long such asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases have infectivity.","Miyamae, Yuka; Hayashi, Toshiya; Yonezawa, Hitoshi; Fujihara, Jin; Matsumoto, Yousuke; Ito, Takafumi; Tsubota, Takaya; Ishii, Koji",Int J Infect Dis,,386

483776,Case report: Incidental findings of COVID-19 infection on positron emission tomography/computed tomography for staging of a giant gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak and the measures to contain the global pandemic can have an impact on the well-being and mental health status of individuals. Parents of young children are particularly at risk for high levels of parental stress due to the current public health crisis, which can impact parenting behaviors and children's well-being. Although different initial scales have been developed to measure COVID-19-related anxiety, they have not yet been tested sufficiently in parent samples. A brief measure of COVID-19-related anxiety is necessary for both quick assessment in practice and in larger epidemiological studies of parents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the distributions, validities, and reliabilities of four different COVID-19 anxiety scales: Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Pandemic Anxiety Scale, and one subscale of the COVID Stress Scales. Based on the psychometric properties of these scales, we aim to provide recommendations for a brief unidimensional inventory to assess COVID-19-related anxiety among parents. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey of 515 German-speaking parents (465 mothers, 90.3%) with at least one child aged 0-6 years was conducted during a 6-week period (June 29 to August 9, 2020). Half of the parents were recruited via Facebook parenting groups, while the other half were recruited through childcare centers. We psychometrically tested 25 items on COVID-19-related anxiety using the framework of classical test theory, including item analysis, correlational analysis of family variables, and exploratory factor analysis. Moreover, an item response theory approach was applied to estimate item discriminations and item difficulties. RESULTS: Based on the psychometric properties, three items of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale were identified as a single unidimensional factor. The adapted scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (&#945;=.79), moderate to high item discrimination, strong positive intercorrelation with two other COVID-19 anxiety scales, and a small positive association with parenting stress. Mothers and fathers did not differ in total scores (t513=-0.79, P=.42). CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggests that existing COVID-19-related anxiety scales measure different latent constructs of anxiety. Furthermore, all scales showed only small to moderate correlations with trait health anxiety, suggesting that COVID-19-related anxiety is distinct from general health anxiety. The adapted ""disease anxiety"" subscale of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale is an economical measure for assessing COVID-19-related anxiety in parents. Directions for future research are outlined.","Kubb, Christian; Foran, Heather M",JMIR Ment Health,,386

Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily.","Chakraborti, Suman; Maiti, Arabinda; Pramanik, Suvamoy; Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Pilla, Francesco; Banerjee, Anushna; Das, Dipendra Nath",Sci Total Environ,,386

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) exerts a variety of biological effects. However, the role of IGF-1 in myocarditis remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: LDL-R knockout mice were randomly divided into the control group, myocarditis group, and IGF-1 siRNA group. Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Western blot were used to measure IGF-1 expression in myocardial tissue. The myocardial tissue changes were analyzed by HE staining. The total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in each group were detected. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the number of macrophages. The secretion of TNF-&#945; and INF-Î³ and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Compared with the control group, IGF-1 expression, TC, and LDL in myocarditis group was significantly increased, along with decreased heart rate (HR), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVEDs), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and macrophages number in the peritoneum were increased. Moreover, the secretion of TNF-&#945;, INF-Î³, and MIF was also significantly increased (p<0.05). However, IGF-1 siRNA treatment inhibited IGF-1 expression and reversed the changes in the myocarditis group with statistically significant differences compared with the myocarditis group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IGF-1 expression is increased in myocarditis. The downregulation of IGF-1 expression inhibits macrophages infiltration, reduces the expression of MIF and inflammatory factors, and improves myocarditis injury.","Li, H-D; Chen, B; Yang, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,386

488455,"Hospitalization for COVID-19 in patients treated with selected immunosuppressant and immunomodulating agents, compared to the general population: A Danish cohort study",2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was first described in 1967, but its definition has evolved considerably since then. ARDS is defined as the onset of hypoxemia, tachypnea, and loss of lung compliance due to some stimulus. In the United States, the incidence of ARDS has been growing because it is being increasingly recognized. The incidence of ARDS has also gone up recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: To date, there is no known one treatment for ARDS. Multiple studies have looked into various causes of ARDS, pathophysiology, and ventilation and management strategies. However, there is still considerable variability in the treatment and management of these patients from institution to institution. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Google Scholar. Publications describing the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment were included in this review. RESULTS: The definition of ARDS has evolved over the years. The most recent and agreed upon diagnostic criteria are based on the Berlin criteria for ARDS. Management of patients with ARDS includes low tidal volume ventilation, prone ventilation, paralysis in certain patient populations, and perhaps extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This also applies to patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ARDS have a high mortality due to the incredibly complex disease process. Because of the complexity of ARDS, the management and treatment is equally as difficult. This article reviews some of the strategies used to date, including the role of ECMO, and includes some society recommendations. Further research must be done into which methods best guide lung ventilation in severe ARDS and patients on ECMO.","Hasan, Zubair",Am J Ther,,386

489682,1032 COVID disease severity: comparing demographics and social vulnerability indices for pregnant patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Caring for people with dementia (PwD) is often challenging for caregiving relatives. Respite care (RC) is a commonly used short-term inpatient service. The provision of RC can serve as a link between home care and institutional care and can help to stabilize the care provided at home. During RC, the everyday functional skills of PwD can be improved or stabilized through systematic mobility training. However, no specific mobility programme exists for this setting. The aim of the DESKK study was to develop and test a mobility training programme for PwD in the RC setting in Germany. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pilot study was conducted in a specialized RC centre for PwD. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed using a mixed methods design. RESULTS: The DESKK mobility programme may be introduced in the RC setting depending on the required time and professional resources. The mobility programme had a high acceptance rate among the staff involved. Ongoing documentation of the mobility exercises were challenging. During their stay (2-4 weeks), the physical function level of the included PwD (n = 20) increased regarding leg strength, gross motor coordination, fine coordination of the fingers and hand strength. CONCLUSIONS: The DESKK mobility programme showed a high acceptance rate by the staff and was usable in daily care routine for the most part. These aspects indicate that the programme has the potential to be successfully implemented in the RC setting. The DESKK concept is described in the form of a practice-friendly website to facilitate its use in clinical practice after its successful evaluation.","Heinrich, Steffen; Horstmannshoff, Caren; Holle, Bernhard",BMC Geriatr,,386

To date, dexamethasone has shown a decrease in mortality in patients who require oxygen, especially those with invasive mechanical ventilation. However, it is unknown if another corticosteroid can be used, the optimal dose and its duration, to achieve a better clinical outcome. The objective of the study was to compare the differences in clinical outcome and laboratory results in hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV2 Pneumonia treated with dexamethasone at 6 mg doses versus patients treated with high-dose methylprednisolone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ambispective cohort study with survival analysis of 216 patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV2 by Berlin protocol, who were hospitalized in a high-complexity clinic in Medellín, Colombia. The patients should also have supplementary oxygen and radiological confirmation of Pneumonia by chest tomography. Sample size was not calculated since the total population that met the inclusion criteria was evaluated. 111 patients were treated with the institutional protocol with intravenous dexamethasone 6 mg QD for seven to 10 days if they required oxygen. Since September 15, 2020, the hospitalization protocol of the clinic was modified by the Infectious Diseases and Pulmonology service, recommending a high dose of methylprednisolone of 250 to 500 mg every day for three days with a subsequent change to oral prednisone 50 mg every day for 14 days. The protocol was not applied in the intensive care unit, where dexamethasone continued to be administered. The clinical outcome and differences in laboratory results of the patients who received dexamethasone vs. the prospective cohort that received methylprednisolone from September 15 to October 31, 2020, were evaluated. Follow-up was carried out by outpatient consultation one month after discharge or by telephone, inquiring about readmission or living-dead status. RESULTS: 216 patients had Covid-19 pneumonia documented by ground-glass imaging and alveolar pressure / inspired oxygen fraction (PaFi) less than 300. 111 patients received dexamethasone (DXM) and 105 received methylprednisolone (MTP). Patients in the DXM group evolved to severe ARDS in a higher proportion (26.1% vs 17.1% than the MTP group). Upon completion 4 days of treatment with parenteral corticosteroid, laboratory markers of severity decreased significantly in the group that received MTP, CRP 2.85 (2.3-3.8) vs 7.2 (5.4-9.8), (p-value < 0.0001), D-dimer 691 (612-847) vs 1083 (740-1565) (p-value = 0.04) and DHL 273 (244-289) vs 355 (270.6-422) (p-value = 0.01). After starting the corticosteroid, transfer to the intensive care unit (4.8% vs. 14.4%) and mortality (9,5% vs. 17.1%) was lower in the group that received MTP. Recovery time was shorter in patients treated with MTP, three days (3-4) vs. DXM 6 days (5-8) (p-value < 0.0001). At 30-day follow-up, 88 (92.6%) were alive in MTP vs 58 (63.1%) of those who received dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the treatment of severe Covid-19 Pneumonia with high-dose methylprednisolone for three days followed by oral prednisone for 14 days, compared with 6 mg dexamethasone for 7 to 10 days, statistically significantly decreased the recovery time, the need for transfer to intensive care and the severity markers C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and LDH.

We use a dictionary classifier to categorize 612'177 tweets by parties, politicians, and the public as well as 441'458 articles published in 76 newspapers between February and August 2020. We distinguish between ?problem? (COVID-19) and ?solutions? (face masks and contact-tracing apps) and, using a vector autoregression approach, we analyze the relationship between their salience on social and traditional media, as well as among different groups on social media. We find that overall attention to COVID-19 was not driven by endogenous dynamics between the different actors. By contrast, the debate on face masks was led by the attentive public and by politicians, whereas parties and newspapers followed. The results illustrate how social media challenge the capacity of party and media elites to craft a consensus regarding the appropriateness of different measures as responses to a major crisis.","Gilardi, Fabrizio Gessler Theresa Kubli Maël Müller Stefan",Swiss Political Science Review,,386

496006,Prior presumed coronavirus infection reduces COVID-19 risk: A cohort study,2020,"The sex discordance in COVID-19 outcomes has been widely recognized, with males generally faring worse than females and a potential link to sex steroids. A plausible mechanism is androgen-induced expression of TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 in pulmonary tissues that may increase susceptibility or severity in males. This hypothesis is the subject of several clinical trials of anti-androgen therapies around the world. Here, we investigated the sex-associated TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human and mouse lungs and interrogated the possibility of pharmacologic modification of their expression with anti-androgens. We found no evidence for increased TMPRSS2 expression in the lungs of males compared to females in humans or mice. Furthermore, in male mice, treatment with the androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide did not decrease pulmonary TMPRSS2. On the other hand, ACE2 and AR expression was sexually dimorphic and higher in males than females. ACE2 was moderately suppressible with enzalutamide administration. Our work suggests that sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes attributable to viral entry are independent of TMPRSS2. Modest changes in ACE2 could account for some of the sex discordance.","Baratchian, Mehdi; McManus, Jeffrey M; Berk, Mike P; Nakamura, Fumihiko; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Xu, Weiling; Erzurum, Serpil; Drazba, Judy; Peterson, John; Klein, Eric A; Gaston, Benjamin; Sharifi, Nima",Sci Rep,,386

AIMS: The aims of the current study were to assess the prevalence of loneliness among young people at the time of COVID-19 and to identify whether selected variables related to the pandemic predicted the level of loneliness. METHOD: A cross-sectional study using WhatsApp and Facebook social media platforms was conducted to survey 1,057 young people aged 15 to 24 years from six Middle Eastern countries. Participants completed survey items including demographic and COVID-19-related questions; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of experienced loneliness was 1 (0.1%), 625 (59.1%), 429 (40.6%), and 2 (0.2%), reflecting low, moderate, moderately high, and high experiences for loneliness, respectively. History of depression or anxiety, being dissatisfied with life, and having depression at the time of COVID-19 were significant predictors of loneliness among youth. The model was significant (F = 44.95, p < .05) and accounted for 29.8% of the variance in UCLA Loneliness Scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the high prevalence rate of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with depression and impaired life satisfaction among Middle Eastern youth. Thus, special attention and interventional action plans need to be developed taking into consideration the youths' special situation during COVID-19.","Al Omari, Omar; Al Sabei, Sulaiman; Al Rawajfah, Omar; Abu Sharour, Loai; Al-Hashmi, Iman; Al Qadire, Mohammad; Khalaf, Atika",J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc,,386

The decision to pivot to remote learning was made swiftly, particularly by those institutions operating a shared leadership model, benefitting from a greater degree of agility, innovation, and collaboration. The current article highlights three of the leadership best practices for navigating unpredictable adaptive challenges such as that posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Firstly, by utilizing a type of servant leadership, that emphasizes empowerment, involvement, and collaboration, academic leaders with emotional intelligence and emotional stability should place the interests of others above their own. Secondly, academic leaders should distribute leadership responsibilities to a network of teams throughout the organization to improve the quality of the decisions made in crisis resolution and thirdly, leaders should communicate clearly and frequently to all stakeholders through a variety of communication channels. Looking forward, the rise of the flexible “allostatic leader” with the adaptive capacity to learn and evolve in crisis, to emerge better able to address future crises, is described.","Fernandez, Antonio Arturo; Shaw, Graham Paul",J.

For the second pilot assessment, University’s VLE page & MS Teams was trailed. Issues with internet connectivity, VLE page slowdown, and suboptimal recording feature in MS Teams were identified. For the final pilot assessment, phased launching of VLE page with single test item per page was implemented with success. The students reported that attempting the online exam on VLE with ZOOM support was user friendly. Ninety percent of the class was supportive of the continuing with the online assessments. Conclusion: In order to device an effective protocol for e-assessments conducting multiple trial runs, and incorporating feedback from all stakeholders is a necessity.","Fatima, S.

499395,PIN108 Using the Apriori Algorithm to Identify Risk Factors Associated with Survival and Mortality Among COVID-19 Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global mental health crisis, highlighting the need for a focus on community-wide mental health. Emotional CPR (eCPR) is a program and practice developed by persons with a lived experience of recovery from trauma or mental health challenges to train community members from diverse backgrounds to support others through mental health crises. eCPR trainers have found that eCPR may promote feelings of belonging by increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems. Thus, clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect would improve along with feelings of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of eCPR. METHODS: We employed a pre-post design with 151 individuals, including peer support specialists, service users, clinicians, family members, and nonprofit leaders, who participated in virtual eCPR trainings between April 20, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Instruments were administered before and after training and included the Herth Hope Scale; Empowerment Scale; Flourishing Scale (perceived capacity to support individuals); Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; Active-Empathic Listening Scale (supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health challenges); Social Connectedness Scale (feelings of belonging and connection with others); Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and University of California, Los Angeles 3-item Loneliness Scale (symptoms and emotions). The eCPR fidelity scale was used to determine the feasibility of delivering eCPR with fidelity. We conducted 2-tailed paired t tests to examine posttraining improvements related to each scale. Additionally, data were stratified to identify pre-post differences by role. RESULTS: Findings indicate that it is feasible for people with a lived experience of a mental health condition to develop a program and train people to deliver eCPR with fidelity. Statistically significant pre-post changes were found related to one's ability to identify emotions, support others in distress, communicate nonverbally, share emotions, and take care of oneself, as well as to one's feelings of social connectedness, self-perceived flourishing, and positive affect (P&#8804;.05). Findings indicated promising evidence of pre-post improvements (not statistically significant) related to loneliness, empowerment, active-empathetic listening, mindfulness awareness, and hope. Nonprofit leaders and workers demonstrated the greatest improvements related to loneliness, social connectedness, empathic listening, and flourishing. Peer support specialists demonstrated the greatest improvements related to positive affect, and clinicians demonstrated the greatest improvements related to mindfulness awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Promising evidence indicates that eCPR, a peer-developed and peer-delivered program, may increase feelings of belonging while increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems and improving clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect and feelings of loneliness.","Myers, Amanda L; Collins-Pisano, Caroline; Ferron, Joelle C; Fortuna, Karen L",J Particip Med,,386
499509,Comparison of fasting gastric volume using ultrasound in diabetic and non-diabetic patients in elective surgery: An observational study,2020,"African swine fever (ASF) causes huge economic losses and is one of most dangerous diseases of pigs. The disease is known for almost 100 years, an effective vaccine or treatment is still unavailable, only proper biosecurity measures, including disinfection, are being applied, in order to prevent disease outbreaks. Eight active substances, i.e., formaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite, caustic soda, glutaraldehyde, phenol, benzalkonium chloride, potassium peroxymonosulfate and acetic acid, were tested, in order to confirm their effectiveness against African swine fever virus (ASFV). This specific selection was done based on the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)'s recommendation and previous disinfectant studies on surfaces. The result of our study shows that most of them inactivate the virus, in recommended concentrations. In order to reduce the cytotoxicity of the four substances, Microspin S-400 HR columns were applied, therefore making it possible to demonstrate four logarithms virus titer reduction. Sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, caustic soda and potassium peroxymonosulfate showed the best ASFV inactivation rates, achieving titer reductions over 5 logs. Despite microfiltration, the virucidal activity of formaldehyde was not assessable, due to its high cytotoxicity. Our results showed that cleaning is particularly important, because removal of the soiling provides improved effectiveness of the tested chemical compounds.","Juszkiewicz, Malgorzata; Walczak, Marek; Mazur-Panasiuk, Natalia; Wozniakowski, Grzegorz",,,386

Although there are ongoing clinical trials of repurposed and investigational antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are as yet no scientifically proven, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy. Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined. Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses. Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations. Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts. Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.","Abena, Pascale M; Decloedt, Eric H; Bottieau, Emmanuel; Suleman, Fatima; Adejumo, Prisca; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Muyembe TamFum, Jean-Jacques; Seydi, Moussa; Eholie, Serge P; Mills, Edward J; Kallay, Oscar; Zumla, Alimuddin; Nachega, Jean B",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,386

Lactoferrin (LF) is a naturally occurring non-toxic glycoprotein with broad-spectrum antiviral, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we assessed the potential of LF in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Antiviral immune response gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in uninfected Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells treated with LF. An infection assay for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in Caco-2 cells treated or not with LF. SARS-CoV-2 titer was determined by qRT-PCR, plaque assay and immunostaining. Inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production was determined by qRT-PCR. LF significantly induced the expression of IFNA1, IFNB1, TLR3, TLR7, IRF3, IRF7 and MAVS genes. Furthermore, LF partially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Our in vitro data support LF as an immune modulator of the antiviral immune response with moderate effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Salaris, Claudio; Scarpa, Melania; Elli, Marina; Bertolini, Alice; Guglielmetti, Simone; Pregliasco, Fabrizio; Blandizzi, Corrado; Brun, Paola; Castagliuolo, Ignazio",Nutrients,,386

506052,Venous thromboembolism and COVID-19 patients: an ongoing story,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated lockdowns have caused significant disruptions across society, including changes in the number of emergency department (ED) visits. This study aims to investigate the impact of three pre-COVID-19 interventions and of the COVID-19 UK-epidemic and the first UK national lockdown on overcrowding within University College London Hospital Emergency Department (UCLH ED). The three interventions: target the influx of patients at ED (A), reduce the pressure on in-patients' beds (B) and improve ED processes to improve the flow of patents out from ED (C). METHODS: We collected overcrowding metrics (daily attendances, the proportion of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (four-hours target) and the reduction in overall waiting time) during 01/04/2017-31/05/2020. We then performed three different analyses, considering three different timeframes. The first analysis used data 01/04/2017-31/12-2019 to calculate changes over a period of 6 months before and after the start of interventions A-C. The second and third analyses focused on evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, comparing the first 10 months in 2020 and 2019, and of the first national lockdown (23/03/2020-31/05/2020). RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19 all interventions led to small reductions in waiting time (17%, p < 0.001 for A and C; an 9%, p = 0.322 for B) but also to a small decrease in the number of patients leaving within 4 h of arrival (6.6,7.4,6.2% respectively A-C,p < 0.001). In presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance and waiting time were reduced (40% and 8%; p < 0.001), and the number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival was increased (6%,p < 0.001). During the first lockdown, there was 65% reduction in attendance, 22% reduction in waiting time and 8% increase in number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (p < 0.001). Crucially, when the lockdown was lifted, there was an increase (6.5%,p < 0.001) in the percentage of people leaving within 4 h, together with a larger (12.5%,p < 0.001) decrease in waiting time. This occurred despite the increase of 49.6%(p < 0.001) in attendance after lockdown ended. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed results pre-COVID-19 (significant improvements in waiting time with some interventions but not improvement in the four-hours target), may be due to indirect impacts of these interventions, where increasing pressure on one part of the ED system affected other parts. This underlines the need for multifaceted interventions and a system-wide approach to improve the pathway of flow through the ED system is necessary. During 2020 and in presence of the COVID-19 epidemic, a shift in public behaviour with anxiety over attending hospitals and higher use of virtual consultations, led to notable drop in UCLH ED attendance and consequential curbing of overcrowding. Importantly, once the lockdown was lifted, although there was an increase in arrivals at UCLH ED, overcrowding metrics were reduced. Thus, the combination of shifted public behaviour and the restructuring changes during COVID-19 epidemic, maybe be able to curb future ED overcrowding, but longer timeframe analysis is required to confirm this.","Panovska-Griffiths, J; Ross, J; Elkhodair, S; Baxter-Derrington, C; Laing, C; Raine, R",BMC Emerg Med,,386

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 and necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom 689 excess serum specimens were available and found that sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested specimens from 4,856 individuals from Boise, ID, collected over 1 week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We expect that the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","Bryan, Andrew; Pepper, Gregory; Wener, Mark H; Fink, Susan L; Morishima, Chihiro; Chaudhary, Anu; Jerome, Keith R; Mathias, Patrick C; Greninger, Alexander L",J. clin. microbiol,,386

The current situation demands an effective therapeutic strategy to control the disease using drugs that are approved, or by inventing new ones. The present study examines the possible repurposing of existing anti-viral protease inhibitor drugs. For this, the structural features of the viral spike protein, the substrate for host cell protease and main protease of the available SARS CoV-2 isolates were established by comparing with related viruses for which antiviral drugs are effective. The results showed 97% sequence similarity among SARS and SARS-CoV-2 main protease and has same cleavage site positions and ACE2 receptor binding region as in the SARS-CoV spike protein. Though both are N-glycosylated, unlike SARS-CoV, human SARS-CoV-2 S-protein was O-glycosylated as well. Molecular docking studies were done to explore the role of FDA approved protease inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 replication. The results indicated that, Ritonavir has the highest potency to block SARS-CoV-2 main protease and human TMPRSS2, a host cell factor that aids viral infection. Other drugs such as Indinavir and Atazanavir also showed favourable binding with Cathepsin B/L that helped viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Further molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations confirmed the stability of protein-drug complexes. These results suggest that protease inhibitors particularly Ritonavir, either alone or in combination with other drugs such as Atazanavir, have the potential to treat COVID 19.

As the amount of virus shed in faeces and urine varies largely from person to person, it is very difficult to quantitatively determine the number of people who are infected in the population. More research on the surveillance of viruses in wastewater using accurate and validated methods, as well as subsequent risk analysis and modelling is paramount in understanding the dynamics of viral outbreaks.","Farkas, Kata; Hillary, Luke S.; Malham, Shelagh K.; McDonald, James E.; Jones, David L.",Curr.

510397,"Clinical Characteristics and Short-Term Outcomes of Chronic Dialysis Patients Admitted for COVID-19 in Metro Manila, Philippines",2021,"Objectives: To find out if the expressed breast milk delivery rate to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for babies who were hospitalized for any reason other than COVID-19, and exclusive breastfeeding (EB) rates between discharge date and 30th day of life of those babies were affected by COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Babies who were hospitalized before the date first coronavirus case was detected in our country were included as control group (CG). The study group was divided into two groups; study group 1 (SG1): the mothers whose babies were hospitalized in the period when mother were asked not to bring breast milk to NICU, study group 2 (SG2): the mothers whose babies were hospitalized after the date we started to use the informed consent form for feeding options. The breast milk delivery rates to NICU during hospitalization and EB rates between discharge and 30th day of life were compared between groups. Results: Among 154 mother-baby dyads (CG, n=50; SG1, n=46; SG2, n=58), the percentage of breast milk delivery to NICU was 100%, 79% for CG, SG2, respectively (p<0.001). The EB rate between discharge and 30th day of life did not change between groups (CG:90%, SG1:89%, SG2:75.9; p=0.075). Conclusions: If the mothers are informed about the importance of breast milk, the EB rates are not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in short term, even if the mothers are obligatorily separated from their babies. The breast milk intake rate of the babies was lowest while our NICU protocol was uncertain, and after we prepared a protocol this rate increased.","Gunes, Asli Okbay; Dincer, Emre; Karadag, Nilgun; Topcuoglu, Sevilay; Karatekin, Guner",J. perinat. med,,386

A number of variant protocols for performing lung scintigraphy emerged in the medical literature which minimized or eliminated the ventilation component, due to the persistent need to provide this critical diagnostic service without compromising the safety of staff and patients. We have summarized and reviewed these protocols, many of which are based on concepts developed earlier in the history of lung scintigraphy. It is possible that some of these interim remedies may gain traction and earn a more permanent place in the ongoing practice of nuclear medicine.","Zuckier, Lionel S",Semin. nucl. med,,386

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the hospital received CP, RDV, or combination of both. Mortality, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and total ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. Adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052). There were 15, 3, and 6 deaths in the CP, RDV, and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination therapy group had the longest median ICU LOS (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 0.220) and hospital LOS (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175). Age (p = 0.036), initial SOFA score (p = 0.013), and intubation (p = 0.005) were statistically significant predictors of mortality. Patients with type O blood had decreased ventilation days, ICU LOS, and total LOS. Thirteen treatment-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed between patients treated with RDV, CP, or combination therapy. Elderly patients, those with a high initial SOFA score, and those who require intubation are at increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19. Blood type did not affect clinical outcomes.","Padilla, Regine; Arquiette, Jered; Mai, Yvonne; Singh, Gurinder; Galang, Kristine; Liang, Edward",J Pharm Pharm Sci,,386

We aimed to examine how laboratory errors may arise from factors, e.g., flexible working order, staff displacement, changes in the number of tests, and samples will reflect on the total test process (TTP) during the pandemic period. Materials and methods: In 12 months, 6 months before and during the pandemic, laboratory errors were assessed via quality indicators (QIs) related to TTP phases. QIs were grouped as pre-, intra- and postanalytical. The results of QIs were expressed in defect percentages and sigma, evaluated with 3 levels of performance quality: 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values. Results: When the pre- and during pandemic periods were compared, the sigma value of the samples not received was significantly lower in pre-pandemic group than during pandemic group (4.7&#963; vs. 5.4&#963;, P = 0.003).

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted virtually all aspects of human life around the world and has introduced additional occupational stressors for PSP. The objective of this study was to explore how PSP, especially those seeking digital mental health services, have been affected by the pandemic. Our research unit, PSPNET, provides internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy to PSP in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. When the pandemic spread to Saskatchewan, PSPNET began inquiring about the impact of the pandemic on prospective clients during the eligibility screening process. We used content analysis to analyze data from telephone screening interviews (n = 56) and descriptive statistics to analyze data from a questionnaire concerning the impacts of COVID-19 (n = 41). The results showed that most PSP reported facing several novel emotional challenges (e.g., social isolation, boredom, anger, and fear) and logistical challenges (e.g., related to childcare, finances, work, and access to mental healthcare). Most participants indicated they felt at least somewhat afraid of contracting COVID-19 but felt more afraid of their families contracting the virus than themselves. However, few participants reported severe challenges of any kind, and many (40%) indicated that they had not been significantly negatively impacted by the pandemic. Overall, the results suggest that PSP are not expressing significant concern at this time in meeting the novel challenges posed by COVID-19. Continued research will be required to monitor how diverse PSP populations and treatment outcomes are affected by the pandemic as the situation evolves.","McCall, Hugh; Beahm, Janine; Landry, Caeleigh; Huang, Ziyin; Carleton, R Nicholas; Hadjistavropoulos, Heather",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,386

The study data were collected between May 15 and 31, 2020, using a descriptive questionnaire form and the Parenting Practices Scale applied to 1115 parents of children between 6 and 13 years of age. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 21.0 software package, and with descriptive, correlation and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: It was noted that 68% of the mothers did not work, and 40.2% of the fathers had shifted to a flexible work arrangement as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study revealed that 89.6% of the families had established ground rules related to screen time, and that the screen time of the children of 71.7% of the families had seen an increase, amounting to 6.42 ± 3.07 h/day. Gender, age, household income, mother's employment status, family's rules about screen time, and inconsistent parenting practices were defined as significant predictors in the children's screen time model created for the study. CONCLUSIONS: A vast majority of the participants stated that their children's screen time had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, there is no data on its safety/tolerability or efficacy in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). OBJECTIVES: We performed this study to identify the incidence of adverse events following SARS-CoV2 EUA vaccines and the incidence of new onset GVHD or worsening of existing GVHD after EUA vaccine administration and the incidence SAR-CoV2 positivity in vaccinated HCT patients. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 113 HCT patients who received at least one dose of EUA vaccine to describe the safety/tolerability, any impact on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and incidence of SARS-CoV2 PCR positivity after vaccination. Patients received either Pfizer (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older and received at least one dose of vaccine in the post HCT setting. RESULTS: Most patients presented with myalgias/arthralgias (first dose 7.7%, second dose 14.6%), fatigue (first dose 15.4%, second dose 29.2%), and injection site pain (first dose 40.4%, second dose 43.8%). Other side effects experienced by patients included: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, injection-site rash and swelling. Liver function abnormalities occurred in 18.6% of patients. The incidence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia occurred at 13.3%, 11.5%, and 8.8% respectively. Forty percent of patients who had active chronic GVHD at the time of vaccination where worsening chronic GVHD occurred in 3.5% of patients. New chronic GVHD developed in 9.7% of patients after vaccination.

Based on observations, as well as analyses of policy documents and self-organization cases, this article shows that Chinese citizens and governments collaborated through three different channels in fighting against the virus, but different channels produced different results. First, through residential committees, Chinese governments successfully mobilized most citizens to comply with stay-at-home orders, contact traced and isolated suspected cases through existing networks within the communities. Second, as a formal channel for state–society interaction during the crisis, government-organized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) failed in bridging demands of the health system and contributions from citizens. Third, self-organizations emerged as a key informal channel for citizens to fight against the virus. The experiences and lessons learned in this citizen–government collaboration in combating the virus may offer some implications for other settings.","Zhao, Ting; Wu, Zhongsheng",Am. Rev.

518057,Biological and Clinical Factors contributing to the Metabolic Heterogeneity of Hospitalized Patients with and without COVID-19,2021,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) poses a significant threat to the population and urban sustainability worldwide. The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0 %. It contributes to a 44.3 % to 55.4 % reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6 % by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning.","Jiang, Peng; Fu, Xiuju; Van Fan, Yee; Klemes, Jirí Jaromír; Chen, Piao; Ma, Stefan; Zhang, Wanbing",J Clean Prod,,386

We demonstrate the construction of a vaccine platform based on a unique three-plasmid system to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors from chemically synthesized DNA. In response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we use this vaccine platform to rapidly produce fully synthetic MVA (sMVA) vectors co-expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid antigens, two immunodominant antigens implicated in protective immunity. We show that mice immunized with these sMVA vectors develop robust SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, including potent neutralizing antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential of a vaccine platform based on synthetic DNA to efficiently generate recombinant MVA vectors and to rapidly develop a multi-antigenic poxvirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.","Chiuppesi, Flavia; Salazar, Marcela d039; Alincourt,; Contreras, Heidi; Nguyen, Vu H; Martinez, Joy; Park, Yoonsuh; Nguyen, Jenny; Kha, Mindy; Iniguez, Angelina; Zhou, Qiao; Kaltcheva, Teodora; Levytskyy, Roman; Ebelt, Nancy D; Kang, Tae Hyuk; Wu, Xiwei; Rogers, Thomas F; Manuel, Edwin R; Shostak, Yuriy; Diamond, Don J; Wussow, Felix",Nat Commun,,386

Our identification approach exploits regional variation in the point in time when wearing of face masks became mandatory in public transport and shops. Depending on the region we consider, we find that face masks reduced the number of newly registered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections between 15% and 75% over a period of 20 days after their mandatory introduction. Assessing the credibility of the various estimates, we conclude that face masks reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 47%.","Mitze, Timo; Kosfeld, Reinhold; Rode, Johannes; Wälde, Klaus",Proc.

519428,A case report about diabetes mellitus and covid-19 outbreak,2020,"Efforts to suppress transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK have seen non-pharmaceutical interventions being invoked. The most severe measures to date include all restaurants, pubs and cafes being ordered to close on 20th March, followed by a ""stay at home"" order on the 23rd March and the closure of all non-essential retail outlets for an indefinite period. Government agencies are presently analysing how best to develop an exit strategy from these measures and to determine how the epidemic may progress once measures are lifted. Mathematical models are currently providing short and long term forecasts regarding the future course of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK to support evidence-based policymaking. We present a deterministic, age-structured transmission model that uses real-time data on confirmed cases requiring hospital care and mortality to provide up-to-date predictions on epidemic spread in ten regions of the UK. The model captures a range of age-dependent heterogeneities, reduced transmission from asymptomatic infections and produces a good fit to the key epidemic features over time. We simulated a suite of scenarios to assess the impact of differing approaches to relaxing social distancing measures from 7th May 2020 on the estimated number of patients requiring inpatient and critical care treatment, and deaths. With regard to future epidemic outcomes, we investigated the impact of reducing compliance, ongoing shielding of elder age groups, reapplying stringent social distancing measures using region based triggers and the role of asymptomatic transmission. We find that significant relaxation of social distancing measures from 7th May onwards can lead to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 disease and the health system being quickly overwhelmed by a sizeable, second epidemic wave. In all considered age-shielding based strategies, we projected serious demand on critical care resources during the course of the pandemic. The reintroduction and release of strict measures on a regional basis, based on ICU bed occupancy, results in a long epidemic tail, until the second half of 2021, but ensures that the health service is protected by reintroducing social distancing measures for all individuals in a region when required. Our work confirms the effectiveness of stringent non-pharmaceutical measures in March 2020 to suppress the epidemic. It also provides strong evidence to support the need for a cautious, measured approach to relaxation of lockdown measures, to protect the most vulnerable members of society and support the health service through subduing demand on hospital beds, in particular bed occupancy in intensive care units.","Keeling, Matt J; Hill, Edward M; Gorsich, Erin E; Penman, Bridget; Guyver-Fletcher, Glen; Holmes, Alex; Leng, Trystan; McKimm, Hector; Tamborrino, Massimiliano; Dyson, Louise; Tildesley, Michael J",PLoS Comput Biol,,386

The International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) Farm Simulation Approach and Technology Impact Policy Impact Calculations (TIPICAL) model was used considering with Corona (WC) and without Corona (WOC). The Integrated Dairy Research Network (IDRN) database (January 2019 to July 2020) was used for simulation of IFCN two typical farms. The milk price is decreased by 17% and feed price is increased by 3.7% due to COVID-19 in March which was used as the base for farm simulation. This resulted in a decrease in milk yield by 7.9% and 8.9% for small household and family farms, respectively. The cost of milk production increased by 19.10% and 10.9% for household and family farms, respectively. This has an overall negative impact on farm income which accounted for national economic loss from dairy farms in Bangladesh to 4.43 million USD/day (36.84 crore BDT). This loss has been fluctuated from April onward and was higher in June (3.83 million USD/day) due to a combination of COVID-19, flood, and seasonality effect on lowering milk production. At the same time, the farmers' response to the resilience capacity (liquidity, operating profit margin, and financial performance) to combat COVID-19-induced situation has been declined substantially. Based on this, we conclude that the government might take a strategy to support farmers by providing financial support for increasing the operating capital and decreasing the cost of milk production. The outcome of this study is expected to be beneficial for policymakers, farmers, and processors in Bangladesh and similar other countries elsewhere.","Uddin, Mohammad Mohi; Akter, Amrin; Khaleduzzaman, A B M; Sultana, Mst Nadira; Hemme, Torsten",Trop Anim Health Prod,,386

Automated variable selection allows data-driven risk evaluation by recognizing distinct patterns in data. We sought to evaluate an automated variable selection method (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, LASSO) for predicting 30-day mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and CS (AMICS) receiving acute percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to two established scores. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with AMICS receiving acute PCI at one of two tertiary heart centres in Denmark 2010-2017. Patients were divided according to treatment with mechanical circulatory support (MCS); PCI-MCS cohort (n = 220) versus PCI cohort (n = 1180). The latter was divided into a development (2010-2014) and a temporal validation cohort (2015-2017). Cohort-specific LASSO models were based on data obtained before PCI. LASSO models outperformed IABP-SHOCK II and CardShock risk scores in discriminative ability for 30-day mortality in the PCI validation [receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84) vs 0.73 (95% CI 0.69-0.77) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.75), respectively, P < 0.01 for both] and PCI-MCS development cohort [ROC AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.70-0.83) vs 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.57-0.71), respectively, P < 0.01 for both]. Variable influence differed depending on MCS, with age being the most influential factor in the LASSO-PCI model, whereas haematocrit and estimated glomerular filtration rate were the highest-ranking factors in the LASSO-PCI-MCS model. CONCLUSION: Data-driven prognosis models outperformed established risk scores in patients with AMICS receiving acute PCI and exhibited good discriminative abilities. Observations indicate a potential use of machinelearning to facilitate individualized patient care and targeted interventions in the future.","Helgestad, Ole K L; Povlsen, Amalie L; Josiassen, Jakob; Möller, Sören; Hassager, Christian; Jensen, Lisette O; Holmvang, Lene; Schmidt, Henrik; Møller, Jacob E; Ravn, Hanne B",European heart journal.

523321,Neurological Injury in COVID-19 Patients Who Receive VV-ECMO Therapy: A Cohort Study,2021,"Since December 2019, the world has been experiencing the challenge of facing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), a severe infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The individuals with the most severe symptoms and the highest risk of death are the elderly and those with chronic illness. Among chronic conditions, those with a certain degree of chronic inflammation may predispose to a more severe evolution of COVID-19. Elderly with psychiatric disorders can present a persistent inflammatory state, a characteristic of the age's immunological senescence, but the disorder can accentuate that. Social isolation is still the safest way to avoid contamination. However, isolated older people may have or worsen mental health conditions due to isolation and health concerns. In this scenario, a SARS-CoV-2 infection may progress to more severe disease. Conversely, COVID-19 can predispose or aggravate psychiatric disorders, as it induces a cytokine storm, causing systemic hyper inflammation. It may damage the blood-brain barrier, resulting in inflammation in the central nervous system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to reach and trigger an inflammatory process directly in the nervous system. This review makes an update about research on the mental health of the elderly during the pandemic. Also, it discusses the vulnerability of these individuals in the face of stress and in the case of contracting COVID-19, considering mainly the stress's hormonal and inflammatory mechanisms. Finally, the review points out possible care and attention strategies and entertainment and activities that can reduce the damage to mental and physical health and improve the elderly's quality of life. Graphical abstract Isolation and concerns about COVID-19 may harm elderly mental health. Immunosenescence and pandemic stress increase the risk of psychiatric disorders. Stress and disorders may potentiate the elderly's inflammation and COVID-19 symptoms.

Mass vaccination campaigns are underway in multiple countries and are expected worldwide once more vaccine becomes available. Some early candidate vaccines use novel platforms, such as mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, and relatively new platforms, such as replication-deficient viral vectors. While these new vaccine platforms hold promise, limited safety data in humans are available. Serious health outcomes linked to vaccinations are rare, and some outcomes may occur incidentally in the vaccinated population. Knowledge of background incidence rates of these medical conditions is a critical component of vaccine safety monitoring to aid in the assessment of adverse events temporally associated with vaccination and to put these events into context with what would be expected due to chance alone. A list of 22 potential adverse events of special interest (AESI), including neurologic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular disorders, was compiled by subject matter experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recently available U.S. background rates for these medical conditions, overall and by age, sex, and race/ethnicity (when available), were sourced from reported statistics (data published by medical panels/ associations or federal government reports), and literature reviews in PubMed.

The latter function involves reversing the post-translational modification of cellular proteins conjugated with either ubiquitin (Ub) or Ub-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). Ub is known to be highly conserved among eukaryotes, but surprisingly, ISG15 is highly divergent among animals. The ramifications of this sequence divergence to the recognition of ISG15 by coronavirus PLPs at a structural and biochemical level are poorly understood. Therefore, the activity of PLPs from SARS-CoV, MERS‐CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus was evaluated against seven ISG15s originating from an assortment of animal species susceptible, and not, to certain coronavirus infections. Excitingly, our kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural analysis revealed an array of different preferences among PLPs. Included in these studies is the first insight into a coronavirus PLP’s interface with ISG15 via SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with the principle binding domain of human ISG15 (hISG15) and mouse ISG15s (mISG15s). The first X-ray structure of the full-length mISG15 protein is also reported and highlights a unique, twisted hinge region of ISG15 that is not conserved in hISG15, suggesting a potential role in differential recognition. Taken together, this new information provides a structural and biochemical understanding of the distinct specificities among coronavirus PLPs observed and addresses a critical gap of how PLPs can interact with ISG15s from a wide variety of species.","Daczkowski, Courtney M.; Dzimianski, John V.; Clasman, Jozlyn R.; Goodwin, Octavia; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Pegan, Scott D.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283617301870; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.04.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283617301870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28438633/,386
590714,Reinfection risk of novel coronavirus (COVID-19): A systematic ‎review of current evidence,2020-12-15,"The water supply in megacities can be affected by the living habits and population mobility, so the fluctuation degree of daily water supply data is acute, which presents a great challenge to the water demand prediction. This is because that non-stationarity of daily data can have a large influence on the generalization ability of models. In this study, the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) and wavelet transform (WT) methods were used to carry out decomposition of daily data to solve the non-stationarity problem. The bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and Gaussian radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) were developed to carry out prediction of different subseries. The ensemble learning was introduced to improve the generalization ability of models, and prediction interval was generated based on student's t-test to cope with the variation of water supply laws. This study method was applied to the daily water demand prediction in Shenzhen and cross-validation was performed. The results show that WT is superior to HP decomposition method, but maximum decomposition level of WT should not be set too high, otherwise the trend characteristics of subseries will be weakened. Although the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused a variation in water supply laws, this variation is still within the prediction interval. The WT and coupling models accurately predict water demand and provide the optimal mean square error (0.17%), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (97.21%), mean relative error (0.1), mean absolute error (3.32%), and correlation coefficient (0.99).","Liu, Xin; Sang, Xuefeng; Chang, Jiaxuan; Zheng, Yang",Water Resour Manage,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02927-y,386
591469,Do COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU require anti-Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis?,2020-05-22,"Aluminum-based adjuvants (ABAs) are used in human vaccines to enhance the magnitude of protective immune responses elicited against specific pathogens. One hypothesis is that stress signals released by aluminum-exposed necrotic cells play a role in modulating an immune response that contributes to the adjuvant’s effectiveness. We hypothesized that aluminum adjuvant-induced necrosis would be similar irrespective of cellular origin or composition of the adjuvant. To test this hypothesis, human macrophages derived from peripheral monocytic cell line (THP-1) and cells derived from the human brain (primary astrocytes) were evaluated. Three commercially available formulations of ABAs (Alhydrogel, Imject alum, and Adju-Phos) were examined. Alum was also used as a reference. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species formation, and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified. Cells were exposed to different concentrations (10-100 µg/mL) of the adjuvants for 24 h or 72 h. The two FDA approved adjuvants (Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos) decreased cell viability in both cell types. At the 72 h time point, the decrease in viability was accompanied with increased ROS formation. The size of the aluminum agglomerates was not relatable to the changes observed. After exposure to ABAs, astrocytes and macrophages presented a distinct profile of cytokine secretion which may relate to the function and unique characteristics of each cell type. These variations indicate that aluminum adjuvants may have differing capability of activating cells of different origin and thus their utility in specific vaccine design should be carefully assessed for optimum efficacy.","Nies, Isaac; Hidalgo, Krisha; Bondy, Stephen C.; Campbell, Arezoo",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1382668920300806; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388105/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668920300806?v=s5,386
591785,Short-Stay Hospitalizations for Patients with COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021-05-03,"We aimed to explore student and staff perceptions and experiences of a pilot SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing service (P-ATS) in a UK university campus setting. This was a mixed-method study comprised of an online survey, and thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and focus groups conducted at the mid-point and end of the 12-week P-ATS programme. Ninety-nine students (84.8% female, 70% first year; 93.9% P-ATS participants) completed an online survey, 41 individuals attended interviews or focus groups, including 31 students (21 first year; 10 final year) and 10 staff. All types of testing and logistics were highly acceptable (virus: swab, saliva; antibody: finger prick) and 94.9% would participate again. Reported adherence to weekly virus testing was high (92.4% completed ≥6 tests; 70.8% submitted all 10 swabs; 89.2% completed ≥1 saliva sample) and 76.9% submitted ≥3 blood samples. Students tested to “keep campus safe”, “contribute to national efforts to control COVID-19”, and “protect others”. In total, 31.3% had high anxiety as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) (27.1% of first year). Students with lower levels of anxiety and greater satisfaction with university communications around P-ATS were more likely to adhere to virus and antibody tests. Increased adherence to testing was associated with higher perceived risk of COVID-19 to self and others. Qualitative findings revealed 5 themes and 13 sub-themes: “emotional responses to COVID-19”, “university life during COVID-19”, “influences on testing participation”, “testing physical and logistical factors” and “testing effects on mental wellbeing”. Asymptomatic COVID-19 testing (SARS-CoV-2 virus/antibodies) is highly acceptable to students and staff in a university campus setting. Clear communications and strategies to reduce anxiety are likely to be important for testing uptake and adherence. Strategies are needed to facilitate social connections and mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 and self-isolation.","Blake, Holly; Corner, Jessica; Cirelli, Cecilia; Hassard, Juliet; Briggs, Lydia; Daly, Janet M.; Bennett, Malcolm; Chappell, Joseph G.; Fairclough, Lucy; McClure, C.

592224,Laboratory Testing Implications of Risk-Stratification and Management for Improving Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients,2020-06-14,"OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and ethnodemographic correlates of serological responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein following mild-to-moderate COVID-19. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of healthcare workers who had self-isolated due to COVID-19. SETTING: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, UK (UHBFT). PARTICIPANTS: 956 health care workers were recruited by open invitation via UHBFT trust email and social media. INTERVENTION: Participants volunteered a venous blood sample that was tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies. Results were interpreted in the context of the symptoms of their original illness and ethnodemographic variables. RESULTS: Using an assay that simultaneously measures the combined IgG, IgA and IgM response against the spike glycoprotein (IgGAM), the overall seroprevalence within this cohort was 46.2% (n=442/956). The seroprevalence of immunoglobulin isotypes was 36.3%, 18.7% and 8.1% for IgG, IgA and IgM respectively. IgGAM identified serological responses in 40.6% (n=52/128) of symptomatic individuals who reported a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Increasing age, non-white ethnicity and obesity were independently associated with greater IgG antibody response against the spike glycoprotein. Self-reported fever and fatigue were associated with greater IgG and IgA responses against the spike glycoprotein. The combination of fever and/or cough and/or anosmia had a positive predictive value of 92.3% for seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assays employing combined antibody detection demonstrate enhanced seroepidemiological sensitivity and can detect prior viral exposure even when PCR swabs have been negative. We demonstrate an association between known ethnodemographic risk factors associated with mortality from COVID-19 and the magnitude of serological responses in mild-to-moderate disease. The combination of cough, and/or fever and/or anosmia identifies the majority of individuals who should self-isolate for COVID-19.","Shields, Adrian M; Faustini, Sian E; Perez-Toledo, Marisol; Jossi, Sian; Allen, Joel D; Al-Taei, Saly; Backhouse, Claire; Dunbar, Lynsey; Ebanks, Daniel; Emmanuel, Beena; Faniyi, Aduragbemi A; Garvey, Mark I.; Grinbergs, Annabel; McGinnell, Golaleh; O’Neill, Joanne; Watanabe, Yasunori; Crispin, Max; Wraith, David.

In the majority of naturally infected animals, FCoV infection remains subclinical and is associated with generalised B and T cell hyperplasia, but no other pathological findings. A minority of cats, however, develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal systemic granulomatous disease. This is generally accompanied by B and T cell depletion. The obvious functional differences of lymphatic tissues in FCoV-infected cats with and without FIP suggest that they contribute to the outcome of FCoV infection. This study attempted to evaluate the functional changes in haemolymphatic tissues after natural FCoV infection, with special emphasis on the magnitude, phenotype and function of the monocyte/macrophage population. The spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow from naturally FCoV-infected cats with and without FIP and specific pathogen-free (SPF) control cats were examined for the quantity and activation state of monocytes/macrophages both by immunohistology and by quantitative real time PCR for the transcription of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) and GM-CSF. Compared to cats with FIP, FCoV-infected cats without FIP exhibited significantly higher IL-10 levels in the spleen and significantly lower levels of IL-6, G- and M-CSF in mesenteric lymph nodes. In cats with FIP, however, IL-12 p40 levels were significantly lower in lymphatic tissues in comparison to both SPF cats and FCoV-infected cats without FIP. In comparison to SPF cats, FIP cats had significantly higher IL-1β levels and lower TNF levels in mesenteric lymph nodes and lower M-CSF levels in the spleen. Findings indicate that FCoV-infected cats which do not develop FIP are able to mount an effective FCoV-specific immune response and can avoid excessive macrophage activation and FIP, possibly by upregulation of IL-10 production. Development of FIP, however, might be due to a lack of IL-12 which inhibits an effective cellular immune response and allows for monocyte/macrophage activation and the development of FIP.","Kipar, Anja; Meli, Marina L.; Failing, Klaus; Euler, Tatjana; Gomes-Keller, Maria A.; Schwartz, Dirk; Lutz, Hans; Reinacher, Manfred",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16621029/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242706000560; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242706000560,386

Cases with refractory pulmonary infiltration were discussed in this study. METHODS: During hospitalization, chest CT scan and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were repeatedly performed. While drawing parallels to RT-PCR, the impact of delayed absorption of lung lesions on length of hospital stay (LOS) and medical expense was investigated. Features for delayed absorption of lung lesions were identified using cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: Cases with delayed absorption of lung lesions had a prolonged LOS (18.00 ± 4.90 vs 9.25 ± 4.20, p < 0.01) and increased medical expense (9124.55 ± 2421.31 vs 4923.88 ± 2218.56, p < 0.01). Time interval from admission to a negative RT-PCR (ATN) was also prolonged (13.29 ± 4.72 vs 9.25 ± 4.20, p = 0.03). The cox proportional hazard regression model indicated that imported cases bore high risk of delayed absorption of lung lesions (hazard ratio = 2.54, 95% confidence interval 1.05, 6.11, p = 0.04). Sensitivity analysis revealed similar pattern (hazard ratio = 6.64, 95% confidence interval 1.62, 27.18, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Imported cases of COVID-19 were more likely to have refractory pulmonary infiltration, which subsequently prolongs LOS and increases medical expense.","Li, BinBin; Hu, WeiZhen; Bao, ChunMiao",Open Med (Wars),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981852/; https://doi.org/10.1515/med-2021-0265,386

Rarely, do they rapidly enlarge into large abdominal masses over a short period of time. Generally, we attribute rapidly growing abdominal masses to sarcomas, desmoid tumors, or gynecological masses. We present a case of a rapidly growing appendiceal adenocarcinoma in an elderly patient. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an 83-year-old-male who presented with a one-month history of abdominal pain. A computer tomography (CT) scan identified a lower pelvic mass measuring 7.39 cm × 5.40 cm. A biopsy was done which revealed appendiceal carcinoma. A plan for radiotherapy to reduce the tumor size was made and the patient was discharged. However, the patient returned after three weeks due to worsening abdominal pain and a CT scan identified a significant enhancement in the tumor size. The patient underwent debulking surgery. Pathology of the specimen identified adenocarcinoma of the appendix. DISCUSSION: A rapidly growing carcinoma of the appendix is rare as they are known to have a slow growth rate. A swift diagnosis and intervention are required as these rapidly enhancing neoplasms in the abdomen can become unresectable and metastasize. Although there are various methods of treatment for appendiceal carcinomas, the rapid growth rate and lack of response to radiation required debulking surgery. CONCLUSION: There exist a myriad of differential diagnoses for a rapidly growing mass in the abdomen. We are presenting the first documented case of a rapidly growing appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Surgeons should be aware of the variety of differentials in such cases.","Gilani, Mohammad; Iskaros, Mina; Nahidi, Seyed Mohammad; Mehta, Nisarg; Ahmed, Leaque",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218018/,386

Regarding orthopaedic practice, various authors and organisations have come out with guidelines to resume elective surgeries. However, clear consensus and common strategies need be derived. With this motive, we conducted a review of the literature for guidelines to resume elective orthopaedic surgery amid COVID-19 pandemic and shortlisted scholarly publications and information from regional organisations. We have summarised the information and derived an organised algorithm considering the guidelines provided by various sources. In this extraordinary time, guidelines come in as a relief for every surgeon who is in a dilemma whether to resume electives or not.

This study aims at identifying a panel of clinical and laboratory parameters that at day-5 of symptoms onset could predict disease progression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort study on hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Patient-level epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at fixed time-points: day 5, 10, and 15 from symptoms onset. COVID-19 progression was defined as in-hospital death and/or transfer to ICU and/or respiratory failure (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 200) within day-11 of symptoms onset. Multivariate regression was performed to identify predictors of COVID-19 progression. A model assessed at day-5 of symptoms onset including male sex, age > 65 years, dyspnoea, cardiovascular disease, and at least three abnormal laboratory parameters among CRP (> 80 U/L), ALT (> 40 U/L), NLR (> 4.5), LDH (> 250 U/L), and CK (> 80 U/L) was proposed. Discrimination power was assessed by computing area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) values. RESULTS: A total of 235 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively included in a 3-month period. The majority of patients were male (148, 63%) and the mean age was 71 (SD 15.9). One hundred and ninety patients (81%) suffered from at least one underlying illness, most frequently cardiovascular disease (47%), neurological/psychiatric disorders (35%), and diabetes (21%). Among them 88 (37%) experienced COVID-19 progression. The proposed model showed an AUC of 0.73 (95% CI 0.66–0.81) for predicting disease progression by day-11. CONCLUSION: An easy-to-use panel of laboratory/clinical parameters computed at day-5 of symptoms onset predicts, with fair discrimination ability, COVID-19 progression. Assessment of these features at day-5 of symptoms onset could facilitate clinicians’ decision making. The model can also play a role as a tool to increase homogeneity of population in clinical trials on COVID-19 treatment in hospitalized patients.","Gentilotti, Elisa; Savoldi, Alessia; Compri, Monica; Górska, Anna; De Nardo, Pasquale; Visentin, Alessandro; Be, Giorgia; Razzaboni, Elisa; Soriolo, Nicola; Meneghin, Dario; Girelli, Domenico; Micheletto, Claudio; Mehrabi, Sara; Righi, Elda; Tacconelli, Evelina",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06596-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454452/,386

Developing countries are short of money and education, skilled people, and wealthy institutions; many countries also lack adequate communication, the means to exploit what resources they have, and the ability to attract the business and investment that might bring them prosperity.

To understand how strategic vaccine site placement may benefit high vulnerability populations, we extracted vaccine site locations for 26 U.S. states and linked these data to county-level adult vaccination rates and the CDC 2018 Social Vulnerability Index rankings. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models to compare vaccine site density between the highest and lowest SVI domain quartiles, and assessed whether greater vaccine site density mediated or modified the relationship between social vulnerability and vaccination rates. We found that high vulnerability counties by socioeconomic status had more vaccine sites per 10,000 residents, yet this higher vaccine site density did not reduce socioeconomic disparities in vaccination rates. Persistent vaccination inequities may reflect other structural barriers to access. Our results suggest that targeted vaccine site placement in high vulnerability counties may be necessary but insufficient for the goal of widespread, equitable vaccination.","Thakore, Nitya; Khazanchi, Rohan; Orav, E.

Fifty-four adolescents were randomly assigned to either the asynchronous online class group (AOCG, n = 24, age: 15.8 ± 0.4 years) or the synchronous online class group (SOCG, n = 24 age: 15.9 ± 0.3 years). The online physical education class lasted two days per week for 10 weeks. Recorded video lectures were conducted for the AOCG, and Tabata training for the SOCG, as real-time lecture methods. Baseline and post-online physical education class measures included muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, balance, and cardiorespiratory fitness tests. The results showed that the synchronous online physical education class had a positive effect on the improvement of muscle mass, ankle strength (dorsiflexion), hip strength (abduction, flexion, extension, and external rotation), knee strength (extension and flexion), and balance (Y-balance test) in adolescents. These findings suggest that the physical fitness of adolescents can be sufficiently improved through appropriate online physical education class methods. Further research should focus on developing and evaluating different types of exercises for synchronous online physical education classes as a precautionary measure for the second wave of COVID-19.","Lee, Kwang-Jin; Noh, Byungjoo; An, Keun-Ok",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639604/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910305,386
598495,Risk stratification of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through comparative studies of laboratory results with influenza,2020-07-31,"We describe how the set of tools, practices, and social relations known as “precision agriculture” is defined, promoted, and debated. To do so, we perform a critical discourse analysis of popular and trade press websites. Promoters of precision agriculture champion how big data analytics, automated equipment, and decision-support software will optimize yields in the face of narrow margins and public concern about farming’s environmental impacts. At its core, however, the idea of farmers leveraging digital infrastructure in their operations is not new, as agronomic research in this vein has existed for over 30 years. Contemporary discourse in precision ag tends to favour emerging digital technologies themselves over their embeddedness in longstanding precision management approaches. Following several strands of science and technology studies (STS) research, we explore what rhetorical emphasis on technical innovation achieves, and argue that this discourse of novelty is a reinvention of precision agriculture in the context of the growing “smart” agricultural economy. We overview six tensions that remain unresolved in this promotional rhetoric, concerning the definitions, history, goals, adoption, uses, and impacts of precision agriculture. We then synthesize these in a discussion of the extent to which digital tools are believed to displace farmer decision-making and whether digital agriculture addresses the biophysical heterogeneity of farm landscapes or land itself has become an “experimental technology”—a way to advance the general development of artificial intelligence. This discussion ultimately helps us name a larger dilemma: that the smart agricultural economy is perhaps less about supporting land and its stewards than promising future tech and profits.","Duncan, Emily; Glaros, Alesandros; Ross, Dennis Z.; Nost, Eric",Agric Human Values,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-021-10244-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276130/,386
598577,Retraction: Lung ultrasound score in establishing the timing of intubation in COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia: A preliminary retrospective observational study,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Senecavirus A (SVA), a member of the family Picornaviridae, genus Senecavirus, is a recently identified single-stranded RNA virus closely related to members of the Cardiovirus genus. SVA was originally identified as a cell culture contaminant and was not associated with disease until 2007 when it was first observed in pigs with Idiopathic Vesicular Disease (IVD). Vesicular disease is sporadically observed in swine, is not debilitating, but is significant due to its resemblance to foreign animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), whose presence would be economically devastating to the United States. IVD disrupts swine production until foreign animal diseases can be ruled out. Identification and characterization of SVA as a cause of IVD will help to quickly rule out infection by foreign animal diseases. METHODS: We have developed and characterized an indirect ELISA assay to specifically identify serum antibodies to SVA. Viral protein 1, 2 and 3 (VP1, VP2, VP3) were expressed, isolated, and purified from E. coli and used to coat plates for an indirect ELISA. Sera from pigs with and without IVD symptoms as well as a time course following animals from an infected farm, were analyzed to determine the antibody responses to VP1, VP2, and VP3. RESULTS: Antibody responses to VP2 were higher than VP1 and VP3 and showed high affinity binding on an avidity ELISA. ROC analysis of the SVA VP2 ELISA showed a sensitivity of 94.2% and a specificity of 89.7%. Compared to IFA, the quantitative ELISA showed an 89% agreement in negative samples and positive samples from 4–60 days after appearance of clinical signs. Immune sera positive for FMDV, encephalomyocarditis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus antibodies did not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS: A simple ELISA based on detection of antibodies to SVA VP2 will help to differentially diagnose IVD due to SVA and rule out the presence of economically devastating foreign animal diseases.","Dvorak, Cheryl M.

The risks of COVID‐19 for SOT candidates and recipients combined with data about this population's response to other vaccines has led to transplant centers recommending vaccination for their candidates and recipients in accordance with guidance from major transplant organizations. Relevant ethics considerations include: weighing the low risk of vaccination causing transplant complications against potentially limited antibody response of vaccines for transplant recipients; the equitable distribution of vaccines among vulnerable populations; the duty to steward and respect organs as limited resources; the duty to support vaccination; and patient autonomy. Vaccinated transplant patients and candidates should also consider participating in research studies to better understand the efficacy and potential long‐term risks in this patient population. There are difficult scenarios, like timing transplant after second vaccine dose, when to administer the second dose to a partially vaccinated candidate who gets an organ match, whether to vaccinate a recent transplant recipient with low exposure risk and which vaccine to use. Here we provide ethics considerations for vaccinating different groups within the transplant population.","Parent, Brendan; Caplan, Arthur; Mehta, Sapna A.",Clin Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34241923/,386

METHODS: In this case series, we identified patients with COVID-19 admitted to 3 Partners Healthcare hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts between March 7th, 2020, and March 30th, 2020. Patient characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes were determined. FINDINGS: A total of 247 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified; the median age was 61 (interquartile range [IQR]: 50–76 years), 58% were men, 30% of Hispanic ethnicity, 21% enrolled in Medicaid, and 12% dual-enrolled Medicare/Medicaid. The median estimated household income was $66,701 [IQR: $50,336-$86,601]. Most patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine (72%), and statins (76%; newly initiated in 34%). During their admission, 103 patients (42%) required intensive care. At the end of the data collection period (June 24, 2020), 213 patients (86.2%) were discharged alive, 2 patients (0.8%) remain admitted, and 32 patients (13%) have died. Among those discharged alive (n = 213), 70 (32.9%) were discharged to a post-acute facility, 31 (14.6%) newly required supplemental oxygen, 19 (8.9%) newly required tube feeding, and 34 (16%) required new prescriptions for antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, methadone, or opioids. Over a median post-discharge follow-up of 80 days (IQR, 68–84), 22 patients (10.3%) were readmitted.

Considering the rapid spread of the infection, all patients in France must be considered as potentially infected by the virus. Nevertheless, patients without clinical or radiological (CT scan) markers of COVID-19, and with negative nasopharyngeal sample within 24h of surgery, are at low risk of being infected. Instructions for personal protection include specific wound dressings and decontamination of all material used. The operating room should be ventilated after each tracheostomy and the pressure of the room should be neutral or negative. Percutaneous tracheostomy is to be preferred over surgical cervicotomy in order to reduce aerosolization and to avoid moving patients from the intensive care unit to the operating room. Ventilation must be optimized during the procedure, to limit patient oxygen desaturation. Drug assisted neuromuscular blockage is advised to reduce coughing during tracheostomy tube insertion. An experienced team is mandatory to secure and accelerate the procedure as well as to reduce risk of contamination.","Schultz, P; Morvan, J B; Fakhry, N; Morinière, S; Vergez, S; Lacroix, C; Bartier, S; Barry, Beatrix; Babin, E; Couloigner, V; Atallah, I",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879726120301091; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879726120301091?v=s5,386

METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis approach was used to comprehensively search MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for relevant studies. Studies that reported psychological stress in patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Psychological comorbidities were defined as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Pooled proportions of psychological comorbidities with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed using a random-effects model. The quality of assessment for each study, heterogeneity between the studies, and publication bias were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies with 7959 patients/caregivers were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled proportions of anxiety/worry, depression/bad mood, and sleep disturbance were 38.9% (95% CI: 31.3-46.7); I2â¯=â¯97%; pâ¯<â¯0.01, 30.9% (95% CI: 23.3-38.9), I2â¯=â¯97%; pâ¯<â¯0.01, and 36.5% (95% CI: 28.3-45.1), I2â¯=â¯97%, pâ¯<â¯0.01, respectively.

RT-PCR assays are diagnosis gold standard; however, they can lead to false-negative results. Therefore, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA investigation can play a complementary role in assessing the individuals immune status. Majority of serological tests focus on IgM and IgG although IgA are the main immunoglobulins involved in mucosal immunity. It has been reported that digestive symptoms may occur in the absence of any typical respiratory symptom. Thus, a complete screening, comprising IgA, IgM, and IgG detection could be more consistent and useful in patients with atypical symptoms or in paucisymptomatic cases. Current literature describes over 200 immunoassays available worldwide, pointing out a great results variability, depending on methodology or antigens’ nature. In our study we evaluated anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM, and IgG trend on a control group and on two COVID-19 patient groups (early and late infection time) with a lateral-flow combined immunoassay (LFIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dissimilar antibodies time kinetics have been described in COVID-19 (decreasing IgM concentration with IgA/IgG persistence for a longer time; as well as persistent IgA, IgG, and IgM concentration); our results confirmed both of them depending on the methodology; therefore, it is difficult to compare different studies outcomes, suggesting the importance of a serological tests international standardization. Nevertheless, we propose a flowchart with combined anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM/IgA detection as a screening on general population, where serological positivity should be considered as an “alert,” to avoid and contain possible new outbreaks.","Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Gisone, Francesca; Bernardini, Sergio",Immunological investigations,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820139.2020.1823407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945214/,386

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to discuss the incidence, characteristics, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, and outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with CAPA. METHODS: A literature search was performed through Pubmed and Web of Science databases for articles published up to March 20th, 2021. RESULTS: In 1,421 COVID-19 patients, the overall CAPA incidence was 13.5% (ranging 2.5-35.0%). The majority required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The time to CAPA diagnosis from illness onset varied between 8.0-16.0 days. However, the time to CAPA diagnosis from ICU admission and IMV initiation ranged between 4.0-15.0 days and 3.0-8.0 days. The most common diagnostic criteria were the modified AspICU-Dutch/Belgian Mycosis Study Group and IAPA-Verweij et al. 77.6% of patients had positive lower respiratory tract cultures, other fungal biomarkers of BAL and serum galactomannan were positive in 45.3% and 18.2% of patients. The CAPA mortality rate was high at 48.4%, despite the widespread use of antifungals. Lengthy hospital and ICU LOS ranging between 16.0-37.5 days and 10.5-37.0 days were observed. CAPA patients had prolonged IMV duration of 13.0-20.0 days. CONCLUSION: The true incidence of CAPA likely remains unknown as the diagnosis is limited by the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria that rely solely on microbiological data with direct or indirect detection of Aspergillus in respiratory specimens, particularly in clinical conditions with a low pretest probability.

We then compared the outcome to ongoing surveillance. We used a modified prioritization method developed at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. In a Delphi process experts scored pathogens according to ten variables. We ranked the pathogens according to the total score and divided them into four priority groups. We then compared the priority groups to self-reported time spent on surveillance by epidemiologists and ongoing programmes for surveillance through mandatory and/or voluntary notifications and for surveillance of typing results. 106 pathogens were scored. The result of the prioritization process was similar to the outcome of the prioritization in Germany. Common pathogens such as calicivirus and Influenza virus as well as blood-borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, gastro-intestinal infections such as Campylobacter and Salmonella and vector-borne pathogens such as Borrelia were all in the highest priority group. 63% of time spent by epidemiologists on surveillance was spent on pathogens in the highest priority group and all pathogens in the highest priority group, except for Borrelia and varicella-zoster virus, were under surveillance through notifications. Ten pathogens in the highest priority group (Borrelia, calicivirus, Campylobacter, Echinococcus multilocularis, hepatitis C virus, HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS- and MERS coronavirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and varicella-zoster virus) did not have any surveillance of typing results.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our research was to assess the performance of FREND(TM) COVID-19 Ag assay (NanoEntek, South Korea) as a ultra-rapid frontline test for SARS-COV-2 identification, in comparison with RT-PCR and another COVID-19 antigen fluorescence immunoassay (FIA). STUDY DESIGN: The qualitative FIA FREND(TM) test, designed to detect within 3 minutes the Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM™, Copan Diagnostics Inc, US) from suspected COVID-19 cases who accessed the Emergency Room of the Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Liguria, Northwest Italy. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and STANDARD F(TM) COVID-19 Ag FIA test (SD BIOSENSOR Inc., Republic of Korea). RESULTS: In November 2020, 110 nasopharyngeal samples were collected consecutively; 60 resulted RT-PCR positive.

ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002–2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, has been isolated from one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound human, pangolin, and horseshoe bat (R. macrotis) ACE2 more efficiently than the SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13 RBD. Only the RaTG13 RBD bound rodent ACE2 orthologs efficiently. Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1. An ACE2-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized SARS-CoV-2 five-fold more efficiently than human ACE2-Fc.

MSCs have immunomodulatory properties and can be used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Crohn’s disease. MSCs also can be used in cancer and aging. At present, many clinical experiments are using MSCs. MSCs can reduce the occurrence of inflammation and apoptosis of tissue cells, and promote the proliferation of endogenous tissue and organ cells, so as to achieve the effect of repairing tissue and organs. MSCs presumably also play an important role in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.","Gao, Guanwen; Fan, Chenyang; Li, Weiquan; Liang, Runzhang; Wei, Chuzhong; Chen, Xiaojie; Yang, Yue; Zhong, Yueyuan; Shao, Yingqi; Kong, Yi; Li, Zesong; Zhu, Xiao",Hum Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272720/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13577-021-00578-0,386

The medical and scientific community responds to needs as and when they arise but finds difficult to propose a global strategy in the medium and long term. Regarding diagnosis, priority should be given to anticipating the management of re-emerging pathogens, to developing capacities of real-time molecular diagnosis, and to preserving reference expertise and reference biological materials. This effort should also include sero-epidemiological studies aiming at obtaining a more accurate mapping of the circulation of potentially re-emerging pathogens. Regarding therapeutics (with the exception of vaccines which are addressed in another presentation), the expected improvements are the advance implementation of ready-to-use protocol frames for clinical trials and that of an ambitious strategy aiming at gradually covering the taxonomic spectrum of evolutionary virus groups infecting vertebrates.","de Lamballerie, Xavier",Bull Acad Natl Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407919305710; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407919305710,386

METHODS: The Corona São Caetano programme is a primary care initiative providing care to all residents with COVID-19 in São Caetano do Sul, Brazil. It was designed to capture standardised clinical data on community COVID-19 cases. After triage of potentially severe cases, consecutive patients presenting to a multimedia screening platform between 13 April and 13 May 2020 were tested at home with SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR; positive patients were followed up for 14 days with phone calls every 2 days. RT-PCR-negative patients were offered additional SARS-CoV-2 serology testing to establish their infection status. We describe the clinical, virological and natural history features of this prospective population-based cohort. FINDINGS: Of 2073 suspected COVID-19 cases, 1583 (76.4%) were tested by RT-PCR, of whom 444 (28.0%, 95% CI 25.9 to 30.3) were positive; 604/1136 (53%) RT-PCR-negative patients underwent serology, of whom 52 (8.6%) tested SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The most common symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were cough, fatigue, myalgia and headache; whereas self-reported fever (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.4 to 3.9), anosmia (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.6 to 4.4) and ageusia (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.3 to 3.8) were most strongly associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR or serology. RT-PCR cycle thresholds were lower in men, older patients, those with fever and arthralgia and closer to symptom onset. The rates of hospitalisation and death among 444 RT-PCR-positive cases were 6.7% and 0.7%, respectively, with older age and obesity more frequent in the hospitalised group. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 presents in a similar way to other mild community-acquired respiratory diseases, but the presence of fever, anosmia and ageusia can assist the specific diagnosis. Most patients recovered without requiring hospitalisation with a low fatality rate compared with other hospital-based studies.","Leal, Fabio E; Mendes-Correa, Maria C; Buss, Lewis Fletcher; Costa, Silvia F; Bizario, Joao C S; de Souza, Sonia R P; Thomaz, Osorio; Tozetto-Mendoza, Tania Regina; Villas-Boas, Lucy S; de Oliveira-da Silva, Léa Campos; Grespan, Regina M Z; Capuani, Ligia; Buccheri, Renata; Domingues, Helves; Alexander, Neal; Mayaud, Philippe; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33436471/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042745,386

The impacts of the pattern on epidemic dynamics in heterogeneous metapopulation networks, wherein each node represents a subpopulation with any number of individuals, are investigated by using a mean-field approach. The results show that the pattern does not alter the epidemic threshold, but can slightly lower the final average density of infected individuals as a whole. More importantly, we also find that the pattern produces different impacts on nodes with different degree, and that there exists a critical degree [Formula: see text]. For nodes with degree smaller than [Formula: see text] , the pattern produces a positive impact on epidemic mitigation; conversely, for nodes with degree larger than [Formula: see text] , the pattern produces a negative impact on epidemic mitigation.","Gong, Yong-Wang; Song, Yu-Rong; Jiang, Guo-Ping",Physica A,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2013.05.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437113004512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288087/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437113004512,386

In vivo, TGEV primarily targets and infects intestinal epithelial cells, which play an important role in glucose absorption via the apical and basolateral transporters Na(+)-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and facilitative glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), respectively. In this study, we therefore sought to evaluate the effects of TGEV infection on glucose uptake and SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression. Our data demonstrate that infection with TGEV resulted in increased glucose uptake and augmented expression of EGFR, SGLT1 and GLUT2. Moreover, inhibition studies showed that EGFR modulated glucose uptake in control and TGEV infected cells. Finally, high glucose absorption was subsequently found to promote TGEV replication.","Dai, Lei; Hu, Wei Wei; Xia, Lu; Xia, Mi; Yang, Qian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27851758/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165585,386

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study comparing patients treated between 23 March 2020 and 14 June 2020, deemed exposed to the pandemic/lockdown, to patients treated between 18 December 2019 and 10 March 2020, deemed to be unexposed. Data came from electronic clinical records from secondary care mental health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment area population ∼0.86 million). Eligible patients were aged 65 years or over at baseline with at least 14 days' follow‐up, excluding patients diagnosed with confirmed or suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality. FINDINGS: In the two cohorts, 3,073 subjects were exposed to lockdown and 4,372 subjects were unexposed; the cohorts were followed up for an average of 74 and 78 days, respectively. After controlling for confounding by sociodemographic factors, smoking status, mental comorbidities, and physical comorbidities, patients with dementia suffered an additional 53% risk of death (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.02–2.31), and patients with severe mental illness suffered an additional 123% risk of death (HR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.42–3.49). No significant additional mortality risks were identified from physical comorbidities, potentially due to low statistical power in that respect. CONCLUSION: During lockdown people with dementia or severe mental illness had a higher risk of death without confirmed COVID‐19. These data could inform future health service responses and policymaking to help prevent avoidable excess death during future outbreaks of this or a similar infectious disease.","Chen, Shanquan; Jones, Peter B.; Underwood, Benjamin R.; Fernandez‐Egea, Emilio; Qin, Pei; Lewis, Jonathan R.; Cardinal, Rudolf N.",Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34382242/,386

METHODS: Telephone interviews with 1050 members of the lay public in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area, Malaysia, were conducted between July 11 and September 12, 2009. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that public psychobehavioral responses closely mirrored the daily number of reported deaths due to 2009 H1N1 influenza. During the weeks of escalating reported deaths, sharp rises of various domains of fear, health avoidance and protective behaviors, and impact were observed. In particular, health avoidance and protective behaviors decreases were consistent with the decline of reported deaths, indicating the paramount importance of efforts to sustain behavioral change in the general public.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Survey data from applicants to otolaryngology residency programs were obtained from the Texas Seeking Transparency in Applications to Residency database. Applicant differences between the 2021 match year and prior match years (2018, 2019, and 2020) were analyzed using two-sided t-tests, Chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: A total of 442 otolaryngology residency applicants responded to the survey, including 329 from the match years 2018 to 2020 and 113 from match year 2021. In 2021, 30.7% of responding applicants reported matching at a program where they had a geographic connection, compared to 40.0% in prior years (P = .139). Matched applicants in 2021 reported attending less interviews than applicants in prior years (mean 12.2 vs. 13.3, P = .040), and 26.1% of responding applicants reported matching at a program where they sent a preference signal. Applicants in the 2021 match reported significantly lower total costs than applicants in prior years (mean difference -$5,496, 95% confidence interval -$6,234 to -$4,759; P < .001). Compared to prior match years, matched applicants in 2021 had no meaningful differences in characteristics such as United States Medical Licensing Exam board scores, clerkship grades, honors society memberships, research output, volunteer experiences, or leadership experiences. CONCLUSION: Based on this sample, there was no evidence of significant interview hoarding or increased geographic clustering in the 2021 otolaryngology match, and the COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to result in significantly different matched applicant characteristics.

One hundred and fourteen children aged 6–14 years with chronic stable asthma and on regular inhaled steroid were monitored for respiratory symptoms over a full calendar year from recruitment. They would attend the study clinic if peak expiratory flow rate decreased to below 80% of their baselines, if they met a predefined symptom score, or if parents subjectively felt them developing a cold. Virological diagnosis using virus culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction methods on nasal swab specimens would be attempted for all these visits irrespective of triggers. Physician diagnosed outcome of each episode was documented. Three hundred and five episodes of respiratory illnesses were captured in the cohort. Nasal specimens were available in 166 episodes, 92 of which were diagnosed as asthma exacerbations, and 74 non-asthma related episodes. Respiratory viruses were detected in 61 of 166 episodes (36.7%). There was no significant difference in virus detection rate between asthma exacerbations (32 out of 97 episodes, 34.8%) and non-asthma respiratory illnesses (29 out of 79 episodes, 39.2%). Although newly discovered respiratory viruses were identified in these episodes, rhinovirus was the commonest organism associated with both asthma exacerbations and non-asthma related episodes. Plausible explanations for much lower virus detection rate than previously reported include improved personal hygiene and precautionary measures taken during respiratory tract infections in the immediate post-severe acute respiratory syndrome period together with a significant contribution of other adverse factors like environmental air pollution. We conclude that not all viral infections in children with asthma lead to an asthma exacerbation and the attributing effect of different triggers of asthma exacerbations in children vary across different time periods and across different localities.","Lee, So-lun; Chiu, Shui-seng Susan; Malik, Peiris Joseph S.; Chan, Kwok-hung; Wong, Hing-sang Wilfred; Lau, Yu-lung",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21448631/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-011-1446-1,386

However, the disease burden has sharply declined and the epidemic areas has shrunken after the implementation of an integrated malaria control and elimination strategy, especially since 2000. Till now, China has successfully scaled up its efforts to become malaria-free and is currently being evaluated for malaria-free certification by the WHO. In the battle against malaria, China’s efforts have spanned generations, reducing from an incidence high of 122.9/10 000 (6.97 million cases) in 1954 to 0.06/10 000 (7855 cases) in 2010. In 2017, for the first time, China reached zero indigenous case of malaria, putting the country on track to record three consecutive years of zero transmission by 2020, accoding to the National Malaria Elimination Action Plan (2010–2020). China’s efforts to eliminate malaria is impressive, and the country is dedicated to sharing its lessons learned in malaria elimination—including, but not limited to, the application of novel genetics-based approaches—with other nations through new initiatives. China will promote international relationships and establish collaborative platforms on a wide range of topics in roughly 65 countries, including 20 African nations. China’s experience in applying innovative genetics-based approaches and tools to characterize malaria parasite populations, including surveillance of markers related to drug resistance, categorization of cases as indigenous or imported, and objective identification of the likely sources of infections to inform efforts towards malaria control and elimination in Africa could offer game-changing results when applied to settings with ongoing transmission.","Chen, Jun-Hu; Fen, Jun; Zhou, Xiao-Nong",Infect Dis Poverty,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875017/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-021-00839-y,386

Italy is immersed in COVID-19. Most of the world will soon follow. The United States currently has the most documented cases of COVID-19 of any nation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated acute cardiomyopathy is common in critical care patients and is associated with a high mortality. COVID-19 patients frequently require mechanical support for adequate oxygenation. A severe shortfall of ventilators is predicted. Of equal concern is the projected shortage of trained professionals required to care for patients on mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography is proving to be a valuable tool for identifying the pulmonary manifestations and progression of COVID-19. Lung ultrasound also facilitates successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography of the lung, pleura and diaphragm are easily mastered by experienced echocardiographers. Echocardiography has an established role for optimal fluid management and recognition of cardiac disease including SARS-CoV-2 associated acute cardiomyopathy. Cardiologists, anesthesiologists, sonographers, and all providers should be prepared to commit their full spectrum of skills to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. We should also be prepared to collaborate and cross-train to expand professional services as necessary. During a declared health care crisis, providers must be familiar with the ethical principles, organizational structure, practical application, and gravity of limited resource allocation.","Drake, Daniel H.; De Bonis, Michele; Covella, Michele; Agricola, Eustachio; Zangrillo, Alberto; Zimmerman, Karen G.; Cobey, Frederick C.",J Am Soc Echocardiogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503707/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2020.04.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0894731720302182; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894731720302182?v=s5,386

METHODS: Two estimation methods of ICU_ALOS were compared: the average LOS of already discharged patients at the date of estimation (DPE), and a standard parametric method used for analyzing time-to-event data which fits a given distribution to observed data and includes the censored stays of patients still treated in the ICU at the date of estimation (CPE). Methods were compared on a series of all COVID-19 consecutive cases (n = 59) admitted in an ICU devoted to such patients. At the last follow-up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. A simulation study investigated the generalizability of the methods' patterns. CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID-19 estimates reported to date. RESULTS: LOS ≥ 30 days concerned 14 out of the 59 patients (24%), including 8 of the 21 deaths observed. Two months after the first admission, 38 (64%) patients had been discharged, with corresponding DPE and CPE estimates of ICU_ALOS (95% CI) at 13.0 days (10.4–15.6) and 23.1 days (18.1–29.7), respectively. Series' true ICU_ALOS was greater than 21 days, well above reported estimates to date. CONCLUSIONS: Discharges of short stays are more likely observed earlier during the course of an outbreak. Cautious unbiased ICU_ALOS estimates suggest parameterizing a higher burden of ICU bed occupancy than that adopted to date in COVID-19 forecasting models.

612228,Epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of pediatric patients with COVID‐19 in China: A multicenter retrospective study,2021-08-12,"The incidence of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in women of child-bearing age is approximately 64 per 1000 population. The spectrum of illness ranges from acute bronchitis, which is very common, through influenza virus infection and exacerbations of underlying lung disease, to pneumonia, which, fortunately is uncommon (<1.5% LRTI), but can be severe. Acute bronchitis is generally mild, self-limiting and usually does not require antibacterial therapy. Influenza virus infection in pregnant women has been recently related to increased hospitalization for acute cardiorespiratory conditions. At present, the safety of the newer neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza virus infection has not been established in pregnancy and they are not routinely recommended. In influenza virus infection complicated by pneumonia, antibacterial agents active against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae superinfection should be used. There are few data on infective complications of asthma or COPD in pregnancy. The latter is rare, as patients with COPD are usually male and aged over 45 years. Management is the same as for nonpregnant patients. The incidence and mortality of pneumonia in pregnancy is similar to that in nonpregnant patients. Infants born to pregnant patients with pneumonia have been found to be born earlier and weigh less than controls. Risk factors for the development of pneumonia include anemia, asthma and use of antepartum corticosteroids and tocolytic agents. Based on the few available studies, the main pathogens causing pneumonia are S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and viruses. β-Lactam and macrolide antibiotics therefore remain the antibiotics of choice in terms of both pathogen coverage and safety in pregnancy. In HIV-infected pregnant patients, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, but not Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), is more common than in nonpregnant patients. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) has not definitely been associated with adverse clinical outcomes despite theoretical risks. Currently it is still the treatment of choice in PCP, where mortality remains high. In conclusion, there are few data specifically related to pregnant women with different types of LRTI. Where data are available, no significant differences compared with nonpregnant patients have been identified. In considering the use of any therapeutic agent or investigation in pregnant patients with LRTI, safety aspects must be carefully weighed against potential benefit. Otherwise, management strategies should not differ from those for nonpregnant patients. Further research in this area is warranted.","Lim, Wei Shen; Macfarlane, John T.; Colthorpe, Charlotte L.",Am J Respir Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14720004/,386

615360,The Impact of Different Prophylactic Anticoagulation Doses on the Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19,2020-11-05,"COVID-19 testing across India uses a mix of two types of tests. Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are relatively inexpensive point-of-care lateral-flow-assay tests, but they are also less sensitive. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test has close to 100% sensitivity and specificity in a laboratory setting, but delays in returning results, as well as increased costs relative to RATs, may vitiate this advantage. India-wide, about 49% of COVID-19 tests are RATs, but some Indian states, including the large states of Uttar Pradesh (pop. 227.9 million) and Bihar (pop. 121.3 million) use a much higher proportion of such tests. Here we show, using simulations based on epidemiological network models, that the judicious use of RATs can yield epidemiological outcomes comparable to those obtained through RT-PCR-based testing and isolation of positives, provided a few conditions are met. These are (a) that RAT test sensitivity is not too low, (b) that a reasonably large fraction of the population, of order 0.5% per day, can be tested, (c) that those testing positive are isolated for a sufficient duration, and that (d) testing is accompanied by other non-pharmaceutical interventions for increased effectiveness. We assess optimal testing regimes, taking into account test sensitivity and specificity, background seroprevalence and current test pricing. We find, surprisingly, that even 100% RAT test regimes should be acceptable, from both an epidemiological as well as a economic standpoint, provided the conditions outlined above are met.","Cherian, Philip; Krishna, Sandeep; Menon, Gautam I.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292931/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009126,386

In the last few weeks, researchers' greatest efforts have been focusing mainly on the analysis of olfactory disorders, neglecting taste dysfunctions. According to our psychophysical evaluations, it can be inferred that the pathogenesis of taste disorders in COVID-19 patients is largely smell-independent. Moreover, isolated gustatory disorders are highly specific of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For these reasons, it is essential that gustatory dysfunctions, like olfactory disorders, are included in the COVID-19 guidelines.","Vaira, Luigi Angelo; Lechien, Jerome R.; Salzano, Giovanni; Salzano, Francesco Antonio; Maglitto, Fabio; Saussez, Sven; De Riu, Giacomo",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33014753/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-020-02182-4,386

615992,Social psychological theory and research on the novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) pandemic: Introduction to the rapid response special section,2020-07-09,"As cities grow in size and number of inhabitants, continuous monitoring of the environmental impact of sound sources becomes essential for the assessment of the urban acoustic environments. This requires the use of management systems that should be fed with large amounts of data captured by acoustic sensors, mostly remote nodes that belong to a wireless acoustic sensor network. These systems help city managers to conduct data-driven analysis and propose action plans in different areas of the city, for instance, to reduce citizens’ exposure to noise. In this paper, unsupervised learning techniques are applied to discover different behavior patterns, both time and space, of sound pressure levels captured by acoustic sensors and to cluster them allowing the identification of various urban acoustic environments. In this approach, the categorization of urban acoustic environments is based on a clustering algorithm using yearly acoustic indexes, such as [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and standard deviation of [Formula: see text]. Data collected over three years by a network of acoustic sensors deployed in the city of Barcelona, Spain, are used to train several clustering methods. Comparison between methods concludes that the k-means algorithm has the best performance for these data. After an analysis of several solutions, an optimal clustering of four groups of nodes is chosen. Geographical analysis of the clusters shows insights about the relation between nodes and areas of the city, detecting clusters that are close to urban roads, residential areas and leisure areas mostly. Moreover, temporal analysis of the clusters gives information about their stability. Using one-year size of the sliding window, changes in the membership of nodes in the clusters regarding tendency of the acoustic environments are discovered. In contrast, using one-month windowing, changes due to seasonality and special events, such as COVID-19 lockdown, are recognized. Finally, the sensor clusters obtained by the algorithm are compared with the areas defined in the strategic noise map, previously created by the Barcelona city council. The developed k-means model identified most of the locations found on the overcoming map and also discovered a new area.","Pita, Antonio; Rodriguez, Francisco J.; Navarro, Juan M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444020/,386

Removed lungs underwent histopathological evaluation. Gene expression profiling (GEP) for immune-related signatures was performed on lung specimens and SARS-CoV-2-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cytokine levels were measured on lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and in culture supernatants. Pathological assessment showed extensive lung damage with the pattern of proliferative to fibrotic phases, with diffuse alveolar damage mimicking usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Lungs’ GEP revealed overexpression of pathogen recognition receptors, effector cytokines and chemokines, immune activation receptors and of the inflammasome components. Multiplex cytokine analysis confirmed a proinflammatory state, with high levels of monocyte/macrophage chemotactic and activating factors and of IL-6 and TNF-α. A similar profile was observed in SARS-CoV-2-stimulated PBMCs collected 7 days after transplant. The pattern of tissue damage observed in the lungs suggests that this may represent the output of protracted disease, resembling a diffuse UIP-like picture. The molecular immune profiling supports the paradigm of a persistent proinflammatory state and sustained humoral immunity, conditions that are maintained despite the iatrogenic immunosuppression.","Croci, Giorgio A.; Vaira, Valentina; Trabattoni, Daria; Biasin, Mara; Valenti, Luca; Baselli, Guido; Barberis, Massimo; Guerini Rocco, Elena; Gregato, Giuliana; Scandroglio, Mara; Fominskiy, Evgeny; Palleschi, Alessandro; Rosso, Lorenzo; Nosotti, Mario; Clerici, Mario; Ferrero, Stefano",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33801959/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10030611,386

Here we report the safety and efficacy of ARTIVeda in adult COVID-19 patients with symptomatic mild-moderate COVID-19, who were treated in a randomized, open-label Phase IV study in Bangalore, Karnataka, India (Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/09/028044). ARTIVeda showed a very favorable safety profile, and the only ARTIVeda-related adverse events were transient mild rash and mild hypertension. Notably, ARTIVeda, when added to the SOC, accelerated the recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. While all patients were symptomatic at baseline (WHO score = 2-4), 31 of 39 (79.5%) of patients treated with ARTIVeda plus SOC became asymptomatic (WHO score = 1) by the end of the 5-day therapy, including 10 of 10 patients with severe dry cough 7 of 7 patients with severe fever. By comparison, 12 of 21 control patients (57.1%) treated with SOC alone became asymptomatic on day 5 (P=0.028, Fishers exact test). This clinical benefit was particularly evident when the treatment outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (WHO score = 4) treated with SOC alone versus SOC plus ARTIVeda were compared. The median time to becoming asymptomatic was only 5 days for the SOC plus ARTIVeda group (N=18) but 14 days for the SOC alone group (N=10) (P=0.004, Log-rank test). These data provide clinical proof of concept that targeting the TGF-b pathway with ARTIVeda may contribute to a faster recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 when administered early in the course of their disease.","Trieu, V.; Saund, S.; Rahate, P.; Barge, V.; Nalk, S.; Windlass, H.; Uckun, F.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.24.21250418; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.24.21250418v1?rss=1,386

Most efforts worldwide by the scientific community and commercial companies focus on the formulation of protocols for SARS-CoV-2 analysis in wastewater and approaches addressing the quantitative relationship between WBE and medical surveillance are lacking. In the present study, a mathematical model is developed which uses as input the number of daily positive medical tests together with the highly non-linear shedding rate curve of individuals to estimate the evolution of global virus shedding rate in wastewater along calendar days. A comprehensive parametric study by the model using as input actual medical surveillance and WBE data for the city of Thessaloniki (~700,000 inhabitants, North Greece) during the outbreak of November 2020 reveals the conditions under which WBE can be used as an early warning tool for predicting pandemic outbreaks. It is shown that early warning capacity is different along the days of an outbreak and depends strongly on the number of days apart between the day of maximum shedding rate of infected individuals in their disease cycle and the day of their medical testing. The present data indicate for Thessaloniki an average early warning capacity of around 2 days. Moreover, the data imply that there exists a proportion between unreported cases (asymptomatic persons with mild symptoms that do not seek medical advice) and reported cases. The proportion increases with the number of reported cases. The early detection capacity of WBE improves substantially in the presence of an increasing number of unreported cases. For Thessaloniki at the peak of the pandemic in mid-November 2020, the number of unreported cases reached a maximum around 4 times the number of reported cases.","Petala, M.; Kostoglou, M.; Karapantsios, Th.; Dovas, Ch.; Lytras, Th.; Paraskevis, D.; Roilides, E.; Koutsolioutsou-Benaki, A.; Panagiotakopoulos, G.; Sypsa, V.; Metallidis, S.; Papa, A.; Stylianidis, E.; Papadopoulos, A.; Tsiodras, S.; Papaioannou, N.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34627900/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150838; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721059167; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721059167?v=s5,386

The amount of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) in cells reflects the balance of synthesis, mediated by the PARP protein family, and degradation, which is catalyzed by a glycohydrolase, PARG. Many of the proteins mediating PAR metabolism possess specialised high affinity PAR-binding modules that allow the efficient sensing or processing of the PAR signal. The identification of four such PAR-binding modules and the characterization of a number of proteins utilising these elements during the last decade has provided important insights into how PAR regulates different cellular activities. The macrodomain represents a unique PAR-binding module which is, in some instances, known to possess enzymatic activity on ADP-ribose derivatives (in addition to PAR-binding). The most recently discovered example for this is the PARG protein, and several available PARG structures have provided an understanding into how the PARG macrodomain evolved into a major enzyme that maintains PAR homeostasis in living cells.","Žaja, Roko; Mikoč, Andreja; Barkauskaite, Eva; Ahel, Ivan",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970154/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom3010001,386

Soft law was used either as an instrument in and of itself, or as a justification for hard law instruments, with more than 200 non-binding measures being enacted by the state and by the Autonomous Communities. Spanish courts also used soft law as a tool to interpret existing hard law instruments, Such uses give rise to concerns about the transparency of administrative action and the principle of legal certainty. Moreover, the widespread use of soft law to justify the adoption of binding measures restricting fundamental rights might have consequences for democratic accountability and judicial control of executive action. This article indicates the need to reconsider the current system of constitutional and legal constraints attached to this form of regulation, by introducing some binding procedural rules relating to its adoption and its publication, and by clarifying its legal effects and the mechanism through which it can be enforced by courts.","UTRILLA FERNÁNDEZ-BERMEJO, Dolores",European journal of risk regulation : EJRR,https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2020.117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191957/,386

Society is positioning teachers, especially teachers of literacy, as the reason for poor student performance. In addition, negative media discourse around deficit initial teacher education, especially with regard to the teaching of reading and writing, is adding to the overall assumption that teachers of literacy are failing. This article highlights instances of teacher practice by literacy teachers during the global pandemic of COVID-19 which oppose the ‘problem teacher’ discourse. Snowball sampling was used to garner seven early years and primary school teachers for interviews, focussing on teacher perceptions of multimodal texts. A Foucaultian lens of governmentality and power and Fairclough’s approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) were used as lens and method of analysis. The findings of this study indicate that these participant teachers have been sophisticated practitioners in their planning and practice during the pandemic, despite the institutional barriers and extreme disruptions experienced. On reflection, therefore, the constructed societal discourse around ‘problem teachers’ needs to be reviewed and adjusted.","Downes, Lynn; Brosseuk, Deb",Aust Educ Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13384-021-00450-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025009/,386

In order to contain the spread of the pandemic and minimize its impact on economy, the tried-and-true control theory is utilized. Firstly, the control problem is clarified. Then, by combining advantages of the U-model control and the extended state observer (ESO), an extended state observer-based U-model control (ESOUC) is proposed to generate a population restriction policy. Closed-loop stability of the regulation system is also proved Two examples are considered, and numerical simulation results show that the ESOUC can suppress the COVID-19 faster than the linear active disturbance rejection control, which benefits controlling the infectious disease and the economic recovery.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Tertiary-care academic medical center in New York City PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Women undergoing OB/GYN ED consults or surgeries between February 1(st) to April 15(th). INTERVENTIONS: March 16th institutional moratorium on elective surgeries MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The volume and types of surgeries and ED consults were compared before and after the COVID-19 moratorium. During the pandemic, the average weekly volume of ED consults and GYN surgeries decreased, while OB surgeries remained stable. The proportions of OBGYN ED consults, GYN surgeries, and OB surgeries relative to all ED consults, all surgeries, and all labor and delivery patients were 1.87%, 13.8%, 54.6% in the pre-COVID timeframe (February 1(st) to March 15(th)) versus 1.53%, 21.3%, 79.7% in the COVID timeframe (March 16(th) to April 15(th)), representing no significant difference in proportions of OBGYN ED consults (p=0.464) and GYN surgeries (p=0.310) before and during COVID, with proportionate increase in OB surgeries (p<.002). The distribution of GYN surgical case types changed significantly during the pandemic with higher proportions of emergent surgeries for ectopics, miscarriages, and concern for cancer (p <.001). Alternatively, the OB surgery distribution of case types remained relatively constant. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how the pandemic has impacted the ways OB/GYN patients access and receive care. As expected, institutional policies suspending elective surgeries during the pandemic decreased GYN surgical volume and affected the types of cases performed. This decrease was not appreciated for OB surgical volume reflecting the non-elective and time-sensitive nature of obstetric care. A decrease in ED consults was noted during the pandemic begging the question “Where have all the emergencies gone?”. Although the moratorium on elective procedures was necessary, “elective” GYN surgeries remain medically indicated to address symptoms such as pain and bleeding and to prevent serious medical sequelae such as severe anemia requiring transfusion. As we continue to battle COVID-19, we must not lose sight of those patients whose care has been deferred.","Spurlin, Emily E.; Han, Esther S.; Silver, Elisabeth R; May, Benjamin L; Tatonetti, Nicholas P.; Ingram, Myles A.; Jin, Zhezhen; Hur, Chin; Advincula, Arnold P.; Hur, Hye-Chun",J Minim Invasive Gynecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248312/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1553465020311304?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2020.11.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1553465020311304,386

India had initiated a nationwide lockdown to combat the pandemic starting from the last week of March until the end of May 2020. But, the lockdown had continued subsequently in several red zones across parts of the country for few months. However, scientists have criticized the government’s abrupt lockdown since it prevented people from preparing for the worst aftermath. Besides, the curfews have blocked millions of impoverished migrant workers from leaving cities to return to their homes in distant rural villages. As a result, the destitute workers have endured enormous hardship and outright discrimination desolately leading to their added physical and mental distress, pain, suffering, and death. Most of the victims of the lockdown have belonged to the economically distressed lower social classes of the Indian caste hierarchy.

The literature reviewed reveals a pattern wherein African Americans are more likely to be misdiagnosed for all types of mental illness compared with other ethnicities due to fallacies perpetuated throughout the history of African Americans. In addition, the aggregation of current information and research on the current COVID-19 pandemic will justify future research on the epidemic of police brutality and shootings of unarmed African Americans.

Although most such infections are viral in origin, it is difficult to differentiate bacterial and viral infections, as the clinical symptoms are similar. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods allow testing for multiple pathogens simultaneously and are, therefore, gaining interest. This prospective case-control study was conducted from October 2013 to February 2014. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (throat) swabs were obtained from children admitted with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at a tertiary hospital. A control group of 40 asymptomatic children was included. Testing for 16 viruses was done by real-time multiplex PCR. Multiplex PCR detected a viral pathogen in 159/177 (89.9 %) patients admitted with SARI. There was a high rate of co-infection (46.9 %). Dual detections were observed in 64 (36.2 %), triple detections in 17 (9.6 %), and quadruple detections in 2 (1.1 %) of 177 samples. Seventy-eight patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, of whom 28 (35.8 %) had co-infection with multiple viruses. AdV, HBoV, HRV, HEV, and HCoV-OC43 were also detected among asymptomatic children. This study confirms the high rate of detection of viral nucleic acids by multiplex PCR among hospitalized children admitted with SARI, as well as the high rate of co-detection of multiple viruses. AdV, HBoV, HRV, HEV, and HCoV-OC43 were also detected in asymptomatic children, resulting in challenges in clinical interpretation.

We explored a method for deriving thresholds proposed in an influenza surveillance manual published by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODS: For 2002-2011, we analysed two routine influenza-like-illness (ILI) datasets, general practice sentinel surveillance and a locum medical service sentinel surveillance, plus laboratory data and hospital admissions for influenza. For each sentinel dataset, we created two composite variables from the product of weekly ILI data and the relevant laboratory data, indicating the proportion of tested specimens that were positive. For all datasets, including the composite datasets, we aligned data on the median week of peak influenza or ILI activity and assigned three threshold levels: seasonal threshold, determined by inspection; and two intensity thresholds termed average and alert thresholds, determined by calculations of means, medians, confidence intervals (CI) and percentiles. From the thresholds, we compared the seasonal onset, end and intensity across all datasets from 2002-2011. Correlation between datasets was assessed using the mean correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The median week of peak activity was week 34 for all datasets, except hospital data (week 35). Means and medians were comparable and the 90% upper CIs were similar to the 95(th) percentiles. Comparison of thresholds revealed variations in defining the start of a season but good agreement in describing the end and intensity of influenza seasons, except in hospital admissions data after the pandemic year of 2009. The composite variables improved the agreements between the ILI and other datasets. Datasets were well correlated, with mean correlation coefficients of >0.75 for a range of combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Thresholds for influenza surveillance are easily derived from historical surveillance and laboratory data using the approach proposed by WHO. Use of composite variables is helpful for describing influenza season characteristics.","Tay, Ee Laine; Grant, Kristina; Kirk, Martyn; Mounts, Anthony; Kelly, Heath",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24146973/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0077244,386

Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed. Given the situation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that “in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.” Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials. The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances. The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials. The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance. Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators.","Hao, Weixing; Parasch, Andrew; Williams, Stephen; Li, Jiayu; Ma, Hongyan; Burken, Joel; Wang, Yang",Int J Hyg Environ Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463920305289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917368/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463920305289,386

However, we understand very little about the effects of this pandemic on families of young children. We used a risk and resilience model to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on mental health in diverse caregivers (N = 286) with children ages birth to 5. We evaluated the hypotheses that (a) pandemic stress and caregiver-reported child psychosocial concerns correlate with caregivers’ mental health symptoms and (b) caregivers’ pandemic-related self-efficacy and coping mediate these relationships. Caregivers completed surveys in April–May 2020 assessing pandemic stress (e.g., health, finances, and housing), child psychosocial problems, coping strategies, and self-efficacy to manage family needs. Our primary outcome was caregivers’ self-reported changes in mental health symptoms since the outbreak. Path analysis revealed that higher pandemic stress was associated with caregivers’ reduced confidence in meeting their family’s needs related to COVID-19, which correlated with worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Greater child psychosocial problems also predicted worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Findings suggest that pandemic stress, child psychosocial problems, and caregiver self-efficacy are interrelated in their influence on caregivers’ mental health. While further research is needed to examine strategies to foster resilience and buffer the pandemic’s effects on caregiver mental health, this is a first step in evaluating the psychosocial effects of this pandemic in families of young children.

The article’s main finding is that the occupational structure appears to have gendered effects. While men tend to benefit from ethnic segregation, women face difficulties when looking for jobs with high shares of immigrant workers. Looking for jobs in occupations that recruit from relatively few educational backgrounds (credentials) is beneficial for both sexes at the outset unemployment, but among females this competitive advantage diminishes over time.

However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. METHODS: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. RESULTS: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human–animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation. CONCLUSIONS: This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.","Li, Hong-Ying; Zhu, Guang-Jian; Zhang, Yun-Zhi; Zhang, Li-Biao; Hagan, Emily A; Martinez, Stephanie; Chmura, Aleksei A; Francisco, Leilani; Tai, Hina; Miller, Maureen; Daszak, Peter",Int Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32040190/,386

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Methods: Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 received vaccine and 3 received placebo. Groups were distinguished by vaccine candidate, age of participant, and vaccine dose level. Interim safety and immunogenicity data of BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from US and German trials. We now present additional safety and immunogenicity data from the US Phase 1 trial that supported selection of the vaccine candidate advanced to a pivotal Phase 2/3 safety and efficacy evaluation. Results: In both younger and older adults, the 2 vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs), comparable to or higher than the GMT of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. BNT162b2 was associated with less systemic reactogenicity, particularly in older adults.

624528,"The effect of vascular risk factor burden on the severity of COVID-19 illness, a retrospective cohort study",2020-09-21,"Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) usually co-infect pigs in modern large-scale piggery, which both can cause severe diarrhea in newborn piglets and lead to significant economic losses to the pig industry. The VP7 protein is the main coat protein of PoRV, and the S protein is the main structural protein of PEDV, which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo. In this study, a DNA vaccine pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S co-expressing VP7 protein of PoRV and S protein of PEDV was constructed. Six 8-week-old mice were immunized with the recombinant plasmid pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S. The high humoral immune responses (virus specific antibody) and cellular immune responses (IFN-γ, IL-4, and spleen lymphocyte proliferation) were evaluated. The immune effect through intramuscular injection increased with plasmid dose when compared with subcutaneous injection. The immune-enhancing effect of IFN-α adjuvant was excellent compared with pig spleen transfer factor and IL-12 adjuvant. These results demonstrated that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S possess the immunological functions of the VP7 proteins of PoRV and S proteins of PEDV, indicating that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S is a candidate vaccine for porcine rotaviral infection (PoR) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED).","Yin, Yue; Zhu, Ling; Liu, Pengjuan; Zhao, Jun; Fan, Yi; Sun, Xiangang; Xu, Zhiwen",Brazilian Journal of Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30637649/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42770-018-0022-5; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42770-018-0022-5.pdf,386
625936,Biventricular Longitudinal Strain Predict Mortality in COVID-19 Patients,2021-01-18,"The COVID-19 pandemic likely exacerbated caregiving challenges for caregivers of parents diagnosed with a blood cancer. Providing care during a public health crisis presents a complex web of uncertainties regarding cancer care, personal health, and COVID-19 risk. Identifying caregivers’ uncertainty experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic can be a first step in learning where to direct resources or alter policies to ensure that they can not only perform their caregiver role but also cope in health-promoting ways. Using uncertainty management theory, this study explored how the pandemic has impacted adult child caregivers’ experiences caring for a parent diagnosed with a blood cancer, as well as their experiences of uncertainty and uncertainty management. As part of a larger study on blood cancer caregivers’ needs, a survey was administered from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to recruit caregivers through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. A qualitative and quantitative content analysis was conducted on open-ended responses from 84 caregivers. Caregivers described changes illustrating the complexity of providing care during a pandemic: (a) increased fears and uncertainty-related distress, b) reduced in-person care opportunities, (c) increased isolation, and (d) enhanced family communication. Caregivers with parents diagnosed with acute blood cancers used significantly more uncertainty management strategies and had more sources of uncertainty than caregivers with parents living with chronic blood cancer types. Findings highlight the need for supportive services to help caregivers manage uncertainty and improve their capacity to provide care in an unpredictable global health crisis. Such support may reduce poor psychosocial outcomes.","Fisher, Carla L; Wright, Kevin B; Hampton, Chelsea N; Vasquez, Taylor S; Kastrinos, Amanda; Applebaum, Allison J; Sae-Hau, Maria; Weiss, Elisa S; Lincoln, Greg; Bylund, Carma L",Transl Behav Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibab021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042962/,386

The outcome of infection with the influenza A virus is determined by a complex interplay of viral and host factors. With the ongoing threat of seasonal influenza and the potential emergence of new, more virulent strains of influenza viruses, we need to develop a better understanding of genetic variation in the human population and its association with severe outcomes from influenza infection. We propose a list of approximately 100 systems-based candidate genes for future study of the genetic basis of influenza disease and immunity in humans, based on evidence in the published literature for their potential role in the pathogenesis of this infection: binding of the virus to receptors on the host cell surface; cleavability of HA by host proteases; virus replication in host cells; destruction of host cells by apoptosis; state of immunocompetence of the individual host; and viral infections predisposing to bacterial infection.","Zhang, Lyna; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Gwinn, Marta; Dowling, Nicole F.; Khoury, Muin J.",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134809001798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647099/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134809001798; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2009.07.006,386

Hemodialysis patients who receive life-sustaining medical therapy in healthcare settings, face unique challenges as they need to be at a dialysis unit three or more times a week, where they are confined to specific settings and tended to by dialysis nurses and staff with physical interaction and in close proximity. Despite the importance and critical situation of the dialysis units, modelling studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spread in these settings are very limited. In this paper, we have used a combination of discrete event and agent-based simulation models, to study the operations of a typical large dialysis unit and generate contact matrices to examine outbreak scenarios. We present the details of the contact matrix generation process and demonstrate how the simulation calculates a micro-scale contact matrix comprising the number and duration of contacts at a micro-scale time step. We have used the contacts matrix in an agent-based model to predict disease transmission under different scenarios. The results show that micro-simulation can be used to estimate contact matrices, which can be used effectively for disease modelling in dialysis and similar settings.","Tofighi, M.; Asgary, A.; Merchant, A.

627501,No evidence of clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with oxygen requirement: results of a study using routinely collected data to emulate a target trial,2020-04-14,"BACKGROUND: Platelets are associated with HIV in the blood of infected individuals and might modulate viral dissemination, particularly if the virus is directly transmitted into the bloodstream. The C-type lectin DC-SIGN and the novel HIV attachment factor CLEC-2 are expressed by platelets and facilitate HIV transmission from platelets to T-cells. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms behind CLEC-2-mediated HIV-1 transmission. RESULTS: Binding studies with soluble proteins indicated that CLEC-2, in contrast to DC-SIGN, does not recognize the viral envelope protein, but a cellular factor expressed on kidney-derived 293T cells. Subsequent analyses revealed that the cellular mucin-like membranous glycoprotein podoplanin, a CLEC-2 ligand, was expressed on 293T cells and incorporated into virions released from these cells. Knock-down of podoplanin in 293T cells by shRNA showed that virion incorporation of podoplanin was required for efficient CLEC-2-dependent HIV-1 interactions with cell lines and platelets. Flow cytometry revealed no evidence for podoplanin expression on viable T-cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Podoplanin was also not detected on HIV-1 infected T-cells. However, apoptotic bystander cells in HIV-1 infected cultures reacted with anti-podoplanin antibodies, and similar results were obtained upon induction of apoptosis in a cell line and in PBMCs suggesting an unexpected link between apoptosis and podoplanin expression. Despite the absence of detectable podoplanin expression, HIV-1 produced in PBMC was transmitted to T-cells in a CLEC-2-dependent manner, indicating that T-cells might express an as yet unidentified CLEC-2 ligand. CONCLUSIONS: Virion incorporation of podoplanin mediates CLEC-2 interactions of HIV-1 derived from 293T cells, while incorporation of a different cellular factor seems to be responsible for CLEC-2-dependent capture of PBMC-derived viruses. Furthermore, evidence was obtained that podoplanin expression is connected to apoptosis, a finding that deserves further investigation.","Chaipan, Chawaree; Steffen, Imke; Tsegaye, Theodros Solomon; Bertram, Stephanie; Glowacka, Ilona; Kato, Yukinari; Schmökel, Jan; Münch, Jan; Simmons, Graham; Gerardy-Schahn, Rita; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Retrovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20482880/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-7-47,386

The disease has been associated with high mortality rate, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases. This could be attributed to dysregulated immune responses and severe systemic inflammation in COVID-19 patients. The use of effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and modulation of the immune responses could be a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.

The wisdom of crowds has been effective at forecasting in similar scenarios. We investigated whether the initial regional social media reaction to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in three critically affected countries has significant relations with their observed mortality a month later. We obtained COVID-19 related regionally geolocated tweets from Italian, Spanish, and United States regions. We quantified the predictive power of the wisdom of the crowds using correlations and regressions of geolocated Tweet Intensity (TI) during the initial social media attention peak versus the cumulative number of deaths a month ahead. We found that the intensity of initial COVID-19 related tweet attention at the beginning of the pandemic across Italian, Spanish, and United States regions is significantly related (p < 0.001) to the extent to which these regions had been affected by the pandemic a month later. This association is most striking in Italy as when at its peak of TI in late February 2020 only two of its regions had reported mortality. The collective wisdom of the crowds at early stages of the pandemic, when information on the number of infections was not broadly available, strikingly predicted the extent of mortality reflecting the regional severity of the pandemic almost a month later. Our findings could underpin the creation of real-time novelty detection systems aimed at early reporting of the severity of crises impacting a territory leading to early activation of control measures at a stage when available data is extremely limited.","Turiel, Jeremy; Fernandez-Reyes, Delmiro; Aste, Tomaso",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211001/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93042-w,386

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, wearing masks and hand disinfection are widely adopted hygiene practices. However, our study indicated that exposure to the vapors from alcohol-based sanitizers during hand disinfection might degrade the filtration performance of the in-use masks, and the degradation worsened with the increasing number of hand disinfection. After five times of hand disinfection, the filtration efficiencies of surgical masks decreased by >8% for 400 and 500nm particles and by 3.68{+/-}1.83% for 1m particles. This was attributed to the dissipation of electrostatic charges on the masks when exposed to the alcohol vapor generated during hand disinfection. Simple practice of vapor-avoiding hand disinfection could mitigate the effects of alcohol vapor, which was demonstrated on two brands of surgical masks. The vapor-avoiding hand disinfection is recommended to be included in the hygiene guide to maintain the mask performance.","He, W.; Guo, Y.; Liu, J.; Yue, Y.; Wang, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.01.20223982v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.01.20223982,386

In this paper, we review current literature on the effect of weather (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, etc.) and climate (temperature as an essential climate variable, solar radiation in the ultraviolet, sunshine duration) variables on SARS-CoV-2 and discuss their impact to the COVID-19 pandemic; the review also refers to respective effect of urban parameters and air pollution. Most studies suggest that a negative correlation exists between ambient temperature and humidity on the one hand and the number of COVID-19 cases on the other, while there have been studies which support the absence of any correlation or even a positive one. The urban environment and specifically the air ventilation rate, as well as air pollution, can probably affect, also, the transmission dynamics and the case fatality rate of COVID-19. Due to the inherent limitations in previously published studies, it remains unclear if the magnitude of the effect of temperature or humidity on COVID-19 is confounded by the public health measures implemented widely during the first pandemic wave. The effect of weather and climate variables, as suggested previously for other viruses, cannot be excluded, however, under the conditions of the first pandemic wave, it might be difficult to be uncovered. The increase in the number of cases observed during summertime in the Northern hemisphere, and especially in countries with high average ambient temperatures, demonstrates that in the absence of public health interventions, cannot mitigate the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks.","Paraskevis, D.; Kostaki, E.

The attitudes and experiences of psychotherapists with respect to online therapy (OT) have so far been generally poorly studied and particularly with a view to the situation during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine 1) the frequency of utilization of OT during the first lockdown, 2) the satisfaction with OT versus face-to-face therapy and 3) the technology acceptance experience overall and with respect to the guideline procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: German psychotherapists licensed and in training, cognitive-behavioral (CB 45.6%), analytic (AP 14%), depth-psychological (DP 34.5%), systemic (SYS 5.8%), were invited to participate in an online survey on demographic and therapeutic data, use of OT, satisfaction with OT vs. face-to-face therapy (Zufriedenheitsfragebogen für Therapeuten, ZUF-THERA) and technology acceptance (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 Questionnaire, UTAUT). RESULTS: The 174 participating psychotherapists (mean age = 44.73 years, SD ± 12.79; female 81.6%) reported that the average proportion of OT in the total therapeutic activity during the lockdown was 43.09%, with significant differences between guideline procedures (DP, CB > AP). The satisfaction with OT proved to be significantly lower than with face-to-face therapy and did not differ between the procedures. Prior experience with OT was reported by 23.6% of therapists overall and was higher among those working systemically compared to CB or AP therapists. Therapists working in CB experienced more enjoyment with OT than those working in DP and AP as well as perceived a stronger social influence (e.g. through colleagues) in the use of OT than therapists working in DP. CONCLUSION: The frequency of use of OT soared during the first lockdown (March–May 2020, 43% in comparison to the former limit covered by health insurances of 20%). In principle, therapists were highly satisfied with OT but significantly lower than with face-to-face therapy.

629272,Drug treatments affecting ACE2 in COVID-19 infection: a systematic review protocol,2020-07-15,"National evidence-based guidelines for preventing healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England were originally commissioned by the Department of Health and developed during 1998–2000 by a nurse-led multi-professional team of researchers and specialist clinicians. Following extensive consultation, they were first published in January 2001(1) and updated in 2007.(2) A cardinal feature of evidence-based guidelines is that they are subject to timely review in order that new research evidence and technological advances can be identified, appraised and, if shown to be effective for the prevention of HCAI, incorporated into amended guidelines. Periodically updating the evidence base and guideline recommendations is essential in order to maintain their validity and authority. The Department of Health commissioned a review of new evidence and we have updated the evidence base for making infection prevention and control recommendations. A critical assessment of the updated evidence indicated that the epic2 guidelines published in 2007 remain robust, relevant and appropriate, but some guideline recommendations required adjustments to enhance clarity and a number of new recommendations were required. These have been clearly identified in the text. In addition, the synopses of evidence underpinning the guideline recommendations have been updated. These guidelines (epic3) provide comprehensive recommendations for preventing HCAI in hospital and other acute care settings based on the best currently available evidence. National evidence-based guidelines are broad principles of best practice that need to be integrated into local practice guidelines and audited to reduce variation in practice and maintain patient safety. Clinically effective infection prevention and control practice is an essential feature of patient protection. By incorporating these guidelines into routine daily clinical practice, patient safety can be enhanced and the risk of patients acquiring an infection during episodes of health care in NHS hospitals in England can be minimised.","Loveday, H.P.; Wilson, J.A.; Pratt, R.J.; Golsorkhi, M.; Tingle, A.; Bak, A.; Browne, J.; Prieto, J.; Wilcox, M.",J Hosp Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24330862/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0195-6701(13)60012-2; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670113600122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670113600122,386

631478,Investigation of perfusion defects by Q-SPECT/CT in patients with mild-to-moderate course of COVID-19 and low clinical probability for pulmonary embolism,2021-06-25,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by massive inflammation of the arterial endothelium accompanied by vasoconstriction and widespread pulmonary micro thrombi. As a result, due to the destruction of nitric oxide ((•)NO) by inflammatory superoxide (O(2)(•−)), pulmonary (•)NO concentration ceases, resulting in uncontrolled platelet aggregation and massive thrombosis, which kills the patients. Introducing (•)NO by inhalation (INO) may replace the loss of endothelium-derived (•)NO. The first results from clinical trials with INO in SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rapid and sustained improvement in cardiopulmonary function and decreased inflammation. An ongoing phase III study is expected to confirm the method’s efficacy. INO may hence become a first line treatment in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, due to the rapid inactivation of (•)NO by deoxyhemoglobin to nitrate, pulmonary administration of (•)NO will not protect remote organs. Another INO-related pharmacological approach to protect SARS-CoV-2 patients from developing life-threatening disease is to inhibit the O(2)(•−)-driven destruction of (•)NO by neutralizing inflammatory O(2)(•−). By making use of low molecular weight compounds that mimic the action of the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The MnSOD mimetics of the so-called porphyrin type (e.g., AEOL 10150), salen type (e.g., EUK-8) and cyclic polyamine type (e.g., M40419, today known as GC4419 and avasopasem manganese) have all been shown to positively affect the inflammatory response in lung epithelial cells in preclinical models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Manganese diPyridoxyL EthylDiamine (MnPLED)-type mangafodipir (manganese dipyridoxyl diphosphate—MnDPDP), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that possesses MnSOD mimetic activity, has shown promising results in various forms of inflammation, in preclinical as well as clinical settings. Intravenously administration of mangafodipir will, in contrast to INO, reach remote organs and may hence become an important supplement to INO. From the authors’ viewpoint, it appears logical to test mangafodipr in COVID-19 patients at risk of developing life-threatening SARS-CoV-2.

632350,Mountain Rescue During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Considerations and Practical Implications,2020-09-23,"This paper discusses the measures adopted by the Italian government to face the COVID-19 emergency after the first wave in March/April 2020. This study places these measures in light of the massive reform process based on the “managerialism” of healthcare, which started in the 1990s. These reforms, which were inspired by the ideas of ‘New Public Management’, introduced managerialism, regionalization and quasi-markets to the Italian National Health System. As a result, dramatic changes have been made in public healthcare, and the responsibility for healthcare was decentralized to regions, introducing a multi-level governance structure. The COVID-19 emergency has drawn the results of this approach into question. With the enactment of new decrees, the central government directly intervened in the management of the health system by introducing specific measures aiming to increase the number of hospital beds and personnel, which w previously downsized. We describe the main content of the new measures adopted to face the COVID-19 emergency and discuss how key points of the managerialization process in Italy are being questioned as a result of these measures.

632543,A randomised cross-over study comparing ease of tracheal intubation with straight versus curved tracheal tubes,2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND: Surgical procedures play an increasing role among health technologies to treat diseases. Pain often accompanies such diseases, both as a result of their pathology, but also as the side-effect of the intervention itself, and it is not only a burdensome subjective feeling, but adversely affects the recovery process, can induce complications and increases treatment costs. Acute Pain Service Teams are becoming increasingly widespread in hospitals to address post-operative pain, yet we have so far no data on how many hospitals have actually adopted this technology in Hungary. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of our study were to assess the prevalence of Acute Pain Service Teams, map their structure and operation, as well as to understand the barriers and conducive factors of their establishment in Hungarian hospitals. METHODS: We carried out a survey among the 72 hospitals with surgical departments. The questionnaire was filled in by 52 providers, which gave us a response rate of 72.2%. RESULTS: Our results show, that only two of the responding hospitals have Acute Pain Service Teams albeit their structure and operation are in line with the literature. In the 50 hospitals without such teams, financing difficulties and human resources shortages are mentioned to be the most important obstacles of their establishment, but the lack of initiative and interest on the part of the specialities concerned are also an important barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Lagging behind the more affluent EU member states, but similarly to other Central and Eastern European countries, Acute Pain Service has been hardly adopted by Hungarian hospitals.

634370,"Epidemiological, imaging, laboratory, and clinical characteristics and factors related to mortality in patients with COVID-19: a single-center study",2021-05-26,"Coronavirus (CoV) infection is usually detected by cellular sensors, which trigger the activation of the innate immune system. Nevertheless, CoVs have evolved viral proteins that target different signaling pathways to counteract innate immune responses. Some CoV proteins act as antagonists of interferon (IFN) by inhibiting IFN production or signaling, aspects that are briefly addressed in this review. After CoV infection, potent cytokines relevant in controlling virus infections and priming adaptive immune responses are also generated. However, an uncontrolled induction of these proinflammatory cytokines can lead to pathogenesis and disease severity as described for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The cellular pathways mediated by interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and 7, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2/jun, activator protein (AP)-1, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), are the main drivers of the inflammatory response triggered after viral infections, with NF-κB pathway the most frequently activated. Key CoV proteins involved in the regulation of these pathways and the proinflammatory immune response are revisited in this manuscript. It has been shown that the envelope (E) protein plays a variable role in CoV morphogenesis, depending on the CoV genus, being absolutely essential in some cases (genus α CoVs such as TGEV, and genus β CoVs such as MERS-CoV), but not in others (genus β CoVs such as MHV or SARS-CoV). A comprehensive accumulation of data has shown that the relatively small E protein elicits a strong influence on the interaction of SARS-CoV with the host. In fact, after infection with viruses in which this protein has been deleted, increased cellular stress and unfolded protein responses, apoptosis, and augmented host immune responses were observed. In contrast, the presence of E protein activated a pathogenic inflammatory response that may cause death in animal models and in humans. The modification or deletion of different motifs within E protein, including the transmembrane domain that harbors an ion channel activity, small sequences within the middle region of the carboxy-terminus of E protein, and its most carboxy-terminal end, which contains a PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) is sufficient to attenuate the virus. Interestingly, a comprehensive collection of SARS-CoVs in which these motifs have been modified elicited full and long-term protection even in old mice, making those deletion mutants promising vaccine candidates. These data indicate that despite its small size, E protein drastically influences the replication of CoVs and their pathogenicity. Although E protein is not essential for CoV genome replication or subgenomic mRNA synthesis, it affects virus morphogenesis, budding, assembly, intracellular trafficking, and virulence. In fact, E protein is responsible in a significant proportion of the inflammasome activation and the associated inflammation elicited by SARS-CoV in the lung parenchyma. This exacerbated inflammation causes edema accumulation leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and, frequently, to the death of infected animal models or human patients.","DeDiego, Marta L.; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Castaño-Rodriguez, Carlos; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Usera, Fernando; Enjuanes, Luis",Virus Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25093995/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003025,386

The mechanisms of HSV-1 infection and HSV-1’s interactions with various host cells have been studied and reviewed extensively. Type I interferons were secreted by host cells upon HSV infection and play a vital role in controlling virus proliferation. A few studies, however, have focused on HSV-1 infection without the presence of interferon (IFN) signaling. In this study, HEK 293T cells with low toll-like receptor (TLR) and stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING) expression were infected with HSV-1 and subjected to a quantitative proteomic analysis. By using a subcellular fractionation strategy and high-performance mass spectrometry, a total of 6607 host proteins were quantified, of which 498 proteins were differentially regulated. A bioinformatics analysis indicated that multiple signaling pathways might be involved in HSV-1 infection. A further functional study indicated the role of Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 2 (CHCHD2), and Tripartite motif-containing protein 27 (TRIM27) in inhibiting viral DNA replication and proliferation.

The French Red Cross (FRC) is prominent among organisations offering health and support services in the current crisis. Comprised primarily of lay volunteers and some trained health workers, FRC volunteers in the Paris (France) region have faced challenges in adapting to pandemic conditions, working with sick and vulnerable populations, managing limited resources and coping with high demand for their services. Existing studies of volunteers focus on individual, social and organisational determinants of motivation, but attend less to contextual ones. Public health incertitude about the COVID-19 pandemic is an important feature of this pandemic. Whether and how uncertainty interacts with volunteer understandings and experiences of their work and organisational relations to contribute to Red Cross worker motivation is the focus of this investigation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This mixed-methods study will investigate volunteer motivation using ethnographic methods and social network listening. Semi-structured interviews and observations will illuminate FRC volunteer work relations, experiences and concerns during the pandemic. A questionnaire targeting a sample of Paris region volunteers will allow quantification of motivation. These findings will iteratively shape and be influenced by a social media (Twitter) analysis of biomedical and public health uncertainties and debates around COVID-19. These tweets provide insight into a French lay public’s interpretations of these debates. We evaluate whether and how socio-political conditions and discourses concerning COVID-19 interact with volunteer experiences, working conditions and organisational relations to influence volunteer motivation. Data collection began on 15 June 2020 and will continue until 15 April 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has received ethical approval from the Institut Pasteur Institutional Review Board (no 2020-03).

Methods We conducted an open label prospective study in both male and female patients aged 18 to 72 years with suspected mild COVID 19 who were sequentially enrolled in the study. The clinical diagnosis was performed in accordance with the WHO recommendations based on the acute onset of such symptoms as olfactory dysfunction, hyperthermia, myalgia, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, cough, rhinolalia, sore throat, without pneumonia or hypoxia in persons in contact with a confirmed case of COVID 19. The physician assessed clinical symptoms using a 4-point scale. The patient self-assessed clinical symptoms using a ten point visual analogue scale (VAS). All enrolled patients underwent laboratory testing to confirm the diagnosis of COVID 19. Results Of the 120 patients underwent testing, the diagnosis of mild COVID 19 was confirmed in 96 patients and ruled out in 24 patients. When assessing symptoms by a physician according to the correlation analysis, hyperthermia, myalgia, nasal congestion and rhinolalia have a positive predictive value with a significance level of more than 0.6. When self-assessing symptoms by a patient, fever, myalgia and nasal congestion have a diagnostic accuracy with a significance level of more than 0.5. Nasal discharge, cough and sore throat have negative predictive values. Discussion The presence of these symptoms in patients with an acute onset of the disease can help to make a clinical diagnosis of coronavirus disease and identify target groups for self-isolation and outpatient treatment without additional testing.

Herein we compare the immunopathology of lung tissue procured at autopsy in patients dying of SARS-CoV-2 with those dying of DAD prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Autopsy gross and microscopic features stratified by duration of illness in twelve patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA as well as seven patients dying of DAD prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated with multiplex (5-plex: CD4, CD8, CD68, CD20, AE1/AE3) and SARS-CoV immunohistochemistry to characterize the immunopathologic stages of DAD. RESULTS: We observed a distinctive pseudopalisaded histiocytic hyperplasia interposed between the exudative and proliferative phase of COVID-19 associated DAD which was most pronounced at the fourth week from symptom onset. Pulmonary macrothrombi were seen predominantly in cases with pseudopalisaded histiocytic hyperplasia and/or proliferative phase DAD. Neither pseudopalisaded histiocytic hyperplasia nor pulmonary macrothrombi were seen in non-COVID-19 DAD cases, whereas microthrombi were common in DAD regardless of etiology. CONCLUSION: The inflammatory pattern of pseudopalisaded histiocytic hyperplasia may represent the distinctive immunopathology associated with the dexamethasone responsive form of DAD seen in severe COVID-19.","Kritselis, Michael; Yambayev, Ilyas; Prilutskiy, Andrey; Shevtsov, Artem; Vadlamudi, Charitha; Zheng, Hanqiao; Elsadwai, Murad; Ma, Lina; Aniskovich, Emily; Kataria, Yachana; Higgins, Sara; Sarita-Reyes, Carmen; Zuo, Tao; Zhao, Qing; Quillen, Karen; Burks, Eric J.",Hum Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273395/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0046817721001222; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humpath.2021.06.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0046817721001222?v=s5,386

METHODS: The Negative Pressure Face Shield (NPFS) was previously reported as well tolerated with initial use on 30 patients. Diagnostic transnasal laryngoscopy was performed on an additional 108 consecutive patients who were evaluated by questionnaires and sequential pulse oximetry. Further study addressed operative transnasal potassium‐titanyl‐phosphate (KTP) laser laryngoscopy with biopsy done on four patients employing the NPFS. RESULTS: The previously described NPFS version 3 (v.3), a transparent acrylic barrier with two anterior instrumentation ports, was modified by repositioning the side suction port closer to the level of the nose and deepening the lateral sides, squaring off the lower projection. A post‐procedure questionnaire employing a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from no symptoms (rating of 1) to intolerable (rating of 5) identified excellent patient tolerance of the new design (v.4), among 22 patients evaluated and similar in the comparison to the 116 patients using version 3. Among the 138 patients analyzed, only one patient rated the experience as greater than “mild claustrophobia.” 100% of patients answered either “none” or “mild” to the pain and shortness of breath questions. The NPFS (v.4) was then successfully used in four patients for laser laryngoscopy with biopsy of laryngeal papilloma (3/4) and hemorrhagic polyp (1/4). Post‐procedure questionnaire identified no shortness of breath (4/4), no claustrophobia (4/4), no pain (4/4) and no significant changes in pulse oximetry during use.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, LUS has been used not only to help identify possible COVID-19 infection, but also to help prognosticate and risk stratify patients with known, or highly suspicious for, COVID-19 infection 24. Study Objective: To determine if point-of-care LUS can be used to risk stratify patients presenting under suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Methods: 118 patients were scanned using 8-point LUS score method looking at 4 lung fields on each side in order to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of LUS in COVID-19 patients. Scores were assigned to each field based on presence of B-lines, pleural abnormalities, and subpleural consolidations. All lung ultrasounds were performed in the emergency department on persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 respiratory infections. Result: There is a clear trend of increasing mean total LUS score with increasing severity of illness. The increasing severity was defined in ascending order as patients discharged, admitted to floor, admitted to ICU, and death in hospital. The mean total LUS score for each was: discharged (5.18 ±1.47 [95% CI 3.71-6.65]), admitted to floor (9.82 ± 1.57 [95% CI 8.25-11.4]), admitted to ICU (10.83 ± 1.99 [95% CI 8.84-12.8] ), and death in hospital (13.14 ± 4.64 [95% CI 8.5-17.8]). One of the deaths was a patient with a means total LUS score of 3 who was placed on comfort care and then terminally extubated in the setting of metastatic lung disease. If this patient is removed, the mean LUS score associated with death in hospital is 14.83 ± 3.83 [95% CI 11-18.7]. Overall, patient’s that tested positive for COVID-19 had a higher mean LUS score (8.71 ± 1.3 [95% CI 7.41-10) than those that tested negative (7.24 ± 1.86 [95% CI 5.38-9.1). A SpO2 greater than or equal to 90% was associated with a lower average LUS score (7.76 ± 1.24 [95% CI 6.52-9), than an SpO2 less than 90% (12.24 ± 2.24 [95% CI 10-14.5). Patient’s requiring high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, or intubation had a mean LUS score of 12.75 ± 2.05 [95% CI 10.7-14.8], while those who only required nasal cannula or no supplemental oxygen had mean LUS score of 8.76 ± 1.5 [95% CI 7.26-10.3]. Conclusion: Our results show that by using an 8 zone lung ultrasound protocol not only are we able to identify those patients more likely to test positive for COVID, but also to risk stratify those patients under suspicion of a COVID infection.","Joseph, R.; Nesemann, S.; Kadri, N.; Pham, T.; Kendrick, Z.; Solis-McCarthy, J.; Roka, A.; Sisson, C.; Foster, M.; Gelabert, C.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064421006314; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064421006314; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.072,386

Although curcumin, hesperidin, and quercetin have broad spectra of pharmacological properties, their antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Our study aimed to assess the in vitro antiviral activities of curcumin, hesperidin, and quercetin against SARS-CoV-2 compared to hydroxychloroquine and determine their mode of action. In Vero E6 cells, these compounds significantly inhibited virus replication, mainly as virucidal agents primarily indicating their potential activity at the early stage of viral infection. To investigate the mechanism of action of the tested compounds, molecular docking studies were carried out against both SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and main protease (Mpro) receptors. Collectively, the obtained in silico and in vitro findings suggest that the compounds could be promising SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. We recommend further preclinical and clinical studies on the studied compounds to find a potential therapeutic targeting COVID-19 in the near future.","Kandeil, Ahmed; Mostafa, Ahmed; Kutkat, Omnia; Moatasim, Yassmin; Al-Karmalawy, Ahmed A.; Rashad, Adel A.; Kayed, Ahmed E.; Kayed, Azza E.; El-Shesheny, Rabeh; Kayali, Ghazi; Ali, Mohamed A.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203977/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10060758,386

OBJECTIVE: In this trial we set out to determine the efficacy of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. MEASUREMENTS: Patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR test irrespective of disease severity were hospitalised and randomised to receive either COVID-19 CCP plus standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone. The primary outcome was time to viral clearance, defined as having two consecutive RT-PCR-negative tests by day 28. Secondary outcomes included time to symptom resolution, clinical status on the modified WHO Ordinal Clinical Scale (≥1-point increase), progression to severe/critical condition (defined as oxygen saturation <93% or needing oxygen), mortality and safety. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 136 patients were randomised, 69 to CCP+SOC and 67 to SOC only. The median age was 50 years (IQR: 38.5–62.0), 71.3% were male and the median duration of symptom was 7 days (IQR=4–8). Time to viral clearance was not different between the CCP+SOC and SOC arms (median of 6 days (IQR=4–11) vs 4 (IQR=4–6), p=0.196). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes in CCP+SOC versus SOC: time to symptom resolution (median=7 (IQR=5–7) vs 7 (IQR=5–10) days, p=0.450), disease progression (9 (22.0%) vs 7 (24.0%) patients, p=0.830) and mortality (10 (14.5%) vs 8 (11.9%) deaths, p=0.476). CONCLUSION: In this African trial, CCP therapy did not result in beneficial virological or clinical improvements. Further trials are needed to determine subgroups of patients who may benefit from CCP in Africa.

Vaccine development focuses on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated, encoding around 66–87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Here, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which were absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Overall, our data reveal how organisation of glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the protein surface.","Watanabe, Yasunori; Berndsen, Zachary T.; Raghwani, Jayna; Seabright, Gemma E.; Allen, Joel D.; Pybus, Oliver G.; McLellan, Jason S.; Wilson, Ian A.; Bowden, Thomas A.; Ward, Andrew B.; Crispin, Max",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461612/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16567-0,386

India mortality rate with a population of 1.3 billion people is relatively lowest to other countries with high infection rates. Genetic composition of circulating isolates continues to be a key determinant of virulence and pathogenesis. This study aimed to analyse the extent of divergence between genomes of Indian isolates (n=2525 as compared to reference Wuhan-1 strain and isolates from countries showing higher fatality rates including France, Italy, Belgium, and the USA. The study also analyses the impact of key mutations on interactions with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Using 1,44,605 spike protein sequences, global prevalence of mutations in spike protein was observed. The study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India share consensus with global trends with respect to D614G as most prevalent mutational event (81.66% among 2525 Indian isolates). Indian isolates did not reported prevalence of N439K mutation in receptor binding motif (RBM) as compared to global isolates (0.54%). Computational docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis of N439K mutation with respect to ACE 2 binding and reactivity with RBM targeted antibodies viz., B38, BD23, CB6, P2B-F26 and EY6A suggests that variant have relatively higher affinity with ACE 2 receptor which may support higher infectivity. The study warrants large scale monitoring of Indian isolates as SARS-CoV-2 virus is expected to evolve and mutations may appear in unpredictable way.","Alai, Shweta; Gujar, Nidhi; Joshi, Manali; Gautam, Manish; Gairola, Sunil",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758785/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021006678?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021006678,386

644741,Changes in percutaneous coronary intervention practice in Japan during the COVID‐19 outbreak: LIFE Study,2021-03-11,"Background: Due to the ban on classroom teaching during the pandemic, the Munich “Anamnesegruppen” had to be switched to e-learning at short notice. There were no established concepts for this, which is why digitalization was piloted and evaluated for feasibility. Student “Anamnesegruppen”: “Anamnesegruppen” have existed for over 50 years and are organized as independent student peer teaching. In small groups of medical and psychology students, interviews with patients are conducted once a week during the semester. This is followed by a feedback and discussion round, in which ethical and professional questions are discussed in addition to the patient's medical history. The goal is to train the participants' ability to communicate and reflect. Adaptation to digital methods: The anamnesis seminars have been moved to a virtual group room using video conference. Patients were mainly recruited from the participants' circle of acquaintances. The group size was set at eight people each in four groups and supervised by a pair of student tutors. Confidentiality and data protection declarations were obtained in writing. Results: By switching to digital anamnesis groups, all four groups were successfully completed. Both the final supervision of the tutors and the electronic evaluation of the participants yielded positive feedback. Compared to the two previous evaluations of the semesters in classroom sessions, there were no significant differences in the evaluation. Discussion: The continuously good evaluation results, which did not differ between the digital format and the classroom course of the previous semesters, show that an ad hoc conversion to digital teaching is possible. We want to stress the fact that elements reflecting the doctor-patient relationship were successfully preserved. For the similarly structured Balint groups, virtual sessions may also be considered. Further research, especially prospective, is desirable in order to better understand the possibilities of digital teaching in this area.","Kunisch, Raphael; Zimmermann, Peter; Berges, Natalie; Nitzschke, Malte; Schweiger, Felix; Seidl, Mira; Weidenbusch, Marc",GMS J Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659609/,386

Neuromechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism via our established non-human primate model of COVID-19. In rhesus monkey, SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS primarily via the olfactory bulb. Thereafter, viruses rapidly spread to functional areas of the central nervous system, such as hippocampus, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 induces the inflammation possibly by targeting neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 infects neuro-derived SK-N-SH, glial-derived U251, and brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion in the NHP model, which provides important insights into the CNS-related pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Jiao, Li; Yang, Yun; Yu, Wenhai; Zhao, Yuan; Long, Haiting; Gao, Jiahong; Ding, Kaiyun; Ma, Chunxia; Li, Jingmei; Zhao, Siwen; Wang, Haixuan; Li, Haiyan; Yang, Mengli; Xu, Jingwen; Wang, Junbin; Yang, Jing; Kuang, Dexuan; Luo, Fangyu; Qian, Xingli; Xu, Longjiang; Yin, Bin; Liu, Wei; Liu, Hongqi; Lu, Shuaiyao; Peng, Xiaozhong",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00591-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895780/,386

While numerous publications deal with the design and the optimization of corresponding upstream processes, one-to-one comparisons of these cell lines under comparable cultivation conditions have largely been neglected. Therefore, a direct comparison of influenza virus production with adherent MDCK and Vero cells in T-flasks, roller bottles, and lab-scale bioreactors was performed in this study. First, virus seeds had to be adapted to Vero cells by multiple passages. Glycan analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein showed that for influenza A/PR/8/34 H1N1, three passages were sufficient to achieve a stable new N-glycan fingerprint, higher yields, and a faster increase to maximum HA titers. Compared to MDCK cells, virus production in serum-free medium with Vero cells was highly sensitive to trypsin concentration. Virus stability at 37 °C for different virus strains showed differences depending on medium, virus strain, and cell line. After careful adjustment of corresponding parameters, comparable productivity was obtained with both host cell lines in small-scale cultivation systems. However, using these cultivation conditions in lab-scale bioreactors (stirred tank, wave bioreactor) resulted in lower productivities for Vero cells.","Genzel, Yvonne; Dietzsch, Christian; Rapp, Erdmann; Schwarzer, Jana; Reichl, Udo",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617311/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2742-9,386

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected the clinical data of 20 patients with rGBM. All patients received anlotinib (12 mg daily, orally for 2 weeks, discontinued for 1 week, repeated every 3 weeks) combined with dose-dense TMZ (100 mg/m(2), 7 days on with 7 days off) until the disease progressed (PD) or adverse effects (AEs) above grade 4 appeared. Grade 3 AEs need to be restored to grade 2 before continuing treatment, and the daily dose of anlotinib is reduced to 10 mg. The patients were reexamined by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 1 to 3 months. The therapeutic effect was evaluated according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. The survival rate was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. The baseline of all survival index statistics was the start of anlotinib combined with dose-dense of TMZ. National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE 4.0) was used to evaluate AEs. RESULTS: Twenty cases of rGBM were evaluated according to the RANO criteria after treatment with anlotinib and dose-dense TMZ, including five cases of stable disease (SD), thirteen cases of partial response (PR), one case of complete response (CR), and one case of PD. The median follow-up time was 13.4 (95% CI, 10.5–16.3) months. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 47.7%. The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 55%. In the IDH wild type group, the median PFS and median OS were 6.1 and 11.9 months, respectively. We observed that AEs associated with treatment were tolerable. One patient stopped taking the drug because of cerebral infarction. There were no treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSION: Anlotinib combined with dose-dense TMZ for the first-line therapy showed good efficacy in OS, PFS, ORR, and DCR in the treatment of rGBM, and the AEs were tolerant.

CLOCC are among the recently described neurological associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case of CLOCC in a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented with auditory hallucinations and rapidly developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old man with no past medical and psychiatric history presented with auditory hallucinations, restlessness, and suicidal ideations. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive for SARS-CoV-2. A brain MRI revealed an isolated oval-shaped lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, suggestive of CLOCC. After a dramatic hospital course associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and severe intra-abdominal and cerebral bleeding, he developed cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 15. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need for increased vigilance for the atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it suggests that CLOCC can be considered as a differential diagnosis by clinicians in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with unexplained neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, leading to poor outcome.","Elkhaled, Walid; Ben Abid, Fatma; Akhtar, Naveed; Abukamar, Mohamed R.; Ibrahim, Wanis H.",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315854/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.928798,386

We hypothesized that immunostimulation by unmodified siRNA could mediate both RNAi as well as innate immune stimulation depending on the mode of drug delivery. We investigated the potential of immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs) to suppress influenza A virus in vivo in the mouse lung. Lipidoid 98N12-5(1) formulated with unmodified siRNA targeting the influenza nucleoprotein gene exhibited antiviral activity. Formulations were optimized to increase antiviral activity, but the antiviral activity of lipidoid-delivered siRNA did not depend on sequence homology to the influenza genome as siRNA directed against unrelated targets also suppressed influenza replication in vivo. This activity was primarily attributed to enhancement of innate immune stimulation by lipidoid-mediated delivery, which indicates increased toll-like receptor (TLR) activation by siRNA. Certain chemical modifications to the siRNA backbone, which block TLR7/8 activation but retain in vitro RNAi activity, prevented siRNA-mediated antiviral activity despite enhanced lipidoid-mediated delivery. Here, we demonstrate that innate immune activation caused by unmodified siRNA can have therapeutically relevant effects, and that these non-RNAi effects can be controlled through chemical modifications and drug delivery.","Nguyen, David N.; Chen, Steve C-Y; Lu, James; Goldberg, Michael; Kim, Phillip; Sprague, Andrew; Novobrantseva, Tatiana; Sherman, Jennifer; Shulga-Morskaya, Svetlana; de Fougerolles, Antonin; Chen, Jianzhu; Langer, Robert; Anderson, Daniel G",Molecular Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19584813/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616321141; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616321141; https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2009.147,386

The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in the Palestinian population residing in the West Bank. SETTING: The study involved 1355 participants from 11 governorates, including 112 localities in the West Bank and 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: Blood samples were collected between 15th June 2020 and 30th June 2020 from 1355 individuals from randomly selected households in the West Bank, in addition to 1136 individuals visiting Palestinian medical laboratories between the 1st May 2020 and 9th July 2020 for a routine check-up. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Out of the 2491 blood samples collected, serological tests for 2455 adequate serum samples were done using an immunoassay for qualitative detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Seroprevalence was estimated as the proportion of individuals who had a positive result in the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the immunoassay. RESULTS: The random sample of Palestinians living in the West Bank yielded 0% seroprevalence with 95% and an adjusted CI (0% to 0.0043%), while the lab referral samples yielded an estimated seroprevalence of 0.354% with 95% and an adjusted CI (0.001325% to 0.011566%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that as of mid-June 2020, seroprevalence in Palestine persists low and is inadequate to provide herd immunity, emphasising the need to maintain health measures to keep the outbreak under control. Population-based seroprevalence studies are to be conducted periodically to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Palestine and inform policymakers about the efficacy of their surveillance system.","Qutob, Nouar; Awartani, Faisal; Salah, Zaidoun; Asia, Mohammad; Abu Khader, Imad; Herzallah, Khaled; Balqis, Nadeen; Sallam, Husam",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542045/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044552,386
650569,Absolute lymphocyte count is a prognostic marker in Covid‐19: A retrospective cohort review,2020-07-10,"Public health organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are increasingly recommending the use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) in health care settings. For infection control purposes, the usual practice is to discard FFRs after close contact with a patient (“single use”). However, in some situations, such as during contact with tuberculosis patients, limited FFR reuse (i.e., repeated donning and doffing of the same FFR by the same person) is practiced. A related practice, extended use, involves wearing the same FFR for multiple patient encounters without doffing. Extended use and limited FFR reuse have been recommended during infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics to conserve FFR supplies. This commentary examines CDC recommendations related to FFR extended use and limited reuse and analyzes available data from the literature to provide a relative estimate of the risks of these practices compared to single use. Analysis of the available data and the use of disease transmission models indicate that decisions regarding whether FFR extended use or reuse should be recommended should continue to be pathogen- and event-specific. Factors to be included in developing the recommendations are the potential for the pathogen to spread via contact transmission, the potential that the event could result in or is currently causing a FFR shortage, the protection provided by FFR use, human factors, potential for self-inoculation, the potential for secondary exposures, and government policies and regulations. While recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for extended use and limited reuse in certain situations, some new cautions and limitations should be considered before issuing recommendations in the future. In general, extended use of FFRs is preferred over limited FFR reuse. Limited FFR reuse would allow the user a brief respite from extended wear times, but increases the risk of self-inoculation and preliminary data from one study suggest that some FFR models may begin to lose effectiveness after multiple donnings.","Fisher, Edward M.; Shaffer, Ronald E.",Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24628658/; https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2014.902954; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4610368?pdf=render,386
650746,Development and validation of a knowledge-driven risk calculator for critical illness in COVID-19 patients,2020-09-23,"2020. An infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (CoV) known as SARS-C0V-2, identified in China at the end of 2019, is affecting the entire world. This type of infection is common in both animals and humans, and coronaviruses are sometimes zoonotic, i.e. transmissible between animals and humans. The OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) thus reports that MERS-CoV (at the origin of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012) was transmitted from dromedary camels to man, whilst the transmission to man of the SARS-CoV coronavirus (which affected several Asian countries in 2003 and triggered a global alert from the WHO) involved bats and civets. For several years now, we have known that nearly 75% of emerging infectious diseases are of zoonotic origin and several experts now believe that the emergence of new diseases at the human-animal interface will be recurrent in years to come: ecosystems are undergoing profound changes due to global warming, damage to biodiversity· or the development of industrial livestock farming, that favor the emergence and spread of pathogens through the density, confinement or circulation of animals.","Bonnaud, Laure; Fortané, Nicolas",Rev Agric Food Environ Stud,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41130-021-00141-3,386

Currently available commercial serology assays lack the ability to specifically identify nAbs. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based nAb assay (GenScript cPass neutralization antibody assay) has recently received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. OBJECTIVE.­: To evaluate the performance characteristics of this assay and compare and correlate it with the commercial assays that detect SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG). DESIGN.­: Specimens from SARS-COV-2 infected patients (n = 124), healthy donors obtained prepandemic (n = 100), and patients with non-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory infections (n = 92) were analyzed using this assay. Samples with residual volume were also tested on 3 commercial serology platforms (Abbott, Euroimmun, Siemens). Twenty-eight randomly selected specimens from patients with COVID-19 and 10 healthy controls were subjected to a plaque reduction neutralization test. RESULTS.­: The cPass assay exhibited 96.1% (95% CI, 94.9%-97.3%) sensitivity (at >14 days post-positive PCR), 100% (95% CI, 98.0%-100.0%) specificity, and zero cross-reactivity for the presence of non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. When compared with the plaque reduction assay, 97.4% (95% CI, 96.2%-98.5%) qualitative agreement and a positive correlation (R2 = 0.76) was observed. Comparison of IgG signals from each of the commercial assays with the nAb results from plaque reduction neutralization test/cPass assays displayed greater than 94.7% qualitative agreement and correlations with R2 = 0.43/0.68 (Abbott), R2 = 0.57/0.85 (Euroimmun), and R2 = 0.39/0.63 (Siemens), respectively. CONCLUSIONS.­: The combined data support the use of cPass assay for accurate detection of the nAb response. Positive IgG results from commercial assays associated reasonably with nAbs presence and can serve as a substitute.","Nandakumar, Vijayalakshmi; Profaizer, Tracie; Lozier, Bucky K; Elgort, Marc G; Larragoite, Erin T; Williams, Elizabeth S C P; Solis-Leal, Antonio; Lopez, J Brandon; Berges, Bradford K; Planelles, Vicente; Rychert, Jenna; Slev, Patricia R; Delgado, Julio C",Arch Pathol Lab Med,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2021-0213-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181714/,386

The goal of this paper is to test the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, considering less common measures of environmental burden. For that, four different estimations are done, one considering total GHG emissions, and three more taking into account, individually, the three main GHG gases—carbon dioxide (CO(2)), nitrous oxide (N(2)O), and methane gas (CH(4))—considering the oldest and most recent economies adhering to the EU27 (the EU 15 (Old Europe) and the EU 12 (New Europe)) separately. Using panel dynamic fixed effects (DFE), dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) techniques, we validate the existence of a U-shaped relationship for all emission proxies considered, and groups of countries in the short-run. Some evidence of this effect also exists in the long-run. However, we were only able to validate the EKC hypothesis for the short-run in EU 12 under DOLS and the short and long-run using FMOLS. Confirmed is the fact that results are sensitive to models and measures adopted. Externalization of problems globally takes a longer period for national policies to correct, turning global measures harder and local environmental proxies more suitable to deeply explore the EKC hypothesis.","Madaleno, Mara; Moutinho, Victor",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809113/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062907,386

Facebook’s Prophet was used to fit time series models based on observations for the previous 120 months, and to predict trends over the next 36 months. RESULTS: The number of hospitalized patients per month has declined rapidly since 2015, but the monthly number of outpatient visits has steadily increased. Monthly hospital utilization has increased in patients aged ≤29 and ≥50 years, but has declined rapidly since 2014–2015 in patients in their 30s and 40s. The upward trend in overall hospital utilization has slowed considerably in recent years. These trends are expected to continue over the next few years. CONCLUSION: This study revealed some notable changes in the hospital utilization patterns of patients with schizophrenia in recent years.

In order to estimate the duration of immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 it is important to understand for how long antibodies persist after infection in humans. Here, we assessed the persistence of serum antibodies following wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection at 8 and 13 months after diagnosis in 367 individuals. The SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobulin G (S-IgG) and nucleoprotein IgG (N-IgG) concentrations and the proportion of subjects with neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were assessed. Moreover, the NAb titers among a smaller subset of participants (n = 78) against a wild-type virus (B) and variants of concern (VOCs): Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) were determined. We found that NAb against the wild-type virus persisted in 89% and S-IgG in 97% of subjects for at least 13 months after infection. Only 36% had N-IgG by 13 months. The mean S-IgG concentrations declined from 8 to 13 months by less than one third; N-IgG concentrations declined by two thirds. Subjects with severe infection had markedly higher IgG and NAb levels and are expected to remain seropositive for longer. Significantly lower NAb titers against the variants compared to the wild-type virus, especially after a mild disease, suggests reduced protection against VOCs. This article is protected by copyright.

Neurologic syndromes were actively searched by a standardized structured questionnaire and physical examination, confirmed by neuroimaging, neurophysiology of laboratory analyses, as applicable. RESULTS: We studied 1,072 cases (65% men, mean age 53.2±13 years), 71 patients had pre-existing neurologic diseases (diabetic neuropathy: 17, epilepsy: 15, history of ischemic stroke: eight, migraine: six, multiple sclerosis: one, Parkinson disease: one), and 163 (15.2%) developed a new neurologic complication. Headache (41.7%), myalgia (38.5%), dysgeusia (8%), and anosmia (7%) were the most common neurologic symptoms at hospital presentation. Delirium (13.1%), objective limb weakness (5.1%), and delayed recovery of mental status after sedation withdrawal (2.5%), were the most common new neurologic syndromes. Age, headache at presentation, preexisting neurologic disease, invasive mechanical ventilation, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio ≥9 were independent predictors of new in-hospital neurologic complications.

Here, we compared the effect of influenza types, A and B, and influenza shedding in patients’ stools on the gut microbiota diversity and composition. Deep sequencing analysis was performed for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Fecal samples were collected from 38 adults with active respiratory influenza infection and 11 age-matched healthy controls. Influenza infection resulted in variations in intestinal bacterial community composition rather than in overall diversity. Overall, infected patients experienced an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and a corresponding decrease in Firmicutes. Differential abundance testing illustrated that differences in gut microbiota composition were influenza type-dependent, identifying ten differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between influenza A- and influenza B-infected patients. Notably, virus shedding in fecal samples of some patients had significantly reduced gut bacterial diversity (p = 0.023). Further taxonomic analysis revealed that the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis was significantly higher among shedders compared to non-shedders (p = 0.037). These results provide fundamental evidence of the direct effect of influenza infection on gut microbiota diversity, as reported in patients shedding the virus.","Al Khatib, Hebah A.; Mathew, Shilu; Smatti, Maria K.; Eltai, Nahla O.; Pathan, Sameer A.; Al Thani, Asmaa A.; Coyle, Peter V.; Al Maslamani, Muna A.; Yassine, Hadi M.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204203/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10060761,386

This study consisted of 131 portable CXR from 84 COVID-19 patients (51M 55.1±14.9yo; 29F 60.1±14.3yo; 4 missing information). Three expert chest radiologists scored the left and right lung separately based on the degree of opacity (0–3) and geographic extent (0–4). Deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to predict lung disease severity scores. Data were split into 80% training and 20% testing datasets. Correlation analysis between AI-predicted versus radiologist scores were analyzed. Comparison was made with traditional and transfer learning. The average opacity score was 2.52 (range: 0–6) with a standard deviation of 0.25 (9.9%) across three readers. The average geographic extent score was 3.42 (range: 0–8) with a standard deviation of 0.57 (16.7%) across three readers. The inter-rater agreement yielded a Fleiss’ Kappa of 0.45 for opacity score and 0.71 for extent score. AI-predicted scores strongly correlated with radiologist scores, with the top model yielding a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.90 (range: 0.73–0.90 for traditional learning and 0.83–0.90 for transfer learning) and a mean absolute error of 8.5% (ranges: 17.2–21.0% and 8.5%-15.5, respectively). Transfer learning generally performed better. In conclusion, deep-learning CNN accurately stages disease severity on portable chest x-ray of COVID-19 lung infection.

Chickens were divided into five vaccinated groups, which were each immunized with one of the rDEVs, covalent vaccination with rDEV-N & rDEV-S, or covalent vaccination with rDEV-N & rDEV-S1, and a control group. An antibody response against IBV was detectable and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes decreased at 7 days post-vaccination in each vaccinated group, suggesting that humoral and cellular responses were elicited in each group as early as 7 days post-immunization. After challenge with a homologous virulent IBV strain at 21 days post-immunization, vaccinated groups showed significant differences in the percentage of birds with clinical signs, as compared to the control group (p < 0.01), as the two covalent-vaccination groups and the rDEV-S group provided better protection than the rDEV-N- or rDEV-S1-vaccinated group. There was less viral shedding in the rDEV-N & rDEV-S- (2/10) and rDEV-N & rDEV-S1- (2/10) vaccinated groups than the other three vaccinated groups.

Approximately 60% of MFS patients with FBN1 gene mutation will suffer ectopia lentis (EL) from the age of 3. With the development of EL, severe loss of vision will accrue because of lens tilt and glaucoma. Cionni modified capsular tension rings (MCTR) has been applied in the surgery for EL in MFS patients. To evaluate visual acuity and safety of using MCTR during lens subluxation surgery in MFS patients, 66 MFS patients (110 eyes) were included in our study, with the mean duration of follow-up of 4.7 months (SD 1.76 months). The capsular bags were preserved in 101 eyes (91.81%) with MCTR implantation. There was an overall significant improvement in BCVA at 1-month follow-up which was maintained at 3 months. Multivariable linear regression revealed that older age at first visit was associated with greater postoperative BCVA at the 1-month follow-up (P = 0.007).

This paper was motivated by the problem of automating testing for viruses and new drugs using high throughput screening systems. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the turn of 2019-2020 presented extradentary challenges to public health. Existing approaches to test viruses and new drugs do not use optimal schedules and are not efficient. OBJECTIVE: The scheduling of activities performed by various resources in a high throughput screening system affects its efficiency, throughput, operations cost, and quality of screening. This study aims to minimize the total screening (flow) time and ensure the consistency and quality of screening. METHODS: This paper develops innovative mixed integer models that efficiently compute optimal schedules for screening many microplates to identify new drugs and determine whether samples contain viruses. The methods integrate job-shop and cyclic scheduling. Experiments are conducted for a drug discovery process of screening an enzymatic assay and a general process of detecting SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The method developed in this article can reduce screening time by as much as 91.67%. CONCLUSION: The optimal schedules for high throughput screening systems greatly reduce the total flow time and can be computed efficiently to help discover new drugs and detect viruses.","Okea, Adetola; Sahin, Deniz; Chen, Xin; Shang, Ying",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening (Online),https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207324666210811124856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34382507/,386

Hematological manifestations such as thrombocytopenia and reduced lymphocyte and eosinophil numbers are highly prevalent in COVID-19 and have prognostic significance. Few data, however, are available about the prevalence and significance of anemia in COVID-19. In an observational study, we investigated the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical significance of anemia among 206 patients with COVID-19 at the time of their hospitalization in an Internal Medicine unit. The prevalence of anemia was 61% in COVID-19, compared with 45% in a control group of 71 patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of COVID-19, but nasopharyngeal swab tests negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (p = 0.022). Mortality was higher in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. In COVID-19, females had lower hemoglobin concentration than males and a higher prevalence of moderate/severe anemia (25% versus 13%, p = 0.032). In most cases, anemia was mild and due to inflammation, sometimes associated with iron and/or vitamin deficiencies. Determinants of hemoglobin concentration included: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum cholinesterase, ferritin and protein concentrations and number of chronic diseases affecting each patient. Hemoglobin concentration was not related to overall survival that was, on the contrary, influenced by red blood cell distribution width, age, lactate dehydrogenase and the ratio of arterial partial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen fraction. In conclusion, our results highlight anemia as a common manifestation in COVID-19. Although anemia does not directly influence mortality, it usually affects elderly, frail patients and can negatively influence their quality of life.","Bergamaschi, Gaetano; de Andreis, Federica Borrelli; Aronico, Nicola; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Barteselli, Chiara; Merli, Stefania; Pellegrino, Ivan; Coppola, Luigi; Cremonte, Elisa Maria; Croce, Gabriele; Mordà, Francesco; Lapia, Francesco; Ferrari, Sara; Ballesio, Alessia; Parodi, Alessandro; Calabretta, Francesca; Ferrari, Maria Giovanna; Fumoso, Federica; Gentile, Antonella; Melazzini, Federica; Di Sabatino, Antonio",Clin Exp Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10238-020-00679-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417082/,386

However, the efficacy and potential risk of corticosteroids in septic patients have not been well assessed. This review was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to March 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of corticosteroids on patients with sepsis were included. The quality of outcomes in the included articles was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. The data were pooled by using risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD). The random-effects model was used to evaluate the pooled MD or RR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Fifty RCTs that included 12,304 patients with sepsis were identified. Corticosteroids were not associated with the mortality in 28-day (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.02; evidence rank, moderate) and long-term mortality (>60 days) (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.88–1.05) in patients with sepsis (evidence rank, low). However, corticosteroids may exert a significant effect on the mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.83–0.97), in-hospital (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.82–0.99; evidence rank, moderate) in patients with sepsis or septic shock (evidence rank, low). Furthermore, corticosteroids probably achieved a tiny reduction in the length of hospital stay and ICU. Corticosteroids were associated with a higher risk of hypernatremia and hyperglycemia; furthermore, they appear to have no significant effect on superinfection and gastroduodenal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids had no significant effect on the 28-day and long-term mortality; however, they decreased the ICU and hospital mortality. The findings suggest that the clinical corticosteroids may be an effective therapy for patients with sepsis during the short time.

662334,Correlation between daily infections and fatality rate due to Covid-19 in Germany,2020-08-04,"Global shortages of N95 masks have led to an urgent need of N95 decontamination and reuse methods that are scientifically validated and available globally. Although several large scale decontamination methods have been proposed (hydrogen peroxide vapor, UV-C); many of them are not applicable in remote and low resource settings. Heat with humidity has been demonstrated as a promising decontamination approach, but care must be taken when implementing this method at a grassroots level. Here we present a simple method to provide stable humidity and temperature for individual N95 masks which can be simply scaled in low resource settings. Moist heat (>50% humidity, 65-80C temperature) was applied to Kimberly-Clark N95 respirators for over 30 minutes by placing sealed containers with N95 respirators into water that had been brought to a rolling boil and removed from heat, and then allowing the containers to sit for over 45 minutes. After rising to their threshold points, temperature and humidity remained above 65C and 50% for a treatment time of at least 30 minutes. Filtration efficiency of 0.3-4.99um particles remained above 97% after 5 treatment cycles across all particle size sub-ranges, which is consistent with previously-reported data for similar heat and humidity conditions on different N95 FFR models. Although no fit tests were conducted on these masks after treatment, prior data on moist heat based treatment indicates consistent fit for up to five cycles of decontamination. This method of applying heat and humidity for the purpose of N95 respirator decontamination can be implemented on open flame stoves for low resource settings without reliable electricity access or where other methods of decontamination are not accessible. Higher temperatures or longer treatment times, such as treatment at >70C for over 30 minutes, could be achieved by increasing the volumes of boiled water used. Although fresh N95 masks should always be used - whenever available - we believe this simple yet reliable method provides a low cost, electricity free method for N95 decontamination in remote parts of the world.","Doshi, S.; Banavar, S.

Additionally, we have modified the protocol to include a neutralization assay with only a minor modification to this protocol. We used this assay to screen local COVID-19 patient sera (n = 91) and pre-COVID-19 control sera (n = 103), and obtained approximate parity with approved commercial anti-nucleoprotein-based assays with these sera.

Serology tests play an important role in assessing the immune system's response to a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or to vaccination. In Venezuela, before and after receiving the Sputnik V vaccine, we evaluated the IgG antibody response against the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 86 individuals. METHODS: . Antibody responses against NP and RBD were determined with an ELISA just before, 3 weeks after the first and 6 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: : Before vaccination, 59 individuals were seronegative and the other 27 were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antigens NP and/or RBD. Of the seronegative cohort, 42% did not develop a measurable IgG immune response against RBD after the first vaccine dose but all (100%) had a strong IgG response after two vaccine doses. All seropositive individuals developed a strong IgG antibody response against RBD after the first vaccine dose, with antibody levels approximately 40% higher than the seronegative individuals who had received two doses. Moreover, the previously seropositive subjects showed no significant increase in IgG antibody response against RBD after the second vaccine dose. CONCLUSIONS: : We demonstrated that two dose of the Sputnik V vaccine triggers antibody response in all individuals of this study. The second vaccine dose of Sputnik V has no impact on the IgG response for who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antigens prior to vaccination.","Claro, Franklin; Silva, Douglas; Rodriguez, Melissa; Rangel, Rafael; de Waard, Jacobus H.",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221006263; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.07.070; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221006263?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34343704/,386

As a result, PV output is almost always prioritized over other fuel sources and delivered to the electric grid. However, PV curtailment is increasing as PV composes greater shares of grid capacity. In this paper, we present a novel synthesis of curtailment in four key countries: Chile, China, Germany, and the United States. We find that about 6.5 million MWh of PV output was curtailed in these countries in 2018. We find that: Policy and grid planning practices influence where, when, and how much PV is curtailed; Some PV curtailment is attributable to limited transmission capacity connecting remote solar resources to load centers; PV curtailment peaks in the spring and fall, when PV output is relatively high but electricity demand is relatively low.

663680,Mortality Associated With Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with COVID-19,2020-08-15,"Abstract Lack of genetic variability and apparent susceptibility of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) to coronavirus infection has lead to speculation that this species may have immune system deficits. To establish a foundation for evaluation of the immune function, cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated by a panel of six mitogens, and responses compared with those of domestic cat PBM. Individual responses in both species were variable, but evenly distributed throughout the range of stimulation for each mitogen. Proliferation by PBM from domestic cats occured within the same range as that of the cheetahs. However, a significantly lower response to peanut agglutinin (PNA) was observed with domestic cat PBM. Although responses varied between animals, certain individual cheetahs were consistent responders. The decreased values could not be explained by lack of IL-2 responsiveness since exogenous IL-2 significantly enhanced mitogen-stimulated proliferation in 11 of 12 cheetahs tested. The phenotypic distribution of domestic cat and cheetah lymphocyte subpopulations was similar as assessed by immunofluorescence staining for surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and cytotoxic T (Tc) cells (using a specific monoclonal antibody, FT2). Values for B cells (31.2% sIg+) and Tc (28.7% FT2 +) were slightly higher in domestic cats as compared with cheetah PBM (13.3% sIg+; 19.0% FT2+). Even though no species-specific deficits were detected, a significant negative correlation between PHA-stimulated proliferation and percent FT2+ (Tc) cheetah cells was observed. This indicates that proliferation can be used indirectly to assess relative numbers of functional T helper cells in cheetahs. Our studies suggest that these aspects of the cheetah's immune system are comparable with the domestic cat, and establish a basis for in vitro assays evaluating antigen-specific responses.","Miller-Edge, M.; Worley, M.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/016524279190125V; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1835214/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016524279190125V,386

In this study, recent research on the characteristics of expiratory particles and flow is reviewed, with a special focus on different respiratory activities, to provide guidance for reducing the viral infection risk in the built environment. Furthermore, environmental influence on particle evaporation, dispersion, and virus viability after exhalation and the current methods for infection risk assessment are reviewed. Finally, we summarize promising control strategies against infectious expiratory particles. The results show that airborne transmission is a significant viral transmission route, both in short and long ranges, from infected individuals. Relative humidity affects the evaporation and trajectories of middle-sized droplets most, and temperature accelerates the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 both on surfaces and in aerosols. Future research is needed to improve infection risk models to better predict the infection potential of different transmission routes. Moreover, further quantitative studies on the expiratory flow features after wearing a mask are needed.

At present, viral diagnostics are based on direct detection of viral components or indirect detection by measuring antibodies generated in response to viral infection. While sensitivity of detection and quantification are still important challenges, we expect major advances from new assay formats and synthetic binding molecules, such as aptamers. Compared to traditional antibody-based detection, aptamers could provide faster adaptation to continuously evolving virus strains and higher discriminating capacity between specific virus serotypes. Aptamers are very stable and easily modifiable, so are ideal molecules for detection and chemical sensing applications. Here, we review the use of aptasensors for detection of viral pathogens and consider the feasibility of aptasensors to become standard devices for point-of-care diagnostics of viruses.","van den Kieboom, Corné H.; van der Beek, Samantha L.; Mészáros, Tamás; Gyurcsányi, Róbert E.; Ferwerda, Gerben; de Jonge, Marien I.",Trends Analyt Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287539/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993615002435; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165993615002435; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2015.05.012,386

Compared with some existing systems, the new program package has the merits of simplicity, high accuracy, reliability, and quickness. The system ZCURVE_CoV has been run for each of the 11 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes. Consequently, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. In addition to the polyprotein chain ORFs 1a and 1b and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins, spike (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nuleocaspid (N), respectively, ZCURVE_CoV also predicts 5–6 putative proteins in length between 39 and 274 amino acids with unknown functions. Some single nucleotide mutations within these putative coding sequences have been detected and their biological implications are discussed. A web service is provided, by which a user can obtain the annotated result immediately by pasting the SARS-CoV genome sequences into the input window on the web site (http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/).

666702,On the Analysis of Mortality Risk Factors for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: a Data-driven Study Using the Major Brazilian Database,2020-09-25,"SUMMARY: This study examines factors associated with osteoporosis awareness and knowledge using Osteoporosis Prevention and Awareness Tool (OPAAT). Of 410 patients, majority of patients had a OPAAT score < 24 (n = 362, 88.3%). Lower education level (odds ratio (OR) (primary education): 3.63; OR (no formal education): 111.5; p < 0.001) and diabetic patients (OR: 1.67; p = 0.003) were associated with lower OPAAT scores. INTRODUCTION: Lack of osteoporosis awareness forms a critical barrier to osteoporosis care and has been linked with increased institutionalization, healthcare expenditures, and decreased quality of life. This study aims to identify factors associated with osteoporosis awareness and knowledge among female Singaporeans. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult female patients (aged 40 to 90 years old) who were admitted into Outram Community Hospital from April to October 2020. Osteoporosis awareness and knowledge were assessed using interviewer-administered Osteoporosis Prevention and Awareness Tool (OPAAT). High knowledge was defined as a OPAAT score ≥ 24. Multivariate logistical regression analyses were used to identify predictors of low OPAAT scores. RESULTS: Of 410 patients recruited, their mean age was 71.9 ± 9.5 years old and majority of patients had a OPAAT score < 24 (n = 362, 88.3%). Patients with lower OPAAT scores tended to be older (72.5 ± 9.2 vs 67.5 ± 10.1, p < 0.001), attained lower education level (p < 0.001), and were more likely to live in public housing (92.5% vs 81.5%, p = 0.009). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was higher in patients with low OPAAT scores (39.2% vs 18.8%, p = 0.006). After adjustment for covariates, lower education level (odds ratio (OR) (primary education): 3.63; OR (no formal education): 11.5; p < 0.05) and patients with diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.67; p = 0.03) were associated with lower OPAAT knowledge scores. CONCLUSION: Elderly female patients in community hospital have inadequate osteoporosis awareness despite being at risk of fractures.

STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational longitudinal cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive mothers and their infants at three NYU Langone Health hospitals from March 25, 2020 through May 30, 2020. Mothers were surveyed by telephone regarding pre-delivery feeding plans, in-hospital feeding, and home feeding of their neonates. Any change prompted an additional question to determine whether this change was due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 160 mother–newborn dyads, 103 mothers were reached by telephone, and 85 consented to participate. No significant difference was observed in pre-delivery feeding plan between the separated and unseparated dyads (P = .268). Higher rates of breastfeeding were observed in the unseparated dyads compared with the separated dyads in the hospital (p<0.001), and at home (p=0.012). Only two mothers in each group reported expressed breast milk as the hospital feeding source (5.6% of unseparated vs 4.1% of separated). COVID-19 was more commonly cited as the reason for change among the separated compared with the unseparated group (49.0% vs 16.7%, p<0.001). When dyads were further stratified by symptom status into four groups (asymptomatic separated, asymptomatic unseparated, symptomatic separated, and symptomatic unseparated), results remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: In the setting of COVID-19, separation of mother–newborn dyads impacts breastfeeding outcomes, with lower rates of breastfeeding both during hospitalization and at home following discharge compared with unseparated mothers and infants. No evidence of vertical transmission was observed; one case of postnatal transmission occurred from an unmasked symptomatic mother who held her infant at birth.","Popofsky, Stephanie; Noor, Asif; Leavens-Maurer, Jill; Quintos-Alagheband, Maria Lyn; Mock, Ann; Vinci, Alexandra; Magri, Eileen; Akerman, Meredith; Noyola, Estela; Rigaud, Mona; Pak, Billy; Lighter, Jennifer; Ratner, Adam J.; Hanna, Nazeeh; Krilov, Leonard",J Pediatr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347620309860?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347620309860; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791077/,386

Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may mitigate this risk. We evaluated haploHSCT after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with ATG, PTCy, and cyclosporine to prevent rejection and GVHD. Fifty adults underwent haploHSCT from August 2016 to February 2018. RIC included fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day on days –5 to –2), busulfan (3.2 mg/m(2)/day on days –3 and –2), and total body irradiation (200 cGy) on day –1. Unmanipulated PBSCs were infused on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis included ATG (4.5 mg/kg over days –3 to –1), PTCy (50 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4), and cyclosporine from day +5. Median age was 56 years (range, 22 to 70 years); 25 (73.5%) patients were in first complete remission (CR1), 5 (14.7%) were in second complete remission (CR2), and 8 (23.5%) had active disease. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 16 days (range, 8 to 43 days). At day +100, the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD of any grade, and grades III to IV was 38.3% and 5.2%, respectively. Mild chronic GVHD was seen in 15.5%. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in 37 (74%) cases and CMV disease occurred in 4 (11.5%) cases. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation occurred in 21 (61.8%) patients. The incidence of histologically confirmed post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was 5.8%. Four patients received rituximab. There were no CMV, EBV, or PTLD-related deaths.

669121,Patient-reported outcome measures after COVID-19: a prospective cohort study,2020-10-02,"The Covid-19 pandemic emerged and evolved so quickly that societies were not able to respond quickly enough, mainly due to the nature of the Covid-19 virus’ rate of spread and also the largely open societies that we live in. While we have been willingly moving towards open societies and reducing movement barriers, there is a need to be prepared for minimizing the openness of society on occasions such as large pandemics, which are low probability events with massive impacts. Certainly, similar to many phenomena, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us its own geography presenting its emergence and evolving patterns as well as taking advantage of our geographical settings for escalating its spread. Hence, this study aims at presenting a data-driven approach for exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of the pandemic over a regional scale, i.e., Europe and a country scale, i.e., Denmark, and also what geographical variables potentially contribute to expediting its spread. We used official regional infection rates, points of interest, temperature and air pollution data for monitoring the pandemic’s spread across Europe and also applied geospatial methods such as spatial autocorrelation and space-time autocorrelation to extract relevant indicators that could explain the dynamics of the pandemic. Furthermore, we applied statistical methods, e.g., ordinary least squares, geographically weighted regression, as well as machine learning methods, e.g., random forest for exploring the potential correlation between the chosen underlying factors and the pandemic spread. Our findings indicate that population density, amenities such as cafes and bars, and pollution levels are the most influential explanatory variables while pollution levels can be explicitly used to monitor lockdown measures and infection rates at country level. The choice of data and methods used in this study along with the achieved results and presented discussions can empower health authorities and decision makers with an interactive decision support tool, which can be useful for imposing geographically varying lockdowns and protectives measures using historical data.","Hass, Frederik Seeup; Jokar Arsanjani, Jamal",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802001/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062803,386

This study aimed to investigate the impact of the pandemic on mental health, lifestyle adaptations, and their determinants among pregnant women in the United Arab Emirates. METHODS: A survey was conducted electronically between June and August 2020. Pregnant women were recruited from prenatal clinics in the UAE and invited to participate in an online survey developed on Google Forms. The questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics, the Impact of Event Scale- Revised, the Perceived Support Scale and lifestyle-related factors. RESULTS: A total of 384 pregnant women completed the questionnaire of whom 20.6% were in their 1st trimester, 46.1% in their 2nd and 33.3% in their 3rd trimester. The mean IES-R score for the respondents was 26.15 ± 13.55, corresponding to a mild stressful impact, which did not differ significantly among trimesters of pregnancy.

669918,"Nature, availability, and utilization of women-focused cardiac rehabilitation: a systematic review",2021-09-23,"Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and maternal mortality disproportionately affect minorities. However, direct viral infection is not the only way that the former can affect the latter. Most adverse maternal events that end in hospitals have their genesis upstream in communities. Hospitals often represent a last opportunity to reverse a process that begins at a remove in space and time. The COVID-19 pandemic did not create these upstream injuries, but it has brought them to national attention, exacerbated them, and highlighted the need for health care providers to move out of the footprint of their institutions. The breach between community events that seed morbidity and hospitals that attempt rescues has grown in recent years, as the gap between rich and poor has grown and as maternity services in minority communities have closed. COVID-19 has become yet another barrier. For example, professional organizations have recommended a reduced number of prenatal visits, and the platforms hospitals use to substitute for some of these visits are not helpful to people who either lack the technology or the safe space in which to have confidential conversations with providers. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Community-based organizations including legal professionals, health-home coordinators, and advocacy groups, surround almost every hospital, and can be willing partners with interested departments. COVID-19 has made it clearer than ever that it is time to step out of the footprint of our institutions, and to recognize that the need to find upstream opportunities to prevent downstream tragedies. Key Points: COVID-19 will exacerbate disparities in perinatal outcomes. The virus, per se, is not the pandemic's biggest threat to the health of minority women.

671353,GLUCOCOVID: A controlled trial of methylprednisolone in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia refers to the inflammation of the terminal airway, alveoli and pulmonary interstitium, which can be caused by pathogenic microorganisms, physical and chemical factors, immune damage, and drugs. Anemoside B4, the major ingredient of Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel, exhibited anti-inflammatory activity. However, the therapeutic effect of anemoside B4 on pneumonia has not been unraveled. This study aims to investigate that anemoside B4 attenuates the inflammatory responses in Klebsiella pneumonia (KP)- and influenza virus FM1 (FM1)-induced pneumonia mice model. METHODS: The network pharmacology and molecular docking assays were employed to predict the targets of anemoside B4’s treatment of pneumonia. Two models (bacterial KP-infected mice and virus FM1-infected mice) were employed in our study. BALB/c mice were divided into six groups: control, model group (KP-induced pneumonia or FM1-induced pneumonia), anemoside B4 (B4)-treated group (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg), and positive drug group (ribavirin or ceftriaxone sodium injection). Blood samples were collected for hematology analysis. The effects of B4 on inflammation-associated mediators were investigated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) staining. Proteins expression was quantified by western blotting. RESULTS: The network results indicated that many pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) participated in anemoside B4’s anti-inflammatory activity. The counts of neutrophil (NEU) and white blood cell (WBC), the level of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 increased by KP or FM1 infection, which were reversed by anemoside B4. In addition, anemoside B4 significantly suppressed the FM1-induced expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differential protein-88 (MyD88), and myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2), which were further validated by molecular docking data that anemoside B4 bound to bioactive sites of TLR4. Therefore, anemoside B4 exhibited a significant therapeutic effect on pneumonia via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that anemoside B4 attenuates pneumonia via the TLR4/Myd88 signaling pathway, suggesting that anemoside B4 is a promising therapeutic candidate for bacterial-infected or viral-infected pneumonia.","He, Jia; Yuan, Renyikun; Cui, Xiaolan; Cui, Yushun; Han, Shan; Wang, Qin-Qin; Chen, Yangling; Huang, Liting; Yang, Shilin; Xu, Qiongming; Zhao, Yonghui; Gao, Hongwei",Chin Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-020-00350-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32625244/,386
671584,Reduced Presentations and Increased Ischaemic Times for Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-12-31,"Severe/critical cases account for 18–20% of all novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, but their mortality rate can be up to 61.5%. Furthermore, all deceased patients were severe/critical cases. The main reasons for the high mortality of severe/critical patients are advanced age (>60 years old) and combined underlying diseases. Elderly patients with comorbidities show decreased organ function and low compensation for damage such as hypoxia and inflammation, which accelerates disease progression. The lung is the main target organ attacked by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) while immune organs, liver, blood vessels and other organs are damaged to varying degrees. Liver volume is increased, and mild active inflammation and focal necrosis are observed in the portal area. Virus particles have also been detected in liver cells. Therefore, multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) and individualized treatment plans, accurate prediction of disease progression and timely interventions are vital to effectively reduce mortality. Specifically, a “multidisciplinary three-dimensional management, individualized comprehensive plan” should be implemented. The treatment plan complies with three principles, namely, multidisciplinary management of patients, individualized diagnosis and treatment plans, and timely monitoring and intervention of disease. MDT members are mainly physicians from critical medicine, infection and respiratory disciplines, but also include cardiovascular, kidney, endocrine, digestion, nerve, nutrition, rehabilitation, psychology and specialty care. According to a patient’s specific disease condition, an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan is formulated (one plan for one patient). While selecting individualized antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment, we also strengthen nutritional support, psychological intervention, comprehensive rehabilitation and timely and full-course intervention to develop overall and special nursing plans. In response to the rapid progression of severe/critical patients, MDT members need to establish a three-dimensional management model with close observation and timely evaluation. The MDT should make rounds of the quarantine wards both morning and night, and of critical patient wards nightly, to implement “round-the-clock rounds management”, to accurately predict disease progression, perform the quick intervention and prevent rapid deterioration of the patient. Our MDT has cumulatively treated 77 severe/critical COVID-19 cases, including 62 (80.5%) severe cases and 15 (19.5%) critical cases, with an average age of 63.8 years. Fifty-three (68.8%) cases presented with more than one underlying disease and 65 (84.4%) severe cases recovered from COVID-19. The average hospital stay of severe/critical cases was 22 days, and the mortality rate was 2.6%, both of which were significantly lower than the 30–40 days and 49.0–61.5%, respectively, reported in the literature. Therefore, a multidisciplinary, three-dimensional and individualized comprehensive treatment plan can effectively reduce the mortality rate of severe/critical COVID-19 and improve the cure rate.","Yang, Qing",Liver Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864178/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livres.2020.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542568420300374; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542568420300374?v=s5,386

DESIGN: We carried out a qualitative study using semistructured interviews to capture participants’ experiences and perceptions of supported isolation. Data were analysed using the framework approach, a type of thematic analysis that is commonly used in research that has implications for policy. SETTING: Telephone interviews carried out within approximately 1 month of an individual leaving supported isolation. PARTICIPANTS: 26 people who underwent supported isolation at either Arrowe Park Hospital (n=18) or Kents Hill Park Conference Centre (n=8) after being repatriated from Wuhan in January to February 2020. RESULTS: Six key themes were identified: factors affecting compliance with supported isolation; risk perceptions around catching COVID-19; management of supported isolation; communication with those outside supported isolation; relationship with others in supported isolation; and feelings on leaving supported isolation. Participants were willing to undergo supported isolation because they understood that it would protect themselves and others. Positive treatment by staff was fundamental to participants’ willingness to comply with isolation procedures. Despite the high level of compliance, participants expressed some uncertainty about what the process would involve. CONCLUSIONS: As hotel quarantine is introduced across the UK for international arrivals, our findings suggest that those in charge should: communicate effectively before, during and after quarantine, emphasising why quarantine is important and how it will protect others; avoid coercion if possible and focus on supporting and promoting voluntary compliance; facilitate shared social experiences for those in quarantine; and ensure all necessary supplies are provided. Doing so is likely to increase adherence and reduce any negative effects on well-being.","Carter, Holly; Weston, Dale; Greenberg, Neil; Oliver, Isabel; Robin, Charlotte; Rubin, G James; Wessely, Simon; Gauntlett, Louis; Amlot, Richard",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301664/,386

It clearly unknot about the fact that science is a human (society) need based process that starts with social affairs, for example, need to exchange emotion and cognitive processes (psychology), feelings (literature), relation (sociology), money (economics) etc. Humanities are the use of approaches that are predominantly hypothetical but critical, and have a noteworthy historical component, and the methodical aspects distinguish it from the mainly experiential approaches of the science. The basic approaches in both remains the same that it needs a hypothesis, sound methodology, and interpretation of data. Human is the end user in both the cases. So, why only interdisciplinary research focused on the core subjects of science? For example, philosophy, deals with general and vital complications relating to matters including existence, knowledge, language, attitude, behaviour, values, ethics, reason, mind, peace and harmony in life which can be essentially a part of science (especially natural sciences and more particularly animals sciences such as zoology) or vice versa could be true. The current and future time will allow us to believe on such concept, is the main theme of the current article. METHODS: Articles from all published sources are considered for answering the objective that why not concentrating to speed up interdisciplinarity. Few tables and figure are reproduced or redrawn as per the need. And numerical data are collected to present the current status of the interdisciplinarity and the need of the pace it requires. RESULTS: It is noticed that number of research articles on interdisciplinarity in comparison to several core subject area in major databases including environmental biology are still negligible. Countries still need to inter-collaborate at interdisciplinary level for the development and benefit of human race. This needs to be done mainly at socio-economic, intercultural and scientific levels. Although numbers of steps are taken such as establishment of interdisciplinary institutes, introduction of interdisciplinary courses, interdisciplinary research and publication platforms in specialized dedicated journals, still concrete steps to introduce the course of interdisciplinarity at educational and professional level is wanting. CONCLUSION: Therefore, policy on pace in interdisciplinarity across science and humanities is highly wanting especially in developing countries to fix several national and international issues. Present article deals with the current status and future prospective or policies required on interdisciplinarity.","Das, Kabita; Paital, Biswaranjan",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768177/,386
673434,Genetic Risk and COPD Independently Predict the Risk of Incident Severe COVID-19.,2021-07-09,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 studies are primarily from the inpatient setting, skewing towards severe disease. Race and comorbidities predict hospitalization, however, ambulatory presentation of milder COVID-19 disease and characteristics associated with progression to severe disease is not well-understood. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review including all COVID-19 positive cases from Stanford Health Care (SHC) in March 2020 to assess demographics, comorbidities and symptoms in relationship to: 1) their access point of testing (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room (ER)) and 2) development of severe disease. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-seven patients tested positive: 127 (49%), 96 (37%), and 34 (13%) at outpatient, ER and inpatient, respectively. Overall, 61% were age < 55; age > 75 was rarer in outpatient setting (11%) than ER (14%) or inpatient (24%). Most patients presented with cough (86%), fever/chills (76%), or fatigue (63%). 65% of inpatients reported shortness of breath compared to 30–32% of outpatients and ER patients. Ethnic/minority patients had a significantly higher risk of developing severe disease (Asian OR = 4.8 [1.6–14.2], Hispanic OR = 3.6 [1.1–11.9]). Medicare-insured patients were marginally more likely (OR = 4.0 [0.9–17.8]). Other factors associated with developing severe disease included kidney disease (OR = 6.1 [1.0–38.1]), cardiovascular disease (OR = 4.7 [1.0–22.1], shortness of breath (OR = 5.4 [2.3–12.6]) and GI symptoms (OR = 3.3 [1.4–7.7]; hypertension without concomitant CVD or kidney disease was marginally significant (OR = 2.3 [0.8–6.5]). CONCLUSIONS: Early widespread symptomatic testing for COVID-19 in Silicon Valley included many less severely ill patients.

673585,Evidence of the pathogenic HERV-W envelope expression in T lymphocytes in association with the respiratory outcome of COVID-19 patients,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 coinfection with other viral and bacterial pathogens and their interactions are increasingly recognized in the literature as potential determinants of COVID-19 phenotypes. The aim of this study was to determine infection induced, host transcriptomic overlap between SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infection induced gene expression data were used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) via the Enrichr platform. GSEA compared the extracted signature to VirusMINT, Virus and Microbe perturbations from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in order to detect overlap with other pathogen induced host gene signatures. For all analyses, a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: GSEA via Enrichr revealed several significantly enriched sub-signatures associated with HSV1, EBV, HIV1, IAV, RSV, P.Aeruginosa, Staph. Aureus and Strep. Pneumoniae infections, among other pathogens (FDR < 0.05). These signatures were detected in at least 6 infection-induced transcriptomic studies from GEO and involved both bronchial epithelial and peripheral blood immune cells. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may function synergistically with other viral and bacterial pathogens at the transcriptomic level. Notably, several meta-analyses of COVID-19 cohorts have furthermore corroborated viral and bacterial pathogens reported herein as coinfections with SARS-CoV-2. The identification of common, perturbed gene networks outlines a common host targetome for these pathogens, and furthermore provides candidates for biomarker discovery and drug design.","Vavougios, George D.",Infect Genet Evol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132111/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820304330?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820304330,386

674295,Performing Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Tracheostomy in COVID-19 Patients,2020-12-02,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a new disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was occurred. Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 are more likely to die, especially elderly patients. We aimed to describe the effect of age on the clinical and immune characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively included 32 patients with COVID-19 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 by the local health authority and who were admitted to the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou, China between January 3 and March 20, 2020. Clinical information and experimental test data were retrospectively collected for the patients. The 32 patients in this study were all in a critical condition and were classified as severe, according to the guidelines of 2019-nCoV infection from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Data were compared between those <60 years old and ≥60 years old. RESULTS: Of 32 patients, 13 were under 60 years old, and 19 patients were ≥60 years old. The most common symptom among all patients upon admission was fever (93.8%, 30/32). Compared to younger patients, older patients exhibited increased comorbidities. Among patients who were 60 years and older, platelet count, direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin(IBIL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were significantly higher than in younger patients who were less than 60 years old. CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and NKT lymphocytes were decreased, CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly increased in all 32 patients, while there were no evident differences between younger and older patients. The CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory, rate, blood pressure plus age ≥65 years), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and pH value were significantly higher in older patients than in patients who were under 60 years old. However, the PaO2 and PaO2:FiO2 were lower in older patients than the younger. Compared to patients under 60 years old, patients who were 60 years and older tended to develop ARDS (15 [78.9%] vs 5 [38.5%]), septic shock (7 [36.8%] vs 0 [0.0%]) and were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (13 [68.4%] vs 3[23.1%]). Dynamic trajectories of seven laboratory parameters were tracked on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and significant differences in lymphocyte count (P = 0.026), D-dimer (P = 0.010), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.000) and C-reactive protein (P = 0.000) were observed between the two age groups. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of critically ill patients were 60 or older. Furthermore, rapid disease progression was noted in elderly patients. Therefore, close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Hu, Chunling; Li, Junlu; Xing, Xia; Gao, Jing; Zhao, Shilong; Xing, Lihua",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735325/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248675,386

The critical binding region of ACE2 is a ∼30 aa long helix. Here we report the design of four stapled peptides based on the ACE2 helix, which is expected to bind to SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the infection. All stapled peptides showed high helical contents (50-94% helicity). On the contrary, the linear control peptide NYBSP-C showed no helicity (19%). We have evaluated the peptides in a pseudovirus based single-cycle assay in HT1080/ACE2 and human lung cells A549/ACE2, overexpressing ACE2. Three of the four stapled peptides showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080/ACE2 (IC50: 1.9 – 4.1 µM) and A549/ACE2 cells (IC50: 2.2 – 2.8 µM). The linear peptides NYBSP-C and the double-stapled peptide StRIP16, used as controls, showed no antiviral activity. Most significantly, none of the stapled peptides show any cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested. We also evaluated the antiviral activity of the peptides by infecting Vero E6 cells with the replication-competent authentic SARS-CoV-2 (US_WA-1/2020). NYBSP-1 was the most efficient preventing the complete formation of cytopathic effects (CPEs) at an IC100 17.2 µM. NYBSP-2 and NYBSP-4 also prevented the formation of the virus-induced CPE with an IC100 of about 33 µM. We determined the proteolytic stability of one of the most active stapled peptides, NYBSP-4, in human plasma, which showed a half-life (T1/2) of >289 min.","Curreli, Francesca; Victor, Sofia M B; Ahmed, Shahad; Drelich, Aleksandra; Tong, Xiaohe; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Hillyer, Christopher D.; Debnath, Asim K",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.266437,386
674999,"Clinical features and prognostic factors of patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province, China",2021-02-13,"Tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns are highly variable within and across individuals, leading to altered host responses after acute virus infection. Unraveling key tissue-specific response patterns provides novel opportunities for defining fundamental mechanisms of virus-host interaction in disease and the identification of critical tissue-specific networks for disease intervention in the lung. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients, and little is understood about how lung cell types contribute to disease outcomes. MERS-CoV replicates equivalently in primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (MVE) and fibroblasts (FB) and to equivalent peak titers but with slower replication kinetics in human airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE). However, only infected MVE demonstrate observable virus-induced cytopathic effect. To explore mechanisms leading to reduced MVE viability, donor-matched human lung MVE, HAE, and FB were infected, and their transcriptomes, proteomes, and lipidomes were monitored over time. Validated functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that MERS-CoV-infected MVE were dying via an unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated apoptosis. Pharmacologic manipulation of the UPR in MERS-CoV-infected primary lung cells reduced viral titers and in male mice improved respiratory function with accompanying reductions in weight loss, pathological signatures of acute lung injury, and times to recovery. Systems biology analysis and validation studies of global kinetic transcript, protein, and lipid data sets confirmed that inhibition of host stress pathways that are differentially regulated following MERS-CoV infection of different tissue types can alleviate symptom progression to end-stage lung disease commonly seen following emerging coronavirus outbreaks.","Sims, Amy C.; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Kyle, Jennifer E.; Burnum-Johnson, Kristin E.; Lam, Mariam; Fulcher, M.

For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the development of antibodies against COVID‐19, and clinical history are unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals who recovered from COVID‐19 and volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti‐COVID‐19 antibodies. RESULTS: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti‐COVID‐19 serology results. IgG anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 spike antibody strength correlated with hospitalization for COVID‐19 using two different assays. Total anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to sample collection and symptom duration. CONCLUSIONS: SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID‐19. If anti‐spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered severe COVID‐19 disease symptoms may represent better donors.","Ikegami, Sachie; Benirschke, Robert; Flanagan, Tara; Tanna, Nicole; Klein, Tovah; Elue, Rita; Debosz, Patricia; Mallek, Jessica; Wright, Gregory; Guariglia, Perry; Kang, Jason; Gniadek, Thomas J.",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840002/; https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16015,386

Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the urgent need for rapid responses to contain the pandemic, it is essential to understand the role that weather conditions on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We evaluate the influence of meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Catalonia. We conducted a geographical analysis at the county level to evaluate the association between mean temperature, absolute humidity, solar radiation, and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19. Next, we used a time-series design to assess the short-term effects of meteorological factors on the daily incidence of COVID-19. We found a geographical association between meteorological factors and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19, from the end of March to June 2020, and a lesser extent in the short-term on the daily incidence during the first wave of the epidemic in Spain.

Although mesothelial cells are known to express multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which contribute to trigger innate immune responses against infections, the precise molecular mechanism remains still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll/IL-1 domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF), one of the two major TLRs–adaptor molecules, on innate immune response induced by TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation in murine peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs). TRIF was strongly expressed in PMCs and its deficiency led to impaired production of cytokines and chemokines by poly I:C and LPS in the cells. Activation of NF-κB or MAPKs through poly I:C and LPS stimulation was reduced in TRIF-deficient PMCs as compared to the WT cells. TRIF was also necessary for optimal nitric oxide synthesis and gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IFN-β in PMCs in response to poly I:C and LPS. Furthermore, both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced high level of IL-6, CXCL1, and CCL2 production in PMCs, which was significantly impaired by TRIF deficiency. These results demonstrated that TRIF is required for optimal activation of innate immune responses in mesothelial cells against microbial infections.","Hwang, Eun-Ha; Kim, Tae-Hyoun; Oh, Sang-Muk; Lee, Kyung-Bok; Yang, Soo-Jin; Park, Jong-Hwan",Cytokine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466615300983; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466615300983; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2015.11.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579632/,386

Here, we expanded the study through small RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis of the host response to both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza virus infections across four founder mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross, a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits. We observed differential expression of over 200 small RNAs of diverse classes during infection. A majority of identified microRNAs (miRNAs) showed divergent changes in expression across mouse strains with respect to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections and responded differently to a highly pathogenic reconstructed 1918 virus compared to a minimally pathogenic seasonal influenza virus isolate. Novel insights into miRNA expression changes, including the association with pathogenic outcomes and large differences between in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, were further elucidated by a survey of selected miRNAs across diverse virus infections. The small RNAs identified also included many non-miRNA small RNAs, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), in addition to nonannotated small RNAs. An integrative sequencing analysis of both small RNAs and long transcripts from the same samples showed that the results revealing differential expression of miRNAs during infection were largely due to transcriptional regulation and that the predicted miRNA-mRNA network could modulate global host responses to virus infection in a combinatorial fashion. These findings represent the first integrated sequencing analysis of the response of host small RNAs to virus infection and show that small RNAs are an integrated component of complex networks involved in regulating the host response to infection.","Peng, Xinxia; Gralinski, Lisa; Ferris, Martin T.; Frieman, Matthew B.; Thomas, Matthew J.; Proll, Sean; Korth, Marcus J.; Tisoncik, Jennifer R.; Heise, Mark; Luo, Shujun; Schroth, Gary P.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Li, Chengjun; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Baric, Ralph S.; Katze, Michael G.",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00198-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22086488/,386

In this commentary, we discuss how this enormous challenge could be addressed for viral vector-based Covid-19 vaccines by learning from the wealth of formulation development experience gained over the years on stability issues related to live attenuated virus vaccines and viral vector vaccines for other diseases. This experience has led –over time– to major improvements on storage temperature, shelf-life and in-use stability requirements. First, we will cover work on ‘classical’ live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8°C with a shelf life of years has become the norm. In the case of pandemics with incredibly high and urgent product demands, however, the desire for rapid and convenient distribution chains combined with short end-user storage times require that liquid formulations with shelf lives of months stored at 2-8 °C be considered. In confronting this “perfect storm” of Covid-19 vaccine stability challenges, understanding the many lessons learned from decades of development and manufacturing of live virus-based vaccines is the shortest path for finding promising and rapid solutions.","Crommelin, Daan J.A.; Volkin, David B.; Hoogendoorn, Karin H.; Lubiniecki, Anthony S.; Jiskoot, Wim",J Pharm Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022354920307449?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022354920307449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242452/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2020.11.015,386

To date, only in rare cases have dogs and cats living with COVID-19 patients been found to harbour SARS-CoV-2, with no evidence of pet-to-human transmission. The aim of the present study was to verify whether dogs and cats act as passive mechanical carriers of SARS-CoV-2 when they live in close contact with COVID-19 patients. Cutaneous and interdigital swabs collected from 48 dogs and 15 cats owned by COVID-19 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR. The time elapsed between owner swab positivity and sample collection from pets ranged from 1 to 72 days, with a median time of 23 days for dogs and 39 days for cats. All samples tested negative, suggesting that pets do not passively carry SARS-CoV-2 on their hair and pads, and thus they likely do not play an important role in the virus transmission to humans. This data may contribute to confirming that the direct contact with the hair and pads of pets does not represent a route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Lauzi, Stefania; Stranieri, Angelica; Giordano, Alessia; Lelli, Davide; Elia, Gabriella; Desario, Costantina; Ratti, Gabriele; Decaro, Nicola; Paltrinieri, Saverio",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372563/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071357,386
678155,Association between previous anticoagulant use and mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2021-06-02,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the medical education platform for students in the United States of America (USA). In that light, medical schools had to rapidly rearrange the dynamics of their educational curricula from the traditional platforms, to incorporate telemedicine. The telemedicine platform is supported in many specialties, allowing students various options to continue their education without interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond. Telemedicine platforms are projected to grow exponentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing a segue for medical schools to modify their curricula by incorporating telemedicine programs. These distant-, e-learning (tele-education) programs align with the recommendations and guidelines for practicing social distancing. In this article, we surveyed fourth-year medical students to better understand their views on multiple aspects of e-learning, and its impact on their medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the medical students’ experiences, satisfaction, insight and knowledge with e-learning, tele-education, telehealth, and their related modalities during COVID-19. We provide an organized overview and analysis of the main factors that influence medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic, while bringing forth the main challenges, limitations, and emerging approaches in the field of telemedicine and its application as it relates to medical education and e-learning across medical specialties. We outline the main themes and ideas that the medical students voiced, as to how their medical education is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they will incorporate telemedicine and tele-education in their future career. A cross-sectional, mixed-method survey was developed and distributed via Google Surveys to 181 University at Buffalo, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, United States of America, 4th year medical students, in December 2020. Results were compiled and analyzed after a 6-day open period for responses to be submitted. The survey instrument consisted of questions that inquire about the students’ perspectives as it relates to their rapid switch from their traditional method of learning to the on-line version of medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 65 students responded to the survey, of which 63 completed the survey. More than half of the students (n = 63, 57%) indicated that both their specialty of interest, and (n = 21, 33%) their sub-internships were impacted by the temporary lockdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students also indicated that the top three specialties that were affected included surgery, internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. When the students were asked if they were satisfied with the use of aquifer for their health care e-learning, only 35% of the students were satisfied. The students expressed that the school’s administration team did a good job in developing the new tele-education curriculum for those in clinical training. In addition, responses indicated that students were open to case-based video learning and readings, when combined with the abbreviated clinical exposure during the make-up “clinical immersions periods” allowed for adequate learning. Overall, the survey responses show that more than half, approximately 54% of the medical students utilized telemedicine platforms during their clerkships that were impacted by COVID-19. The 4th-year medical students did not find tele-education and e-learning to be as effective as traditional medical education that combines in-person didactic classroom instructions and in-person face-to-face in hospital clerkships. Students felt that the telemedicine program that was rapidly set up due to the COVID-19 ‘lockdown’ was fragmented, since it was not a formal integration of a telemedicine E-learning program. Students would have preferred more ‘real’ cases to follow, instead of the ready-made, aquifer type of cases. Telemedicine has significant potential to address many of the challenges facing the medical education environment today. We believe now that people have become comfortable with this method of teaching, that even after the pandemic ends, we will continue to see tele-education used as a platform for medical education.","Franklin, Gillian; Martin, Clare; Ruszaj, Marc; Matin, Maliyat; Kataria, Akaash; Hu, Jinwei; Brickman, Arlen; Elkin, Peter L.",Life (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/life11040294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808274/,386
678289,Temporal Changes of CT Findings in 90 Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Longitudinal Study,2020-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Patients with severe COVID-19 develop a life-threatening hyperinflammatory response to the virus. Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. METHODS: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. FINDINGS: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0·450, 95% CI 0·204–0·990, p=0·047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0·900, 0·412–1·966; p=0·79). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0·866, 95% CI 0·482–1·553; p=0·63) or IL-6 inhibition (0·882, 0·452–1·722; p=0·71) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0·990, 95% CI 0·981–0·999; p=0·031) and adverse clinical outcome (0·987, 0·979–0·995; p=0·0021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1·009, 95% CI 1·003–1·014, p=0·0011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·006, 1·001–1·011, p=0·028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1·006, 1·002–1·010, p=0·0031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·005, 1·001–1·010, p=0·016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. INTERPRETATION: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

678837,"Spectrum of Endocrine Dysfunction and Association With Disease Severity in Patients With COVID-19: Insights From a Cross-Sectional, Observational Study",2021-07-02,"The heavy burden imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on our society triggered the race towards the development of therapies or preventive strategies. Among these, antibodies and vaccines are particularly attractive because of their high specificity, low probability of drug-drug interaction, and potentially long-standing protective effects. While the threat at hand justifies the pace of research, the implementation of therapeutic strategies cannot be exempted from safety considerations. There are several potential adverse events reported after the vaccination or antibody therapy, but two are of utmost importance: antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). On the other hand, the depletion or exhaustion of T-cells has been reported to be associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. This observation suggests a potential role of vaccines eliciting cellular immunity, which might simultaneously limit the risk of ADE and CSS. Such risk was proposed to be associated with FcR-induced activation of proinflammatory macrophages (M1) by Fu et al. 2020 and Iwasaki et al. 2020. All aspects of the newly developed vaccine (including the route of administration, delivery system, and adjuvant selection) may affect its effectiveness and safety. In this work we use a novel in silico approach (based on AI and bioinformatics methods) developed to support the design of epitope-based vaccines. We evaluated the capabilities of our method for predicting the immunogenicity of epitopes. Next, the results of our approach were compared with other vaccine-design strategies reported in the literature. The risk of immuno-toxicity was also assessed. The analysis of epitope conservation among other Coronaviridae was carried out in order to facilitate the selection of peptides shared across different SARS-CoV-2 strains and which might be conserved in emerging zootic coronavirus strains. Finally, the potential applicability of the selected epitopes for the development of a vaccine eliciting cellular immunity for COVID-19 was discussed, highlighting the benefits and challenges of such an approach.","Mazzocco, G.; Niemiec, I.; Myronov, A.; Skoczylas, P.; Kaczmarczyk, J.; Sanecka-Duin, A.; Gruba, K.; Król, P.; Drwal, M.; Szczepanik, M.; Pyrc, K.; Stępniak, P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.26.267997,386

In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with the viral genome, and propose a model of viral packaging through LLPS. N-protein condenses with specific RNA sequences in the first 1000 nts (5’-End) under physiological conditions and is enhanced at human upper airway temperatures. N-protein condensates exclude non-packaged RNA sequences. We comprehensively map sites bound by N-protein in the 5’-End and find preferences for single-stranded RNA flanked by stable structured elements. Liquid-like N-protein condensates form in mammalian cells in a concentration-dependent manner and can be altered by small molecules. Condensation of N-protein is sequence and structure specific, sensitive to human body temperature, and manipulatable with small molecules thus presenting screenable processes for identifying antiviral compounds effective against SARS-CoV-2.","Iserman, Christiane; Roden, Christine; Boerneke, Mark; Sealfon, Rachel; McLaughlin, Grace; Jungreis, Irwin; Park, Chris; Boppana, Avinash; Fritch, Ethan; Hou, Yixuan J.; Theesfeld, Chandra; Troyanskaya, Olga G; Baric, Ralph S.; Sheahan, Timothy P.; Weeks, Kevin; Gladfelter, Amy S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.147199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32587965/,386

However, it is not known whether specialty-specific recommendations for COVID-19 are followed by allergists. OBJECTIVES: By conducting this study, we aimed to determine the attitudes and experiences of adult/pediatric allergists on allergy management during COVID-19. METHOD: We used a 20-question survey to elicit data from allergists (residents and pediatric and adult allergists registered to the Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology) across Turkey via e-mail. We analyzed the data statistically for frequency distributions and descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A total of 183 allergists participated in the survey. Telemedicine was used for management of asthma (73%), allergic rhinitis (53%), atopic dermatitis (51%), chronic urticaria/angioedema (59%), drug hypersensitivity (45%), food allergy (48%), venom allergy (30%), anaphylaxis (22%), and hereditary angioedema (28%). Thirty-one percent of the respondents discontinued subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-four percent of the physicians reported interruption of systemic steroid use in asthma patients, and 25% of the respondents discontinued biological therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Allergists in Turkey have been using telemedicine at a high rate during the COVID-19 pandemic for asthma and rhinitis. The continuation rate of SCIT was low while the discontinuation rate of biologicals and systemic steroid use in asthma was high in Turkey.

ADPr-binding by the alphavirus nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) MD is necessary for the initiation of virus replication in neural cells, whereas hydrolase activity facilitates replication complex amplification. To determine the importance of these activities for pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis, mutations were introduced into the nsP3 MD of Sindbis virus (SINV), and the effects on ADPr binding and hydrolase activities, virus replication, immune responses, and disease were assessed. Elimination of ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities (G32E) severely impaired in vitro replication of SINV in neural cells and in vivo replication in the central nervous systems of 2-week-old mice with reversion to wild type (WT) (G) or selection of a less compromising change (S) during replication. SINVs with decreased binding and hydrolase activities (G32S and G32A) or with hydrolase deficiency combined with better ADPr-binding (Y114A) were less virulent than WT virus. Compared to the WT, the G32S virus replicated less well in both the brain and spinal cord, induced similar innate responses, and caused less severe disease with full recovery of survivors, whereas the Y114A virus replicated well, induced higher expression of interferon-stimulated and NF-κB-induced genes, and was cleared more slowly from the spinal cord with persistent paralysis in survivors. Therefore, MD function was important for neural cell replication both in vitro and in vivo and determined the outcome from alphavirus encephalomyelitis in mice.","Abraham, Rachy; McPherson, Robert L.; Dasovich, Morgan; Badiee, Mohsen; Leung, Anthony K.

To contribute to this question and to help clarify the possible risks, we analyzed 15 singing scenarios (1) qualitative, by making airflows visible, while singing, and (2) quantitative, by measuring air velocities in three distances (1m, 1.5m and 2m). Air movements were considered positive, when lying above 0.1 m/s, which is the usual room air velocity in venue, such as the concert hall of the Bamberg Symphony, where our measurements with three professional singers (female classical style, male classic style, female popular music styles) took place. Our findings highlight, that high measurements for respiratory air velocity while singing, are comparable to measurements of speaking and, by far, less than coughing. All measurements for singing stayed within a reach of 1.5m, only direct voiceless blowing achieved measurements at the 2m sensor. Singing styles, which use plosive sounds i.e. consonants more often, such as rap, produced the highest air velocities of 0.17 m/s at the 1m sensor. Also, singing, while wearing a facemask, produces no air movements over 0.1 m/s. On the basis of, our recent studies on measurements of airflows and air velocities of professional singers and wind instrument players, as well as further studies on CO2; measurements in room settings of music activities, we publish our results, in consideration of further up-to-date research, in our frequently updated risk assessment (first published in April 2020).

CONCLUSIONS: In COVID‐19 critically ill patients, a modified PT technique, including the use of a smaller ETT cuffed at the carina and fiber‐optic bronchoscope inserted between the tube and the inner surface of the trachea, may ensure a better airway management, respiratory function, patient comfort, and great safety for the staff.","Vargas, Maria; Russo, Gennaro; Iacovazzo, Carmine; Servillo, Giuseppe",Head Neck,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32437066/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26276,386
685166,COVID-19-related health worries compound the psychiatric distress experienced by families of high-risk infants,2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with increased incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), even among patients at low risk for venous thrombo-embolic (VTE) events. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 21-year-old male, with no previous medical history, who presented with cough, fevers, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and 1 day of dizziness with near syncope as well as acutely worsened dyspnoea. He was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 and massive PE. He underwent successful catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), and his clinical status improved. One day following initial CDT, he developed acute respiratory failure and hypotension and was diagnosed with recurrent massive PE. He was treated with repeat CDT and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to provide time for right ventricular recovery. The patient was able to be weaned off ECMO after 9 days and was eventually extubated and discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility. DISCUSSION: Beyond COVID-19, no hypercoagulable risk factors were identified despite thorough investigation. This case highlights the thrombogenic potential and morbid sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in young patients. It also highlights the use of CDT and ECMO among patients with massive PE and COVID-19. To date, this is the youngest reported patient to develop massive PE in the setting of COVID-19.","Hirschbaum, Julian H; Bradley, C Pierce; Kingsford, Philip; Mehra, Anilkumar; Kwan, Wilson",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268475/,386

This beta coronavirus potentially infects the alveolar cells of the lung leading to pneumonia. The disease may progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome especially in elderly patients with comorbidities. Therefore, it is of interest to design and develop candidates for treatment, therapy and prevention. The spike glycoprotein of the virus known to potentially interact with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as a cell entry receptor is a suitable candidate for further consideration as vaccine and treatment candidate. Hence, we screened the spike protein of coronavirus-2 for potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes for further deliberation. Thus, we document several peptides on the spike protein with predicted high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against selected proteases. The linear B-cell epitope with sequence 'GFNCYFPLQSYGF' is of particular interest in this context towards the design and development of short peptide vaccine candidates for combat and care against the virus.","Odhar, Hasanain Abdulhameed; Ahjel, Salam Waheed; Humadi, Suhad Sami",Bioinformation,https://doi.org/10.6026/97320630016375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831518/,386
685667,Protecting High-Risk Cardiac Patients During the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020-03-27,"OBJECTIVE: The Covid-19 pandemic eliminated nearly all visiting sub-internships. We seek to uncover match rate disparities across plastic surgery, otolaryngology, urology, and neurosurgery subspecialties with respect to in-person appraisals. These data aim to highlight the common practices as well as subtle differences that each subspecialty may be displaying in selecting their respective residency candidates. DESIGN: We accessed publicly available online spreadsheets between March 24 to 27 specific to the following surgical subspecialties: plastic surgery, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, and urology. We collected available information including the matched applicants' medical school, the institution at which they matched, and whether they had previous communication with their matched program. This data was then used to record whether the applicant matched at their home institution. SETTING: N/A PARTICIPANTS: N/A RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase in the number of plastic surgery and otolaryngology applicants who matched at their home programs during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle. 12.1% and 17.2% of plastic surgery applicants matched at their home program in the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 application cycles, compared to 25.0% during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle (pâ¯=â¯0.0345). Overall, 23.4% and 22.2% of otolaryngology applicants matched at their home program in the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 application cycles, compared to 31.3% during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle (pâ¯=â¯0.0482). Neurosurgery and urology applicants did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in home match rates during the 2020 to 2021 application cycle (pâ¯=â¯0.164 and pâ¯=â¯0.105, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 related restrictions in the 2020 to 2021 match cycle led residency programs to utilize novel selection mechanisms to evaluate applicants. Without visiting sub-internships during the 2020 to 2021 match cycle, some programs appear to have intentionally favored candidates with whom they were previously acquainted. The significantly higher number of international medical graduates and non-senior medical graduates among neurosurgery and urology residencies, respectively, likely washed out the home matching effect among these specialties but does not discount the importance of in-person appraisals.","Faletsky, Adam; Zitkovsky, Helen; Guo, Lifei",J. surg. educ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2021.07.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366285/,386
685782,Covid-19 and gender: lower rate but same mortality of severe disease in women—an observational study,2021-03-20,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection provides a critical host-immunological challenge. Aim: We explore the effect of host-genetic variation in interferon-lambda-3 rs12979860, Tolloid Like–1 (TLL1) rs17047200 and Discoidin domain receptor 1(DDR1) rs4618569 on host response to respiratory viral infections and disease severity that may probe the mechanistic approach of allelic variation in virus-induced inflammatory responses. Methods: 141 COVID-19 positive patients and 100 healthy controls were tested for interferon-lambda-3 rs12979860, TLL1 rs17047200 and DDR1 rs4618569 polymorphism by TaqMan probe-based genotyping. Different genotypes were assessed regarding the COVID-19 severity and prognosis. Results: There were statistically significant differences between the studied cases and control group with regard to the presence of comorbidities, total leucocytic count, lymphocytic count, CRP, serum LDH, ferritin and D-dimer (p < 0.01). The CC genotype of rs12979860 cytokine, the AA genotype of TLL1 rs17047200 and the AA genotype of the rs4618569 variant of DDR1 showed a higher incidence of COVID-19 compared to the others. There were significant differences between the rs4618569 variant of DDR and the outcome of the disease, with the highest mortality in AG genotype 29 (60.4%) in comparison to 16 (33.3%) and 3 (6.2%) in the AA and GG genotypes, respectively (p = 0.007*), suggesting that the A allele is associated with a poor outcome in the disease. Conclusion: Among people who carry C and A alleles of SNPs IFN-λ rs12979860 and TLL1 rs17047200, respectively, the AG genotype of the DDR1 rs4618569 variant is correlated with a COVID-19 poor outcome.

685843,SARS-Cov2: a meta-analysis of symptom distribution by continent in 7310 adult COVID-19 infected patients,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation elicited by a cytokine storm is considered a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aims to assess the validity and clinical utility of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein (CRP) ratio (LCR), typically used for gastric carcinoma prognostication, versus the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for predicting in-hospital outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the association of LCR and NLR with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), dialysis, upgrade to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. Independent t-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to calculate mean differences and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with its 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively. RESULTS: The mean age for NLR patients was 63.6 versus 61.6, and for LCR groups, it was 62.6 versus 63.7 years, respectively. The baseline comorbidities across all groups were comparable except that the higher LCR group had female predominance. The mean NLR was significantly higher for patients who died during hospitalization (19 vs. 7, P ≤ 0.001) and those requiring IMV (12 vs. 7, P = 0.01). Compared to alive patients, a significantly lower mean LCR was observed in patients who did not survive hospitalization (1,011 vs. 632, P = 0.04). For patients with a higher NLR (> 10), the unadjusted odds of mortality (odds ratios (ORs) 11.0, 3.6 - 33.0, P < 0.0001) and need for IMV (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4 - 7.7, P = 0.008) were significantly higher compared to patients with lower NLR. By contrast, for patients with lower LCR (< 100), the odds of in-hospital all-cause mortality were significantly higher compared to patients with a higher LCR (OR 0.2, 0.06 - 0.47, P = 0.001). The aORs controlled for baseline comorbidities and medications mirrored the overall results, indicating a genuinely significant correlation between these biomarkers and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: A high NLR and decreased LCR value predict higher odds of in-hospital mortality. A high LCR at presentation might indicate impending clinical deterioration and the need for IMV.","Ullah, Waqas; Basyal, Bikash; Tariq, Shafaq; Almas, Talal; Saeed, Rehan; Roomi, Sohaib; Haq, Shujaul; Madara, John; Boigon, Margot; Haas, Donald C.; Fischman, David L.",J Clin Med Res,https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr4227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32655735/,386

The interruption of immunosuppressive therapy is frequently suggested in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19; however, such an interruption potentially increases the risk of allograft rejection and hyperimmune response. We here report the successful treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in a kidney transplant recipient who received a sirolimus-based regimen. The course of COVID-19 management was favorable for maintaining sirolimus treatment. Nevertheless, the patient showed signs of extreme overexposure to sirolimus because of drug interaction with antiviral treatment.

Moreover, we discuss briefly mechanisms behind the inactivation of aminoglycosides, a major concern due to the increasing appearance of multiresistant bacterial strains. Taken together, the general knowledge about aminoglycoside and RNA interaction is of utmost importance in the process of identifying/developing the next generation or new classes of antibiotics.

688284,Clinical characteristics and predictors of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Southern Brazil,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus infection emerged in the Wuhan province of China and began to spread rapidly. In this study, we aimed to determine the differences between COVID‐19 disease and Influenza. METHODS: This retrospective study included 164 children with COVID‐19, as well as 46 children with Influenza. The two groups were compared with respect to clinical and laboratory parameters and the rates of intensive care and mechanical ventilation requirement. RESULTS: In both groups, the most common admission complaints were fever and cough. As compared to the COVID‐19 group, the Influenza group had significantly higher rates of cough (37 [80.4%] and 38 [23.2%]), fever (31 [67.4%] and 34 [20.7%]), muscle pain (34 [73.9%] and 31 [18.9%]), vomiting (13 [28.9%] and 8 [4.9%]) and tachypnea (32 [69.6%] and 3 [1.8%]) (P < .01 for all comparisons). The mean WBC count (7.10 ± 1.08 vs. 10.90 ± 1.82), mean neutrophil count (3.19 ± 0.58 vs. 6.04 ± 0.97), APTT, CRP, procalcitonin, ALT, and LDH levels were significantly lower in the COVID‐19 group compared to the Influenza group (P < .05 for all comparisons). There was, however, no significant difference between the mean lymphocyte counts of both groups. The Influenza group had significantly higher rates of intensive care requirement (19 [41.3%] vs. 3 [1.8%]) and mechanical ventilation requirement (16 [34.8%] vs. 2 [1.2%]) as well as a significantly higher mortality rate (7 [15.2%] vs. 2 [1.2%]) than the COVID‐19 group (P < .01). CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 and Influenza may share similar clinical features.

For COVID-19 these are currently unknown for children, with unanswered questions also on children’s role in transmission of the virus, the extent to which the vaccine will reduce transmission, and the expected benefit (if any) to the child. Ultimately, deciding whether to recommend that children receive a novel vaccine for a disease which is not a major threat to them, or to mandate the vaccine, requires precise information on risks, including disease severity and vaccine safety and effectiveness, and comparative evaluation of the alternatives, and of the levels of coercion associated with each. But the decision also requires balancing self-interest with duty to others, and liberty with utility. Separate to ensuring vaccine supply and access, we outline three requirements for mandatory vaccination from an ethical perspective: (1) whether the disease is a grave threat to the health of children and to public health; (2) positive comparative expected utility of mandatory vaccination and (3) proportionate coercion. We also suggest that the case for mandatory vaccine in children may be strong in the case of influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Savulescu, Julian; Giubilini, Alberto; Danchin, Margie",J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2021.01.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347621000287?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347621000287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484698/,386

However, owing to the low specificity of CT findings, differential diagnosis is essential. The typical CT findings of COVID‐19 include ground‐glass opacifications and consolidations with predominant distribution in bilateral, peripheral, and subpleural parts of the lung. These imaging findings are non‐specific and may resemble other lung conditions, including ultrasonic humidifier lung, which is a condition that develops on inhaling aerosols generated by ultrasonic humidifiers. We present two patients with initial symptoms similar to COVID‐19. CT examination revealed centrilobular nodules and consolidations with upper lobe‐predominant distribution, although atypical for COVID‐19, but key findings for ultrasonic humidifier lung. Therefore, ultrasonic humidifier lung could be a differential diagnosis for COVID‐19 in dry environments.

The respiratory microbiome is less studied than that of other areas, but it is believed to contribute to the host’s local immune education and to the development of respiratory diseases, including allergies, asthma and others. In this review, was highlighted the current clinical microbiology knowledge about the microbiota and the various lung diseases relationships, previously only indirectly related to microbial pathogenesis, and the microbiota–pathogenesis relationship of lung infection, among the main causes of diseases, in order to prevent and help in a targeted treatment of various lung diseases. ABSTRACT: The recent COVID-19 pandemic promoted efforts to better understand the organization of the respiratory microbiome and its evolution from birth to adulthood and how it interacts with external pathogens and the host immune system. This review aims to deepen understanding of the essential physiological functions of the resident microbiome of the respiratory system on human health and diseases. First, the general characteristics of the normal microbiota in the different anatomical sites of the airways have been reported in relation to some factors such as the effect of age, diet and others on its composition and stability. Second, we analyze in detail the functions and composition and the correct functionality of the microbiome in the light of current knowledge. Several studies suggest the importance of preserving the micro-ecosystem of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microbes of the respiratory system, and, more recently, its relationship with the intestinal microbiome, and how it also leads to the maintenance of human health, has become better understood.","Santacroce, Luigi; Charitos, Ioannis Alexandros; Ballini, Andrea; Inchingolo, Francesco; Luperto, Paolo; De Nitto, Emanuele; Topi, Skender",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33019595/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9100318,386
