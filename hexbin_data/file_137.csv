291,291,291,Ducks: The “Trojan Horses” of H5N1 influenza,12.251716,7.988442,2009-05-31,"Abstract Wild ducks are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses that can be transmitted to domestic poultry and mammals, including humans. Of the 16 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of influenza A viruses, only the H5 and H7 subtypes cause highly pathogenic (HP) influenza in the natural hosts. Several duck species are naturally resistant to HP Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. These duck species can shed and spread virus from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts while showing few or no disease signs. While the HP Asian H5N1 viruses are 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry, the absence of disease signs in some duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the “Trojan horses” of H5N1 in their surreptitious spread of virus. An important unresolved issue is whether the HP H5N1 viruses are maintained in the wild duck population of the world. Here, we review the ecology and pathobiology of ducks infected with influenza A viruses and ducks’ role in the maintenance and spread of HP H5N1 viruses. We also identify the key questions about the role of ducks that must be resolved in order to understand the emergence and control of pandemic influenza. It is generally accepted that wild duck species can spread HP H5N1 viruses, but there is insufficient evidence to show that ducks maintain these viruses and transfer them from one generation to the next.","Kim, Jeong‐Ki; Negovetich, Nicholas J.; Forrest, Heather L.; Webster, Robert G.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,137,1
336,336,336,Analysis of Memory B Cell Responses and Isolation of Novel Monoclonal Antibodies with Neutralizing Breadth from HIV-1-Infected Individuals,12.302882,8.092127,2010-01-20,"BACKGROUND: The isolation of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize a broad spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates and the characterization of the human neutralizing antibody B cell response to HIV-1 infection are important goals that are central to the design of an effective antibody-based vaccine. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We immortalized IgG(+) memory B cells from individuals infected with diverse clades of HIV-1 and selected on the basis of plasma neutralization profiles that were cross-clade and relatively potent. Culture supernatants were screened using various recombinant forms of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) in multiple parallel assays. We isolated 58 mAbs that were mapped to different Env surfaces, most of which showed neutralizing activity. One mAb in particular (HJ16) specific for a novel epitope proximal to the CD4 binding site on gp120 selectively neutralized a multi-clade panel of Tier-2 HIV-1 pseudoviruses, and demonstrated reactivity that was comparable in breadth, but distinct in neutralization specificity, to that of the other CD4 binding site-specific neutralizing mAb b12. A second mAb (HGN194) bound a conserved epitope in the V3 crown and neutralized all Tier-1 and a proportion of Tier-2 pseudoviruses tested, irrespective of clade. A third mAb (HK20) with broad neutralizing activity, particularly as a Fab fragment, recognized a highly conserved epitope in the HR-1 region of gp41, but showed striking assay-dependent selectivity in its activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that by using appropriate screening methods, a large proportion of memory B cells can be isolated that produce mAbs with HIV-1 neutralizing activity. Three of these mAbs show unusual breadth of neutralization and therefore add to the current panel of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies with potential for passive protection and template-based vaccine design.","Corti, Davide; Langedijk, Johannes P.

513,513,513,Hepatitis Associated Aplastic Anemia: A review,12.538223,7.815412,2011-02-28,"Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is an uncommon but distinct variant of aplastic anemia in which pancytopenia appears two to three months after an acute attack of hepatitis. HAAA occurs most frequently in young male children and is lethal if leave untreated. The etiology of this syndrome is proposed to be attributed to various hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses. Several hepatitis viruses such as HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV have been associated with this set of symptoms. Viruses other than the hepatitis viruses such as parvovirus B19, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein bar virus, Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) and non-A-E hepatitis virus (unknown viruses) has also been documented to develop the syndrome. Considerable evidences including the clinical features, severe imbalance of the T cell immune system and effective response to immunosuppressive therapy strongly present HAAA as an immune mediated mechanism. However, no association of HAAA has been found with blood transfusions, drugs and toxins. Besides hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses and immunopathogenesis phenomenon as causative agents of the disorder, telomerase mutation, a genetic factor has also been predisposed for the development of aplastic anemia. Diagnosis includes clinical manifestations, blood profiling, viral serological markers testing, immune functioning and bone marrow hypocellularity examination. Patients presenting the features of HAAA have been mostly treated with bone marrow or hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA matched donor, and if not available then by immunosuppressive therapy. New therapeutic approaches involve the administration of steroids especially the glucocorticoids to augment the immunosuppressive therapy response. Pancytopenia following an episode of acute hepatitis response better to hematopoietic cell transplantation than immunosuppressive therapy.","Rauff, Bisma; Idrees, Muhammad; Shah, Shahida Amjad Riaz; Butt, Sadia; Butt, Azeem M; Ali, Liaqat; Hussain, Abrar; Irshad-ur-Rehman; Ali, Muhammad",Virol J,137,1
546,546,546,"Novel, Divergent Simian Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses in a Wild Ugandan Red Colobus Monkey Discovered Using Direct Pyrosequencing",12.1534,7.9453692,2011-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) has caused lethal outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in captive primates, but its distribution in wild primates has remained obscure. Here, we describe the discovery and genetic characterization by direct pyrosequencing of two novel, divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single male red colobus monkey from Kibale National Park, Uganda. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The viruses were detected directly from blood plasma using pyrosequencing, without prior virus isolation and with minimal PCR amplification. The two new SHFV variants, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other (51.9% nucleotide sequence identity) and from the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (52.0% and 51.8% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively) and demonstrate greater phylogenetic diversity within SHFV than has been documented within any other arterivirus. Both new variants nevertheless have the same 3′ genomic architecture as the type strain, containing three open reading frames not present in the other arteriviruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results represent the first documentation of SHFV in a wild primate and confirm the unusual 3′ genetic architecture of SHFV relative to the other arteriviruses. They also demonstrate a degree of evolutionary divergence within SHFV that is roughly equivalent to the degree of divergence between other arterivirus species. The presence of two such highly divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single individual represents a degree of within-host viral diversity that exceeds what has previously been reported for any arterivirus. These results expand our knowledge of the natural history and diversity of the arteriviruses and underscore the importance of wild primates as reservoirs for novel pathogens.","Lauck, Michael; Hyeroba, David; Tumukunde, Alex; Weny, Geoffrey; Lank, Simon M.; Chapman, Colin A.; O'Connor, David H.; Friedrich, Thomas C.; Goldberg, Tony L.",PLoS One,137,1
555,555,555,"A Simple, Inexpensive Device for Nucleic Acid Amplification without Electricity—Toward Instrument-Free Molecular Diagnostics in Low-Resource Settings",12.328649,7.8647304,2011-05-09,"BACKGROUND: Molecular assays targeted to nucleic acid (NA) markers are becoming increasingly important to medical diagnostics. However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.","LaBarre, Paul; Hawkins, Kenneth R.; Gerlach, Jay; Wilmoth, Jared; Beddoe, Andrew; Singleton, Jered; Boyle, David; Weigl, Bernhard",PLoS One,137,1

859,859,859,Directed Fusion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Cardiomyocytes via VSV-G Facilitates Stem Cell Programming,12.269024,8.2761,2012-05-30,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) spontaneously fuse with somatic cells in vivo, albeit rarely, and the fusion products are capable of tissue-specific function (mature trait) or proliferation (immature trait), depending on the microenvironment. That stem cells can be programmed, or somatic cells reprogrammed, in this fashion suggests that stem cell fusion holds promise as a therapeutic approach for the repair of damaged tissues, especially tissues not readily capable of functional regeneration, such as the myocardium. In an attempt to increase the frequency of stem cell fusion and, in so doing, increase the potential for cardiac tissue repair, we expressed the fusogen of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) in human MSCs. We found VSV-G expressing MSCs (vMSCs) fused with cardiomyocytes (CMs) and these fusion products adopted a CM-like phenotype and morphology in vitro. In vivo, vMSCs delivered to damaged mouse myocardium via a collagen patch were able to home to the myocardium and fuse to cells within the infarct and peri-infarct region of the myocardium. This study provides a basis for the investigation of the biological impact of fusion of stem cells with CMs in vivo and illustrates how viral fusion proteins might better enable such studies.","Kouris, Nicholas A.; Schaefer, Jeremy A.; Hatta, Masato; Freeman, Brian T.; Kamp, Timothy J.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Ogle, Brenda M.",Stem Cells Int,137,8

In this study, however, we show that the Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mouse strain accumulates large numbers of CD8(+) T cells in the lung as infection progresses, and that these cells display a dysfunctional and immunosuppressive phenotype (PD-1(+), Tim-3(+), CD122(+)). CD8(+) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(+) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(+) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vβ chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vβ 14. Although Vβ8(+) CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vβ8(+) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-γ secreting profiles. Our data demonstrate that IL-10-secreting CD8(+) T cells can arise during chronic Mtb infection, although the significance of this T cell population in tuberculosis pathogenesis remains unclear.","Cyktor, Joshua C.; Carruthers, Bridget; Beamer, Gillian L.; Turner, Joanne",PLoS One,137,1

1196,1196,1196,Microglia Play a Major Role in Direct Viral-Induced Demyelination,12.560632,7.895639,2013-06-20,"Microglia are the resident macrophage-like populations in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia remain quiescent, unable to perform effector and antigen presentation (APC) functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that microglia can be persistently infected by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis with subsequent axonal loss, and demyelination and serve as a virus-induced model of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Current studies revealed that MHV infection is associated with the pronounced activation of microglia during acute inflammation, as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of microglia-specific proteins, Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), which is a macrophage/microglia-specific novel calcium-binding protein and involved in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis. During chronic inflammation (day 30 postinfection), microglia were still present within areas of demyelination. Experiments performed in ex vivo spinal cord slice culture and in vitro neonatal microglial culture confirmed direct microglial infection. Our results suggest that MHV can directly infect and activate microglia during acute inflammation, which in turn during chronic inflammation stage causes phagocytosis of myelin sheath leading to chronic inflammatory demyelination.","Chatterjee, Dhriti; Biswas, Kaushiki; Nag, Soma; Ramachandra, S.

1303,1303,1303,Confounding roles for type I interferons during bacterial and viral pathogenesis,12.346877,7.7422132,2013-10-24,"Although type I interferons (IFN-I) were initially defined as potent antiviral agents, they can also cause decreased host resistance to some bacterial and viral infections. The many antiviral functions of the IFN-I include direct suppression of viral replication and activation of the immune response against viruses. In addition to their antiviral effects, IFN-I are also protective against several extracellular bacterial infections, in part, by promoting the induction of TNF-α and nitric oxide. In contrast, there is a negative effect of IFN-I on host resistance during chronic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and acute infections with intracellular bacteria. In the case of LCMV, chronic IFN-I signaling induces adaptive immune system suppression. Blockade of IFN-I signaling removes the suppression and allows CD4 T-cell- and IFN-γ-mediated resolution of the infection. During acute intracellular bacterial infection, IFN-I suppress innate immunity by at least two defined mechanisms. During Francisella infection, IFN-I prevent IL-17 upregulation on γδ T cells and neutrophil recruitment. Following Listeria infection, IFN-I promote the cell death of macrophages and lymphocytes, which leads to innate immune suppression. These divergent findings for the role of IFN-I on pathogen control emphasize the complexity of the interferons system and force more mechanistic evaluation of its role in pathogenesis. This review evaluates IFN-I during infection with an emphasis on work carried out IFN-I-receptor-deficient mice.","Carrero, Javier Antonio",International Immunology,137,1

Between 15–70% of reported cases are fatal. There is no approved vaccine available, and preclinical protection in vivo by an experimental vaccine has not been demonstrated previously. In the present study, the attenuated poxvirus vector, Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the CCHF virus glycoproteins. Cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in two mouse strains, including type I interferon receptor knockout mice, which are susceptible to CCHF disease. This vaccine protected all recipient animals from lethal disease in a challenge model adapted to represent infection via a tick bite. Histopathology and viral load analysis of protected animals confirmed that they had been exposed to challenge virus, even though they did not exhibit clinical signs. This is the first demonstration of efficacy of a CCHF vaccine.","Buttigieg, Karen R.; Dowall, Stuart D.; Findlay-Wilson, Stephen; Miloszewska, Aleksandra; Rayner, Emma; Hewson, Roger; Carroll, Miles W.",PLoS One,137,1
1429,1429,1429,The Regulation of Autophagy by Influenza A Virus,12.537167,8.107077,2014-03-23,"Influenza A virus is a dreadful pathogen of animals and humans, causing widespread infection and severe morbidity and mortality. It is essential to characterize the influenza A virus-host interaction and develop efficient counter measures against the viral infection. Autophagy is known as a catabolic process for the recycling of the cytoplasmic macromolecules. Recently, it has been shown that autophagy is a critical mechanism underlying the interaction between influenza A virus and its host. Autophagy can be induced by the infection with influenza A virus, which is considered as a necessary process for the viral proliferation, including the accumulation of viral elements during the replication of influenza A virus. On the other hand, influenza A virus can inhibit the autophagic formation via interaction with the autophagy-related genes (Atg) and signaling pathways. In addition, autophagy is involved in the influenza virus-regulated cell deaths, leading to significant changes in host apoptosis. Interestingly, the high pathogenic strains of influenza A virus, such as H5N1, stimulate autophagic cell death and appear to interplay with the autophagy in distinct ways as compared with low pathogenic strains. This review discusses the regulation of autophagy, an influenza A virus driven process.","Zhang, Rong; Chi, Xiaojuan; Wang, Song; Qi, Baomin; Yu, Xiaoqiang; Chen, Ji-Long",Biomed Res Int,137,28
1487,1487,1487,A comparative study of experimental mouse models of central nervous system demyelination,12.428125,7.976217,2014-04-10,"Several mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) are now available. We have established a mouse model, in which ocular infection with a recombinant HSV-1 that expresses murine IL-2 constitutively (HSV-IL-2) causes CNS demyelination in different strains of mice. This model differs from most other models in that it represents a mixture of viral and immune triggers. In the present study, we directly compared MOG(35–55), MBP(35–47), and PLP(190–209) models of EAE with our HSV-IL-2-induced MS model. Mice with HSV-IL-2-induced and MOG-induced demyelinating diseases demonstrated a similar pattern and distribution of demyelination in their brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. In contrast, no demyelination was detected in the optic nerves of MBP- and PLP-injected mice. IFN-β injections significantly reduced demyelination in brains of all groups, in the spinal cords of the MOG and MBP groups, and completely blocked it in the spinal cords of the PLP and HSV-IL-2 groups as well as in optic nerves of MOG and HSV-IL-2 groups. In contrast to IFN-β treatment, IL-12p70 protected the HSV-IL-2 group from demyelination, while IL-4 was not effective at all in preventing demyelination. MOG-injected mice showed clinical signs of paralysis and disease-related mortality whereas mice in the other treatment groups did not. Collectively, the results indicate that the HSV-IL-2 model and the MOG model complement each other and, together, provide unique insights into the heterogeneity of human MS.","Dumitrascu, Oana M.; Mott, Kevin R.; Ghiasi, Homayon",Gene Ther,137,1

Evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease. METHODS: Mice were infected intracranially with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Infected animals were treated with increasing doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 and morbidity and mortality recorded. Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells (tetramer staining) into the CNS of FTY720-treated mice was determined using flow cytometry. The effects of FTY720 treatment on virus-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity were also determined. The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in FTY720-treated mice was examined by flow cytometry and histopathologically, respectively, in the spinal cords of the mice. RESULTS: Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased clinical disease severity and mortality. These results correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication (P < 0.05) within the CNS at days 7 and 14 post-infection, which was associated with diminished accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.05) into the CNS. Reduced neuroinflammation in FTY720-treated mice correlated with increased retention of T lymphocytes within draining cervical lymph nodes (P < 0.05). Treatment with FTY720 did not affect virus-specific T cell proliferation, expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α or cytolytic activity. FTY720-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses through impacting migration and accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis. FTY720 treatment reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination by restricting the access of disease-causing lymphocytes into the CNS but is not associated with viral recrudescence in this model.","Blanc, Caroline A; Rosen, Hugh; Lane, Thomas E",J Neuroinflammation,137,1

Sonic hedgehog (SHH) released from astrocytes plays an important role in the maintenance of BBB integrity. BBB disruption and microglial activation are common pathological features of various neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a major pro-inflammatory cytokine released from activated microglia, increases BBB permeability. Here we show that IL-1β abolishes the protective effect of astrocytes on BBB integrity by suppressing astrocytic SHH production. Astrocyte conditioned media, SHH, or SHH signal agonist strengthened BBB integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins, whereas SHH signal inhibitor abrogated these effects. Moreover, IL-1β increased astrocytic production of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CCL20, and CXCL2, which induce immune cell migration and exacerbate BBB disruption and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that astrocytic SHH is a potential therapeutic target that could be used to restore disrupted BBB in patients with neurologic diseases.","Wang, Yue; Jin, Shijie; Sonobe, Yoshifumi; Cheng, Yi; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Parajuli, Bijay; Kawanokuchi, Jun; Mizuno, Tetsuya; Takeuchi, Hideyuki; Suzumura, Akio",PLoS One,137,1

Restricted expression of the IFN-λ receptor, and the ability of IFN-λ to induce IFN-stimulated genes in HCV-infected cells, suggest potential roles for IFN-λ in HCV therapy even in this era of directly acting antivirals. This review summarizes our current understanding of the IFN-λ family and the role of λ IFNs in the natural history of HCV infection.","Laidlaw, Stephen M.; Dustin, Lynn B.",Front Immunol,137,1

During these responses, endogenous glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, become highly reactive and may secrete inflammatory mediators that regulate BBB permeability and recruit additional circulating immune cells. Here, we discuss the various roles played by astrocytes, microglia, and infiltrating immune cells during host immunity to non-tumor antigens in the CNS, focusing first on bacterial and viral infections, and then turning to responses directed against self-antigens in the setting of CNS autoimmunity.","Huber, Amanda K.; Duncker, Patrick C.; Irani, David N.",Front Oncol,137,1
1756,1756,1756,A Novel Host-Proteome Signature for Distinguishing between Acute Bacterial and Viral Infections,12.435142,8.126049,2015-03-18,"Bacterial and viral infections are often clinically indistinguishable, leading to inappropriate patient management and antibiotic misuse. Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral- and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the individual proteins (P<0.001), as well as routinely used clinical parameters and their combinations (P<0.001). It remained robust across different physiological systems, times from symptom onset, and pathogens (AUCs 0.87-1.0). The accurate differential diagnosis provided by this novel combination of viral- and bacterial-induced proteins has the potential to improve management of patients with acute infections and reduce antibiotic misuse.","Oved, Kfir; Cohen, Asi; Boico, Olga; Navon, Roy; Friedman, Tom; Etshtein, Liat; Kriger, Or; Bamberger, Ellen; Fonar, Yura; Yacobov, Renata; Wolchinsky, Ron; Denkberg, Galit; Dotan, Yaniv; Hochberg, Amit; Reiter, Yoram; Grupper, Moti; Srugo, Isaac; Feigin, Paul; Gorfine, Malka; Chistyakov, Irina; Dagan, Ron; Klein, Adi; Potasman, Israel; Eden, Eran",PLoS One,137,1

Chemokines, which are known to play a role in inflammation, are also involved in the remyelination process. We aimed to demonstrate that remyelination-stimulating factors are altered in the brainstem of 1- and 6-month-old taiep rats. We used a Rat RT(2) Profiler PCR Array to assess mRNA expression of 84 genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors. We also evaluated protein levels of CCL2, CCR1, CCR2, CCL5, CCR5, CCR8, CXCL1, CXCR2, CXCR4, FGF2, and VEGFA by ELISA. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as a control. PCR Array procedure showed that proinflammatory cytokines were not upregulated in the taiep rat. In contrast, some mRNA levels of beta and alpha chemokines were upregulated in 1-month-old rats, but CXCR4 was downregulated at their 6 months of age. ELISA results showed that CXCL1, CCL2, CCR2, CCR5, CCR8, and CXCR4 protein levels were decreased in brainstem at the age of 6 months. These results suggest the presence of a chronic neuroinflammation process with deficiency of remyelination-stimulating factors (CXCL1, CXCR2, and CXCR4), which might account for the demyelination in the taiep rat.","Soto-Rodriguez, Guadalupe; Gonzalez-Barrios, Juan-Antonio; Martinez-Fong, Daniel; Blanco-Alvarez, Victor-Manuel; Eguibar, Jose R.; Ugarte, Araceli; Martinez-Perez, Francisco; Brambila, Eduardo; Millán-Perez Peña, Lourdes; Pazos-Salazar, Nidia-Gary; Torres-Soto, Maricela; Garcia-Robles, Guadalupe; Tomas-Sanchez, Constantino; Leon-Chavez, Bertha Alicia",Oxid Med Cell Longev,137,8

This study examines the effects of the route of administration of a live attenuated vaccine on its interactions with, and stimulation of, the murine immune system as well as its ability to increase survival and provide protection from colonisation by a virulent challenge strain. We assess the effect of administration method using the murine model for typhoid, where animals are infected with S. Typhimurium. Mice were vaccinated either intravenously or orally with the same live attenuated S. Typhimurium strain and data were collected on vaccine strain growth, shedding and stimulation of antibodies and cytokines. Following vaccination, mice were challenged with a virulent strain of S. Typhimurium and the protection conferred by the different vaccination routes was measured in terms of challenge suppression and animal survival. The main difference in immune stimulation found in this study was the development of a secretory IgA response in orally-vaccinated mice, which was absent in IV vaccinated mice. While both strains showed similar protection in terms of challenge suppression in systemic organs (spleen and liver) as well as survival, they differed in terms of challenge suppression of virulent pathogens in gut-associated organs. This difference in gut colonisation presents important questions around the ability of vaccines to prevent shedding and transmission. These findings demonstrate that while protection conferred by two vaccines can appear to be the same, the mechanisms controlling the protection can differ and have important implications for infection dynamics within a population.","Kinnear, Clare L.; Strugnell, Richard A.",PLoS One,137,1

A better understanding of the ferroptotic death mechanism could lead to the development of new therapeutics for degenerative diseases, and a better understanding of how to induce ferroptosis in specific tumor contexts. We performed an unbiased genome-wide siRNA screen to find genetic suppressors of ferroptosis. We determined that loss of CARS, the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, suppresses ferroptosis induced by erastin, which inhibits the cystine–glutamate antiporter known as system x(c)(−). Knockdown of CARS inhibited erastin-induced death by preventing the induction of lipid reactive oxygen species, without altering iron homeostasis. Knockdown of CARS led to the accumulation of cystathionine, a metabolite on the transsulfuration pathway, and upregulated genes associated with serine biosynthesis and transsulfuration. In addition, inhibition of the transsulfuration pathway resensitized cells to erastin, even after CARS knockdown. These studies demonstrate a new mechanism of resistance to ferroptosis and may lead to strategies for inducing and suppressing ferroptosis in diverse contexts.","Hayano, M; Yang, W S; Corn, C K; Pagano, N C; Stockwell, B R",Cell Death Differ,137,8

EBV integration has been reported, but its scale and impact to cancer development is remains unclear. C666-1 (NPC cell line) and Raji (BL cell line) are commonly studied EBV-positive cancer cells. A rare few EBV integration sites in Raji were found in previous research by traditional methods. To deeply survey EBV integration, we sequenced C666-1 and Raji whole genomes by the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and a total of 909 breakpoints were detected in the two cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the number of integration sites was positive correlated with the total amount of chromosome structural variations (SVs) and copy number structural variations (CNVs), and most breakpoints located inside or nearby genome structural variations regions. It suggested that host genome instability provided an opportunity for EBV integration on one hand and the integration aggravated host genome instability on the other hand. Then, we respectively assembled the C666-1 and Raji EBV strains which would be useful resources for EBV-relative studies. Thus, we report the most comprehensive characterization of EBV integration in NPC cell and BL cell, and EBV shows the wide range and random integration to increase the tumorigenesis. The NGS provides an incomparable level of resolution on EBV integration and a convenient approach to obtain viral strain compared to any research technology before.","Xiao, Kai; Yu, Zhengyuan; Li, Xiayu; Li, Xiaoling; Tang, Ke; Tu, Chaofeng; Qi, Peng; Liao, Qianjin; Chen, Pan; Zeng, Zhaoyang; Li, Guiyuan; Xiong, Wei",J Cancer,137,28

Although in total 16 high-risk HPV strains have been identified so far. Currently available commercial vaccines are designed by targeting mainly HPV16 and HPV18 viral strains as these are the most common strains associated with cervical cancer. Because of the high level of antigenic specificity of HPV capsid antigens, the currently available vaccines are not suitable to provide cross-protection from all other high-risk HPV strains. Due to increasing reports of cervical cancer cases from other HPV high-risk strains other than HPV16 and 18, it is crucial to design vaccine that generate reasonable CD8+ T-cell responses for possibly all the high-risk strains. With this aim, we have developed a computational workflow to identify conserved cross-clade CD8+ T-cell HPV vaccine candidates by considering E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from all the high-risk HPV strains. We have identified a set of 14 immunogenic conserved peptide fragments that are supposed to provide protection against infection from any of the high-risk HPV strains across globe.

It is not well-known whether influenza virus infection affects cell death and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication in HIV-1-infected patients. Using a lymphoma cell line, Jurkat, we examined the in vitro effects of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1) infection on cell death and HIV-1 RNA production in infected cells. We found that pH1N1 infection increased apoptotic cell death through Fas and Bax-mediated pathways in HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells. Infection with pH1N1 virus could promote HIV-1 RNA production by activating host transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ĸB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways and T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-related pathways. The replication of HIV-1 latent infection could be reactivated by pH1N1 infection through TCR and apoptotic pathways. These data indicate that HIV-1 replication can be activated by pH1N1 virus in HIV-1-infected cells resulting in induction of cell death through apoptotic pathways.","Wang, Xue; Tan, Jiying; Biswas, Santanu; Zhao, Jiangqin; Devadas, Krishnakumar; Ye, Zhiping; Hewlett, Indira",Viruses,137,28

Here, we report on the construction of two chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that utilize a carbonic anhydrase (CA) domain mapped, human single chain antibody (scFv G36) as a targeting moiety but differ in their capacity to provide costimulatory signaling for optimal T cell proliferation and tumor cell killing. The resulting anti-CAIX CARs were expressed on human primary T cells via lentivirus transduction. CAR-transduced T cells (CART cells) expressing second-generation G36-CD28-TCRζ exhibited more potent in vitro antitumor effects on CAIX(+) RCC cells than first-generation G36-CD8-TCRζ including cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, proliferation, and clonal expansion. Adoptive G36-CD28-TCRζ CART cell therapy combined with high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 injection also lead to superior regression of established RCC in nude mice with evidence of tumor cell apoptosis and tissue necrosis. These results suggest that the fully human G36-CD28-TCRζ CARs should provide substantial improvements over first-generation mouse anti-CAIX CARs in clinical use through reduced human anti-mouse antibody responses against the targeting scFv and administration of lower doses of T cells during CART cell therapy of CAIX(+) RCC.","Lo, Agnes Shuk-Yee; Xu, Chen; Murakami, Akikazu; Marasco, Wayne A",Mol Ther Oncolytics,137,11

In this context, ciprofloxacin is part of the first-line of countermeasures against numerous high consequence bacteria. Significant resistance can occur via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and deletions within ciprofloxacin targeted genes. Ideally, use of ciprofloxacin would be prefaced with AR determination to avoid overuse or misuse of the antibiotic. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of a panel of 44 single-stranded molecular inversion probes (MIPs) coupled to next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the detection of genetic variants known to confer ciprofloxacin resistance in Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis. Sequencing results demonstrate MIPs capture and amplify targeted regions of interest at significant levels of coverage. Depending on the genetic variant, limits of detection (LOD) for high-throughput pooled sequencing ranged from approximately 300–1800 input genome copies. LODs increased 10-fold in the presence of contaminating human genome DNA. In addition, we show that MIPs can be used as an enrichment step with high resolution melt (HRM) real-time PCR which is a sensitive assay with a rapid time-to-answer. Overall, this technology is a multiplexable upfront enrichment applicable with multiple downstream molecular assays for the detection of targeted genetic regions.","Stefan, Christopher P.; Koehler, Jeffrey W.; Minogue, Timothy D.",Sci Rep,137,1

The hNPCs used in that study were derived by a novel direct differentiation method (direct differentiation, DD-NPCs) that resulted in a unique gene expression pattern when compared to hNPCs derived by conventional methods. Since the therapeutic potential of human NPCs may differ greatly depending on the method of derivation and culture, we wanted to determine whether NPCs differentiated using conventional methods would be similarly effective in improving clinical outcome under neuroinflammatory demyelinating conditions. For the current study, we utilized hNPCs differentiated from a human induced pluripotent cell line via an embryoid body intermediate stage (EB-NPCs). Intraspinal transplantation of EB-NPCs into mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in decreased accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the central nervous system that was concomitant with reduced demyelination at the site of injection. Dampened neuroinflammation and remyelination was correlated with a transient increase in CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) concentrated within the peripheral lymphatics. However, compared to our earlier study, pathological improvements were modest and did not result in significant clinical recovery. We conclude that the genetic signature of NPCs is critical to their effectiveness in this model of viral-induced neurologic disease. These comparisons will be useful for understanding what factors are critical for the sustained clinical improvement.","Plaisted, Warren C.; Zavala, Angel; Hingco, Edna; Tran, Ha; Coleman, Ronald; Lane, Thomas E.; Loring, Jeanne F.; Walsh, Craig M.",PLoS One,137,8

Objectives We aimed to develop an air interface EVOC using pig tracheas in the study of influenza infection demonstrating that tracheal explants can be effectively maintained in organ culture and support productive influenza infection. Methods Tracheal explants were maintained in the air interface EVOC system for 7 days. Histological characteristics were analysed with different staining protocols and co‐ordinated ciliary movement on the epithelial surface was evaluated through a bead clearance assay. Explants were infected with a swine H1N1 influenza virus. Influenza infection of epithelial cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and viral replication was quantified by plaque assays and real‐time RT‐PCR. Results Histological analysis and bead clearance assay showed that the tissue architecture of the explants was maintained for up to 7 days, while ciliary movement exhibited a gradual decrease after 4 days. Challenge with swine H1N1 influenza virus showed that the EVOC tracheal system shows histological changes consistent with in vivo influenza infection and supported productive viral replication over multiple cycles of infection. Conclusion The air interface EVOC system using pig trachea described here constitutes a useful biological tool with a wide range of applications in the study of influenza infection.","Nunes, Sandro F.; Murcia, Pablo R.; Tiley, Laurence S.; Brown, Ian H.; Tucker, Alexander W.; Maskell, Duncan J.; Wood, James Lionel N.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,137,1

To address these gaps in our knowledge, we leveraged a nonhuman primate model of VZV infection where rhesus macaques are intrabronchially challenged with the closely related Simian Varicella Virus (SVV). Acute infection is characterized by immune infiltration of the lung airways, a significant up-regulation of genes involved in antiviral-immunity, and a down-regulation of genes involved in lung development. This is followed by a decrease in viral loads and increased expression of genes associated with cell cycle and tissue repair. These data provide the first characterization of the host response required to control varicella virus replication in the lung and provide insight into mechanisms by which VZV infection can cause lung injury in an immune competent host.","Arnold, Nicole; Girke, Thomas; Sureshchandra, Suhas; Nguyen, Christina; Rais, Maham; Messaoudi, Ilhem",Sci Rep,137,1

The Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse reference population is a promising model for pharmacogenomic studies because of its large amount of genetic variation, genetic reproducibility, and dense recombination sites. While the CC lines are phenotypically diverse, their genetic diversity in drug disposition processes, such as detoxification reactions, is still largely uncharacterized. Here we systematically measured RNA-sequencing expression profiles from livers of 29 CC lines under baseline conditions. We then leveraged a reference collection of metabolic biotransformation pathways to map potential relations between drugs and their underlying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By applying this approach on proximal eQTLs, including eQTLs acting on the overall expression of genes and on the expression of particular transcript isoforms, we were able to construct the organization of hepatic eQTL-drug connectivity across the CC population. The analysis revealed a substantial impact of genetic variation acting on drug biotransformation, allowed mapping of potential joint genetic effects in the context of individual drugs, and demonstrated crosstalk between drug metabolism and lipid metabolism. Our findings provide a resource for investigating drug disposition in the CC strains, and offer a new paradigm for integrating biotransformation reactions to corresponding variations in DNA sequences.","Nachshon, Aharon; Abu-Toamih Atamni, Hanifa J.; Steuerman, Yael; Sheikh-Hamed, Roa'a; Dorman, Alexandra; Mott, Richard; Dohm, Juliane C.; Lehrach, Hans; Sultan, Marc; Shamir, Ron; Sauer, Sascha; Himmelbauer, Heinz; Iraqi, Fuad A.; Gat-Viks, Irit",Front Genet,137,17

Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. OBJECTIVES: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. METHODS: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Sequencing data of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT‐PCR‐positive specimens were analysed. RESULTS: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real‐time PCR in 20.9% (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV‐positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species. Eighty per cent (16/20) of sequences that grouped as HRV C in the VP4/VP2 tree clustered as HRV A, alongside some previously described C strains as subspecies C/A. Discordant branching was seen within HRV A group: two sequences clustering as A in the VP4/VP2 tree branched within the C/A subspecies in the 5′UTR tree, and one sequence showed identity to different HRV A strains in the two genes. The prevalence of HRV C and C/A species was greater in paediatric compared to adult patients (47.9% vs 25.5%, P = .032). CONCLUSION: Human rhinoviruses are a common cause of respiratory infections, and HRV C is present in the Southern Hemisphere.

In this report, the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of SM934 on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was investigated using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. We demonstrated that SM934 treatment alleviate the severity of arthritis in CIA mice with established manifestations. The therapeutic benefits were associated with ameliorated joint swelling and reduced extent of bone erosion and destruction. Further, administration of SM934 diminished the development of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and Th17 cells and suppressed the production of pathogenic antibodies, without altering the proportion of germinal center B cells. Ex vivo, SM934 treatment inhibited the bovine type II collagen (CII) induced proliferation and inflammatory cytokines secretion of CII -reactive T cells. In vitro, SM934 impeded the polarization of naïve CD4(+) T cells into Tfh cells and the expression of its transcript factor Bcl-6. Moreover, SM934 decreased the IL-21-producing CD4(+) T cells and dampened the IL-21 downstream signaling through STAT3.

It also participates in the process of influenza infection by affecting viral clearance and immune cell responses. However, whether IL-6 impacts lung repair in influenza pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we studied the role of IL-6 in acute influenza infection in mice. IL-6-deficient mice infected with influenza virus exhibited higher lethality, lost more body weight and had higher fibroblast accumulation and lower extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover in the lung than their wild-type counterparts. Deficiency in IL-6 enhanced proliferation, migration and survival of lung fibroblasts, as well as increased virus-induced apoptosis of lung epithelial cells. IL-6-deficient lung fibroblasts produced elevated levels of TGF-β, which may contribute to their survival. Furthermore, macrophage recruitment to the lung and phagocytic activities of macrophages during influenza infection were reduced in IL-6-deficient mice. Collectively, our results indicate that IL-6 is crucial for lung repair after influenza-induced lung injury through reducing fibroblast accumulation, promoting epithelial cell survival, increasing macrophage recruitment to the lung and enhancing phagocytosis of viruses by macrophages. This study suggests that IL-6 may be exploited for lung repair during influenza infection.","Yang, Mei-Lin; Wang, Chung-Teng; Yang, Shiu-Ju; Leu, Chia-Hsing; Chen, Shun-Hua; Wu, Chao-Liang; Shiau, Ai-Li",Sci Rep,137,28
2617,2617,2617,PBMC transcriptome profiles identifies potential candidate genes and functional networks controlling the innate and the adaptive immune response to PRRSV vaccine in Pietrain pig,12.148858,8.087757,2017-03-09,"The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a devastating viral disease affecting swine production, health and welfare throughout the world. A synergistic action of the innate and the adaptive immune system of the host is essential for mounting a durable protective immunity through vaccination. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the transcriptome profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to characterize the innate and the adaptive immune response to PRRS Virus (PRRSV) vaccination in Pietrain pigs. The Affymetrix gene chip porcine gene 1.0 ST array was used for the transcriptome profiling of PBMCs collected at immediately before (D0), at one (D1) and 28 days (D28) post PRRSV vaccination with three biological replications. With FDR <0.05 and log2 fold change ±1.5 as cutoff criteria, 295 and 115 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in PBMCs during the stage of innate and adaptive response, respectively. The microarray expression results were technically validated by qRT-PCR. The gene ontology terms such as viral life cycle, regulation of lymphocyte activation, cytokine activity and inflammatory response were enriched during the innate immunity; cytolysis, T cell mediated cytotoxicity, immunoglobulin production were enriched during adaptive immunity to PRRSV vaccination. Significant enrichment of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, signaling by interleukins, signaling by the B cell receptor (BCR), viral mRNA translation, IFN-gamma pathway and AP-1 transcription factor network pathways were indicating the involvement of altered genes in the antiviral defense. Network analysis revealed that four network modules were functionally involved with the transcriptional network of innate immunity, and five modules were linked to adaptive immunity in PBMCs. The innate immune transcriptional network was found to be regulated by LCK, STAT3, ATP5B, UBB and RSP17. While TGFß1, IL7R, RAD21, SP1 and GZMB are likely to be predictive for the adaptive immune transcriptional response to PRRSV vaccine in PBMCs. Results of the current immunogenomics study advances our understanding of PRRS in term of host-vaccine interaction, and thereby contribute to design a rationale for disease control strategy.","Islam, Md.

In the present study, we screened plasma of 88 HIV-1 infected ART naïve individuals for their neutralization potential using a standard panel of 18 pseudoviruses belonging to different subtypes and different levels of neutralization. We identified 12 samples with good breadth of neutralization (neutralized >90% of the viruses). Four of these samples neutralized even the difficult-to-neutralize tier-3 pseudoviruses with great potency (GMT > 600). Analysis of neutralization specificities indicated that four samples had antibodies with multiple epitope binding specificities, viz. CD4-binding site (CD4BS), glycans in the V1/V2 and V3 regions and membrane proximal external region (MPER). Our findings indicate the strong possibility of identifying highly potent bNAbs with known or novel specificities from HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals from India that can be exploited as therapeutic tools or lead molecules for the identification of potential epitopes for design of a protective HIV-1 vaccine.","Cheedarla, Narayanaiah; Precilla, K.

Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) plays important roles in renal physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, whether H(2)S could protect against CRF in rats remains unclear. In this study, we found that H(2)S alleviated gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis in normal rat kidney-52E cells. We demonstrated that H(2)S significantly improved the kidney structure and function of CRF rats. We found that H(2)S decreased the protein levels of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cleaved-caspase-3, but increased the expression of Bcl-2. Treatment with H(2)S reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and ROS and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. H(2)S significantly abolished the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 in the kidney of CRF rats. Furthermore, H(2)S decreased the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as the protein levels of p50, p65, and p-p65 in the kidney of CRF rats. In conclusion, H(2)S could ameliorate adenine-induced CRF in rats by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation through ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways.","Wu, Dongdong; Luo, Ning; Wang, Lianqu; Zhao, Zhijun; Bu, Hongmin; Xu, Guoliang; Yan, Yongjun; Che, Xinping; Jiao, Zhiling; Zhao, Tengfu; Chen, Jingtao; Ji, Ailing; Li, Yanzhang; Lee, Garrick D.",Sci Rep,137,1
2737,2737,2737,VEGF isoforms have differential effects on permeability of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells,12.293746,8.107363,2017-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing of Vascular endothelial growth factor-A mRNA transcripts (commonly referred as VEGF) leads to the generation of functionally differing isoforms, the relative amounts of which have potentially significant physiological outcomes in conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The effect of such isoforms on pulmonary vascular permeability is unknown. We hypothesised that VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b isoforms would have differing effects on pulmonary vascular permeability caused by differential activation of intercellular signal transduction pathways. METHOD: To test this hypothesis we investigated the physiological effect of VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b on Human Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell (HPMEC) permeability using three different methods: trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER), Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and FITC-BSA passage. In addition, potential downstream signalling pathways of the VEGF isoforms were investigated by Western blotting and the use of specific signalling inhibitors. RESULTS: VEGF(165)a increased HPMEC permeability using all three methods (paracellular and transcellular) and led to associated VE-cadherin and actin stress fibre changes. In contrast, VEGF(165)b decreased paracellular permeability and did not induce changes in VE-cadherin cell distribution. Furthermore, VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b had differing effects on both the phosphorylation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling proteins pMEK, p42/44MAPK, p38 MAPK, pAKT and peNOS. Interestingly specific inhibition of the pMEK, p38 MAPK, PI3 kinase and eNOS pathways blocked the effects of both VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b on paracellular permeability and the effect of VEGF(165)a on proliferation/migration, suggesting that this difference in cellular response is mediated by an as yet unidentified signalling pathway(s). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the novel isoform VEGF(165)a and VEGF(165)b induce differing effects on permeability in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.","Ourradi, Khadija; Blythe, Thomas; Jarrett, Caroline; Barratt, Shaney L.; Welsh, Gavin I.; Millar, Ann B.",Respir Res,137,11

CD4(+) T cells and several cytokines, such as the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ, are critical in the control of this infection. Conversely, the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 has been shown to dampen Th1 cell responses to M. tuberculosis infection impairing bacterial clearance. However, the critical cellular source of IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection is still unknown. Using IL-10 reporter mice, we show in this article that during the first 14 d of M. tuberculosis infection, the predominant cells expressing IL-10 in the lung were Ly6C(+) monocytes. However, after day 21 postinfection, IL-10–expressing T cells were also highly represented. Notably, mice deficient in T cell–derived IL-10, but not mice deficient in monocyte-derived IL-10, showed a significant reduction in lung bacterial loads during chronic M. tuberculosis infection compared with fully IL-10–competent mice, indicating a major role for T cell–derived IL-10 in TB susceptibility. IL-10–expressing cells were detected among both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, expressed high levels of CD44 and Tbet, and were able to coproduce IFN-γ and IL-10 upon ex vivo stimulation. Furthermore, during M. tuberculosis infection, Il10 expression in CD4(+) T cells was partially regulated by both IL-27 and type I IFN signaling. Together, our data reveal that, despite the multiple immune sources of IL-10 during M. tuberculosis infection, activated effector T cells are the major source accounting for IL-10–induced TB susceptibility.","Moreira-Teixeira, Lúcia; Redford, Paul S.; Stavropoulos, Evangelos; Ghilardi, Nico; Maynard, Craig L.; Weaver, Casey T.; Freitas do Rosário, Ana Paula; Wu, Xuemei; Langhorne, Jean; O’Garra, Anne",J Immunol,137,8

Therefore it is possible that the immunopathology differs among the various presentations of DAD. The aim of this study is to compare lung immunopathology of viral (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) to non-viral, extrapulmonary aetiologies in autopsy cases with DAD. METHODS: The lung tissue of 44 patients, was divided in the H1N1 group (n = 15) characterized by severe pulmonary injury due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection; the ARDS group (n = 13), characterized by patients with DAD due to non-pulmonary causes; and the Control group (n = 16), consisting of patients with non-pulmonary causes of death. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis were used to quantify, in the parenchyma and small airways, several immune cell markers. RESULTS: Both DAD groups had higher expression of neutrophils and macrophages in parenchyma and small airways. However, there was a higher expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD83+ dendritic cells, granzyme A+ and natural killer + cell density in the lung parenchyma of the H1N1 group (p < 0.05). In the small airways, there was a lower cell density of tryptase + mast cells and dendritic + cells and an increase of IL-17 in both DAD groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: DAD due to viral A(H1N1)pdm09 is associated with a cytotoxic inflammatory phenotype, with partially divergent responses in the parenchyma relative to the small airways. In non-viral DAD, main immune cell alterations were found at the small airway level, reinforcing the role of the small airways in the pathogenesis of the exudative phase of DAD.

A vaccine that either reduces susceptibility to infection or reduces shedding of prions by infected animals, or a combination of both, could be of benefit for disease control. The development of such a vaccine is challenged by the unique nature of prion diseases and the requirement for formulation and delivery in an oral format for application in wildlife settings. To address the unique nature of prions, our group targets epitopes, termed disease specific epitopes (DSEs), whose exposure for antibody binding depends on disease-associated misfolding of PrP(C) into PrP(Sc). Here, a DSE corresponding to the rigid loop (RL) region, which was immunogenic following parenteral vaccination, was translated into an oral vaccine. This vaccine consists of a replication-incompetent human adenovirus expressing a truncated rabies glycoprotein G recombinant fusion with the RL epitope (hAd5:tgG-RL). Oral immunization of white-tailed deer with hAd5:tgG-RL induced PrP(Sc)-specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses with an encouraging safety profile in terms of no adverse health effects nor prolonged vector shedding. By building upon proven strategies of formulation for wildlife vaccines, these efforts generate a particular PrP(Sc)-specific oral vaccine for CWD as well as providing a versatile platform, in terms of carrier protein and biological vector, for generation of other oral, peptide-based CWD vaccines.","Taschuk, Ryan; Scruten, Erin; Woodbury, Murray; Cashman, Neil; Potter, Andrew; Griebel, Philip; Tikoo, Suresh K.; Napper, Scott",Prion,137,17

(2012) Invasive bacterial infections following influenza: a time‐series analysis in Montréal, Canada, 1996–2008. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 268–275. Background Shared seasonal patterns, such as between influenza and some respiratory bacterial infections, can create associations between phenomena not causally related. Objectives To estimate the association of influenza with subsequent bacterial infections after full adjustment for confounding by seasonal and long‐term trends. Methods Time series of weekly counts of notified cases of invasive infections with Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, in Montréal, Canada, 1996–2008, were modelled by negative binomial regression, with terms representing seasonal and long‐term trends and terms for numbers of positive laboratory tests for influenza A and B. Results The associations of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis with influenza disappeared after seasonal terms were added to the model. However, the influenza B count remained associated with the S. pyogenes counts for the same week and the following week: S. pyogenes incidence rate ratios were 1.0376 (95% CI: 1.0009–1.0757) and 1.0354 (0.9958–1.0766), respectively, for each increase of 1 in the influenza count. Conclusions Influenza B accounts for about 8percnt; of the incidence of invasive S. pyogenes infections, over and above any effect associated with modellable seasonal and long‐term trends. This association of influenza B with S. pyogenes infections can be attributed largely to the years 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2008, when late peaks in influenza B counts were followed by peaks in S. pyogenes notifications. This finding reinforces the case for universal immunization against influenza, as partial protection against the ‘flesh eating disease’.","Allard, R.; Couillard, M.; Pilon, P.; Kafka, M.; Bédard, L.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,137,1

A cross-sectional survey of LBRS was conducted from December 2009-February 2010 using two-stage cluster sampling based on probability proportional to size. A total of 280 oropharyngeal swab sample pools were collected from 1400 birds in 8 clusters and tested by qRT-PCR for the matrix (M) gene of type A influenza virus and HA gene subtypes H9, H5 and H7. Thirty-four (34) samples were positive for the M gene, of which 28 were also positive for H9. No sample was found positive for H5 or H7. Data for 36 potential risk factors, collected by questionnaire, were analyzed by survey-weighted logistic regression and prevalence odds ratios (OR) for associated risk factors were calculated. A final multivariable model identified three risk factors for H9 infection in LRBS, namely obtaining birds from mixed sources (OR 2.28, CI(95%): 1.4–3.7), keeping birds outside cages (OR 3.10, CI(95%): 1.4–7.0) and keeping chicken breeds other than broilers (OR 6.27, CI(95%): 1.7–23.2).

Genetic and epidemiological data for the four HPIVs derived from two pediatric cohorts in Viet Nam are presented. Respiratory samples were screened for HPIV1–4 by real-time PCR. Demographic and clinical data of patients infected with different HPIV were compared. We used a hemi-nested PCR approach to generate viral genome sequences from HPIV-positive samples and conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. In total, 170 samples tested positive for HPIV. HPIV3 was most commonly detected in our cohort and 80 co-detections of HPIV with other respiratory viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses suggest local endemic circulation as well as punctuated introductions of new HPIV lineages. Viral gene flow analysis revealed that Viet Nam is a net importer of viral genetic diversity. Epidemiological analyses imply similar disease severity for all HPIV species.

We asked whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) B cells in MS secrete different cytokines than control-subject B cells and whether cytokine secretion affects MS phenotype. We blindly studied CSF B cells after their immortalization by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in prospectively-collected MS patients and control subjects with other inflammatory-(OIND) or non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND) and healthy volunteers (HV). The pilot cohort (n = 80) was analyzed using intracellular cytokine staining (n = 101 B cell lines [BCL] derived from 35 out of 80 subjects). We validated differences in cytokine production in newly-generated CSF BCL (n = 207 BCL derived from subsequent 112 prospectively-recruited subjects representing validation cohort), using ELISA enhanced by objective, flow-cytometry-based B cell counting. After unblinding the pilot cohort, the immortalization efficiency was almost 5 times higher in MS patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). MS subjects' BCLs produced significantly more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared to control BCLs. Progressive MS patients BCLs produced significantly more tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and lymphotoxin (LT)-α than BCL from relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. In the validation cohort, we observed lower secretion of IL-1β in RRMS patients, compared to all other diagnostic categories. The validation cohort validated enhanced VEGF-C production by BCL from RRMS patients and higher TNF-α and LT-α secretion by BCL from progressive MS. No significant differences among diagnostic categories were observed in secretion of IL-6 or GM-CSF. However, B cell secretion of IL-1β, TNF-α, and GM-CSF correlated significantly with the rate of accumulation of disability measured by MS disease severity scale (MS-DSS). Finally, all three cytokines with increased secretion in different stages of MS (i.e., VEGF-C, TNF-α, and LT-α) enhance lymphangiogenesis, suggesting that intrathecal B cells directly facilitate the formation of tertiary lymphoid follicles, thus compartmentalizing inflammation to the central nervous system.","Stein, Jason; Xu, Quangang; Jackson, Kayla C.; Romm, Elena; Wuest, Simone C.; Kosa, Peter; Wu, Tianxia; Bielekova, Bibiana",Front Neurol,137,1

In the context of vaccine development remarkable efforts have been made to develop new vaccines and also to improve the efficacy of existing vaccines against specific diseases. To date, some vaccines are developed from protein subunits or killed pathogens, whilst several vaccines are based on live-attenuated organisms, which carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under certain immunocompromised conditions. To avoid this, the development of risk-free effective vaccines in conjunction with adequate delivery systems are considered as an imperative need to obtain desired humoral and cell-mediated immunity against infectious diseases. In the last several years, the use of nanoparticle-based vaccines has received a great attention to improve vaccine efficacy, immunization strategies, and targeted delivery to achieve desired immune responses at the cellular level. To improve vaccine efficacy, these nanocarriers should protect the antigens from premature proteolytic degradation, facilitate antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, control release, and should be safe for human use. Nanocarriers composed of lipids, proteins, metals or polymers have already been used to attain some of these attributes. In this context, several physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles play an important role in the determination of vaccine efficacy. This review article focuses on the applications of nanocarrier-based vaccine formulations and the strategies used for the functionalization of nanoparticles to accomplish efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce desired host immunity against infectious diseases.","Pati, Rashmirekha; Shevtsov, Maxim; Sonawane, Avinash",Front Immunol,137,1

(2010) Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) during winter influenza season in the southern hemisphere. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(4), 187–197. Background Countries in the southern hemisphere experienced sizable epidemics of pandemic influenza H1N1 in their winter season during May–August, 2009. Methods We make use of the Richards model to fit the publicly available epidemic data (confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) of six southern hemisphere countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) to draw useful conclusions, in terms of its reproduction numbers and outbreak turning points, regarding the new pH1N1 virus in a typical winter influenza season. Results The estimates for the reproduction numbers of these six countries range from a high of 1·53 (95% CI: 1·22, 1·84) for confirmed case data of Brazil to a low of 1·16 (1·09, 1·22) for pH1N1 hospitalizations in Australia. For each country, model fits using confirmed cases, hospitalizations, or deaths data always yield similar estimates for the reproduction number. Moreover, the turning points for these closely related outbreak indicators always follow the correct chronological order, i.e., case–hospitalization–death, whenever two or more of these three indicators are available. Conclusions The results suggest that the winter pH1N1 outbreaks in the southern hemisphere were similar to the earlier spring and later winter outbreaks in North America in its severity and transmissibility, as indicated by the reproduction numbers. Therefore, the current strain has not become more severe or transmissible while circulating around the globe in 2009 as some experts had cautioned.

We have previously shown that EBOV VP40 in exosomes causes recipient immune cell death. METHODS: Using VP40-producing clones, we analyzed donor cell cycle, extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, and recipient immune cell death. Transcription of cyclin D1 and nuclear localization of VP40 were examined via kinase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Extracellular vesicle contents were characterized by mass spectrometry, cytokine array, and western blot. Biosafety level-4 facilities were used for wild-type Ebola virus infection studies. RESULTS: VP40 EVs induced apoptosis in recipient T cells and monocytes. VP40 clones were accelerated in growth due to cyclin D1 upregulation, and nuclear VP40 was found bound to the cyclin D1 promoter. Accelerated cell cycling was related to EV biogenesis, resulting in fewer but larger EVs. VP40 EV contents were enriched in ribonucleic acid-binding proteins and cytokines (interleukin-15, transforming growth factor-β1, and interferon-γ). Finally, EBOV-infected cell and animal EVs contained VP40, nucleoprotein, and glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear VP40 upregulates cyclin D1 levels, resulting in dysregulated cell cycle and EV biogenesis. Packaging of cytokines and EBOV proteins into EVs from infected cells may be responsible for the decimation of immune cells during EBOV pathogenesis.","Pleet, Michelle L; Erickson, James; DeMarino, Catherine; Barclay, Robert A; Cowen, Maria; Lepene, Benjamin; Liang, Janie; Kuhn, Jens H; Prugar, Laura; Stonier, Spencer W; Dye, John M; Zhou, Weidong; Liotta, Lance A; Aman, M Javad; Kashanchi, Fatah",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,137,28
3570,3570,3570,Oxidative Stress in Poultry: Lessons from the Viral Infections,12.213501,8.216807,2018-12-10,"Reactive species (RS), generally known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), are produced during regular metabolism in the host and are required for many cellular processes such as cytokine transcription, immunomodulation, ion transport, and apoptosis. Intriguingly, both RNS and ROS are commonly triggered by the pathogenic viruses and are famous for their dual roles in the clearance of viruses and pathological implications. Uncontrolled production of reactive species results in oxidative stress and causes damage in proteins, lipids, DNA, and cellular structures. In this review, we describe the production of RS, their detoxification by a cellular antioxidant system, and how these RS damage the proteins, lipids, and DNA. Given the widespread importance of RS in avian viral diseases, oxidative stress pathways are of utmost importance for targeted therapeutics. Therefore, a special focus is provided on avian virus-mediated oxidative stresses. Finally, future research perspectives are discussed on the exploitation of these pathways to treat viral diseases of poultry.","Rehman, Zaib Ur; Meng, Chunchun; Sun, Yingjie; Safdar, Anum; Pasha, Riaz Hussain; Munir, Muhammad; Ding, Chan",Oxid Med Cell Longev,137,8

When vaccine development is accelerated to a rapid pace in response to emerging infectious disease threats, the challenges to develop such diagnostic tools is even greater. This was observed through the recent expansion of Zika virus infections into the Western Hemisphere in 2014–2017. When initial Zika vaccine clinical trials were being designed and launched in response to the outbreak, there were no standardized sets of viral and immunological assays, and no approved diagnostic tests for Zika virus infection. The diagnosis of Zika virus infection is still an area of active research and development on many fronts. Here we review emerging infectious disease vaccine clinical assay development and trial execution with a special focus on the state of Zika virus clinical assays and diagnostics.","Roberts, Christine C.; Maslow, Joel N.",Vaccines (Basel),137,1

Here, we show that IFITM proteins regulate murine CD4(+) Th cell differentiation. Ifitm2 and Ifitm3 are expressed in wild‐type (WT) CD4(+) T cells. On activation, Ifitm3 was downregulated and Ifitm2 was upregulated. Resting Ifitm‐family‐deficient CD4(+) T cells had higher expression of Th1‐associated genes than WT and purified naive Ifitm‐family‐deficient CD4(+) T cells differentiated more efficiently to Th1, whereas Th2 differentiation was inhibited. Ifitm‐family‐deficient mice, but not Ifitm3‐deficient mice, were less susceptible than WT to induction of allergic airways disease, with a weaker Th2 response and less severe disease and lower Il4 but higher Ifng expression and IL‐27 secretion. Thus, the Ifitm family is important in adaptive immunity, influencing Th1/Th2 polarization, and Th2 immunopathology.","Yánez, Diana C.; Sahni, Hemant; Ross, Susan; Solanki, Anisha; Lau, Ching‐In; Papaioannou, Eleftheria; Barbarulo, Alessandro; Powell, Rebecca; Lange, Ulrike C.; Adams, David J.; Barenco, Martino; Ono, Masahiro; D'Acquisto, Fulvio; Furmanski, Anna L.; Crompton, Tessa",Eur J Immunol,137,8

We propose cluster finding to be a two-step process: first, possible transmission clusters are identified using a cluster algorithm, second, the plausibility that the identified clusters represent genuine transmission clusters is evaluated. AIM: To introduce visual tools to assess automatically identified clusters. METHODS: We developed tools to visualise: (i) clusters found in dimensions of time, geographical location and genetic data; (ii) nested sub-clusters within identified clusters; (iii) intra-cluster pairwise dissimilarities per dimension; (iv) intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. We applied our tools to notified mumps cases in the Netherlands with available disease onset date (January 2009 – June 2016), geographical information (location of residence), and pathogen sequence data (n = 112). We compared identified clusters to clusters reported by the Netherlands Early Warning Committee (NEWC). RESULTS: We identified five mumps clusters. Three clusters were considered plausible. One was questionable because, in phylogenetic analysis, genetic sequences related to it segregated in two groups. One was implausible with no smaller nested clusters, high intra-cluster dissimilarities on all dimensions, and low intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. The NEWC reports concurred with our findings: the plausible/questionable clusters corresponded to reported outbreaks; the implausible cluster did not. CONCLUSION: Our tools for assessing automatically identified clusters allow outbreak investigators to rapidly spot plausible transmission clusters for mumps and other human-to-human transmissible diseases. This fast information processing potentially reduces workload.","Soetens, Loes; Backer, Jantien A.; Hahné, Susan; van Binnendijk, Rob; Gouma, Sigrid; Wallinga, Jacco",Euro Surveill,137,17

Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1β, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients’ demographic characteristics. The present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-1β and IL-12 levels and lesion size and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1β cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1β will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≤ 1 year were significantly low by an average of 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection’s duration of ≥ 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a negative significant association with IL-12, as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection ≤ one year were significantly low on average by 41.82 pg/ml (p value = 0.002) compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≥ 5 years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1β and IL-12 in eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact on disease progression.","Abushouk, Amir; Nasr, Amre; Masuadi, Emad; Allam, Gamal; Siddig, Emmanuel E.; Fahal, Ahmed H.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,137,1

Infection also consistently leads to transient immune-suppression. BoHV-1 is the number one infectious agent in cattle that is associated with abortions in cattle. BoHV-1, as other α-herpesvirinae subfamily members, establishes latency in sensory neurons. Stressful stimuli, mimicked by the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone, consistently induce reactivation from latency in latently infected calves and rabbits. Increased corticosteroid levels due to stress have a two-pronged effect on reactivation from latency by: (1) directly stimulating viral gene expression and replication, and (2) impairing antiviral immune responses, thus enhancing virus spread and transmission. BoHV-1 encodes several proteins, bICP0, bICP27, gG, UL49.5, and VP8, which interfere with key antiviral innate immune responses in the absence of other viral genes. Furthermore, the ability of BoHV-1 to infect lymphocytes and induce apoptosis, in particular CD4+ T cells, has negative impacts on immune responses during acute infection. BoHV-1 induced immune-suppression can initiate the poly-microbial disorder known as bovine respiratory disease complex, which costs the US cattle industry more than one billion dollars annually. Furthermore, interfering with antiviral responses may promote viral spread to ovaries and the developing fetus, thus enhancing reproductive issues associated with BoHV-1 infection of cows or pregnant cows. The focus of this review is to describe the known mechanisms, direct and indirect, by which BoHV-1 interferes with antiviral immune responses during the course of infection.","Jones, Clinton",Front Immunol,137,28

Nevertheless, the modulation of the non-coding RNA involved in the process of TGFBR2 expression in ovaries is not well studied. In our study, we isolated and characterized the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the porcine TGFBR2 gene and microRNA-1306 (miR-1306) was identified as the functional miRNA that targets TGFBR2 in porcine granulosa cells (GCs). Functional analysis showed that miR-1306 promotes apoptosis of GCs as well as attenuating the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway targeting and impairing TGFBR2 in GCs. Moreover, we identified the miR-1306 core promoter and found three potential SMAD4-binding elements (SBEs). Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that the transcription factor SMAD4 directly binds to the miR-1306 core promoter and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway is modulated by SMAD4 positive feedback via inhibition of miR-1306 expression in GCs. Collectively, our findings provide evidence of an epigenetic mechanism that modulates as well as mediates the feedback regulation of the classical TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway in GCs from porcine ovaries.","Yang, Liu; Du, Xing; Liu, Lu; Cao, Qiuyu; Pan, Zengxiang; Li, Qifa",Cells,137,1

In addition to good management practices, vaccination offers an attractive alternative for controlling mycoplasma infections in food animals, instead of using antibiotics, which often leave unacceptable residues. The use of live attenuated vaccines, however, carry the concern of reversion to virulence or genetic recombination with field strains. Currently there are no commercially available vaccines against ostrich-infecting mycoplasmas and this study therefore set out to develop and evaluate the use of a DNA vaccine against mycoplasma infections in ostriches using an OppA protein as antigen. To this end, the oppA gene of “Mycoplasma nasistruthionis sp. nov.” str. Ms03 was cloned into two DNA vaccine expression vectors after codon correction by site-directed mutagenesis. Three-months-old ostriches were then vaccinated intramuscularly at different doses followed by a booster vaccination after 6 weeks. The ability of the DNA vaccines to elicit an anti-OppA antibody response was evaluated by ELISA using the recombinant OppA protein of Ms03 as coating antigen. A statistically significant anti-OppA antibody response could be detected after administration of a booster vaccination indicating that the OppA protein was successfully immunogenic. The responses were also both dose and vector dependent. In conclusion, the DNA vaccines were able to elicit an immune response in ostriches and can therefore be viewed as an option for the development of vaccines against mycoplasma infections.","Wium, Martha; Jonker, Hester Isabella; Olivier, Adriaan Jacobus; Bellstedt, Dirk Uwe; Botes, Annelise",Front Immunol,137,1

Among them, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that chronically infects over 90% of the adult population, with over 200,000 cases of cancer and 150,000 cancer-related deaths attributed to it yearly. Acute EBV infection can present as infectious mononucleosis, and lead to the future onset of multiple cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Many of these cancers express latent viral genes, including Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2). Previous attempts to create potent immunogens against EBV have been reported but generated mixed success. We designed novel Synthetic Consensus (SynCon) DNA vaccines against EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2 to improve on the immune potency targeting important antigens expressed in latently infected cells. These EBV tumor antigens are hypothesized to be useful targets for potential immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers. We optimized the genetic sequences for these three antigens, studied them for expression, and examined their immune profiles in vivo. We observed that these immunogens generated unique profiles based on which antigen was delivered as the vaccine target. EBNA1vax and LMP2Avax generated the most robust T cell immunity. Interestingly, LMP1vax was a very weak immunogen, generating very low levels of CD8 T cell immunity both as a standalone vaccine and as part of a trivalent vaccine cocktail. LMP2Avax was able to drive immunity that impacted EBV-antigen-positive tumor growth. These studies suggest that engineered EBV latent protein vaccines deserve additional study as potential agents for immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers.","Wojtak, Krzysztof; Perales-Puchalt, Alfredo; Weiner, David B.",Vaccines (Basel),137,28

Antemortem oral swabs were collected from 639 snakes from 12 US collections, including 62 species, 28 genera, and 6 families: Pythonidae (N = 414 snakes; pythons were overrepresented in the sample population), Boidae (79), Colubridae (116), Lamprophiidae (4), Elapidae (12), and Viperidae (14). Infection was more common in pythons (38%; 95% CI: 33.1–42.4%), and in boas (10%; 95% CI: 5.2–18.7%) than in colubrids (0.9%, 95% CI: <0.01–4.7%); infection was not detected in other snake families (lamprophiids 0/4, 95% CI: 0–49%; elapids 0/12, 95% CI: 0–24.2%; and vipers 0/14, 95% CI: 0–21.5%), but more of these snakes need to be tested to confirm these findings. Clinical signs of respiratory disease were common in infected pythons (85 of 144). Respiratory signs were only observed in 1 of 8 infected boas and were absent in the single infected colubrid. Divergent serpentoviruses were detected in pythons, boas, and colubrids, suggesting that different serpentoviruses might vary in their ability to infect snakes of different families. Older snakes were more likely to be infected than younger snakes (p-value < 0.001) but males and females were equally likely to be infected (female prevalence: 23.4%, 95% CI 18.7–28.9%; male prevalence: 23.5%, 95% CI 18–30.1%; p-value = 0.144). Neither age (p-value = 0.32) nor sex (p-value = 0.06) was statistically associated with disease severity. Longitudinal sampling of pythons in a single collection over 28 months revealed serpentovirus infection is persistent, and viral clearance was not observed. In this collection, infection was associated with significantly increased rates of mortality (p-value = 0.001) with death of 75% of infected pythons and no uninfected pythons over this period. Offspring of infected parents were followed: vertical transmission either does not occur or occurs with a much lower efficiency than horizontal transmission. Overall, these findings confirm that serpentoviruses pose a significant threat to the health of captive python populations and can cause infection in boa and colubrid species.","Hoon-Hanks, Laura L.; Ossiboff, Robert J.; Bartolini, Pia; Fogelson, Susan B.; Perry, Sean M.; Stöhr, Anke C.; Cross, Shaun T.; Wellehan, James F.

METHODS: Several databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register were searched up to November 14, 2019. All randomized trials investigating the use of NMBAs in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and reporting mortality data were included in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes, including respiratory physiological parameters, incidence of barotrauma, ICU-free days, and ventilation-free days. RESULTS: A total of 7 trials enrolling 1598 patients were finally included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that the use of NMBAs in moderate-to-severe ARDS could significantly decrease the mortality truncated to day 28 (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98, P = 0.03) and day 90 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99, P = 0.04). NMBA use could significantly decrease the incidence of barotrauma (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87, P = 0.009). No significant difference was observed in ICU-free days or ventilation-free days between the NMBA and control groups. CONCLUSION: The use of NMBAs could significantly decrease mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients and decrease the incidence of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. However, more large-scale randomized trials are needed to further validate the effect of NMBA use in ARDS.","Chang, Wei; Sun, Qin; Peng, Fei; Xie, Jianfeng; Qiu, Haibo; Yang, Yi",Crit Care,137,1

Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28–42% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV–1 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.","Powell, Timothy R.; Duarte, Rodrigo R.

Of all species, pigs are likely to constitute a greater share of the growth in the livestock subsector. However, constraints such as respiratory infectious diseases cause significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Compared to industrialized countries, the occurrence and impacts of respiratory diseases on pig production in Africa is under-documented. Hence, knowledge on prevalence and incidence of economically important swine respiratory pathogens in pigs in Africa is necessary to guide interventions for prevention and control. The purpose of this review was to document the current status of research on five important respiratory pathogens of swine in Africa to inform future research and interventions. The pathogens included were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSv), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). For this review, published articles were obtained using Harzing’s Publish or Perish software tool from GoogleScholar. Articles were also sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, FAO and OIE websites. The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae. This review highlights knowledge and information gaps on epidemiologic aspects as well as economic impacts of the various pathogens reported in swine in Africa, which calls for further studies.","Oba, P.; Wieland, B.; Mwiine, F.

The mortality rates of the F(1) hybrids and of the F(2) segregants showed the codominance of the susceptible and resistant characters. The direct individual intrapopulation correlation between the induction of antiviral state in macrophages activated by IFN gamma and the resistance to the virus infection, showed that an antiviral state could be induced in resistant mouse macrophages, whereas in susceptible mouse macrophages no restriction of virus replication could be observed. A direct inter- and intrapopulation correlation of pre-existing antibody titres against MHV3 with the mortality and a direct interpopulation correlation of those titres with the mean survival time of susceptible animals was shown. The data indicate, among the mechanisms of resistance against the virus infection, a role of IFN gamma macrophage-activation and of antibodies against MHV3 which may delay the mean survival time in susceptible animals.","Vassão, R.

Two countries are considered: one disease-free country and one visited or source country with a running endemic or epidemic infectious disease. Two models are considered. In the first model (disease importation), susceptible individuals travel from their disease-free home country to the endemic country and come back after some weeks. The risk of infection spreading in their home country is then estimated supposing the visitors are submitted to the same force of infection as the local population but do not contribute to it. In the second model (disease exportation), it is calculated the probability that an individual from the endemic (or epidemic) country travels to a disease-free country in the condition of latent infected and eventually introduces the infection there. The input of both models is the force of infection at the visited/source country, assumed known. The models are deterministic, but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented as an appendix. The models are exemplified with two distinct real situations: the risk of dengue importation from Thailand to Europe and the risk of Ebola exportation from Liberia to the USA.","Lopez, Luis Fernandez; Amaku, Marcos; Coutinho, Francisco Antonio Bezerra; Quam, Mikkel; Burattini, Marcelo Nascimento; Struchiner, Claudio José; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Massad, Eduardo",Bull Math Biol,137,8

5554,5554,5554,Therapeutic Potential of RNA Interference Against Cellular Targets of HIV Infection,12.293072,7.8013673,2007-09-15,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), widely distributed, small regulatory RNA genes, target both messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation and suppression of protein translation based on sequence complementarity between the miRNA and its targeted mRNA. Different names have been used to describe various types of miRNA. During evolution, RNA retroviruses or transgenes invaded the eukaryotic genome and inserted in the non-coding regions of DNA, conceivably acting as transposon-like jumping genes, providing defense from viral invasion and fine-funing of gene expression as a secondary level of gene modulation in eukaryotes. When a transposon is inserted in the intron, it becomes an intronic miRNA, taking advantage of the protein synthesis machinery, i.e., mRNA transcription and splicing, as a means for processing and maturation. Recently, miRNAs have been found to play an important, but not life-threatening, role in embryonic development. They might play a pivotal role in diverse biological systems in various organisms, facilitating a quick response and accurate plotting of body physiology and structures. Based on these unique properties, man-made intronic miRNAs have been developed for in vitro evaluation of gene function, in vivo gene therapy and generation of transgenic animal models. The biogenesis and identification of miRNAs, potential applications, and future directions for research are presented, hopefully providing a guideline for further miRNA and gene function studies.","Ying, Shao-Yao; Chang, Donald C.; Lin, Shi-Lung",Mol Biotechnol,137,17
5559,5559,5559,The effects of interferon-γ on the central nervous system,12.622715,8.110537,1997,"In hospital isolation rooms, door operation can lead to containment failures and airborne pathogen dispersal into the surrounding spaces. Sliding doors can reduce the containment failure arising from the door motion induced airflows, as compared to the hinged doors that are typically used in healthcare facilities. Such airflow leakage can be measured quantitatively using tracer gas techniques, but detailed observation of the turbulent flow features is very difficult. However, a comprehensive understanding of these flows is important when designing doors to further reduce such containment failures. Experiments and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling, by using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) flow solver, were used to study airflow patterns in a full-scale mock-up, consisting of a sliding door separating two identical rooms (i.e. one isolation room attached to an antechamber). A single sliding door open/ hold-open/ closing cycle was studied. Additional variables included human passage through the doorway and imposing a temperature difference between the two rooms. The general structures of computationally-simulated flow features were validated by comparing the results to smoke visualizations of identical full-scale experimental set-ups. It was found that without passage the air volume leakage across the doorway was first dominated by vortex shedding in the wake of the door, but during a prolonged hold-open period a possible temperature difference soon became the predominant driving force. Passage generates a short and powerful pulse of leakage flow rate even if the walker stops to wait for the door to open.

One hundred and sixty-four patients (33%) had at least one positive blood culture. Gram-positive cocci (α-streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci) were found in 146/164 cases (89%). Gram-negative bacteria were present in only seven cases. Receiving marrow from an unrelated donor was the only significant risk factor for bacteraemia in univariate regression analysis. Within 60 days after BMT, 69/500 patients died. The mortality rate was significantly higher among those with positive blood cultures during the aplastic phase, 44/164 (27%) than in those without bacteraemia, 25/336 (7%). Death directly caused by sepsis was unusual in patients with α-streptococci or CNS-bacteraemia (8/146, 5%). In contrast, three of seven patients with gram-negative bacteraemia died of the infection. However, in patients with bacteraemia, 21 of 44 deaths were attributable to invasive fungal infections (18 candida, three aspergillus; autopsy findings). Among patients with negative blood cultures during the aplastic phase, 6/25 died of invasive fungal infection (three candida, one saccaromyces and two aspergillus). This indicates that early bacteraemia is associated with death from invasive fungal infection. Therefore, efforts to shorten the neutropenic period after BMT, prevention, early detection of invasive fungal infections and adjustments of immnosuppressive regimens when marrow from an unrelated donor is used, may improve the outcome after BMT.","Sparrelid, E; Hägglund, H; Remberger, M; Ringdén, O; Lönnqvist, B; Ljungman, P; Andersson, J",Bone Marrow Transplant,137,28

Between May 2009 and May 2010, all allo-HSCTs who presented with respiratory symptoms were screened for the presence of the H1N1 virus. Oseltamivir resistance was assessed and chart reviews were performed for all cases. In all, 51 of 248 (20%) allo-HSCT recipients followed at our outpatient clinic were screened. We identified 10 patients with H1N1 infection. Close contact with children was the most commonly suspected mode of transmission. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were present in eight and five patients, respectively. Lymphopenia (<1 G/L) was the most frequent biological abnormality. High immunosuppression was responsible for severe infection requiring mechanical ventilation associated with prolonged viral shedding in three patients who had significant comorbidities and GvHD. Two of them developed an oseltamivir-resistant strain and both patients died subsequently despite intensive therapy, resulting in a case fatality rate of 20%. In conclusion, although most allo-HSCTs had mild symptoms from H1N1 infection, severe immunosuppression and emergence of oseltamivir resistance were likely responsible for a substantial morbidity, further supporting the need for vaccination and monitoring of close contacts, especially children.","Mohty, B; Thomas, Y; Vukicevic, M; Nagy, M; Levrat, E; Bernimoulin, M; Kaiser, L; Roosnek, E; Passweg, J; Chalandon, Y",Bone Marrow Transplant,137,1

Each year, influenza has spread around the world causing about 250,000–500,000 deaths and more than 5 million cases of severe illness. The objective is as follows: evaluating the outcomes of patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus in relation to certain TNF-308, IL6, and IL8 polymorphisms and identifying the associated factors with the severe outcome. SUBJECT AND METHODS: This is a case–control study. The cases were patients confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be influenza A (H1N1) virus infected. The controls were healthy individuals. Medical history and outcome of the disease was registered. In all study participants, polymorphisms of TNF rs1800629, IL6 rs18138879, and IL8 rs4073; odds ratio (OR); and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Infection with influenza A (H1N1) virus was associated more with the following genotypes: TNF-308 AA (OR = 4.041; 95% CI = 1.215–13.4) and IL8 AA (OR = 3.273; 95% CI = 1.372–7.805).

LUS requires only a few minutes and is a useful extension of the physical examination. Fractures of the ribs as well as the sternum are seen well on ultrasound. Minute pleural fluids (effusion, hemtothorax) are detectable. LUS is able to detect the sound of lung water and thus to differentiate a cardiogenic pulmonary edema from chronic obstructive lung disease. Inflammatory lung diseases such as pleuritis and pneumonia are better seen than on chest X‑ray. LUS should replace chest X‑ray in the diagnosis of ambulant acquired pneumonia. In ventilator-associated pneumonia and atelectasis, LUS measures the presence of lung consolidation as well as dynamic changes und reventilation.

Short-circuit currents (I(SC)) were measured, showing an increase by E2 and P in a dose-dependent manner. The Na,K-ATPase subunits -α(1) and -β(1) were detected by Western blotting, but total expression was not significantly altered. Furthermore, all three epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) subunits -α, -β, and -γ were detected, with trends toward a higher expression in the presence of E2 and P. Real-time PCR revealed an increase of α- and β-ENaC expression but no alteration of γ-ENaC. In addition, the mRNA expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Na,K-ATPase-β(1) subunit were elevated in the presence of E2 and P. Single-channel patch clamp analysis demonstrated putative highly selective and nonselective cation channels in the analyzed cells, with a higher percentage of responsive patches under the influence of E2 and P.

Thus, group A (n=7) was given G-CSF and group B (n=7) was not. G-CSF therapy reduced both the incidence and duration of ADM-induced oral mucositis, and a positive correlation was also seen between the incidence of mucositis and ADM-induced leukopenia (<2,000/mm(3)).

The CXC chemokine interleukin (IL)-8, is a potent neutrophil recruiting and activating factor and the detection of IL-8 in clinical samples from patients with these diseases has led clinicians to believe that antagonism of IL-8 may be a practicable therapeutic strategy for disease management. Work over the last decade has concentrated on both the molecular mechanisms by which IL-8 is produced in the inflammatory setting and also on the manner in which IL-8 activates the neutrophil. Expression of the IL-8 gene appears to be controlled by several components of the inflammatory milieu. Whilst lipopolysaccharide, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α are capable of augmenting IL-8 production, IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of IL-8 synthesis and appears to play an auto-regulatory role. Regulation of the IL-8 gene is under the control of nuclear factor κB which appears to be a primary target for corticosteroid-mediated repression of IL-8 production. IL-8 exerts is effects on neutrophils by binding with high affinity to two receptors on its cell surface, the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. These closely related receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors, proteins that historically have proved amenable to antagonism by small molecules. The recent descriptions in the literature of highly potent small molecule antagonists of CXCR2 and their success in blocking in vivo trafficking of neutrophils suggest that antagonsim of IL-8 at the receptor level is a viable therapeutic strategy. Clinical trials of such compounds will ultimately provide crucial information currently lacking and will define whether or not IL-8 blockade provides future therapy in pulmonary disease.","Pease, James E.; Sabroe, Ian",Am J Respir Med,137,8

However, S. aureus might exhibit fluctuating blood culture positivity, labeled as “the skip phenomenon”. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of the skip phenomenon in a cohort of hospitalized patients with S. aureus bacteremia and to determine the associated clinical variables. METHODS: We conducted a nested case–control study, using a previous cohort of 757 adult inpatients between July 2006 and June 2011 with ≥ 3 days of S. aureus bacteremia. Each case of S. aureus bacteremia with the skip phenomenon was matched to 2 to 4 controls based on age, gender, and duration of bacteremia. The association of clinical characteristics with the skip phenomenon was analyzed via conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 757 patients in the cohort, 29 (4%) had the skip phenomenon. 26 (90%) patients in the cases group were male. The median age was 69.4 years (interquartile range [IQR] 58.7 to 80.3). Although an attempt to match for the duration of bacteremia was done, there was a statistically longer duration in patients with cases as compared to that in controls (median [IQR], 10 [7–12] days, vs 8 [6–10] days; P = 0.015). Accordingly, duration of bacteremia was adjusted for in regression models. Notably, 26 (90%) patients in the case group were receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy, as compared to 69 (79%) patients in the control group (P = 0.427).

Herein, we review the pertinent patient characteristics, therapy, and outcome data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1993 to April 2013, 249 children and adolescents (193 protocol patients) diagnosed with AML were enrolled in the three BFM studies. Patients were mainly treated in one of five pediatric hematology/oncology centers distributed over Austria. RESULTS: Many characteristics and outcome parameters were not statistically different between the three trials. Almost similar proportions of patients were stratified into two risk groups: standard risk (SR) (approximately 37 % overall) and high-risk (HR) (61 %). MLL rearrangements were found in 23 % of patients overall as the most frequent genetic aberration subtype. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 84–95 % of patients. The most important type of event was leukemic relapse (5-year cumulative incidence 40 ± 8 %, 21 ± 5 %, and 39 ± 6 %; p = 0.058), with a trend to a higher rate specifically in SR patients of study AML-BFM 2004 compared with AML-BFM 98. Importantly, the frequency of death from causes other than relapse sequelae declined over the years (AML-BFM 93: 5/42 12 %, AML-BFM 98: 5/57 9 %, and AML-BFM 2004: 5/94 5 %). Altogether, event-free survival at 5 years varied insignificantly (48 ± 8 %, 61 ± 7 %, and 50 ± 6 %; p = 0.406). Nevertheless, survival (pSU) apparently improved from BFM 93 to subsequent studies, both overall (57 ± 8 %, 75 ± 6 %, and 62 ± 6 %; p = 0.046) and regarding the HR group (5-year-probability of survival (pSU) 40 ± 10 %, 66 ± 8 %, and 52 ± 8 %; p = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Treatment of pediatric AML in Austria renders survival rates in the range of international best practice. However, unambiguous statistical comparison of treatment periods is eventually hampered by small numbers and inequalities of recruitment. Hence, only internationally collaborative trials will allow developing treatment further to achieve higher cure rates with fewer events.","Boztug, Heidrun; Mühlegger, Nora; Glogova, Evgenia; Mann, Georg; Urban, Christian; Meister, Bernhard; Schmitt, Klaus; Jones, Neil; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Haas, Oskar; Strehl, Sabine; Lion, Thomas; Pötschger, Ulrike; Fink, Franz-Martin; Gadner, Helmut; Dworzak, Michael",Memo,137,22

Methods: In a blinded study, we used ESI-FTICR MS to analyze 24 unrelated samples of total cellular DNA containing 12 mtDNA variants and compared the results with those obtained by conventional PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and gel electrophoresis. Results: From the 24-sample blinded panel, we correctly identified 12 of the samples as bearing an mtDNA variant and found the remaining 12 samples to have no pathogenic variants. The correlation coefficient between the 2 methods for mtDNA variant detection was 1.0; there were no false positives or false negatives in this sample set. In addition, the ESI-FTICR method identified 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that had previously been missed by standard PCR-RFLP analysis.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can act synergistically with IFN-γ with respect to class II expression on a variety of cells. As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-α on IFN-γ-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-α alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-γ for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-α activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-α with a polyclonal anti-TNF-α antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-α enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-γ 12–24 h prior to TNF-α addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-γ and TNF-α may be increased TNF-α receptor expression by IFN-γ. Astrocytes treated with IFN-γ for 24 h express more TNF-α receptors (3900/cell) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/cell), with no significant change in the binding affinity (K(d)). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-α requires an inductive signal from IFN-γ, which in part may be increased TNF-α receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-α enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-γ. TNF-α exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-α receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-γ. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.","Benveniste, Etty N.; Sparacio, Shaun M.; Bethea, John R.",J Neuroimmunol,137,11

This observation was valid for both adenovirus (2.4%, 5.0% and 6.6%) and rotavirus (5.2% , 13.6% and 16.6%). Virus isolation was positive in 3.6% of liquid, 17.4% of semisolid and 18.1% of solid specimens. (Chi-squared for linear trend, P value <0.0001). We suggest that solid faecal specimens at the end of an episode of diarrhoea will have a higher diagnostic yield than liquid specimens at the peak of symptoms. Our findings repudiate the commonly held dogma that viruses of gastroenteritis are more likely to be found in liquid than in solid faecal specimens. This finding has important implications for those establishing diagnostic algorithms for the investigation of viral gastroenteritis.","McCaughey, C.; O'Neill, H.J.; Wyatt, D.E.; Christie, S.N.; Jackson, P.T.; Coyle, P.V.",J Infect,137,11

We performed a prospective observational study of 955 cases of adult CAP in 14 hospitals in eight Asian countries. Microbiological evaluation to determine etiological pathogens as well as clinical evaluation was performed. Bronchopulmonary disease (29.9%) was the most frequent underlying disease, followed by cardiovascular diseases (19.9%), malignancy (11.7%) and neurological disorder (8.2%). Streptococcus pneumoniae (29.2%) was the most common isolate, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.1%). Serological tests were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (11.0%) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.4%). Only 1.1% was positive for Legionella pneumophila by urinary antigen test. Of the pneumococcal isolates, 56.1% were resistant to erythromycin and 52.6% were not susceptible to penicillin. Seventeen percent of CAP had mixed infection, especially S. pneumoniae with C. pneumoniae. The overall mortality rate was 7.3%, and nursing home residence, mechanical ventilation, malignancy, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory rate > 30/min and hyponatraemia were significant independent risk factors for mortality by multivariate analysis (P < 0.05).

Here, we firstly resolved the topology of IFITM1 on the plasma membrane where N-terminus points into the cytoplasm and C-terminus resides extracellularly. Further, KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 locating at 62–67 of the conserved intracellular loop (CIL) were found to play a key role in the restriction on the Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV). Similarly, KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/3 also contributed to suppressing ZIKV replication. Finally, IFITM1 was revealed to be capable of restricting the release of ZIKV particles from endosome to cytosol so as to impede the entry of ZIKV into host cells, which was tightly related with the inhibition of IFITM1 on the acidification of organelles.

The disease, called weaner colitis, caused mortality of 1 %, while morbidity varied from 20 to 75%. Colon contents from affected sheep were inoculated into 17 sheep, 13 of which developed diarrhoea 5 to 7 days after inoculation. Naturally and experimentally infected sheep had mild, erosive typhlitis and colitis. Microscopic examination of washed scrapings of colonic mucosa from all affected sheep revealed masses of curved bacteria that were not seen in controls. Electron microscopic examination showed similar bacteria adherent to colonic epithelium of an experimentally infected sheep. Curved, motile bacteria were isolated from 2 naturally occurring cases. One isolate was inoculated into 9 sheep, 2 of which developed diarrhoea. The other isolate was given to 4 sheep without observable effect. The curved bacteria grew only on media containing blood, in an atmosphere of approximately 10% air, 10% CO(2) and 80% H(2). They were Gram‐negative, with a polar flagellum at one or both ends, they did not ferment glucose or give a positive catalase reaction.

There are extensive ongoing experimental efforts to understand the biological functions of the gene products encoded in the human genome. However, computational analysis can aid immensely in the interpretation of biological function by associating known functional/structural domains to the human proteins. In this article we have discussed the implications of such associations. The association of structural domains to human proteins could help in prioritizing the targets for structure determination in the structural genomics initiatives. The protein kinase family is one of the most frequently occurring protein domain families in the human proteome while P‐loop hydrolase, which comprises many GTPases and ATPases, is a highly represented superfamily. Using the superfamily relationships between families of unknown and known structures we could increase structural information content of the human genome by about 5%. We could also make new associations of domain families to 33 human proteins that are potentially linked to genetically inherited diseases.

The eddy covariance method and isotope signals of rain, plant, soil, and stream waters were used to determine forest water sources under different moisture conditions. Four sampling events were conducted to collect soil and plant twig samples in wet, moderate, dry, and very dry conditions for the identification of isotopic signals. Annual ET from 2012 to 2015 was quite stable with an average of 1,182 ± 26 mm, and a substantial daily ET was observed even during drought periods, although some decline was observed, corresponding with volumetric soil water content. During the wet period, water for ET was supplied from the surface soil layer between 0 and 0.5 m, whereas in the dry period, approximately 50% to 90% was supplied from the deeper soil layer below 0.5‐m depth, originating from water precipitated several months previously at this forest. Isotope signatures demonstrated that the water sources of the plants, soil, and stream were all different. Water in plants was often different from soil water, probably because plant water came from a different source than water that was strongly bound to the soil particles. Plants showed no preference for soil depth with their size, whereas the existence of storage water in the xylem was suggested. The evapotranspiration at this forest is balanced and maintained using most of the available water sources except for a proportion of rapid response run‐off.","Lion, Marryanna; Kosugi, Yoshiko; Takanashi, Satoru; Noguchi, Shoji; Itoh, Masayuki; Katsuyama, Masanori; Matsuo, Naoko; Shamsuddin, Siti‐Aisah",Hydrol Process,137,1

Comparative morphology of the venom apparatus in the braconid wasp subfamily Rogadinae (Insecta, Hymenoptera, Braconidae) and related taxa. —Zoologica Scripta, 33, 223–237. The morphology of the venom apparatus intima in representatives of 38 genera of the problematic braconid wasp subfamily Rogadinae and other cyclostome braconids was investigated and a preliminary phylogenetic analysis for the group was performed with the information obtained. Despite the limited number of characters, the data suggest several relationships at various taxonomic levels. The venom apparatus in the Clinocentrini and the Stiropiini is relatively unmodified and similar to that found in other genera previously placed within a broader concept of the Rogadinae (e.g. genera of Lysitermini, Pentatermini, Tetratermini, Hormiini) and also to that of the Betylobraconinae. The presence of a cone of filaments located inside the secondary venom duct near to its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom duct is proposed as a synapomorphy for the tribe Rogadini to the exclusion of Stiropiini, Clinocentrini and Yeliconini. Other features of the secondary venom duct and its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom duct support a number of relationships between the genera of the Rogadini and also within the large genus Aleiodes. A clade containing 15 Rogadini genera (Bathoteca, Bathotecoides, Bulborogas, Canalirogas, Colastomion, Conspinaria, Cystomastacoides, Macrostomion, Megarhogas, Myocron, Pholichora, Rectivena, Rogas, Spinaria and Triraphis) is supported by the presence of a thickened and short secondary venom duct, whereas the different members of Aleiodes (excluding members of the subgenus Heterogamus) and Cordylorhogas are distinguished by having a recessed secondary venom duct with well‐defined and numerous internal filaments. New World Rogas species exhibit a unique venom apparatus and may not be closely related to the Old World ones. Features of the venom apparatus of the enigmatic genus Telengaia and the exothecine genera Shawiana and Colastes suggest that the Telengainae and Exothecinae are both closely related to the Braconinae, Gnamptodontinae, and possibly to the Opiinae and Alysiinae. An unsculptured venom reservoir was found in one specimen of the type species of Avga, A. choaspes, which is consistent with it occupying either a very basal position within the cyclostome braconids or belonging to a recently recognized ‘Gondwanan’ clade that also includes the Aphidiinae.","Zaldivar‐Riverón, A.; Areekul, B.; Shaw, M.

Pulmonary sequelae have been documented following respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients; however potential late effects in children undergoing nonmyeloablative chemotherapy have not been investigated. AIM: To evaluate the long‐term pulmonary morbidity of respiratory viral infections during chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Childhood ALL survivors, aged 7 to 18 years, greater than 6 months posttreatment were recruited. Exclusion criteria included HSCT or proven bacterial/fungal respiratory infection during treatment. Subjects were classified into “viral” or “control” groups according to retrospective medical records that documented the presence of laboratory‐proven RVIs during chemotherapy. Symptom questionnaires (Liverpool, ISAAC) and lung function testing (spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity, forced oscillation technique to ATS/ERS standards) were then performed cross‐sectionally at the time of recruitment. RESULTS: Fifty‐four patients (31 viral, 23 control) were recruited: median (range) age 11.2 (7.2‐18.1) years, and at 4.9 (0.5‐13) years posttherapy. Abnormalities were detected in 17 (31%) individuals (8 viral, 9 control), with the most common being DLCO impairment (3 viral, 4 control) and reduced respiratory reactance at 5 Hz (5 viral, 6 control). Children with RVIs during chemotherapy reported more current respiratory symptoms, particularly wheeze (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9‐10.0; P = .09) and cough (OR, 2.7; 95% CI: 0.8‐9.5; P = .11). No differences in lung function tests were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found children with RVIs during chemotherapy developed more long‐term respiratory symptoms than controls; however, differences did not reach statistical significance. No differences in static lung function were found between the two groups. Overall, pulmonary abnormalities and/or significant ongoing respiratory symptoms were detected in nearly a third of ALL survivors treated without HSCT.

It is an endemic most commonly found at South Asia and has first emerged in Malaysia in 1998. Bats are found to be the main reservoir for this virus, causing disease in both humans and animals. The last outbreak has occurred in May 2018 in Kerala. It is characterized by high pathogenicity and fatality rates which varies from 40% to 70% depending on the severity of the disease and on the availability of adequate healthcare facilities. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available for NiV disease and the treatment is just supportive. Clinical presentations for this virus range from asymptomatic infection to fatal encephalitis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at predicting an effective epitope-based vaccine against glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus, using immunoinformatics approaches. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Glycoprotein G of the Nipah virus sequence was retrieved from NCBI. Different prediction tools were used to analyze the epitopes, namely, BepiPred-2.0: Sequential B Cell Epitope Predictor for B cell and T cell MHC classes II and I. Then, the proposed peptides were docked using Autodock 4.0 software program. Results and Conclusions. The two peptides TVYHCSAVY and FLIDRINWI have showed a very strong binding affinity to MHC class I and MHC class II alleles. Furthermore, considering the conservancy, the affinity, and the population coverage, the peptide FLIDRINWIT is highly suitable to be utilized to formulate a new vaccine against glycoprotein G of Nipah henipavirus.

A better understanding of the epidemiology of HAIs in these patients is needed. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all the patients hospitalized for ≥ 48 h during a 12-year period in the 12-bed ICU of the Gustave Roussy hospital, monitored prospectively for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infection (BSI) and for use of medical devices. RESULTS: During 3388 first stays in the ICU, 198 cases of VAP and 103 primary, 213 secondary, and 77 catheter-related BSIs were recorded. The VAP rate was 24.5/1000 ventilator days (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.2–28.0); the catheter-related BSI rate was 2.3/1000 catheter days (95% CI 1.8–2.8). The cumulative incidence during the first 25 days of exposure was 58.8% (95% CI 49.1–66.6%) for VAP, 8.9% (95% CI, 6.2–11.5%) for primary, 15.1% (95% CI 11.6–18.5%) for secondary and 5.0% (95% CI 3.2–6.8%) for catheter-related BSIs. VAP or BSIs were not associated with a higher risk of ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report HAI rates in a large cohort of critically ill cancer patients. Although both the incidence of VAP and the rate of BSI are higher than in general ICU populations, this does not impact patient outcomes. The occurrence of device-associated infections is essentially due to severe medical conditions in patients and to the characteristics of malignancy.

However, secrecy has only recently started to receive more attention in research. What has largely been neglected so far are the consequences of secret-sharing for the relationship between sharer and receiver. In this project, we aim to fill this gap. Previous research has shown that closeness can make secret-sharing more likely. Building on research from the self-disclosure and relationship literature, we experimentally investigate whether secret-sharing might in turn increase perceptions of closeness. In addition, we test the valence of the secrets shared as potential driver of the hypothesized effect, as negative secrets might signal a high level of trust, but might also present a burden to the receiver. To provide a holistic picture, we build on a variety of methods to investigate three perspectives: Study 1 focuses on the receiver and tests whether another person sharing secrets (vs. nonconfidential information) decreases distance in the eyes of the receiver. Study 2 investigates lay theories and tests how an observer perceives the relationship between two people who share secrets (vs. nonconfidential information). Study 3 tests whether these lay theories about sharing secrets are predictive of behavior, and how a sharer might choose secrets of negative or positive valence to decrease perceived distance on the receiver’s side. Our results will contribute to the understanding of how sharing secrets affects the way individuals think about each other, how close they feel to each other, and how they interact with each other.","Jaffé, Mariela E.; Douneva, Maria",PLoS One,137,1

Analyses have been carried out to assess preparedness in Europe, Asia and Africa. We assessed plans to evaluate the national strategic pandemic influenza preparedness in the countries of Latin America. Published national pandemic influenza preparedness plans from Latin American countries were evaluated against criteria drawn from the World Health Organization checklist. Plans were eligible for inclusion if formally published before 16 November 2007. Fifteen national plans were identified and retrieved from the 17 Latin American countries surveyed. Latin American countries demonstrated different degrees of preparedness, and that a high level of completeness of plans was correlated to a country's wealth to a certain extent. Plans were judged strong in addressing surveillance requirements, and provided appropriate communication strategies directed to the general public and health care personnel. However, gaps remained, including the organization of health care services’ response; planning and maintenance of essential services; and the provision of containment measures such as the stockpiling of necessary medical supplies including vaccines and antiviral medications. In addition, some inconsistencies and variations which may be important, such as in border control measures and the capacity to contain outbreaks, exist between country plans—issues that could result in confusion in the event of a pandemic. A number of plans remain developmental in nature and, as elsewhere, more emphasis should be placed on strengthening the operability of plans, and in testing them. Whilst taking account of resources constraints, plans should be further developed in a coherent manner with both regional and international imperatives.","Mensua, Ana; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Coker, Richard",Health Policy Plan,137,3

We aimed to decrease the duration of discharge antibiotic treatment to less than 5 days following inpatient incision and drainage of uncomplicated abscesses. METHODS: A new treatment protocol that defined uncomplicated abscesses, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria, was created to monitor the accurate duration of prescribed therapy at discharge. We implemented a treatment algorithm that takes into account the epidemiologic changes in microbial etiologies and the presence of systemic findings for patients after surgical incision and drainage. We used control charts to assess the impact of the interventions. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighteen patients were discharged following abscess drainage from our inpatient infectious diseases unit in 2016. The patients were 3 months to 21 years of age. Only 72 (17%) patients had prescribed discharge antibiotic treatment courses that were less than 5 days [range 0–31 days, median 8 days (IQR 6, 9)], and the average prescribed course at discharge was 8.6 days. During the study period, we significantly decreased the average duration of discharge antibiotics to 7.3 days in all patients (P = 0.0016, 95% CI: −2.1036 to −0.4964, difference of means −1.3). The discharge treatment duration of patients with uncomplicated abscess was shorter at 4.7 days [range 0–9 days, median 5 days, (IQR 3, 5)]. Prescription compliance to less than 5 days treatment course at discharge increased from the baseline of 17% to 42% overall. CONCLUSIONS: Standardizing definitions of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue abscesses was critical to the success of this project. In addition to possible improved treatment adherence and decreased side effects, our protocol led to decreased patient care costs with no documented changes in readmission rates.","Erdem, Guliz; Buckingham, Don; Drewes, Kevin; Kenney, Brian; Gibson, Annika; Gallup, Nathaniel; Barson, William",Pediatr Qual Saf,137,1

UT-knockout mice exhibit the urea-selective urine-concentrating defect, without affecting electrolyte balance, suggesting that UT-B inhibitors have the potential to be developed as novel diuretics. In this study, we characterized a novel compound 5-ethyl-2-methyl-3-amino-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylate (CB-20) with UT inhibitory activity as novel diuretics with excellent pharmacological properties. This compound was discovered based on high-throughput virtual screening combined with the erythrocyte osmotic lysis assay. Selectivity of UT inhibitors was assayed using transwell chambers. Diuretic activity of the compound was examined in rats and mice using metabolic cages. Pharmacokinetic parameters were detected in rats using LC–MS/MS. Molecular docking was employed to predict the potential binding modes for the CB-20 with human UT-B. This compound dose-dependently inhibited UT-facilitated urea transport with IC(50) values at low micromolar levels. It exhibited nearly equal inhibitory activity on both UT-A1 and UT-B. After subcutaneous administration of CB-20, the animals showed polyuria, without electrolyte imbalance and abnormal metabolism. CB-20 possessed a good absorption and rapid clearance in rat plasma. Administration of CB-20 for 5 days did not cause significant morphological abnormality in kidney or liver tissues of rats. Molecular docking showed that CB-20 was positioned near several residues in human UT-B, including Leu364, Val367, and so on. This study provides proof of evidence for the prominent diuretic activity of CB-20 by specifically inhibiting UTs. CB-20 or thienopyridine analogs may be developed as novel diuretics.","Li, Min; Zhao, Yan; Zhang, Shun; Xu, Yue; Wang, Shu-yuan; Li, Bo-wen; Ran, Jian-hua; Li, Run-tao; Yang, Bao-xue",Acta Pharmacol Sin,137,1

NASH ends up to advanced liver disease, which is highly threatening to human health. Currently, treatment of NASH is very limited. Acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC1/ACC2) are proved as effective drug targets for NASH. We aimed to develop novel ACC inhibitors and evaluate their therapeutic value for NASH prevention. ACC inhibitors were obtained through structure-based drug design, synthesized, screened from ACC enzymatic measurement platform and elucidated in cell culture-based assays and animal models. The lipidome and microbiome analysis were integrated to assess the effects of WZ66 on lipids profiles in liver and plasma as well as gut microbiota in the intestine. WZ66 was identified as a novel ACC1/2 inhibitor. It entered systemic circulation rapidly and could accumulate in liver. WZ66 alleviated NASH-related liver features including steatosis, Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells activation in diet-induced obese mice. The triglycerides (TGs) and other lipids including diglycerides (DGs), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) were decreased in WZ66-treated mice as evidenced by lipidome analysis in livers. The lipids profiles in plasma were also altered with WZ66 treatment. Plasma TG were moderately increased, while the activation of SREBP1c was not detected. WZ66 also downregulated the abundance of Allobaculum, Mucispirillum and Prevotella genera as well as Mucispirillum schaedleri species in gut microbiota. WZ66 is an ideal lead compound and a potential drug candidate deserving further investigation in the therapeutics of NASH.","Gao, Ying-sheng; Qian, Min-yi; Wei, Qiang-qiang; Duan, Xu-bin; Wang, Shi-lei; Hu, Hai-yang; Liu, Jun; Pan, Chu-yue; Zhang, Shuo-quan; Qi, Lian-wen; Zhou, Jin-pei; Zhang, Hui-bin; Wang, Li-rui",Acta Pharmacol Sin,137,1

In this study, we investigated the effects of rifampicin (RFP) on the membrane expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and the relationship between oxidative stress and RFP-induced endocytosis of MRP2 in HepG2 cells. We found that RFP (12.5–50 μM) dose-dependently decreased the expression and membrane localization of MRP2 in HepG2 cells without changing the messenger RNA level. RFP (50 μM) induced oxidative stress responses that further activated the PKC-ERK/JNK/p38 (protein kinase C-extracellular signal-regulated kinase/c-JUN N-terminal kinase/p38) and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) signaling pathways in HepG2 cells. Pretreatment with glutathione reduced ethyl ester (2 mM) not only reversed the changes in oxidative stress indicators and signaling molecules but also diminished RFP-induced reduction in green fluorescence intensity of MRP2. We conducted co-immunoprecipitation assays and revealed that a direct interaction existed among MRP2, clathrin, and adaptor protein 2 (AP2) in HepG2 cells, and their expression was clearly affected by the changes in intracellular redox levels. Knockdown of clathrin or AP2 with small interfering RNA attenuated RFP-induced decreases of membrane and total MRP2. We further demonstrated that RFP markedly increased the ubiquitin–proteasome degradation of MRP2 in HepG2 cells, which was mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase GP78, but not HRD1 or TEB4. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that RFP-induced oxidative stress activates the PKC-ERK/JNK/p38 and PI3K signaling pathways that leads to clathrin-dependent endocytosis and ubiquitination of MRP2 in HepG2 cells, which provides new insight into the mechanism of RFP-induced cholestasis.","Xu, Bao-yan; Tang, Xu-dong; Chen, Jing; Wu, Hong-bo; Chen, Wen-sheng; Chen, Lei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,137,1
12819,12819,12819,Advanced biomaterials for cancer immunotherapy,12.312955,8.030967,2020-03-02,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor impairment and progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons. At present, the acute application of neurotoxic drugs such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) are commonly used to simulate the pathology of PD; however, it is difficult to induce the progressive pathogenesis of PD with these models. In this study, we employed DAT promoter-mediated Cre transgenic mice to establish tamoxifen-inducible Dicer conditional knockout (cKO) mice in an effort to mimic the progressive loss of DA neurons and the development of PD-like behavioral phenotypes. The results showed that Dicer cKO mice exhibited progressive loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) following tamoxifen administration. Significant DA loss was observed 6 weeks after tamoxifen administration; accordingly, progressive motor function impairment was also observed. We also found that a significant neuroinflammatory response, as evidenced by microglial proliferation, another hallmark of PD pathogenesis, accompanied the loss of DA neurons. The acute application of levo-DOPA (l-DOPA) relieved the PD-like motor impairments in Dicer cKO mice to exert its antiparkinsonian action, indicating that the model can be used to evaluate the antiparkinsonian efficacy of PD drugs. To further elucidate the potential application of this novel PD animal model for PD drug development, we employed the powerful neuroprotective agent dihydromyricetin (DHM) (10 mg/kg) and the selective sigma-1 receptor agonist PRE-084 (1 mg/kg), both of which were previously shown to produce antiparkinsonian effects. The results indicated that the chronic administration of either DHM or PRE-084 attenuated the Dicer cKO-induced loss of DA neurons and motor impairments, although the two drugs acted through different mechanisms. These data indicate that the Dicer cKO mouse model may be a useful model for investigating the pathological development of PD and intervention-mediated changes. In conclusion, this transgenic mouse model appears to simulate the progressive pathogenesis of PD and may be a potentially useful model for PD drug discovery.","Guo, Chen-hong; Cao, Ting; Zheng, Long-tai; Waddington, John L; Zhen, Xue-chu",Acta Pharmacol Sin,137,1

Emerging evidence suggests the therapeutic potential for ameliorating MI-induced myocardial damages by targeting NLRP3 and pyroptosis. In this study, we investigated the myocardial protection effect of a novel anthraquinone compound (4,5-dihydroxy-7-methyl-9,10-anthraquinone-2-ethyl succinate) named Kanglexin (KLX) in vivo and in vitro. Male C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated either with KLX (20, 40 mg· kg(−1)per day, intragastric gavage) or vehicle for 7 consecutive days prior to ligation of coronary artery to induce permanent MI. KLX administration dose-dependently reduced myocardial infarct size and lactate dehydrogenase release and improved cardiac function as compared to vehicle-treated mice 24 h after MI. We found that MI triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation leading to conversion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 into their active mature forms in the heart, which could expand the infarct size and drive cardiac dysfunction. We also showed that MI induced pyroptosis, as evidenced by increased DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial swelling, and cell membrane rupture, as well as increased levels of pyroptosis-related proteins, including gasdermin D, N-terminal GSDMD, and cleaved caspase-1. All these detrimental alterations were prevented by KLX. In hypoxia- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes, we showed that KLX (10 μM) decreased the elevated levels of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling- and propidium iodide-positive cells, and pyroptosis-related proteins. We conclude that KLX prevents MI-induced cardiac damages and cardiac dysfunction at least partly through attenuating NLRP3 and subsequent cardiomyocyte pyroptosis, and it is worthy of more rigorous investigations for its potential for alleviating ischemic heart disease.","Bian, Yu; Li, Xin; Pang, Ping; Hu, Xue-ling; Yu, Shu-ting; Liu, Yi-ning; Li, Xin; Wang, Ning; Wang, Jin-hui; Xiao, Wei; Du, Wei-jie; Yang, Bao-feng",Acta Pharmacol Sin,137,1

Integrating digital technologies into health program delivery may expand opportunities for youth to receive important health information, yet there are few rigorous studies assessing the effectiveness of this type of intervention. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of In the Know (ITK), a program integrating in-person and technology-based sexual health education for underserved adolescents. METHODS: Youth were engaged in the development of the intervention, including the design of the digital technology and the curriculum content. The intervention focuses on 3 main areas: sexual health and contraceptive use, healthy relationships, and educational and career success. It includes an in-person, classroom component, along with a web-based component to complement and reinforce key content. A cluster randomized controlled trial is in progress among adolescents aged 13-19 years living in Fresno County, California. It is designed to examine the differences in self-reported health and behavioral outcomes among youth in the intervention and control groups at 3 and 9 months. Primary outcomes are condom and contraceptive use or no sex in the past 3 months and use of any clinical health services in the past 3 months. Secondary outcomes include the number of sexual partners in the past 3 months and knowledge of local clinical sexual health services. We will use mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models to assess differences between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: Trial enrollment began in October 2017 and ended in March 2020 with a total of 1260 participants. The mean age of the participants is 15.73 (SD 1.83) years, and 69.98% (867/1239) of the participants report being Hispanic or Latino. Study results will be available in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: ITK has the potential to improve contraceptive and clinic use among underserved youth. This trial will inform future youth-focused health interventions that are considering incorporating technology.

Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α recruits the inflammatory cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in the adipose tissue; however, the mechanisms promoting the MIP-1α expression remain unclear. We hypothesized that MIP-1α co-induced by palmitate and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in monocytic cells/macrophages could be further enhanced in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress. To investigate this, THP-1 monocytic cells and primary human macrophages were co-stimulated with palmitate and TNF-α and mRNA and protein levels of MIP-1α were measured by using quantitative reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), respectively. The cognate receptor of palmitate, toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, was blunted by genetic ablation, neutralization, and chemical inhibition. The involvement of TLR4-downstream pathways, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 or myeloid differentiation (MyD)-88 factor, was determined using IRF3-siRNA or MyD88-deficient cells. Oxidative stress was induced in cells by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) treatment and ROS induction was measured by dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay. The data show that MIP-1α gene/protein expression was upregulated in cells co-stimulated with palmitate/TNF-α compared to those stimulated with either palmitate or TNF-α (P < 0.05). Further, TLR4-IRF3 pathway was implicated in the cooperative induction of MIP-1α in THP-1 cells, and this cooperativity between palmitate and TNF-α was clathrin-dependent and also required signaling through c-Jun and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). Notably, ROS itself induced MIP-1α and could further promote MIP-1α secretion together with palmitate and TNF-α. In conclusion, palmitate and TNF-α co-induce MIP-1α in human monocytic cells via the TLR4-IRF3 pathway and signaling involving c-Jun/NF-κB. Importantly, oxidative stress leads to ROS-driven MIP-1α amplification, which may have significance for metabolic inflammation.","Sindhu, Sardar; Akhter, Nadeem; Wilson, Ajit; Thomas, Reeby; Arefanian, Hossein; Al Madhoun, Ashraf; Al-Mulla, Fahd; Ahmad, Rasheed",Cells,137,8

In the present study we first showed that the expression levels of RNF6 in MM were significantly elevated compared with the bone marrow cells of healthy donors. Overexpression of RNF6 in LP1 and PRMI-8266 MM cell lines promoted cell proliferation, whereas knockdown of RNF6 led to apoptosis of MM cells. Furthermore, we revealed that RNF6, as a ubiquitin ligase, interacted with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and induced its K63-linked polyubiquitination. Different from current knowledge, RNF6 increased GR stability at both endogenous and exogenous contexts. Such an action greatly promoted GR transcriptional activity, which was confirmed by luciferase assays and by the increased expression levels of prosurvival genes including Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, two typical downstream genes of the GR pathway. Consistent with these findings, ectopic expression of RNF6 in MM cells conferred resistance to dexamethasone, a typical anti-myeloma agent. In conclusion, we demonstrate that RNF6 promotes MM cell proliferation and survival by inducing atypical polyubiquitination to GR, and RNF6 could be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of MM.","Ren, Ying; Xu, Xin; Mao, Chen-yu; Han, Kun-kun; Xu, Yu-jia; Cao, Bi-yin; Zhang, Zu-bin; Sethi, Gautam; Tang, Xiao-wen; Mao, Xin-liang",Acta Pharmacol Sin,137,8

We showed that treatment with interleukin 1β (IL‐1β) induced EnMT of HUVECs via activation of NF-κB/Snail pathway, which was further exacerbated by knockdown of protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 (PTPL1). We demonstrated that PTPL1 inhibited NF-κB/Snail through dephosphorylating and stabilizing IκBα. IL‐1β or hypoxia could downregulate PTPL1 expression in HUVECs. The deregulation of PTPL1/NF-κB signaling was validated in a monocrotaline-induced rat PH (MCT-PH) model and clinical PH specimens.

Donepezil is used to treat mild to moderate AD, and it has been shown to treat cognitive impairment and memory deficits caused by VD. However, the action mechanism of donepezil against VD has not been clarified. In this study, a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) model was established in rats to simulate the pathology of VD. Two weeks after the surgery, the rats were administered donepezil (10 mg · kg(−1) · d(−1), ig) for 3 weeks, and then subjected to behavioral tests. We showed that donepezil treatment significantly improved the performance of BCCAO rats in Morris Water Mazes test and Step-down test. Furthermore, we showed that donepezil treatment significantly attenuated neurodegeneration and restored the synapse dendritic spines density in cortex and hippocampus. We revealed that donepezil treatment significantly increased BDNF expression in cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, donepezil treatment significantly decreased nuclear translocation of HDAC6 and the binding between HDAC6 and BDNF promoter IV in cortex, but not in the hippocampus. The attenuated neurodegeneration by donepezil in cortex and hippocampus might due to the reduced ROS levels and increased phosphorylation of AMPK, whereas increased phosphorylation of AKT was only detected in cortex. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that donepezil attenuates neurodegeneration in cortex and hippocampus via increasing BDNF expression; the regulation of donepezil on HDAC6 occurred in cortex, but not in the hippocampus.

We found that CMR dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human lung cancer H460, A549 and PC-9 cells. Furthermore, exposure to low and median doses of CMR induced paraptosis but not apoptosis, which was presented as the formation of extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation with increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, Bip and Chop, as well as activation of MAPK pathway in the lung cancer cells. Knockdown of Bip with siRNA not only reduced the cell-killing effect of CMR, but also decreased the percentage of cytoplasmic vacuoles in H460 cells. Moreover, CMR also increased the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to radiotherapy through enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress. In lung cancer H460 cell xenograft nude mice, combined treatment of CMR and radiation caused greatly enhanced tumor growth inhibition with upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins and activation of pErk in xenograft tumor tissue.

We identified 4,311 genes and 91 proteins differentially expressed between scale-type and hair-type tissue, of which 6 genes were shared by the transcriptome and proteome. Differentiation altered the abundance of hundreds of proteins and mRNA in the two types of skin appendages, many of which are involved in keratinocyte differentiation, epidermal cell differentiation, and multicellular organism development based on GO enrichment analysis, and FoxO, MAPK, and p53 signalling pathways based on KEGG enrichment analysis. DEGs in scale-type tissues were also significantly enriched in immune-related terms and pathways compared with that in hair-type tissues. Thus, we propose that pangolins have a normal skin innate immune system.

Updated phylogenies are central to this understanding. Most cladograms of Flaviviridae focus on specific lineages and ignore outgroups, hampering the efficacy of the analysis to test ingroup monophyly and relationships. This is due to the lack of annotated Flaviviridae genomes, which has gene content variation among genera. This variation makes analysis without partitioning difficult. Therefore, we developed an annotation pipeline for the genera of Flaviviridae (Flavirirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus, and Pestivirus, named “Fast Loci Annotation of Viruses” (FLAVi; http://flavi-web.com/), that combines ab initio and homology-based strategies. FLAVi recovered 100% of the genes in Flavivirus and Hepacivirus genomes. In Pegivirus and Pestivirus, annotation efficiency was 100% except for one partition each. There were no false positives.

A homozygous missense variant leading to drastic decrease of PDE2A enzymatic activity was reported in one patient with childhood-onset choreodystonia preceded by paroxysmal dyskinesia and associated with cognitive impairment and interictal EEG abnormalities. Here, we report three new cases with biallelic PDE2A variants identified by trio whole-exome sequencing. Mitochondria network was analyzed after Mitotracker™ Red staining in control and mutated primary fibroblasts. Analysis of retrospective video of patients’ movement disorder and refinement of phenotype was carried out. We identified a homozygous gain of stop codon variant c.1180C>T; p.(Gln394*) in PDE2A in siblings and compound heterozygous variants in young adult: a missense c.446C>T; p.(Pro149Leu) and splice-site variant c.1922+5G>A predicted and shown to produce an out of frame transcript lacking exon 22. All three patients had cognitive impairment or developmental delay. The phenotype of the two oldest patients, aged 9 and 26, was characterized by childhood-onset refractory paroxysmal dyskinesia initially misdiagnosed as epilepsy due to interictal EEG abnormalities. The youngest patient showed a proven epilepsy at the age of 4 months and no paroxysmal dyskinesia at 15 months. Interestingly, analysis of the fibroblasts with the biallelic variants in PDE2A variants revealed mitochondria network morphology changes. Together with previously reported case, our three patients confirm that biallelic PDE2A variants are a cause of childhood-onset refractory paroxysmal dyskinesia with cognitive impairment, sometimes associated with choreodystonia and interictal baseline EEG abnormalities or epilepsy.","Doummar, Diane; Dentel, Christel; Lyautey, Romane; Metreau, Julia; Keren, Boris; Drouot, Nathalie; Malherbe, Ludivine; Bouilleret, Viviane; Courraud, Jérémie; Valenti-Hirsch, Maria Paola; Minotti, Lorella; Dozieres-Puyravel, Blandine; Bär, Séverine; Scholly, Julia; Schaefer, Elise; Nava, Caroline; Wirth, Thomas; Nasser, Hala; de Salins, Marie; de Saint Martin, Anne; Warde, Marie Thérèse Abi; Kahane, Philippe; Hirsch, Edouard; Anheim, Mathieu; Friant, Sylvie; Chelly, Jamel; Mignot, Cyril; Rudolf, Gabrielle",Eur J Hum Genet,137,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of 100 consecutive patients who attended the emergency department of Dhahran Eye Specialist Hospital with isolated, AOBD. The exclusion criteria were: (a) monocular diplopia, (b) binocular diplopia accompanied with neurological deficits other than ocular muscles dysfunction and (c) thyroid eye disease. All patients were followed until resolution of the diplopia or onward referral to another specialty for further management. RESULTS: Male:female ratio was 2:1. Median age of the cohort was 56 years (range 18–90 years). Associated nerve palsy included: abducens nerve (n = 57 patients), oculomotor (n = 32 patients) and trochlear nerve (n = 3 patients). Microvascular ischaemia and ocular myasthenia gravis were two most common pathogenic mechanisms. AOBD resolved spontaneously in 98% of patients.

N-linked glycans are synthesized from Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) precursors that are trimmed and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus by glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. Endo-α-1,2-mannosidase (MANEA) is the sole endo-acting glycoside hydrolase involved in N-glycan trimming and is located within the Golgi, where it allows ER-escaped glycoproteins to bypass the classical N-glycosylation trimming pathway involving ER glucosidases I and II. There is considerable interest in the use of small molecules that disrupt N-linked glycosylation as therapeutic agents for diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Here we report the structure of the catalytic domain of human MANEA and complexes with substrate-derived inhibitors, which provide insight into dynamic loop movements that occur on substrate binding. We reveal structural features of the human enzyme that explain its substrate preference and the mechanistic basis for catalysis. These structures have inspired the development of new inhibitors that disrupt host protein N-glycan processing of viral glycans and reduce the infectivity of bovine viral diarrhea and dengue viruses in cellular models. These results may contribute to efforts aimed at developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents and help provide a more in-depth understanding of the biology of mammalian glycosylation.","Sobala, Łukasz F.; Fernandes, Pearl Z.; Hakki, Zalihe; Thompson, Andrew J.; Howe, Jonathon D.; Hill, Michelle; Zitzmann, Nicole; Davies, Scott; Stamataki, Zania; Butters, Terry D.; Alonzi, Dominic S.; Williams, Spencer J.; Davies, Gideon J.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,137,1

There is, however, little research on the impact of religious leaders on parents' decision-making processes pertaining to childhood vaccination. Ultra-orthodox Jewish religious leaders (rabbis) are considered authorities on health issues, and most of them encourage parents to vaccinate their children. Yet, there have been several recent outbreaks of measles in the ultra-orthodox population in Israel, as well as in other countries. The aim is to study the role played by rabbis in the decision-making process of Israeli ultra-orthodox Jewish parents with regard to vaccination. In-depth interviews were conducted during 2019 with ten Israeli ultra-orthodox Jewish mothers who do not vaccinate their children. The interviewees acknowledged that rabbis generally advocate vaccination. Yet they do not consult them and at times even disregard their instructions. The interviewees search for information on vaccination for themselves (mostly online) and decide not to vaccinate their children based on their assessment of risk. Contrary to the scholarly literature that points to the central role of religious leaders in dealing with health issues, the ultra-orthodox mothers' decision not to vaccinate their children appears to have been made despite the rabbis' instructions and not for religious reasons. These mothers' decision-making process is similar to that of mothers who do not vaccinate their children in other countries with respect to the aspect of gender, the search for information, and the reasons reported. Contacting the ultra-orthodox mothers directly and addressing their concerns about risk increase vaccination rates among the ultra-orthodox Jewish population.","Keshet, Yael; Popper-Giveon, Ariela",J Relig Health,137,1

The results show that the beginnings of scientific production date back to 1971. There are two clearly differentiated moments in scientific production. A first moment (1971–2004), where the production volume is low. A second moment (2005–2019), where the volume of production increases considerably. Therefore, it can be said that the subject began to be relevant for the scientific community from 2005 to the present.

Despite these alarming statistics, treatment options for cryptococcosis remain limited, with only three major classes of drugs approved for clinical use. Exacerbating the public health burden is the fact that the only new class of antifungal drugs developed in decades, the echinocandins, displays negligible antifungal activity against Cryptococcus spp., and the efficacy of the remaining therapeutics is hampered by host toxicity and pathogen resistance. Here, we describe the current arsenal of antifungal agents and the treatment strategies employed to manage cryptococcal disease. We further elaborate on the recent advances in our understanding of the intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that are utilized by Cryptococcus spp. to evade therapeutic treatments. Finally, we review potential therapeutic strategies, including combination therapy, the targeting of virulence traits, impairing stress response pathways and modulating host immunity, to effectively treat infections caused by Cryptococcus spp. Overall, understanding of the mechanisms that regulate anti-cryptococcal drug resistance, coupled with advances in genomics technologies and high-throughput screening methodologies, will catalyse innovation and accelerate antifungal drug discovery.","Iyer, Kali R.; Revie, Nicole M.; Fu, Ci; Robbins, Nicole; Cowen, Leah E.",Nat Rev Microbiol,137,1

Aim of the current study was to focus on the effectiveness of a strategy based on TMP-SMX as de-escalation from β-lactam including regimens. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including patients who were hospitalized for VAP from 2011 to 2019. Patients were distributed in two groups: NO SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group, including patients who received β-lactams for all treatment duration, and SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group, which included patients who switched to TMP-SMX from a β-lactam including regimen after microbiology diagnosis. Three clinical outcomes were analyzed: mortality at 30 days from the start of the antibiotic treatment (T30), mortality at the end of treatment (EoT), and acquisition of multidrug-resistant bacteria during hospitalization in intensive care unit. RESULTS: Overall, 70 patients were included in the current study, 32/70 (45.7%) in NO SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group and 38/70 (54.3%) in SWITCH TO TMP-SMX group, 37/70 (52.8%) had been already included in the previous study. No significant differences in clinical outcomes and patient’s characteristics were found when the two groups were compared. CONCLUSIONS: De-escalation to TMP-SMX for VAP treatment was not associated with higher mortality at EoT and T30 than standard treatment with β-lactam. Monotherapy with TMP-SMX as de-escalation from broad-spectrum empirical regimens is a β-lactam sparing strategy worthy to be further investigated in either multicenter cohort studies or randomized clinical trials.","Strazzulla, Alessio; Postorino, Maria Concetta; Youbong, Tracie; Rouyer, Maxence; Flateau, Clara; Chakvetadze, Catherine; de Pontfarcy, Astrid; Pitsch, Aurelia; Jochmans, Sebastien; Belfeki, Nabil; Monchi, Mehran; Diamantis, Sylvain",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,137,8

This environment is filled with many types of users’ emotions regarding food safety, especially negative emotions that can easily cause panic or anger among the population. However, the mechanisms of how it affects users’ emotions have not been fully studied. Therefore, from the perspective of communication and social psychology, this study uses the content analysis method to analyze factors affecting social media users’ emotions regarding food safety issues. In total, 371 tweet samples of genetically modified food security in Sina Weibo (similar to Twitter) were encoded, measured, and analyzed. The major findings are as follows: (1) Tweet account type, tweet topic, and emotion object were all significantly related to emotion type. Tweet depth and objectivity were both positively affected by emotion type, and objectivity had a greater impact. (2) Account type, tweet topic, and emotion object were all significantly related to emotion intensity. When the depths were the same, emotion intensity became stronger with the decrease in objectivity. (3) Account type, tweet topic, emotion object, and emotion type were all significantly related to a user’s emotion communication capacity. Tweet depth, objectivity, and user’s emotion intensity were positively correlated with emotion communication capacity. Positive emotions had stronger communication capacities than negative ones, which is not consistent with previous studies. These findings help us to understand both theoretically and practically the changes and dissemination of user’s emotions in a food safety and health information environment.","Xiong, Hao; Lv, Shangbin",Healthcare (Basel),137,1

Currently, no in-field diagnostic exists for M. brunnea. Here, we described a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid and sensitive detection of M. brunnea. A set of six oligonucleotide primers was designed to recognize eight distinct sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of M. brunnea. The LAMP assay was optimized by the combination of high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity for the detection of less than 10 pg/μL of target genomic DNA in 60 min per reaction at 65 °C, whereas with PCR, there was no amplification of DNA with concentration less than 1 ng/μL. Among the genomic DNA of 20 fungalisolates, only the samples containing the genomic DNA of M. brunnea changed from violet to sky blue (visible to the naked eye) by using hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye. No DNA was amplified from the eight other fungus species, including two other Marssonina pathogens, three other foliar fungi pathogens of poplar, and three common foliar fungal endophytes of poplar. Moreover, the detection rates of M. brunnea from artificially and naturally infected poplar leaves were 10/16 (62.5%) and 6/16 (37.5%) using PCR, respectively, while the positive-sample ratios were both 16/16 (100%) using the LAMP assay.

To gain information on this risk, we studied the potential for reassortment between two contemporary H9N2 and H5N8 viruses. While the replacement of the PB2, PA, and NS genes of highly pathogenic H5N8 by homologous segments from H9N2 produced infectious H5N8 progeny, PB1 and NP of H9N2 were not able to replace the respective segments from H5N8 due to residues outside the packaging region. Furthermore, exchange of the PB2, PA, and NS segments of H5N8 by those of H9N2 increased replication, polymerase activity and interferon antagonism of the H5N8 reassortants in human cells. Notably, H5N8 reassortants carrying the H9N2-subtype PB2 segment and to lesser extent the PA or NS segments showed remarkably increased virulence in mice as indicated by rapid onset of mortality, reduced mean time to death and increased body weight loss. Simultaneously, we observed that in chickens the H5N8 reassortants, particularly with the H9N2 NS segment, demonstrated significantly reduced transmission to co-housed chickens. Together, while the limited capacity for reassortment between co-circulating H9N2 and H5N8 viruses and the reduced bird-to-bird transmission of possible H5N8 reassortants in chickens may limit the evolution of such reassortant viruses, they show a higher replication potential in human cells and increased virulence in mammals.","Mostafa, Ahmed; Blaurock, Claudia; Scheibner, David; Müller, Christin; Blohm, Ulrike; Schäfer, Alexander; Gischke, Marcel; Salaheldin, Ahmed H; Nooh, Hanaa Z; Ali, Mohamed A; Breithaupt, Angele; Mettenleiter, Thomas C; Pleschka, Stephan; Abdelwhab, Elsayed M",Virus Evol,137,1

METHODS: Bayesian analysis of 3904 critically ill adult patients expected to receive invasive ventilation > 24 h and enrolled in a multinational randomized controlled trial comparing early DEX with usual care sedation. RESULTS: HTE was assessed according to age and clusters (based on 12 baseline characteristics) using a Bayesian hierarchical models. DEX was associated with lower 90-day mortality compared to usual care in patients > 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.83 [95% credible interval [CrI] 0.68–1.00], with 97.7% probability of reduced mortality across broad categories of illness severity. Conversely, the probability of increased mortality in patients ≤ 65 years was 98.5% (OR 1.26 [95% CrI 1.02–1.56]. Two clusters were identified: cluster 1 (976 patients) mostly operative, and cluster 2 (2346 patients), predominantly non-operative. There was a greater probability of benefit with DEX in cluster 1 (OR 0.86 [95% CrI 0.65–1.14]) across broad categories of age, with 86.4% probability that DEX is more beneficial in cluster 1 than cluster 2. CONCLUSION: In critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, early sedation with dexmedetomidine exhibited a high probability of reduced 90-day mortality in older patients regardless of operative or non-operative cluster status. Conversely, a high probability of increased 90-day mortality was observed in younger patients of non-operative status. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

In this article, we review the risk of climate-related impacts along the land-based livestock food supply chain. Although a quantification of the net impacts of climate change on the livestock sector is beyond the reach of our current understanding, there is strong evidence that there will be impacts throughout the supply chain, from farm production to processing operations, storage, transport, retailing and human consumption. The risks of climate-related impacts are highly context-specific but expected to be higher in environments that are already hot and have limited socio-economic and institutional resources for adaptation. Large uncertainties remain as to climate futures and the exposure and responses of the interlinked human and natural systems to climatic changes over time. Consequently, adaptation choices will need to account for a wide range of possible futures, including those with low probability but large consequences.","Godde, C.M.; Mason-D’Croz, D.; Mayberry, D.E.; Thornton, P.K.; Herrero, M.",Glob Food Sec,137,1

As a result, little is known about the costs and effects of delivering lifesaving emergency care, hindering health systems planning, budgeting and prioritization exercises. To determine healthcare costs of emergency care services at public facilities in Uganda, we estimate the median cost of care for five sentinel conditions and 13 interventions. METHODS: A direct, activity-based costing was carried out at five regional referral hospitals over a four-week period from September to October 2019. Hospital costs were determined using bottom-up micro-costing methodology from a provider perspective. Resource use was enumerated via observation and unit costs were derived from National Medical Stores lists. Cost per condition per patient and measures of central tendency for conditions and interventions were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and Nemyeni post-hoc tests were conducted to determine significant differences between costs of the conditions. RESULTS: Eight hundred seventy-two patient cases were captured with an overall median cost of care of $15.53 USD ($14.44 to $19.22). The median cost per condition was highest for post-partum haemorrhage at $17.25 ($15.02 to $21.36), followed by road traffic injuries at $15.96 ($14.51 to $20.30), asthma at $15.90 ($14.76 to $19.30), pneumonia at $15.55 ($14.65 to $20.12), and paediatric diarrhoea at $14.61 ($13.74 to $15.57). The median cost per intervention was highest for fracture reduction and splinting at $27.77 ($22.00 to $31.50). Cost values differ between sentinel conditions (p < 0.05) with treatments for paediatric diarrhoea having the lowest median cost of all conditions (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to describe the direct costs of emergency care in hospitals in Uganda by observing the delivery of clinical services, using robust activity-based costing and time motion methodology. We find that emergency care interventions for key drivers of morbidity and mortality can be delivered at considerably lower costs than many priority health interventions. Further research assessing acute care delivery would be useful in planning wider health care delivery systems development.

In bacteria, the RNA chaperone Hfq is an important post-transcriptional gene regulator. Using live-cell super-resolution imaging, we can distinguish Hfq binding to different sizes of cellular RNAs. We demonstrate that under normal growth conditions, Hfq exhibits widespread mRNA-binding activity, with the distal face of Hfq contributing mostly to the mRNA binding in vivo. In addition, sRNAs can either co-occupy Hfq with the mRNA as a ternary complex, or displace the mRNA from Hfq in a binding face-dependent manner, suggesting mechanisms through which sRNAs rapidly access Hfq to induce sRNA-mediated gene regulation. Finally, our data suggest that binding of Hfq to certain mRNAs through its distal face can recruit RNase E to promote turnover of these mRNAs in a sRNA-independent manner, and such regulatory function of Hfq can be decoyed by sRNA competitors that bind strongly at the distal face.","Park, Seongjin; Prévost, Karine; Heideman, Emily M; Carrier, Marie-Claude; Azam, Muhammad S; Reyer, Matthew A; Liu, Wei; Massé, Eric; Fei, Jingyi",,137,1

Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-λ4-Null), rs368234815-dG allele was most strongly associated with an earlier time-to-first episode of gastrointestinal infections (p = 0.003). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with rs368234815-dG allele, with OR = 1.53, 95%CI (1.13–2.07), p = 0.005 for gastrointestinal infections and OR = 1.30, 95%CI (1.02–1.65), p = 0.033 for malaria.

INTERVENTIONS: The mCARE programme involved digitally enhanced pregnancy surveillance, individually targeted text messages and in-person home-visit to pregnant women for care-seeking reminders for antenatal care, child delivery and postnatal care. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a model to project population and service coverage increases with annual geographical expansion (from 1 million to 10 million population over 10 years) of the mCARE programme and the status quo. MAJOR OUTCOMES: For this modelling study, we used Lives Saved Tool to estimate the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) that would be averted by 2027, if the coverage of health interventions was increased in mCARE programme and the status quo, respectively. Economic costs were captured from a societal perspective using an ingredients approach and expressed in 2018 US dollars. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: We estimated the mCARE programme to avert 3076 deaths by 2027 at an incremental cost of $43 million relative to the status quo, which is translated to $462 per DALY averted. The societal costs were estimated to be $115 million for mCARE programme (48% of which are programme costs, 35% user costs and 17% provider costs). With the continued implementation and geographical scaling-up, the mCARE programme improved its cost-effectiveness from $1152 to $462 per DALY averted from 5 to 10 years. CONCLUSION: Mobile phone-based pregnancy surveillance systems with individually scheduled text messages and home-visit reminder strategies can be highly cost-effective in Bangladesh. The cost-effectiveness may improve as it promotes facility-based child delivery and achieves greater programme cost efficiency with programme scale and sustainability.","Jo, Youngji; LeFevre, Amnesty Elizabeth; Ali, Hasmot; Mehra, Sucheta; Alland, Kelsey; Shaikh, Saijuddin; Haque, Rezwanul; Pak, Esther Semee; Chowdhury, Mridul; Labrique, Alain B",BMJ Open,137,1

However, investigation among children under 5 years old in Jiangsu, China remains quite limited. Data including infectious diarrhea cases among children under five years old and daily meteorological indexes in Jiangsu, China from 2015 to 2019 were collected. The lag-effects up to 21 days of daily maximum temperature (Tmax) on infectious diarrhea were explored using a quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) approach. The cases number of infectious diarrhea was significantly associated with seasonal variation of meteorological factors, and the burden of disease mainly occurred among children aged 0–2 years old. Moreover, when the reference value was set at 16.7°C, Tmax had a significant lag-effect on cases of infectious diarrhea among children under 5 years old in Jiangsu Province, which was increased remarkably in cold weather with the highest risk at 8°C. The results of DLNM analysis implicated that the lag-effect of Tmax varied among the 13 cities in Jiangsu and had significant differences in 8 cities. The highest risk of Tmax was presented at 5 lag days in Huaian with a maximum RR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.29). Suzhou which had the highest number of diarrhea cases (15830 cases), had a maximum RR of 1.04 (95% CI:1.03, 1.05) on lag 15 days. Tmax is a considerable indicator to predict the epidemic of infectious diarrhea among 13 cities in Jiangsu, which reminds us that in cold seasons, more preventive strategies and measures should be done to prevent infectious diarrhea.

The environment, mutational history, and random processes can all impact the exact evolutionary paths, but to which extent these factors contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of a particular system is an open question. Especially in a virus like HIV-1, with a large mutation rate and large population sizes, evolution is expected to be highly predictable if the impact of environment and history is low, and evolution is not neutral. We investigated the effect of environment and mutational history by analyzing sequences from a long-term evolution experiment, in which HIV-1 was passaged on 2 different cell types in 8 independent evolutionary lines and 8 derived lines, 4 of which involved a switch of the environment. The experiments lasted for 240–300 passages, corresponding to approximately 400–600 generations or almost 3 years. The sequences show signs of extensive parallel evolution—the majority of mutations that are shared between independent lines appear in both cell types, but we also find that both environment and mutational history significantly impact the evolutionary paths. We conclude that HIV-1 evolution is robust to small changes in the environment, similar to a transmission event in the absence of an immune response or drug pressure. We also find that the fitness landscape of HIV-1 is largely smooth, although we find some evidence for both positive and negative epistatic interactions between mutations.","Bons, Eva; Leemann, Christine; Metzner, Karin J.; Regoes, Roland R.",PLoS Biol,137,1

Using the Laboratory Course Assessment Survey, we found that students in CURE sections perceived higher levels of authentic research elements than students in inquiry-based sections. To identify specific factors that impact perceptions of research authenticity, we administered weekly reflection questions to CURE students. Coding of reflection responses revealed that experiences of failure, iteration, using scientific practices, and the relevant discoveries in their projects enhanced students’ perceived authenticity of their research experiences. Although failure and iteration can occur in both CUREs and inquiry-based curricula, our findings indicate these experiences–in conjunction with the Relevant Discovery element of a CURE–may be particularly powerful in enhancing student perceptions of research authenticity in a CURE.","Goodwin, Emma C.; Anokhin, Vladimir; Gray, MacKenzie J.; Zajic, Daniel E.; Podrabsky, Jason E.; Shortlidge, Erin E.",CBE Life Sci Educ,137,8

We investigated the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of delirium in NIV patients. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital. Patients in whom NIV was used as a first-line intervention were enrolled. During NIV intervention, delirium was screened using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU each day. The association between delirium and poor outcomes (e.g., NIV failure, ICU and hospital mortality) was investigated using forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 1083 patients. Of these, 196 patients (18.1%) experienced delirium during NIV intervention. Patients with delirium had higher NIV failure rates (37.8% vs. 21.0%, p < 0.01), higher ICU mortality (33.2% vs. 14.3%, p < 0.01), and higher hospital mortality (37.2% vs. 17.0%, p < 0.01) than subjects without delirium. They also had a longer duration of NIV (median 6.3 vs. 3.7 days, p < 0.01), and stayed longer in the ICU (median 9.0 vs. 6.0 days, p < 0.01) and the hospital (median 14.5 vs. 11.0 days, p < 0.01). These results were confirmed in COPD and non-COPD cohorts. According to subtype, compared to hyperactive delirium patients, hypoactive and mixed delirium patients spent more days and many more days on NIV (median 3.4 vs. 6.5 vs. 10.1 days, p < 0.01). Similar outcomes were found for length of stay in the ICU and hospital. However, NIV failure, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality did not differ among the three subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is associated with increases in poor outcomes (NIV failure, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality) and the use of medical resources (duration of NIV, and lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital). Regarding subtype, hypoactive and mixed delirium are associated with higher, and much higher, consumption of medical resources, respectively, compared to hyperactive delirium.

This limitation can be overcome by leveraging randomly allocated genetic variants in nonlinear Mendelian randomization analyses. Based on their association with blood pressure traits in a genome-wide association study of 299 024 European ancestry individuals, we selected 253 genetic variants to proxy the effect of modifying systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Considering the outcomes of incident coronary artery disease, stroke and the combined outcome of CVD, linear and nonlinear Mendelian randomization analyses were performed on 255 714 European ancestry participants without a history of CVD or antihypertensive medication use. There was no evidence favoring nonlinear relationships of genetically proxied systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the cardiovascular outcomes over linear relationships. For every 10-mm Hg increase in genetically proxied systolic blood pressure, risk of incident CVD increased by 49% (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.38–1.61]), with similar estimates obtained for coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.38–1.63]) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.22–1.70]). Genetically proxied blood pressure had a similar relationship with CVD in men and women. These findings provide evidence to support that even for individuals who do not have elevated blood pressure, public health interventions achieving persistent blood pressure reduction will be of considerable benefit in the primary prevention of CVD.","Malik, Rainer; Georgakis, Marios K.; Vujkovic, Marijana; Damrauer, Scott M.; Elliott, Paul; Karhunen, Ville; Giontella, Alice; Fava, Cristiano; Hellwege, Jacklyn N.; Shuey, Megan M.; Edwards, Todd L.; Rogne, Tormod; Åsvold, Bjørn O.; Brumpton, Ben M.; Burgess, Stephen; Dichgans, Martin; Gill, Dipender",Hypertension,137,8

We hypothesised that two methods could predict fluid responsiveness during cardiac surgery based on their ability to alter preload and thereby induce changes in arterial blood pressure characteristics: (1) the change caused by extrasystolic beats and (2) the change caused by a fast infusion of 50 ml crystalloid (micro-fluid challenge). Arterial blood pressure and electrocardiogram waveforms were collected during surgical preparation of the left internal mammary artery in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients received a fluid challenge (5 ml/kg ideal body weight). The first 50 ml were infused in 10 s and comprised the micro-fluid challenge. Predictor variables were defined as post-ectopic beat changes (compared with sinus beats preceding ectopy) in arterial blood pressure characteristics, such as pulse pressure and systolic pressure, or micro-fluid challenge induced changes in the same blood pressure characteristics. Patients were considered fluid responsive if stroke volume index increased by 15% or more after the full fluid challenge. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Fifty-six patients were included for statistical analysis. Thirty-one had extrasystoles. The maximal AUC was found for the extrasystolic change in pulse pressure and was 0.70 (CI [0.35 to 1.00]). The micro-fluid challenge method generally produced lower AUC point estimates. Extrasystoles did not predict fluid responsiveness with convincing accuracy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and changes in arterial waveform indices following a micro-fluid challenge could not predict fluid responsiveness. Given a low number of fluid responders and inherently reduced statistical power, our data does not support firm conclusions about the utility of the extrasystolic method.

Several lines of evidence indicate that statins regulate multiple proteins associated with the regulation of differing cellular pathways. The 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway plays an important role in metabolism homeostasis with effects on cellular processes including apoptosis and the inflammatory responses through several pathways. Recently, it has been shown that statins can affect the AMPK pathway in differing physiological and pathological ways, resulting in anti-cancer, cardio-protective, neuro-protective, and anti-tubercular effects; additionally, they have therapeutic effects on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diabetes mellitus-associated complications. Statins activate AMPK as an energy sensor that inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in cancer cells, whilst exerting its cardio-protective effects through inhibition of inflammation and fibrosis, and promotion of angiogenesis. Furthermore, statin-associated AMPK activation leads to decreased lipid accumulation and decreased amyloid beta deposition in the liver and brain, respectively, and may have therapeutic effects on the liver and neurons.

Here we present the cryo-EM structure of a near intact extracellular region complex of Sema3A, PlexinA4 and Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure shows a large symmetric 2:2:2 assembly in which each subunit makes multiple interactions with others. The two PlexinA4 molecules in the complex do not interact directly, but their membrane proximal regions are close to each other and poised to promote the formation of the intracellular active dimer for signaling. The structure reveals a previously unknown interface between the a2b1b2 module in Nrp1 and the Sema domain of Sema3A. This interaction places the a2b1b2 module at the top of the complex, far away from the plasma membrane where the transmembrane regions of Nrp1 and PlexinA4 embed. As a result, the region following the a2b1b2 module in Nrp1 must span a large distance to allow the connection to the transmembrane region, suggesting an essential role for the long non-conserved linkers and the MAM domain in neuropilin in the semaphorin/plexin/neuropilin complex.","Lu, Defen; Shang, Guijun; He, Xiaojing; Bai, Xiao-chen; Zhang, Xuewu",Nat Commun,137,8

Pooling radiomic features of such data in a statistical analysis is however challenging, as they are sensitive to the variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings, which is often unavoidable in a multicentre retrospective analysis. A statistical harmonization strategy called ComBat was utilized in radiomics studies to deal with the “center-effect”. The goal of the present work was to integrate a transfer learning (TL) technique within ComBat—and recently developed alternate versions of ComBat with improved flexibility (M-ComBat) and robustness (B-ComBat)–to allow the use of a previously determined harmonization transform to the radiomic feature values of new patients from an already known center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed TL approach were incorporated in the four versions of ComBat (standard, B, M, and B-M ComBat). The proposed approach was evaluated using a dataset of 189 locally advanced cervical cancer patients from 3 centers, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, with the clinical endpoint of predicting local failure. The impact performance of the TL approach was evaluated by comparing the harmonization achieved using only parts of the data to the reference (harmonization achieved using all the available data). It was performed through three different machine learning pipelines. RESULTS: The proposed TL technique was successful in harmonizing features of new patients from a known center in all versions of ComBat, leading to predictive models reaching similar performance as the ones developed using the features harmonized with all the data available. CONCLUSION: The proposed TL approach enables applying a previously determined ComBat transform to new, previously unseen data.","Da-ano, Ronrick; Lucia, François; Masson, Ingrid; Abgral, Ronan; Alfieri, Joanne; Rousseau, Caroline; Mervoyer, Augustin; Reinhold, Caroline; Pradier, Olivier; Schick, Ulrike; Visvikis, Dimitris; Hatt, Mathieu",PLoS One,137,1

Our study aimed to evaluate the geographical distribution of cataract surgeons and prospectively identify the factors associated with the increased productivity in cataract surgery and efficiency in outpatient ophthalmic services in rural Chinese hospitals. METHODS: Data were prospectively collated from various hospital datasets and the census registered by the geographical unit county. Prior to mapping, the geographical location data of counties were cross-linked with the equivalent ophthalmologist and service output data to create categories and map multiple data attributes. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to characterise the data stratified by county. Linear regression analyses were used to explore the factors associated with the increased productivity/efficiency. RESULTS: The ophthalmologists, surgical productivity of ophthalmologists and outpatient efficacy of ophthalmologists significantly varied across counties. During the period between 2016 and 2018, the median (IQR) change in surgical productivity of and outpatient efficacy of ophthalmologists were 31.627 (−3.33 to 29.94) and 118.08 (−132.30 to 740.89). In the simple regression analysis for predictors of a high productivity change, only the increased number of phaco machine had statistical significance (p=0.003). In addition, only the gross domestic product per capita in 2016 was associated with an increased improvement in efficiency of outpatient services (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the ophthalmologist productivity and the efficiency of outpatient services were unequally geographically distributed, and their predictors were identified. Further studies to elucidate the extent of the problem and improve the health service delivery models are required.","Zhong, Jing; Wang, Wei; Wang, Hongxi; Huang, Jingjing; Li, Tao; Chen, Jingjing; Chen, Wan; Yuan, Jin; Chen, Weirong",BMJ Open,137,8

GDM is associated with a pro-inflammatory state and increased oxidative stress, which are both involved in vascular damage in diabetes. Our aim was to study Myo anti-inflammatory/antioxidant potential effects on an in vitro model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). To this end, monocyte cell adhesion to HUVECs, adhesion molecule membrane exposure, and oxidative stress levels were determined in cells from control (C-) and GDM women treated during pregnancy either with diet only (GD-) or with diet plus Myo (GD+Myo). To deeply study the vascular effects of Myo, the same evaluations were performed in C- and GD-HUVECs following 48 h in vitro stimulation with Myo. Notably, we first observed that GD-HUVECs obtained from women assuming Myo supplementation exhibited a significantly decreased number of monocytes that adhered to endothelial cells, less adhesion molecule exposure, and lower intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the basal state as compared to GD-HUVECs obtained from women treated by diet only. This Myo anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effect was confirmed by 48 h in vitro stimulation of GD-HUVECs as compared to controls. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that Myo may exert protective actions against chronic inflammation induced by endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.","Baldassarre, Maria Pompea Antonia; Di Tomo, Pamela; Centorame, Giorgia; Pandolfi, Assunta; Di Pietro, Natalia; Consoli, Agostino; Formoso, Gloria",Nutrients,137,8

Positive end-expiratory pressure increases the volume of these passive ventilations; however, its effect on passive ventilation is unknown. Our objective was to determine if increasing positive end-expiratory pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation increases passive ventilation generated by compressions to a clinically significant point. This study was conducted on 13 Landrace-Yorkshire pigs. After inducing cardiac arrest with bupivacaine, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with a LUCAS 3.1. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pigs were ventilated at a positive end-expiratory pressure of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 cmH(2)O (randomly determined) for 9 min. Using the NM3 respiratory monitoring device, expired minute ventilation and volumetric capnography were measured. Arterial blood gas was obtained for each positive end-expiratory pressure level to compare the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure on carbon dioxide. RESULTS: Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure from 0 to 20 cmH(2)O increased the mean (SEM) expired minute ventilation from 6.33 (0.04) to 7.33 (0.04) mL/min. With the 5-cmH(2)O incremental increases in positive end-expiratory pressure from 0 to 20 cmH(2)O, volumetric capnography increased from a mean (SEM) of 94.19 (0.78) to 115.18 (0.8) mL/min, except for 15 cmH(2)O, which showed greater carbon dioxide exhalation with volumetric capnography compared with 20 cmH(2)O. PCO(2) declined significantly as positive end-expiratory pressure was increased from 0 to 20 cmH(2)O. CONCLUSIONS: When increasing positive end-expiratory pressure from 0 to 20, the contribution to overall ventilation from gas oscillations generated by the compressions became more significant, and may even lead to hypocapnia, especially when using positive end-expiratory pressures between 15 and 20.","Levenbrown, Yosef; Hossain, Md Jobayer; Keith, James P.; Burr, Katlyn; Hesek, Anne; Shaffer, Thomas H.",Intensive Care Med Exp,137,8

This study describes the clinical, laboratory and imaging features of this noncommunicable disease in a series of HIV-infected children in South Africa. METHODS: A database search was conducted to identify HIV-infected children enrolled in a Paediatric Rheumatology service in Cape Town, South Africa between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2020. Retrospective data were collected from individuals classified with HIV arthropathy, based on a predefined checklist. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, sonographic, therapeutic, and outcomes data were extracted by chart review. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using R (v4.0.3). RESULTS: Eleven cases of HIV arthropathy were included in the analysis. Cases predominantly presented in older boys with low CD4+ counts. Median age at arthritis onset was 10.3 years (IQR 6.9 – 11.6) and the male-female ratio was 3.0. The median absolute CD4+ count was 389 cells/uL (IQR 322 – 449). The clinical presentation was variable, with both oligoarthritis and polyarthritis being common. Elevated acute phase reactants were the most consistent laboratory feature, with a median ESR of 126 mL/h (IQR 67 – 136) and median CRP of 36 mg/L (IQR 25 – 68). Ultrasonography demonstrated joint effusions and synovial hypertrophy. Response to therapy was slower than has generally been described in adults, with almost all cases requiring more than one immunosuppressive agent. Five children were discharged in established remission after discontinuing immunotherapy, however outcomes data were incomplete for the remaining six cases. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series, HIV arthropathy was associated with advanced immunosuppression. Therapeutic modalities included immunomodulators and antiretroviral therapy, which consistently induced disease remission although data were limited by a high rate of attrition. Prospective studies are needed to define and understand this HIV-associated noncommunicable disease.","Harrison, Michael J.; Brice, Nicola; Scott, Christiaan",Front Immunol,137,8

Data on the occurrence of 14 chronic diseases were collected for 9710 elderly participants in the 2015 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Web graph, Apriori algorithm, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (AAC), and Spatial autocorrelation were used to perform the multimorbidity analysis. The multimorbidity prevalence rate was estimated as 49.64% in the elderly in China. Three major multimorbidity patterns were identified: [Asthma/Chronic lungs diseases]: (Support (S) = 6.17%, Confidence (C) = 63.77%, Lift (L) = 5.15); [Asthma, Arthritis, or rheumatism/ Chronic lungs diseases]: (S = 3.12%, C = 64.03%, L = 5.17); [Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, Arthritis or rheumatism/Heart attack]: (S = 3.96%, C = 51.56, L = 2.69). Results of the AAC analysis showed that the more chronic diseases an elderly has, the lower is the 10-year survival rate (P < 0.001). Global spatial autocorrelation showed a positive spatial correlation distribution for the prevalence of the third multimorbidity pattern in China (P = 0.032). The status of chronic diseases and multimorbidity among the elderly with a spatial correlation is a significant health issue in China.","Guo, Xiaorong; Zhao, Benhua; Chen, Tianmu; Hao, Bin; Yang, Tao; Xu, Huimin",PLoS One,137,1

We have recently introduced the concept of a hybrid Ni/Fe battery-electrolyser (battolyser) for this application(1). The hydrogen produced during the Ni/Fe cell charge and continued electrolysis can serve as chemical feedstock and a fuel for long-term storage, while the hybrid battery electrodes provide short term storage. Here, we present Ni–Fe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs) for enhancing the positive electrode performance. The modified Ni(OH)(2) material capacity, high rate performance and stability have been tested over a large range of charge rates (from 0.1C to 20C) over 1000 cycles. The Ni–Fe layered double hydroxides allow the capacity per nickel atom to be multiplied by 1.8 in comparison to the conventional β-Ni(OH)(2) material which suggests that the nickel content can be reduced by 45% for the same capacity. This reduction of the nickel content is extremely important as this presents the most costly resource. In addition, Fe doped Ni(OH)(2) shows improved ionic and electronic conductivity, OER catalytic activity outperforming the benchmark (Ir/C) catalyst, and long term cycling stability. The implementation of this Fe doped Ni(OH)(2) material in the Ni/Fe hybrid battery-electrolyser will bring both electrolysis and battery function forward at reduced material cost and energy loss.","Iranzo, A.; Mulder, F.

The associations between serum IgG N-glycosylation and thyroid cancer risk have been revealed. We aimed to explore the potential of IgG N-glycan traits as biomarkers in the differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer. METHODS: Plasma IgG N-glycome analysis was applied to a discovery cohort followed by independent validation. IgG N-glycan profiles were obtained using a robust quantitative strategy based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. IgG N-glycans were relatively quantified, and classification performance was evaluated based on directly detected and derived glycan traits. RESULTS: Four directly detected glycans were significantly changed in thyroid cancer patients compared to that in non-cancer controls. Derived glycan traits and a classification glycol-panel were generated based on the directly detected glycan traits. In the discovery cohort, derived trait BN (bisecting type neutral N-glycans) and the glyco-panel showed potential in distinguishing between thyroid cancer and non-cancer controls with AUCs of 0.920 and 0.917, respectively. The diagnostic potential was further validated. Derived trait BN and the glycol-panel displayed “accurate” performance (AUC>0.8) in discriminating thyroid cancer from benign thyroid nodules and healthy controls in the validation cohort. Meanwhile, derived trait BN and the glycol-panel also showed diagnostic potential in detecting early-stage thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: IgG N-glycome analysis revealed N-glycomic differences that allow classification of thyroid cancer from non-cancer controls. Our results suggested that derived trait BN and the classification glyco-panel rather than single N-glycans may serve as candidate biomarkers for further validation.","Zhang, Zejian; Wu, Jianqiang; Liu, Peng; Kang, Lin; Xu, Xiequn",Front Oncol,137,11

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study enrolled 150 controls and 150 obese cases subdivided into two subgroups non-diabetic (n = 70) and 80 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Circulating OPG gene expression levels were figured out by real time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Serum OPG levels were assessed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Our results explored that OPG serum levels were lower in the obese women compared to control group (p < 0.001) and obese diabetics had higher serum levels of OPG in comparison to obese non-diabetic patients (p < 0.001). Expression levels of OPG were higher in obese women than controls (p < 0.001). Moreover, the blood expression levels of OPG gene were higher in diabetic obese patients than non-diabetics. We found positive correlations between parameters of metabolic syndrome and obesity indices. After adjustment of the traditional risk factors, stepwise linear regression analysis test revealed that OPG expression levels were independently correlated with glycated hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and waist-to-hip ratio.

RdRPs initiate RNA synthesis either in primer-dependent or de novo mechanism, with the latter often assisted by a ‘priming element’ (PE) within the RdRP thumb domain. However, RdRP PEs exhibit high-level structural diversity, making it difficult to reconcile their conserved function in de novo initiation. Here we determined a 3.1-Å crystal structure of the Flaviviridae classical swine fever virus (CSFV) RdRP with a relative complete PE. Structure-based mutagenesis in combination with enzymology data further highlights the importance of a glycine residue (G671) and the participation of residues 665–680 in RdRP initiation. When compared with other representative Flaviviridae RdRPs, CSFV RdRP PE is structurally distinct but consistent in terminal initiation preference. Taken together, our work suggests that a conformational change in CSFV RdRP PE is necessary to fulfill de novo initiation, and similar ‘induced-fit’ mechanisms may be commonly taken by PE-containing de novo viral RdRPs.","Zhang, Bu-Yu; Liu, Weichi; Jia, Hengxia; Lu, Guoliang; Gong, Peng",Nucleic Acids Res,137,8

However, their application has been limited so far, mainly because of the complex selection process. ‘High-throughput sequencing fluorescent ligand interaction profiling’ (HiTS–FLIP) significantly increases the selection efficiency and is consequently a very powerful and versatile technology for the selection of high-performance aptamers. It is the first experiment to allow the direct and quantitative measurement of the affinity and specificity of millions of aptamers simultaneously by harnessing the potential of optical next-generation sequencing platforms to perform fluorescence-based binding assays on the clusters displayed on the flow cells and determining their sequence and position in regular high-throughput sequencing. Many variants of the experiment have been developed that allow automation and in situ conversion of DNA clusters into base-modified DNA, RNA, peptides, and even proteins. In addition, the information from mutational assays, performed with HiTS–FLIP, provides deep insights into the relationship between the sequence, structure, and function of aptamers. This enables a detailed understanding of the sequence-specific rules that determine affinity, and thus, supports the evolution of aptamers. Current variants of the HiTS–FLIP experiment and its application in the field of aptamer selection, characterisation, and optimisation are presented in this review.","Drees, Alissa; Fischer, Markus",Int J Mol Sci,137,8

In temperate regions, a distinct seasonality is observed, where peaks of infections typically occur in early winter, often preceding the annual influenza season. Infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality and in some populations exceed that of influenza. Two subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B, have been described, and molecular epidemiological studies have shown that both viruses mostly co-circulate. This trend also appears to be the case for Australia; however, previous genomic studies have been limited to cases from one Eastern state—New South Wales. As such, the broader spatial patterns and viral traffic networks across the continent are not known. Here, we conducted a whole-genome study of RSV comparing strains across eastern and Western Australia during the period January 2016 to June 2017. In total, 96 new RSV genomes were sequenced, compiled with previously generated data, and examined using a phylodynamic approach. This analysis revealed that both RSV-A and RSV-B strains were circulating, and each subtype was dominated by a single genotype, RSV-A ON1-like and RSV-B BA10-like viruses. Some geographical clustering was evident in strains from both states with multiple distinct sub-lineages observed and relatively low mixing across jurisdictions, suggesting that endemic transmission was likely seeded from imported, unsampled locations. Overall, the RSV phylogenies reflected a complex pattern of interactions across multiple epidemiological scales from fluid virus traffic across global and regional networks to fine-scale local transmission events.","Robertson, Mark; Eden, John-Sebastian; Levy, Avram; Carter, Ian; Tulloch, Rachel L; Cutmore, Elena J; Horsburgh, Bethany A; Sikazwe, Chisha T; Dwyer, Dominic E; Smith, David W; Kok, Jen",Virus Evol,137,1

We developed a vocational telerehabilitation (VR) intervention for trauma survivors, delivered by trained occupational therapists (OTs) and clinical psychologists (CPs), and explored factors affecting delivery and acceptability in a feasibility study. Methods: Surveys pre- (5 OTs, 2 CPs) and post-training (3 OTs, 1 CP); interviews pre- (5 OTs, 2 CPs) and post-intervention (4 trauma survivors, 4 OTs, 2 CPs). Mean survey scores for 14 theoretical domains identified telerehabilitation barriers (score ≤ 3.5) and facilitators (score ≥ 5). Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed. Results: Surveys: pre-training, the only barrier was therapists’ intentions to use telerehabilitation (mean = 3.40 ± 0.23), post-training, 13/14 domains were facilitators. Interviews: barriers/facilitators included environmental context/resources (e.g., technology, patient engagement, privacy/disruptions, travel and access); beliefs about capabilities (e.g., building rapport, complex assessments, knowledge/confidence, third-party feedback and communication style); optimism (e.g., impossible assessments, novel working methods, perceived importance and patient/therapist reluctance) and social/professional role/identity (e.g., therapeutic methods). Training and experience of intervention delivery addressed some barriers and increased facilitators. The intervention was acceptable to trauma survivors and therapists. Conclusion: Despite training and experience in intervention delivery, some barriers remained. Providing some face-to-face delivery where necessary may address certain barriers, but strategies are required to address other barriers.","Kettlewell, Jade; Lindley, Rebecca; Radford, Kate; Patel, Priya; Bridger, Kay; Kellezi, Blerina; Timmons, Stephen; Andrews, Isabel; Fallon, Stephen; Lannin, Natasha; Holmes, Jain; Kendrick, Denise; Team, on behalf of the ROWTATE",Int J Environ Res Public Health,137,1

Interestingly, a different trend observed in the permittivity value whereas the value was increased after quenching and subsequently recovered after annealing. The mechanisms which produced the changes is believed to be involved by defects in the form of vacancies, interstitials, microcracks and dislocations created during quenching which gave rise to changes in the values of the complex permeability and permittivity components and hysteresis behaviour.","Abdullah, Nor Hapishah; Mustaffa, Muhammad Syazwan; Hamidon, Mohd Nizar; Shafie, Farah Nabilah; Ismail, Ismayadi; Ibrahim, Idza Riati",Sci Rep,137,1

However, the function of many ABA-responsive genes remains largely unknown. In order to improve the ABA-related signaling network, we conducted a large-scale ABA phenotype screening. LSH, an important transcription factor family, extensively participates in seedling development and floral organogenesis in plants, but whether its family genes are involved in the ABA signaling pathway has not been reported. Here we describe a new function of the transcription factor LSH8 in an ABA signaling pathway. In this study, we found that LSH8 was localized in the nucleus, and the expression level of LSH8 was significantly induced by exogenous ABA at the transcription level and protein level. Meanwhile, seed germination and root length measurements revealed that lsh8 mutant lines were ABA insensitive, whereas LSH8 overexpression lines showed an ABA-hypersensitive phenotype. With further TMT labeling quantitative proteomic analysis, we found that under ABA treatment, ABA-responsive proteins (ARPs) in the lsh8 mutant presented different changing patterns with those in wild-type Col4. Additionally, the number of ARPs contained in the lsh8 mutant was 397, six times the number in wild-type Col4. In addition, qPCR analysis found that under ABA treatment, LSH8 positively mediated the expression of downstream ABA-related genes of ABI3, ABI5, RD29B and RAB18. These results indicate that in Arabidopsis, LSH8 is a novel ABA regulator that could specifically change the expression pattern of APRs to positively mediate ABA responses.","Zou, Jinpeng; Li, Zhifang; Tang, Haohao; Zhang, Li; Li, Jingdu; Li, Yuhong; Yao, Nan; Li, Yaxing; Yang, Deguang; Zuo, Zecheng",Int J Mol Sci,137,22

The unoptimized studies not only raise the process cost but also complicate the physicochemical characteristics of the nanostructures. The liquid–plasma reduction with optimized synthesis parameters is an environmentally friendly and low-cost technique for the synthesis of a range of nanomaterials. This work is focused on the statistically optimized production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by using a liquid–plasma reduction process sustained with an argon plasma jet. A simplex centroid design (SCD) was made in Minitab statistical package to optimize the combined effect of stabilizers on the structural growth and UV absorbance of AgNPs. Different combinations of glucose, fructose, sucrose and lactose stabilizers were tested at five different levels (−2, −1, 0, 1, 2) in SCD. The effect of individual and mixed stabilizers on AgNPs growth parameters was assumed significant when p-value in SCD is less than 0.05. A surface plasmon resonance band was fixed at 302 nm after SCD optimization of UV results. A bond stretching at 1633 cm(−1) in FTIR spectra was assigned to C=O, which slightly shifts towards a larger wavelength in the presence of saccharides in the solution. The presence of FCC structured AgNPs with an average size of 15 nm was confirmed from XRD and EDX spectra under optimized conditions. The antibacterial activity of these nanoparticles was checked against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli strains by adopting the shake flask method. The antibacterial study revealed the slightly better performance of AgNPs against Staph. aureus strain than Escherichia coli.","Altaf, Noor Ul Huda; Naz, Muhammad Yasin; Shukrullah, Shazia; Bhatti, Haq Nawaz; Irfan, Muhammad; Alsaiari, Mabkhoot A.; Rahman, Saifur; Niazi, Usama Muhammad; Glowacz, Adam; Proniewska, Klaudia; Wzorek, Lukasz",Materials (Basel),137,1

We hypothesized that medical and non-medical procedures facilitate environmental dissemination of MRSA in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of hospitalized MRSA-colonized patients to determine the frequency of and risk factors for environmental shedding during procedures. Prior to each procedure, surfaces in the room and portable equipment used for procedures were disinfected. After procedures, high-touch surfaces and portable equipment were cultured; negative control cultures were collected after 1 hour in the absence of a procedure. Bivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with environmental shedding. RESULTS: Of 55 MRSA colonized patients, 22 (40%) had wounds and 25 (46%) had positive skin cultures. Environmental cultures were collected after 138 total procedures (range, 2 to 12 per patient). As shown in the figure, contamination of surfaces occurred frequently during procedures, but was uncommon in the absence of a procedure. Contamination occurred frequently on surfaces touched by personnel during procedures (12 of 38, 32% positive) and on portable equipment used for procedures (25 of 101, 25%). The presence of a wound was the only factor significantly associated with shedding (59% vs. 26%; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Environmental shedding of MRSA occurs frequently during medical and non-medical procedures in hospitalized patients. Our results suggest that there is a need for effective strategies to disinfect surfaces and equipment after procedures.

Improvements in diagnostic techniques, including the increasing clinical use of respiratory viral PCR panels (vPCR), have markedly advanced our understanding of the contributions of NIV to the “influenza season.” METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all vPCR results from one hospital system, collected between October 1, 2016 and March 7, 2017, including inpatient and outpatient samples was performed. 2,047 vPCR tests were reviewed; after removing those with undetermined results and internal control samples, 1,924 were analyzed. Data points abstracted included detection and identification of virus, and date of detection. We compared the total and monthly rates of NIV with IV, throughout the study period. RESULTS: Of 1,924 vPCR results, 985 (51%) were positive for a respiratory virus. Of these, 302 (31%) were IV, and 683 (69%) were NIV. For every month studied, the ratio of NIV to IV exceeded 50%, including the height of the season. The most commonly detected viruses were Influenza A (30%), Rhino/Enterovirus (24%), RSV (19%), Coronavirus OC43 (7%) and Metapneumovirus (5%). The peak influenza incidence temporally coincided with the national peak months of January and February. The NIV incidence paralleled the trend in IV incidence, dominated by Rhino/Enterovirus and RSV, but without a specific virus driving the trend. CONCLUSION: Non-influenza respiratory viruses cause substantial viral RI during the winter months. Many viral syndromes during the height of influenza season have traditionally been attributed to IV, including influenza-like-illness (ILI); however, these can now be better characterized using patient-specific vPCR panels, leading to improved understanding of NIV epidemiology. Even during the period of highest IV incidence, NIV infections were more common than IV. Understanding the high prevalence of NIV infections may improve the judicious use of both antibiotics and antivirals. There may also be a role for refinement of ILI, including best practices for diagnosis and treatment.

Previously, we have studied the bacterial, fungal, and allergen aerosol inactivation by direct microwave irradiation. Here, we further investigated its effects on airborne viruses. MS2 coliphage used as a human model virus was aerosolized and exposed to the direct microwave irradiation for ~2 min at three different power levels (700, 385, and 119 W). In addition to the survival rate, the viral genes before and after the microwave treatments were also examined using PCR and gel electrophoresis. Direct exposure of airborne MS2 viruses to the microwave irradiation at 700 W for less than 2 min was shown to result in more than 90 % inactivation efficiency, about 65 % at medium power level (385 W), and 50 % at the lowest level (119 W). The aerosol inactivation rate followed a linear relationship with the microwave exposure time (R (2) = 0.9889). Scanning electron images revealed visible damages to the viral surface after the exposure. Damages were also observed to the viral RNA genes coding for coat proteins, among which the A protein gene was completely destroyed. This study demonstrated that even without the filtration the direct microwave irradiation could also achieve rapid inactivation of viral aerosols. The information obtained can provide useful guidance on the development of microwave-based viral threat mitigation solutions in a closed or semi-closed space.","Wu, Yan; Yao, Maosheng",Chin Sci Bull,137,17

Together, these observations supported the notion that the CNS was unable to mount and/or support an immune response. However, over time this view evolved and it is now clear that CNS tissue is neither immunologically inert nor privileged, rather, its immune response is exquisitely sensitive to antigenic challenge. Indeed, overwhelming evidence now indicates that upon microbial infection of the CNS there is often a dynamic and orchestrated localized immune response that culminates with infiltration of antigen-specific lymphocytes, usually resulting in control and elimination of the invading pathogen. It is important to note that not all effective immune responses originating in the CNS are completely beneficial to the host; alternatively, there are instances where immune cell infiltration following infection is associated with severe neuropathology resulting in death or chronic neurodegenerative disease.","Hickey, Michelle J.; Stiles, Linda N.; Schaumburg, Chris S.",Central Nervous System Diseases and Inflammation,137,8

Rising R&D costs of up to $800 million per marketed new pharmaceutical have dramatically reduced the approval of new chemical entities (NCEs). Globalization of diseases like AIDS and SARS has had a definite impact on the economic situation not only in the Western world, but also in developing countries, especially for AIDS in Africa and SARS in Asia. The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for free anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs to be made available to people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The spread between unmet medical need in large indications (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) and in niche indications (e.g. Huntington disease) and the economic burden to create a blockbuster ($1 billion sales within one year after launch) has created a marketing-driven clinical development of new chemical entities. A paradigm shift has occurred by which developing a new innovative drug by documenting shortterm efficacy, quality and safety rather than long-term efficacy and emphasizing pharma-covilliglance including considerations of health economy within the medical environment a shift that has fundamentally changed and challenged the pharmaceutical industry.","Meyer-Sabellek, Wolfgang",Quo Vadis Medical Healing,137,1

Dysregulation of the RAS is considered a major factor in the development of cardiovascular pathologies and pharmacologic blockade of this system by the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or antagonism of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) is an effective therapeutic regimen. The RAS is now defined as a more complex system composed of different angiotensin peptides with diverse biological actions mediated by distinct receptor subtypes. The classic RAS comprises the ACE-Ang II-AT(1)R axis that promotes vasoconstriction, water intake, sodium retention and increased oxidative stress, fibrosis, cellular growth, and inflammation. The non-classical or alternative RAS is composed primarily of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-AT(7)R pathway that opposes many actions of the Ang II-AT(1)R axis. In lieu of the complexity of this system, the chapter discusses the current evidence on the enzymatic cascade of the Ang-(1-7) axis of the RAS regarding the peptidases that contribute to the formation and degradation of the peptide in the circulation and various tissues.","Chappell, Mark C.",Angiotensin-(1-7),137,11

Major challenges regarding recognizing, detecting, characterizing, and effectively responding to foodborne viral threats to health exist. Adequate health crisis management is largely dependent on early detection of potential public health threats, which is hampered by changing trends in disease outbreaks, from localized clusters of disease in confined populations to dispersed outbreaks with excellent opportunity for further transmission. In addition, no precise and consistent global baseline syndrome and diagnostic surveillance information exists. An integrated multidisciplinary approach with a combination of sustained pathogen syndrome and diagnostic surveillance, genomics-based, and standardized global analytical networks gathering clinical, epidemiological and genetic data alike would be required to understand the dynamics of foodborne viral infection and to mitigate potential effects of future threats. A huge global effort in virus syndrome and diagnostic surveillance may be justified in the light of global health impact in general, and timely with the development of new metagenomics tools that hold the promise of not only identifying viral pathogens, but possibly the complete microbiome in a single assay.","Smits, Saskia L.; Koopmans, Marion P.

Through empirical investigation and Monte-Carlo simulation on a big H1N1 outbreak in a Chinese university campus, this paper explores the impact of community structure property of social contacts network on epidemic spreading and effectiveness of interventions. A stochastic model based on social contacts networks among students is constructed to simulate this outbreak, revealing that epidemic outbreaks commonly occur in local community. Moreover, effectiveness of three quarantine-based interventions is quantitatively studied by our proposed model, finding that community structure of social networks determines the effects these measures.","Wang, Youzhong; Zeng, Daniel; Cao, Zhidong; Wang, Yong; Song, Hongbin; Zheng, Xiaolong",Intelligence and Security Informatics,137,12

Although molecular methods are replacing many older methods of viral diagnosis, there is still a significant role for immunological methods to guide patient care and in the performance of epidemiologic studies. Identification of viral antigens in clinical samples can be accomplished rapidly through the use of point-of-care lateral immunoassays or through the use of more traditional immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays in the virology laboratory. Serological assays are also a valuable tool for the clinician and epidemiologist. Many of the available diagnostic assays have enzyme immunoassay formats, but functional assays such as hemagglutination-inhibition and neutralizing antibody tests are also available. In some instances, virus infection can be diagnosed with a single serum sample (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C virus infections) while in other instances paired sera are needed (e.g., those caused by common respiratory viruses). Point-of-care antibody assays are also available for testing blood and saliva samples for some viruses.

It is well documented that the use of immunosuppressant therapies dramatically increases this risk in patients with cancer, transplantation, and immunologic disease. Although immune monitoring has yet to be universally embraced, withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapies and use of immune restoration therapies is the standard of care when these patients develop sepsis. Critical illness stress can also induce a level of immunosuppression which is as life-threatening as is seen in the purposefully immunosuppressed patient. This chapter reviews the role of critical illness stress-induced immunosuppression in the development of nosocomial sepsis and MOF, and outlines clinical strategies which can be employed to maintain and restore immune function, and reduce morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.","Carcillo, J.

Generally, acute rhinitis is associated with environmental allergies or respiratory viral infections. Viral microbes with numerous types and subtypes can infect the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity in a repetitive fashion throughout the year, or during a specific period of time such as winter or fall. Among all forms of inflammatory diseases of the nasal mucosa, acute viral rhinitis (AVR) has unique epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics. As the most prevalent type of rhinitis, AVR is also the most common form of any infectious disease of the human body. Although it is almost always self-limiting, in rare circumstances disease might progress and the clinical scenario could become complicated. Common complaints and physical findings related to AVR are similar to those seen with other types of rhinitis such as allergic, hormonal, senile, or drug induced. The clinician must interpret these symptoms and findings in the context of other parameters such as “duration, environmental factors, and patient characteristics” to establish an accurate diagnose and appropriate therapeutic management. In this chapter, we aim to discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical findings, differential diagnosis, and therapeutic management of AVR in light of the recent literature knowledge.

Polarized epithelial cells have long captured the attention of cell biologists and cell physiologists. At the electron-microscopic level, one of the most apparent and fundamental features of this cell type is its polarized organization of intracellular organelles and its structurally and compositionally distinct lumenal (apical) and serosal (basolateral) plasma-membrane domains. The polarized epithelial phenotype is an absolute necessity for organ-system function. In the most general sense, these cells organize to form a continuous, single layer of cells, or epithelium, which serves as a semi-permeable barrier between apposing and biologically distinct compartments. Within the tubules of the nephron, these cells orchestrate complex ion-transporting processes that ultimately control the overall fluid balance of the organism. At the surface of the gastrointestinal tract, specialized versions of this cell type control the digestion, absorption, and immuno-protection of the organism.","Gottardi, Cara J.; Caplan, Michael J.",,137,1

CEPI is faced with complex decisions that involve confronting trade‐offs between multiple objectives, diverse stakeholder perspectives, and uncertainty in vaccine performance. OBJECTIVE: This study reports on a multi‐criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and its testing on CEPI decisions. METHODS: Consultations with CEPI's Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) and document reviews helped identify and structure the criteria against which to evaluate proposals. Forty four subject‐matter experts assessed performance of 18 proposals on multiple criteria. SAC preferences were elicited via a survey employing an adapted swing‐weighting technique and were incorporated into measures of value and cost‐to‐value. A Monte Carlo simulation estimated overall value and ranking probabilities by value and by cost‐to‐value for each proposal. RESULTS: Reviewer assessments and SAC preferences varied significantly. Despite this uncertainty, 14 preferred proposals emerged from the analysis and SAC recommendations on the basis of value and cost‐to‐value. In some cases, SAC recommendations deviated from the analysis because of: less emphasis on cost‐to‐value if budgets seemed underestimated by applicants, more emphasis on the likelihood of generating vaccines for target pathogens versus platform potential against unknown pathogens, and emphasis on funding a diversity of platforms per pathogen. CONCLUSIONS: Despite vaccine performance uncertainty and stakeholder preference heterogeneity, MCDA distinguished between options in a way that broadly corresponded to decisions. Divergence between the MCDA and the SAC point to potential updates needed to the model such as platform diversity trade‐offs.","Gouglas, Dimitrios; Marsh, Kevin",,137,8

This chapter discusses the role of viruses (and virologists) in defining comparative genomics. The reasons why viruses have been popular as model systems are relatively simple: The number of genes in virus genomes is small, and the number of genetically homogeneous progeny that can be obtained in the laboratory is large. The combinatorial approach to classification (at least to virus classification) appears to produce a larger number of possibilities than are actually employed by nature. This results in many empty classes in Agol's scheme and in Koonin's classification. Apparently, the evolutionary process operates under constraints, so its results do not look like the product of indiscriminate mixing and matching. Perhaps every combinatorial classification should be expected to contain many empty classes. The auxiliary evidence strongly supported sequence similarities among the proteins conserved in RNA viruses: First, there was plenty of genetic data mapping replication ability to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. Second, conservation of gene order in virus genomes was observed in RNA viruses.

Two laws that are penal in nature are now applicable in the current pandemic, namely the Epidemics Diseases Act 1897 and the Indian Penal Code 1860. No act of an endoscopist should be seen to be in contravention of any of the aforementioned laws, and the sections thereunder as provisions of the Indian Penal Code can be attracted in the current scenario for spreading an infectious disease either knowingly (Section 270) or unknowingly or negligently (Section 269). Section 4 of the Epidemics Disease Act 1897 gives legal protection to every person who has acted under this Act or the directions issued under this Act subject to only one condition, that is, the act must have been done in good faith. Though the hospitals are obliged to ensure personal safety of its staff legally, morally and ethically, because of the huge gap in demand and supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), it is advisable to arrange PPE on one’s own to first protect oneself and then, by extension, to prevent the spread to others. The dictum is “take care of yourself.” Self-preservation is a supreme law. In the current COVID-19 pandemic conditions, certain additional information, to be agreed upon by the patient, needs to be incorporated in the consent. It should be incorporated in the consent that: • While all the necessary precautions are being taken, there is a finite though small risk that the patient may contract the infection from the hospital. • He/she indemnifies the hospital and the endoscopist against any such liability arising out of any action taken while doing the procedure. • Furthermore, to protect the patient him/herself, he/she agrees to get the preprocedural test for COVID-19 as well as bear the additional cost of the PPE used by the endoscopist and support staff.

Since there are no visible landmarks within the structure that explicit its parcels, non-geometric CC parcellation is a challenging task especially that almost of proposed methods are geometric or data-based. In fact, in order to subdivide the CC from brain sagittal MRI scans, we adopt the probabilistic neural network as a clustering technique. Then, we use a cluster validity measure based on the maximum entropy (Vmep) to obtain the optimal number of classes. After that, we obtain the isolated CC that we parcel automatically using SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) as superpixel segmentation technique. The obtained results on two challenging public datasets prove the performance of the proposed method against geometric methods from the state of the art. Indeed, as best as we know, it is the first work that investigates the validation of a CC parcellation method on ground-truth datasets using many objective metrics.","Jlassi, Amal; ElBedoui, Khaoula; Barhoumi, Walid; Maktouf, Chokri",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,137,1

In the immunodominance model, each individual in a population predominantly responds to a single epitope among the five antigenic epitopes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA), driving escape mutations one at a time, and sequential mutations in multiple individuals who respond to different epitopes eventually generate a drifted strain with mutations in epitopes that are targeted by a majority of the population. A focused antibody response to the Sa epitope in people born between 1965 and 1979 was believed to contribute to a mutation at HA residue 163 and the first antigenic drift of the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus. A serine-to-threonine mutation at HA residue 185 in the Sb epitope emerged in 2010 even before the 163 mutation. We show here that a large fraction of the population in 2010-2011 had responses to the Sb epitope, as shown by 47% of tested sera having altered titers to the S185T mutant. Responses to the Sb epitope showed an age-specific trend similar to that found for the response to Sa epitope in these subjects. Together, the focused responses to Sa and Sb epitopes may have driven the first antigenic drift of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus.","Ketklao, S.; Boonarkart, C.; Phakaratsakul, S.; Auewarakul, P.; Suptawiwat, Ornpreya",Arch Virol,137,22

The aim of the present systematic review was to give an overview on recent literature about mindfulness and compassion characteristics of HCPs, while exploring the effectiveness of techniques, involving the two aspects, such as MBSR or mindfulness intervention and compassion fatigue-related programs. A search of databases, including PubMed and PsycINFO, was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the methodological quality for this systematic review was appraised using AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2). The number of articles that met the inclusion criteria was 58 (4 RCTs, 24 studies with pre-post measurements, 12 cross-sectional studies, 11 cohort studies and 7 qualitative studies). MBSR intervention was effective at improving, and maintaining, mindfulness and self-compassion levels and to improve burnout, depression, anxiety, stress. The most frequently employed interventional strategies were mindfulness-related trainings that were effective at improving mindfulness and self-compassion, but not compassion fatigue, levels. Compassion-related interventions have been shown to improve self-compassion, mindfulness and interpersonal conflict levels. Mindfulness was effective at improving negative affect and compassion fatigue, while compassion satisfaction may be related to cultivation of positive affect. This systematic review summarized the evidence regarding mindfulness- and compassion-related qualities of HCPs as well as potential effects of MBSR, mindfulness-related and compassion-related interventions on professionals' psychological variables like mindfulness, self-compassion and quality of life. Combining structured mindfulness and compassion cultivation trainings may enhance the effects of interventions, limit the variability of intervention protocols and improve data comparability of future research.","Conversano, Ciro; Ciacchini, Rebecca; Orrù, Graziella; Di Giuseppe, Mariagrazia; Gemignani, Angelo; Poli, Andrea",Front Psychol,137,1

METHODS: We report the results of 25 patients who underwent alloBMT using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), alternative donors, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy). In an attempt to reduce regimen-related toxicities, we removed low-dose TBI from the prep and added mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for all donor types in the latter 14 patients. Donors were haploidentical related (n = 14), matched unrelated (n = 9), or mismatched unrelated (n = 2). The median age was 9 years (range 5 months–21 years). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 26 months (range 7 months–9 years), the 2-year overall survival is 92%. There were two deaths, one from infection, and one from complications after a second myeloablative BMT. Three patients developed secondary graft failure, one at 2 years and two at >3 years, successfully treated with CD34 cell boost in one or second BMT in two. The remaining 20 patients have full or stable mixed donor chimerism and are disease-free. The incidence of mixed chimerism is increased since removing TBI from the prep. The 6-month cumulative incidence of grade II acute GVHD is 17%, with no grade III–IV. The 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD is 14%, with severe of 5%. CONCLUSION: This alloBMT platform using alternative donors, RIC, and PTCy is associated with excellent rates of engraftment and low rates of GVHD and non-relapse mortality, and offers a curative option for patients with PIDD, PIRD, and IBMFS.

Fractional ownership types provide flow-sensitive and precise aliasing information for reference variables. ConSORT interprets this ownership information to soundly handle strong updates of potentially aliased references. We have proved ConSORT sound and implemented a prototype, fully automated inference tool.

However, we only partially understand the cellular mechanisms driving the encounter of a soluble ligand transported in the lumen of extracellular vesicles with its cytosolic receptor: a step required to evoke a biologically relevant response. In this context, we review herein current evidence supporting the role of two well-described cellular transport pathways: the endocytic pathway as the main entry route for extracellular vesicles and the autophagic pathway driving lysosomal degradation of cytosolic proteins. The interplay between these pathways may result in the target engagement between an extracellular vesicle cargo protein and its cytosolic target within the acidic compartments of the cell.

To our knowledge, no nationwide investigation has been carried out to determine the actual extent of infection in the general population. METHODS: A total of 1308 random serum samples were collected from the general population in Taiwan in 2010. The antibody-captured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect DENV-specific IgM and IgG. Demographics data were used for risk analysis. RESULTS: The weighted overall seroprevalence was 1.96% for anti-DENV IgM, and 3.4% for anti-DENV IgG, respectively. A significant rise of DENV IgG seropositive rate had been noted since late adulthood stage, from 1.1% at the age group of 50–59 years to 7.6% at the age group of 60–69 years. For people aged over 70 years, the seropositive rate reached 19%. Age, nationality, and regions of residency were associated with the IgG seropositivity. There was no statistically significant difference in seroprevalence of anti-Dengue IgM, indicating recent infection, among univariate predictors we proposed, including gender, age, residency, nationality, and household size. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the majority of population in Taiwan born after 1940 is naive to dengue virus and the prevalence of IgG antibody against dengue virus rises with age. Nationality, and regions of residency are associated with the exposure of population to infection by dengue viruses. Further studies are needed to realize the current situation of seroprevalence of dengue fever in Taiwan.","Lee, Ying-Hsuan; Hsieh, Yu-Chia; Chen, Chih-Jung; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Huang, Yhu-Chering",BMC Infect Dis,137,1

These nanomaterials are at the forefront of rapidly developing indispensable nanotechnology. In all these nanomaterials, titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) is the most common nanomaterial which is being synthesized for many years. These nanoparticles of TiO(2) are widely used at the commercial level, especially in cosmetic industries. High usage in such a way has increased the toxicological consequences of the human population. Several studies have shown that TiO(2) NPs accumulated after oral exposure or inhalation in the alimentary canal, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, cardiac muscle, and kidneys. Additionally, in mice and rats, they disturb glucose and lipid homeostasis. Moreover, TiO(2) nanoparticles primarily cause adverse reactions by inducing oxidative stress that leads to cell damage, inflammation, genotoxicity, and adverse immune responses. The form and level of destruction are strongly based on the physical and chemical properties of TiO(2) nanoparticles, which administer their reactivity and bioavailability. Studies give indications that TiO(2) NPs cause both DNA strand breaks and chromosomal damages. The effects of genotoxicity do not depend only on particle surface changes, size, and exposure route, but also relies on the duration of exposure. Most of these effects may be because of a very high dose of TiO(2) NPs. Despite increased production and use, epidemiological data for TiO(2) NPs is still missing. This review discusses previous research regarding the impact of TiO(2) NP toxicity on human health and highlights areas that require further understanding in concern of jeopardy to the human population. This review is important to point out areas where extensive research is needed; thus, their possible impact on individual health should be investigated in more details.","Shabbir, Samina; Kulyar, Muhammad Fakhar-e-Alam; Bhutta, Zeeshan Ahmad; Boruah, Prerona; Asif, Muhammad",Bionanoscience,137,0

In this study, we examined the effect of admission glucose in diabetics and non-diabetics on outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Our study uniquely examines this association in a largely African American cohort, a population disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed all adults admitted with COVID-19 to a designated COVID hospital in Brooklyn, NY from March 1 to May 15, 2020. Diabetics were compared to non-diabetics, and were further stratified based on admission glucoses of 140 and 180 mg/dL. Diagnosis of diabetes was based on history and/or Hba1c > 6.5%. Univariate, multiple and logistic regressions were used for analyses, examining outcomes of mortality, intubation, ICU admission, acute kidney injury (AKI), and length of stay based on admission glucose levels, while controlling for age, gender, lab values (serum creatinine and WBC), and comorbidities including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Outcomes are presented as an adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: 708 patients were analyzed; 54% diabetics, 83.5% non-Hispanic Blacks, 51% male with a mean age of 68, BMI of 29 kg/m(2) and crude mortality rate of 40%. The length of hospital stay was greater in diabetics than non-diabetics, (13±26 days vs 9.5±18.5 days, p<0.05). Diabetics with an admission glucose > 140 mg/dL (vs<140 g/dL) had a 2.4-fold increased odds of both intubation and ICU admission (95% CI: 1.2, 4.5; 1.3, 4.6). Diabetics with admission glucoses > 180 mg/dL (vs <180 g/dL) had a 1.8-fold increased mortality (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9). Non-diabetics with admission glucoses >140 mg/dL (vs<140 g/dL) had a two-fold increased mortality (95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), 3.5-fold increased odds of ICU admission (95% CI: 1.8,6.6) and a 2.3-fold increased odds of both intubation and AKI (95% CI: 1.3, 4.2; 1.3,4.2). Non-diabetics with a glucose >180 mg/dL (vs <180 g/dL) had a four-fold increased mortality (95% CI: 1.8, 8.8), 2.7-fold increased odds of intubation (95% CI: 1.3, 5.6) and 2.9-fold increased odds of ICU admission (95% CI: 1.3, 6.2). Conclusion: Our results show hyperglycemia portends worse outcomes in diabetics and non-diabetics with COVID-19. Elevated admitting glucoses >180 mg/dL increased odds of mortality four-fold in non-diabetics and 1.8- fold in diabetics. In COVID-19, diabetic patients had a 37% greater length of hospital stay than non-diabetics. Whether hyperglycemia is a marker or a cause of more severe COVID-19 is unknown. These findings suggest that patients presenting with hyperglycemia require closer observation and more aggressive therapies. This raises the testable hypothesis that intensive glucose control may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Skwiersky, Samara; Rosengarten, Sabrina; Chang, Megan; Thomson, Alastair; Meisel, Talia; Macaluso, Francesca; Da Silva, Brandon; Oommen, Alvin; Banerji, Mary Ann",J Endocr Soc,137,19

The symptomatology of PICS includes decreased muscle functioning, increased muscle weakness, increased states of delirium, and increased occurrence of ICU‐acquired weakness. Patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 are at high risk for developing PICS due to the debilitating nature of the disease, prolonged periods of inactivity with the use of mechanical ventilation, and muscle weakness after cessation of mechanical ventilation. With the sudden pandemic of COVID‐19, research on the appropriate physical therapy protocols to provide effective care for these patients during their stay in the ICU is limited. The purpose of the study was to determine if early mobilization and rehabilitation in patients with COVID‐19 can reduce PICS and length of hospital stay. Using PUBMed, Google Scholar, and other databases, a systematic review of literature was conducted and ranked using the Oxford Centre of Evidence‐based Medicine. Of the literature reviewed, 73% of the articles were found to have level 2B and 27% were level 1B. Preliminary results revealed that the majority of patients adhering to early intervention and mobilization yielded improvements in the form of decreased length of hospital stay in the ICU and enhanced functional mobility upon discharge. Based on the results, we can surmise that early mobilization administered to mechanically ventilated patients may provide the same benefits to patients with COVID‐19 in the form of decreased length of hospital stay and reduced likelihood of developing PICS.","Affeldt, Stacey; Alcorn, Phillip; Duke, Travis; Raynes, Edilberto",FASEB J,137,8

In This research structural equation modeling was used to analyze a conceptual model. The sample consisted of 452 undergraduate students of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. The research instruments included the autonomy-supportive environment inventory, the self-system processes questionnaire, three questionnaires of academic emotions, and the agentic engagement scale. The findings showed that supporting autonomy had an indirect effect on students' achievement emotions, via self-system processes. Self-system processes had direct and indirect effects on agentic engagement, via positive academic emotions. Supporting autonomy had an indirect effect on agentic engagement by mediating role of self-system processes and positive academic emotions. Accordingly, emotions are proximal determinants of agentic engagement. Supporting autonomy and self-system processes affect agentic engagement from the pathway of academic emotions. Therefore, in addition to environmental factors and self-appraisals, it is necessary to consider students' emotional experiences to promote agentic engagement in learning settings.","Bordbar, Maryam",Front Psychol,137,25

Vaccine development approaches consist of viral vector vaccines, DNA vaccine, RNA vaccine, live attenuated virus, and recombinant proteins, which elicit a specific immune response. The use of nanoparticles displaying antigen is one of the alternative approaches to conventional vaccines. This is due to the fact that nano-based vaccines are stable, able to target, form images, and offer an opportunity to enhance the immune responses. The diameters of ultrafine nanoparticles are in the range of 1–100 nm. The application of nanotechnology on vaccine design provides precise fabrication of nanomaterials with desirable properties and ability to eliminate undesirable features. To be successful, nanomaterials must be uptaken into the cell, especially into the target and able to modulate cellular functions at the subcellular levels. The advantages of nano-based vaccines are the ability to protect a cargo such as RNA, DNA, protein, or synthesis substance and have enhanced stability in a broad range of pH, ambient temperatures, and humidity for long-term storage. Moreover, nano-based vaccines can be engineered to overcome biological barriers such as nonspecific distribution in order to elicit functions in antigen presenting cells. In this review, we will summarize on the developing COVID-19 vaccine strategies and how the nanotechnology can enhance antigen presentation and strong immunogenicity using advanced technology in nanocarrier to deliver antigens. The discussion about their safe, effective, and affordable vaccines to immunize against COVID-19 will be highlighted.

This study systematically reviews the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in COVID-19, especially for diagnosis, estimation of epidemic trends, prognosis, and exploration of effective and safe drugs and vaccines; and discusses the potential limitations. Methods: We report this systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library from inception to 19 September 2020 for published studies of AI applications in COVID-19. We used PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) to assess the quality of literature related to the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. We registered the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020211555). Results: We included 78 studies: 46 articles discussed AI-assisted diagnosis for COVID-19 with total accuracy of 70.00 to 99.92%, sensitivity of 73.00 to 100.00%, specificity of 25 to 100.00%, and area under the curve of 0.732 to 1.000. Fourteen articles evaluated prognosis based on clinical characteristics at hospital admission, such as clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, reaching accuracy of 74.4 to 95.20%, sensitivity of 72.8 to 98.00%, specificity of 55 to 96.87% and AUC of 0.66 to 0.997 in predicting critical COVID-19. Nine articles used AI models to predict the epidemic of the COVID-19, such as epidemic peak, infection rate, number of infected cases, transmission laws, and development trend. Eight articles used AI to explore potential effective drugs, primarily through drug repurposing and drug development. Finally, 1 article predicted vaccine targets that have the potential to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Conclusions: In this review, we have shown that AI achieved high performance in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, epidemic prediction and drug discovery for COVID-19. AI has the potential to enhance significantly existing medical and healthcare system efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Lian; Zhang, Yonggang; Wang, Dongguang; Tong, Xiang; Liu, Tao; Zhang, Shijie; Huang, Jizhen; Zhang, Li; Chen, Lingmin; Fan, Hong; Clarke, Mike",Front Med (Lausanne),137,5

Despite preventative measures, these injuries are occurring at increasing rates in athletes of all levels. UCL reconstruction techniques generally require a prolonged recovery period and introduce the potential for intraoperative complications prompting investigations into more conservative treatment measures based on specific patient and injury characteristics. The purpose of this review is to describe the current literature regarding the use of biologic augmentation in the management of UCL injuries. Specifically, this review will focus on the basic science background and clinical investigations pertaining to biologic augmentation utilizing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and autologous stem cells. RECENT FINDINGS Despite some evidence supporting the use of PRP therapy in patients with partial UCL tears, there is no current consensus regarding its true efficacy. Similarly, due to a lack of clinical investigations, no consensus exists regarding the utilization of autologous stem cell treatments in the management of UCL injuries. Management of UCL injuries ranges from non-operative treatment with focused physical therapy protocols to operative reconstruction. The use of biologic augmentation in these injuries continues to be investigated in the orthopedic community. Currently, no consensus exists regarding the efficacy of either PRP or autologous stem cells and further research is needed to further define the appropriate role of these treatments in the management of UCL injuries.","Apostolakos, John M; Lin, Kenneth M; Carr, James B; Bedi, Asheesh; Camp, Christopher L; Dines, Joshua S",Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,137,20

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,491; deaths = 102. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 215 cases notified between 8 and 21 June, 75% (163 cases) were notified from Victoria. Most of these cases were acquired locally. In contrast, cases notified from other states (NSW, Qld and WA) over this period were mostly overseas-acquired. Of locally-acquired cases in Victoria in this period, 51% were associated with contacts of a confirmed case or in a known outbreak, while 49% were unable to be linked to another case or were under investigation at the time of reporting. There are several clusters across a range of settings, including extended families, hotel quarantine facilities and a retail store, with most cases limited in geographic spread to a number of Local Government Areas around Melbourne. In response, the Victorian Government has re-introduced restrictions for household and outdoor gatherings, has delayed plans to ease other restrictions and has implemented enhanced public health response activities, particularly with regard to testing and contact tracing. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18 years, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 21 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.3%. Other countries in the Americas region, such as Brazil and Chile, are seeing rapid growth in case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, while there is significant growth in the South East Asia region, including in India and Bangladesh.

Solution containing NPs was optically more transparent than solution containing MPs at the same mass concentration. However, exposure to NPs induced significantly higher mortality rate of zebrafish embryos than exposure to MPs. Exposure to MPs or NPs caused pathological changes of caudal vein plexus. In addition, caudal tissues were impaired with inhibition of intact growth of zebrafish embryos. Peripheral microcirculation at caudal region was significantly deteriorated by exposure to MPs or NPs.

DESIGN Clinical retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING A general teaching hospital in China. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients (age ≥18 years) admitted to our department with an intensive care unit (ICU) stay ≥5 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES HBP levels were recorded twice or more within 5 days after admission. The initial AGI grades and the worst AGI grades within 5 days after admission, the number of patients receiving total enteral nutrition (TEN) and the number of patients with feeding intolerance (FI) and with sepsis were also recorded, along with some clinical severity and outcome variables. RESULTS From June 2018 to May 2019, 221 patients were enrolled in this study. We divided patients into four groups based on the HBP values: HBP ≤20 ng/mL, 20100 ng/mL. Significant differences were found in the ratios of AGI deterioration and TEN and the incidence rates of FI and sepsis among the four groups. Differences were also found among the groups regarding the worst AGI grades. The area under receiver operating characteristic curves for AGI deterioration, severe AGI (grades II or above), TEN and FI were 0.738 (p=0.001), 0.774 (p<0.001), 0.810 (p<0.001) and 0.729 (p=0.001), respectively. The optimal HBP cut-off values for AGI deterioration and severe AGI were 53.27 ng/mL and 41.26 ng/mL, respectively. However, no differences in ICU duration or 28-day mortality were found.

We sought to test whether methylprednisolone reduces the risk of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery. METHODS We conducted a prespecified substudy of a randomized controlled trial involving patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (2007-2014); patients were recruited from 79 centres in 18 countries. Eligibility criteria included a moderate-to-high risk of perioperative death based on a preoperative score of 6 or greater on the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation I. Patients (n = 7286) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous methylprednisolone (250 mg at anesthetic induction and 250 mg at initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) or placebo. Patients, caregivers, data collectors and outcome adjudicators were unaware of the assigned intervention. The primary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury, defined as an increase in the serum creatinine concentration (from the preoperative value) of 0.3 mg/dL or greater (≥ 26.5 μmol/L) or 50% or greater in the 14-day period after surgery, or use of dialysis within 30 days after surgery. RESULTS Acute kidney injury occurred in 1479/3647 patients (40.6%) in the methylprednisolone group and in 1426/3639 patients (39.2%) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.11). Results were consistent across several definitions of acute kidney injury and in patients with preoperative chronic kidney disease. INTERPRETATION Intraoperative corticosteroid use did not reduce the risk of acute kidney injury in patients with a moderate-to-high risk of perioperative death who had cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Our results do not support the prophylactic use of steroids during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, no.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as PCR and isothermal amplification methods provide excellent analytical performance and significantly faster turnaround times than conventional culture-based methods. However, the inherent cost and complexity of NAATs limit their application in resource-limited settings and the developing world. To help address this urgent need, we have developed a sensitive method for nucleic acid analysis based on padlock probe rolling circle amplification (PLRCA), nuclease protection (NP) and lateral flow detection (LFA), referred to as PLAN-LFA, that can be used in resource-limited settings. The assay involves solution-phase hybridization of a padlock probe to target, sequence-specific ligation of the probe to form a circular template that undergoes isothermal rolling circle amplification in the presence of a polymerase and a labeled probe DNA. The RCA product is a long, linear concatenated single-stranded DNA that contains binding sites for the labeled probe. The sample is then exposed to a nuclease which selectively cleaves single-stranded DNA, the double-stranded labeled probe is protected from nuclease digestion and detected in a lateral flow immunoassay format to provide a visual, colorimetric readout of results. We have developed specific assays targeting beta-lactamase resistance gene for monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus discovered in 2019) using the PLAN-LFA platform. The assay provides a limit of detection of 1.1 pM target DNA (or 1.3 × 106 copies per reaction). We also demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the method by performing analysis on DNA and RNA targets, and perform analysis in complex sample matrices like saliva, plant tissue extract and bacterial culture without any sample pretreatment steps.","Jain, Sidhartha; Dandy, David S; Geiss, Brian J; Henry, Charles S",The Analyst,137,1

The 2009 revision of Step 4 of the WHO/UNICEF ""Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding"" elaborated on the practice of skin-to-skin contact between the mother and her newly born baby indicating that the practice should be ""immediate"" and ""without separation"" unless documented medically justifiable reasons for delayed contact or interruption exist. While in immediate, continuous, uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact with mother in the first hour after birth, babies progress through 9 instinctive, complex, distinct, and observable stages including self-attachment and suckling. However, the most recent Cochrane review of early skin-to-skin contact cites inconsistencies in the practice; the authors found ""inadequate evidence with respect to details … such as timing of initiation and dose."" This paper introduces a novel algorithm to analyse the practice of skin to skin in the first hour using two data sets and suggests opportunities for practice improvement. The algorithm considers the mother's Robson criteria, skin-to-skin experience, and Widström's 9 Stages. Using data from vaginal births in Japan and caesarean births in Australia, the algorithm utilizes data in a new way to highlight challenges to best practice. The use of a tool to analyse the implementation of skin-to-skin care in the first hour after birth illuminates the successes, barriers, and opportunities for improvement to achieving the standard of care for babies. Future application should involve more diverse facilities and Robson's classifications.","Brimdyr, Kajsa; Cadwell, Karin; Stevens, Jeni; Takahashi, Yuki",Maternal & child nutrition,137,20

For physicians, interviews mark the gateway from entrance into medical school, acceptance into residency, fellowships, and subsequent job opportunities. Previous literature outlining the costs associated with face-to-face interviews and concerns regarding the climate crisis has triggered an interest in video-based interviews. Barriers to transitioning away from in-person interviews include concerns regarding lack of rapport between applicants and interviewers, and applicants being less able to represent themselves. In a new era ushered in by COVID where many of us have utilized virtual meetings more than any prior time both personally and for work, we wanted to consolidate the current literature on the use of video-based interviews in healthcare and summarize the findings. METHODS A scoping review will be conducted to explore the benefits and limitations of video-based interviews for both applicants and interviewers within healthcare fields, as well as the perceived barriers associated with transitioning away from face-to-face interviews. The scoping review methodology outlined by Arksey and O'Malley will be implemented. The search strategy developed by the authors in collaboration with an academic health sciences librarian will be conducted across four electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and PsycInfo) and supplemented by a review of the grey literature and reference lists of included studies. The study selection process will be documented using the PRISMA flow diagram, and reasons for exclusion following full-text review will be recorded. The extracted data will be analyzed using quantitative and qualitative analysis. DISCUSSION Despite previous literature on the costs associated with face-to-face interviews, there has been hesitancy with transitioning to video-based interviews due to concerns of lack of rapport between applicants and interviewers, and applicants being less able to represent themselves. While these limitations have been explored in previous studies, a succinct review of the current literature to guide the effective restructuring of the interview process is lacking. With our scoping review, we hope to fill this gap in the literature to better understand barriers to transitioning from face-to-face interviews and directions for future research.","Selvam, Rajajee; Hu, Richard; Musselman, Reilly; Raiche, Isabelle; Moloo, Husein",Systematic reviews,137,31

Clinical signs of IBD are nonspecific, and intestinal biopsies are necessary for a definitive diagnosis. A grading scheme has not been established for ferrets. Additionally, the association between histologic severity and clinical signs in ferrets is unknown. We evaluated enteric samples from ferrets diagnosed with IBD, compared histologic grading schemes, and correlated the results with the severity of clinical signs. Enteric sections from 23 ferrets with IBD were analyzed using grading schemes for intestinal inflammation in cats and dogs, and a correlation with clinical signs was evaluated. After dividing the histologic samples into groups based on the severity of clinical signs, main histologic differences were identified. Age and sex were also assessed for correlation with clinical signs. No significant correlation was found between the 2 grading schemes and clinical signs (rho = 0.02, p = 0.89; rho = 0.26, p = 0.18, respectively). Degree of villus fusion, hemorrhage and/or fibrin, epithelial damage, inflammation density, and crypt abscess formation were used retrospectively to create a ferret IBD grading scheme, which was significantly correlated with the severity of clinical signs (rho = 0.48, p = 0.01). A positive correlation was observed between age (p = 0.04) and females (p = 0.007) with severity of clinical signs. Our ferret grading scheme may have clinical utility in providing a more objective, consistent evaluation of IBD in ferrets.","Cazzini, Paola; Watson, Megan K; Gottdenker, Nicole; Mayer, Joerg; Reavill, Drury; Fox, James G; Parry, Nicola; Sakamoto, Kaori","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",137,1

Well-being can be understood as a product of transactions between the individual and their context. Using qualitative research, this metasynthesis shows that girls face several threats to their well-being, often related to gender interwoven with the context in which girls operate.Methods: A Qualitative Metasynthesis was used. It included 10 qualitative studies.Results: Findings of this metasynthesis explain that context plays a relevant role in girls' access to resources and opportunities within families and communities. They show that context defines expectations on how girls should behave and spend their time, which often become stressors for girls. Girls examine their context and use it to set up ideals and compare themselves to others. These comparisons impact girls' self-image and structure aspects of their social life.Conclusions: Context and gender affect girls' well-being at different levels. Therefore, interventions and public policies should study the key factors girls identified as influencing their well-being, and address them using a multilevel rationale. Qualitative research can offer complex and illustrative insights on girls' well-being, exploring their perspectives and experiences, and shedding light on how interlocking systems of oppression affect their well-being.","Bilbao-Nieva, M Isidora",International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,137,1

AIM The aim of this study was to understand the role and experience of hospital palliative care volunteers. DESIGN Systematic review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and three dissertation databases were searched from inception to June 2019. A forward and backward search of included papers in key journals was also undertaken. Records were independently assessed against inclusion criteria by authors. Included papers were assessed for quality, but none were excluded. RESULTS In total, 14 papers were included. Hospital palliative care volunteers were mostly female, aged above 40 years, and training varied considerably. Volunteers faced unique challenges in supporting dying patients due to the nature of hospital care, rapid patient turnover and the once-off nature of support. Volunteer roles were diverse, with some providing hands-on care, but most focused on 'being with' the dying patient. Volunteers were appreciated for providing psychosocial support, seen as complementary to, rather than replacing the work of health professionals. Given volunteers were often required to work across multiple wards, establishing positive work relationships with health professionals was challenging. Divergent views about whether the volunteer was part of or external to the team impacted volunteers' experience and perceptions of the value of their contribution. CONCLUSION Hospital palliative care volunteers face unique challenges in supporting terminally ill patients. Volunteer support in hospital settings is possible and appropriate, if sufficient support is available to mitigate the challenges associated with complex, high-acuity care.","Bloomer, Melissa J; Walshe, Catherine",Palliative medicine,137,4

B cells have been found to infiltrate various cancer types and play a role in tumor immunity, offering new immunotherapy opportunities. Nevertheless, the specific impact of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) on B cells has largely been overlooked. In the current study, we aimed to characterize TANs' role in the recruitment and modulation of B cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We showed that TANs actively participate in the recruitment of B cells to the TME and identified TNFα as the major cytokine mediating B-cell chemotaxis by TANs. The recruitment of CD45+B220+CD138- splenic B cells by TANs in vitro resulted in B-cell phenotypic modulation, with 68.6{plus minus}2.1% of the total migrated B cells displaying a CD45-B220+CD138+ phenotype, typical for plasma cells. This phenotype mirrored the large proportion (54.0{plus minus}6.1%) of CD45-B220+CD138+ intratumoral B cells (i.e., plasma cells) in LLC tumors. We next confirmed that the differentiation of CD45+B220+CD138- B cells to functionally active CD45-B220+CD138+ plasma cells required contact with TANs, was independent of T cells, and resulted in IgG production. We further identified membranal BAFF on TANs as a potential contact mechanism mediating B-cell differentiation, as blocking BAFF-R significantly reduced by 20% IgG production. Our study, therefore, demonstrates that TANs drive the recruitment and modulation of B cells into plasma cells in the TME, hence opening new avenues in the targeting of the immune system in cancer.","Shaul, Merav E; Zlotnik, Asaf; Tidhar, Einat; Schwartz, Asaf; Arpinati, Ludovica; Kaisar-Iluz, Naomi; Mahroum, Sojod; Mishalian, Inbal; Fridlender, Zvi G",Cancer immunology research,137,1

The American Heart Association International Stroke Conference ( ISC ) is well attended by stroke clinicians. We sought to determine whether patients with acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) admitted during the ISC receive less guideline-adherent care and experience worse outcomes. Methods and Results We performed a retrospective cohort study of US hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke and assessed use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, other quality measures, and outcomes for patients with AIS admitted during the ISC compared with those admitted the weeks before and after the conference. A total of 69 738 patients with AIS were included: mean age, 72 years; 52% women; 29% nonwhite. There was no difference between the average weekly number of AIS cases admitted during ISC weeks versus non- ISC weeks (1984 versus 1997; P=0.95). Patient and hospital characteristics were similar between ISC and non- ISC time periods. There were no significant differences in 14 quality metrics and 5 clinical outcomes between patients with AIS treated during the ISC versus non- ISC weeks. Patients with AIS who presented within 2 hours of onset had no difference in the likelihood of receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 3 hours (adjusted odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.03; P=0.13) or the likelihood of receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 60 minutes of arrival (adjusted odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.02; P=0.13).

In this article, we examine trends in adult mortality (ages 55+) across US states from 1977 to 2017, paying close attention to the shifting geographic pattern of high- and low-mortality states. We find that states in the South tended to fall behind the rest of the country in the 1970s and 1980s, while states in the Great Plains and Mountain West tended to fall behind in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. In contrast, states on the East and West Coasts have tended to see considerable improvement in mortality. We consider the role of state-level per-capita spending on public welfare programs in the mortality experience of states between 1977 and 2017. We use fixed effects models to show that greater state welfare generosity predicts greater yearly reductions in mortality. State shifts toward more generous welfare spending regimes may contribute to significant geographic divergences in adult mortality in the United States.","Fenelon, Andrew; Witko, Christopher",Health & place,137,26

In this study, we checked the feasibility of endotracheal intubation with a VivaSight-SL through the Fastrach Laryngeal Mask Airway(®) (FT-LMA). METHODS We studied 50 patients with normal airways, scheduled for elective surgery during general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation. The FT-LMA was inserted and once adequate ventilation was achieved, the VivaSight-SL was passed through the FT-LMA into the trachea under visual control. The following criteria were used to score the laryngeal view: grade 1: full view of the arytenoids and glottis; grade 2: epiglottis, arytenoids or glottic opening are partly visible, the structure of cords is difficult to see; grade 3: dark areas indicating an open space; and grade 4: no part of the larynx can be identified. RESULTS The FT-LMA was placed successfully in 49 patients at the first attempt. One patient was excluded from the study after 2 failed attempts to ventilate with the FT-LMA. All 49 patients were successfully intubated with the VivaSight-SL, (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-0.99), 47 patients at the first attempt (95% CI, 0.83-0.98) and 2 patients at the second attempt. (95% CI, 0.004-0.13). The time to achieve an effective airway with the FT-LMA was 15.4 ± 6 (mean ± SD) seconds. The time to achieve a laryngeal view with the VivaSight-SL was 28.8 ± 5 seconds. Correct position of the VivaSight-SL was confirmed with visualization of the carina. Time of successful intubation with VivaSight-SL from picking up the VivaSight-SL to observing a end-tidal CO(2) curve was 45 ± 7 seconds. After introducing the VivaSight-SL through the intubating channel of the FT-LMA, a grade 1 view was obtained in 18 patients, grade 2 in 18 patients, a grade 3 in 4 patients, and grade 4 in 9 patients. CONCLUSION The high first-attempt intubation success rate using the VivaSight-SL to intubate the trachea through a FT-LMA makes this technique an attractive and promising concept.","Gaitini, Luis A; Yanovski, Boris; Mustafa, Somri; Hagberg, Carin A; Mora, Pedro Charco; Vaida, Sonia J",Anesthesia and analgesia,137,19

This review summarizes available pediatric data and covers the aspects of epidemiology, critical illness with acute infection [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)], the discovered multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and management options. RECENT FINDINGS The available data from the source of the initial viral transmission and then through Europe, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere identifies important aspects of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic: 1) Pediatric infection occurs commonly, is likely underestimated, and transmission patterns remain incompletely described, 2) Pediatric patients suffer multiple end-organ injuries but COVID-19 is not the same prevalence in terms of severity as in adults, 3) MIS-C is a novel and life-threatening manifestation of exposure to the virus, 4) Management using a combination of supportive care, standard practice intensive care management, and anti-inflammatory agents is associated with recovery, 5) Long-term sequelae of viral exposure is unknown at this time. SUMMARY Emerging evidence suggests pediatric patients are at risk for severe and life-threatening effects of exposure to SARS-CoV2. As the pandemic continues, further research is warranted - particularly as a vaccine is not yet available for use in children.","Damania, Rahul; Moore, Whitney; Viamonte, Heather C; Kamat, Pradip; Basu, Rajit K",Current opinion in pediatrics,137,1

Hence, available drugs for treatment of other viral infections may be useful to treat COVID-19. AREAS COVERED The focus of the current review was studying the main characteristics of favipiravir and its usefulness to treat COVID-19. An electronic search was done by using Pubmed and Google scholar. EXPERT OPINION Based on the mechanism of action and safety of favipiravir, the drug may be a promising candidate for compassionate use against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Favipiravir has a wide range of activity against many single-stranded RNA viruses, is well tolerated in humans and has a high barrier to resistance. However, high doses of the agent are necessary to obtain an efficient antiviral activity. Favipiravir is teratogen in pregnant women and associated with the hyperuricemia.

Since this HE protein possesses an acetyl-esterase activity that removes acetyl groups from O-acetylated sialic acid, a role as a receptor-destroying enzyme has been postulated. However, the precise function of HE and of its enzymatic activity remains poorly understood. Making use of neutralizing antibody and of molecular clones of recombinant human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), our results suggest that the HE protein of this HCoV could be associated with infection of target cells and, most notably, is important in the production of infectious viral particles. Indeed, after transfecting BHK-21 cells with various cDNA infectious clones of HCoV-OC43, either lacking the HE protein or bearing an HE protein with a nonfunctional acetyl-esterase enzymatic activity, we were reproducibly unable to detect recombinant infectious viruses compared to the reference infectious HCoV-OC43 clone pBAC-OC43(FL). Complementation experiments, using BHK-21 cells expressing wild-type HE, either transiently or in a stable ectopic expression, demonstrate that this protein plays a very significant role in the production of infectious recombinant coronaviral particles that can subsequently more efficiently infect susceptible epithelial and neuronal cells. Even though the S protein is the main viral factor influencing coronavirus infection of susceptible cells, our results taken together indicate that a functionally active HE protein enhances the infectious properties of HCoV-OC43 and contributes to efficient virus dissemination in cell culture.","Desforges, Marc; Desjardins, Jessica; Zhang, Chengsheng; Talbot, Pierre J",Journal of virology,137,27

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",The Science of the total environment,137,1

Major class of drugs that are targeted against RdRP are nucleotide analogues. Extensive docking and molecular dynamics study describing the binding of natural nucleotides (NTPs) and its analogues leading to significant structural variation in the RdRP has been presented here. RdRP simulations in its apo, NTP-bound, and analogue-bound form have been performed. Nucleotide analogues included in this study were, favipiravir, galidesivir, lamivudine, ribavirin, remdesivir and sofosbuvir. The conformational flexibility of the RdRP molecule has been explored using principal component (PCA) and Markov state modeling (MSM) analysis. PCA inferred the presence of correlated motions among the conserved motifs of RdRP. Inter-domain distances between the finger and thumb subdomain flanking the nascent RNA template entry site sampled open and closed conformations. The ligand and template binding motifs F and G showed negatively correlated motions. K551, R553, and R555, a part of motif F appear to form strong interactions with the ligand molecules. R836, a primer binding residue was observed to strongly bind to the analogues. MSM analysis helped to extract statistically distinct conformations explored by the RdRP. Ensemble docking of the ligands on the Markov states also suggested the involvement of the above residues in ligand interactions. Markov states obtained clearly demarcated the open/closed conformations of the template entry site. These observations on residues from the conserved motifs involved in binding to the ligands may provide an insight into designing new inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Validated surveys can guide improvement and future expansion of telehealth programs. Introduction: This study examines physician and advanced practice provider perspectives and satisfaction using telehealth at UPMC Pinnacle and to assess key predictors of future use in ambulatory care. Methods: A web-based Likert scale survey of UPMC Pinnacle physicians and advanced practice providers was conducted in May-June 2020. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the survey's internal consistency. Crosstab analysis and multivariate regression were used to analyze the interrelationships between variables. Results: A significant majority (64%) of physicians responded positively that they enjoyed telehealth video visits. A majority (65%) felt that the physician-patient relationship was unimpaired during telehealth visits, but only 29% of the respondents felt they were able to examine the patients properly. Providers who experienced good video and audio quality were 3.68 times more likely to enjoy telehealth visits (p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval 2.05-6.61) than those with less-than-optimal video and audio quality. Logistic regression shows a strong correlation between the audio and image quality and respondents' satisfaction with telehealth. Discussion: The key barriers for patients when using telehealth are perceived to be the ability to use a smartphone app, password management, or video/microphone features. For clinicians, barriers include problems with seeing and hearing on the platform. Conclusions: Patient education and improvement of audio and image quality are essential for improving telehealth usage and satisfaction.","Saiyed, Salim; Nguyen, An; Singh, Rashmi",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,137,1

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and daily new deaths due to COVID-19 in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. MATERIALS AND METHODS We selected all the six GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman. This region has a relatively high temperature and humidity, and has homogenous Arab ethnicity with a similar socioeconomic culture. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, including daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization. The information on daily temperature and humidity was obtained from world climate web ""Time and Date"". The daily basis, mean temperature and humidity were recorded from the date of appearance of first case of COVID-19 in the region, Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020. We also evaluated the growth factor, ""a ratio by which a quantity multiplies itself over time; it equals daily cases divided by cases on the previous day"". RESULTS In GCC countries, the daily basis mean temperature from Jan 29, 2020 to May 15, 2020 was 29.20±0.30°C and humidity was 37.95±4.40%. The results revealed that there was a negative correlation and decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths from COVID-19 with increase in humidity in Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The correlation coefficient between temperature with daily cases shows that an increase in temperature was associated with an increase in daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19, however, the temperature is still gradually rising in the region. The growth factor result for daily cases was 1.09±0.00 and daily deaths was 1.07±0.03 for COVID-19, and shows declining trends in GCC region. CONCLUSIONS An increase in relative humidity was associated with a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in GCC countries. The daily growth factor for patients and deaths shows a declining trend. However, the climate is swiftly changing in the region; further studies may be conducted during the peak of summer season. The findings have outcomes for policymakers and health officials about the impact of temperature and humidity on epidemiological trends of daily new cases and deaths due to COVID-19.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Alsalame, N M; Al-Khlaiwi, T; Usmani, A M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,137,31

It is argued that competition between organs for limited resources is an important mesoscale morphogenetic mechanism that produces fitness-enhancing correlated growth. At the genetic level, the growth of individual characters appears independent, or ""modular,"" because patterns of expression and transcription are often highly localized, mutations have trait-specific effects, and gene complexes can be co-opted as a unit to produce novel traits. However, body parts are known to interact over the course of ontogeny, and these reciprocal exchanges can be an important determinant of developmental outcomes. Genetic mechanisms underlie cell and tissue behaviors that allow organs to communicate with one another, but they also create evolutionarily adaptive competitive dynamics that are driven by physiological and biophysical processes. Advances in the understanding of competitive and closely related coordinative interactions across scales will complement existing research programs that emphasize the role of cellular mechanisms in morphogenesis. Study of the large-scale order produced by competitive dynamics promises to facilitate advances in basic evolutionary and developmental biology, as well as applied research in fields such as bioengineering and regenerative medicine that aim to regulate patterning outcomes.","Gawne, Richard; McKenna, Kenneth Z; Levin, Michael","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",137,31

Weighted average mean times to tracheotomy, to decannulation, and to death were calculated from reported or approximated means. DATA SOURCES PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. REVIEW METHODS Studies were screened by 3 investigators independently. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Studies including patients with COVID-19 who underwent a tracheotomy were identified. Studies without reported mechanical ventilation weaning or decannulation were excluded. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS After identifying 232 unique studies, 18 articles encompassing outcomes for 3234 patients were ultimately included for meta-analysis, with a weighted mean follow-up time of 28.6 ± 6.2 days after tracheotomy. Meta-analysis revealed that 55.0% of tracheotomized patients were weaned successfully from mechanical ventilation (95% CI, 47.4%-62.2%). Approximately 34.9% of patients were decannulated successfully, with a mean decannulation time of 18.6 ± 5.7 days after tracheotomy. The pooled mortality in tracheotomized patients with COVID-19 was 13.1%, with a mean time of death of 13.0 ± 4.0 days following tracheotomy. CONCLUSION At the current state of the coronavirus pandemic, over half of patients who have required tracheotomies are being weaned off of mechanical ventilation. While 13.1% patients have died prior to decannulation, over a third of all tracheotomized patients with COVID-19 reported in the literature have undergone successful decannulation.","Benito, Daniel A; Bestourous, Daniel E; Tong, Jane Y; Pasick, Luke J; Sataloff, Robert T",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,137,5

There is, however, great within-individual variation in how an animal perceives and reacts to stressors. These differences in coping with stress modulate the development of stress-induced memory alterations. The present study investigated whether and how chronic stress and individual emotionality interrelate and influence memory performances and brain neurogenesis in birds. For that, we used two lines of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) with divergent emotionality levels. Highly (E+) and less (E-) emotional quail were submitted to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 3 weeks and trained in a spatial task and a discrimination task, a form of cue-based memory. E + and E- birds were also used to assess the impact of CUS and emotionality on neurogenesis within the hippocampus and the striatum. CUS negatively impacted spatial memory, and cell proliferation, and survival in the hippocampus. High emotionality was associated with a decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. CUS improved discrimination performances and favored the differentiation of newborn cells into mature neurons in the striatum, specifically in E+ birds. Our results provide evidence that CUS consequences on memory and neural plasticity depends both on the memory system and individual differences in behavior.","Lormant, Flore; Ferreira, Vitor Hugo Bessa; Meurisse, Maryse; Lemarchand, Julie; Constantin, Paul; Morisse, Mélody; Cornilleau, Fabien; Parias, Céline; Chaillou, Elodie; Bertin, Aline; Lansade, Léa; Leterrier, Christine; Lévy, Frédéric; Calandreau, Ludovic",Scientific reports,137,2

In a representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 5,010), this research tested whether COVID-19 financial hardship was associated with higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation (supported), and whether the reasoned action framework could usefully predict help-seeking intentions in this context (supported).

METHODS The Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) was a multicenter randomized-controlled trial of intravenous thrombolysis (rt-PA) given within six hours of ischemic stroke. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. In a subgroup of 109 IST-3 patients (38 men, median age 82 years), a single reader, masked to all clinical and other imaging data, manually measured x-ray attenuation (Hounsfield Units, HU) on non-contrast CT at the location of angiographically-proven intra-arterial obstructions, pre-randomization and at 24-48 hour follow-up. We calculated change in attenuation between scans. We assessed the impact of pre-randomization arterial obstruction attenuation on six-month functional outcome. RESULTS Most arterial obstructions (64/109, 59%) were hyperattenuating (mean 51.0 HU). Compared with control, treatment with rt-PA was associated with a greater, but non-significant, reduction in obstruction attenuation at follow-up (-8.0 HU versus -1.4 HU in patients allocated control, p = 0.117). In multivariable ordinal regression analysis controlled for patient age, stroke severity, location and extent of obstruction, time from stroke onset to baseline scan and rt-PA treatment allocation, the attenuation of pre-randomization arterial obstruction was not independently associated with six-month outcome (odds ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval = 0.94-1.03, p = 0.516). CONCLUSIONS In ischemic stroke, the x-ray attenuation of the arterial obstruction may decline more rapidly from baseline to 24-48 hours following treatment with thrombolysis but we found no evidence that baseline arterial obstruction attenuation predicts six-month outcome.","Mair, Grant; von Kummer, Rüdiger; Lindley, Richard I; Sandercock, Peter A G; Wardlaw, Joanna M",PloS one,137,27

Our aims were to determine whether TLR elevation could be detected in infected periprosthetic tissues and to assess the utility of these biomarkers as tests for detecting a periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS Fifty-nine patients undergoing revision total joint arthroplasty (twenty-seven hips and thirty-two knees) were prospectively evaluated for periprosthetic joint infection according to currently recommended diagnostic criteria. Nine patients were excluded because of insufficient work-up, leaving fifty available for study. Of these, twenty-one were categorized as infected and twenty-nine as noninfected. Periprosthetic tissues were collected intraoperatively, and total RNA was extracted by standard techniques. Expression of TLR messenger RNAs was assessed by first-strand complementary DNA synthesis from 1 μg of total RNA followed by real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Results were normalized relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Expression of TLRs 1, 6, and 10 in the infected and noninfected groups was compared with use of the Student t test. The receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were calculated to determine the accuracy of each TLR for predicting periprosthetic joint infection at its optimal diagnostic threshold. RESULTS Mean TLR1 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in infected compared with noninfected samples (0.600 compared with 0.005, p = 0.0003); the same was true of TLR6 (0.208 compared with 0.0165, p = 0.0059) but not of TLR10 (0.00019 compared with 0.00014, p = 0.6238). The AUC was 0.995 for TLR1, 0.883 for TLR6, and 0.546 for TLR10. The optimal threshold for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection was 0.0924 for TLR1 (sensitivity = 95.2%, specificity = 100%, LR+ = 13.80, LR- = 0.91) and 0.0215 for TLR6 (sensitivity = 85.7%, specificity = 82.8%, LR+ = 4.98, LR- = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS In our pilot study, TLR1 expression in periprosthetic tissues most accurately predicted periprosthetic joint infection.

However, it is unclear whether nursing home social workers feel adequately trained and prepared in responding to disasters, such as COVID-19. To explore this, we used a study cross-sectional survey distributed via social media focusing on 1) prior training on disaster preparedness, 2) any content social workers wish had been a part of their education, and 3) suggestions for educators/academics to serve social workers on the frontlines. Data in this study are based on a sample of 63 (N=63) nursing home social workers. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS and qualitative data were analyzed using the RaDar (rigorous and accelerated data reduction) technique. Findings revealed that most social workers had little to no training in disaster preparedness, and shared areas of future education initiatives. Participants also shared the need for bridging the research to practice gap through open access articles and support from academics. Findings from the present study reveal areas social work programs can expand gerontology-focused course offerings. Additionally, developments promoting practitioner support from academics is worth consideration.","Miller, Vivian J; Anderson, Keith; Fields, Noelle L; Kusmaul, Nancy",Journal of gerontological social work,137,12

However, there are almost no reports published on the functions of the uORFs of p13 gene. In this study, the Luciferase Reporter Assay System was employed to investigate how the mini ORFs of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) p13 gene (Ha-p13) and its rare codons regulated the downstream gene expression. After the coding sequence of uORFs in the Ha-p13 gene was fused to the luciferase reporter gene in the expression vector pGL3 and the plasmid DNA was then transfected into the Hz-AM1 cells, the translation of the fusion protein could be initiated from the start codon of the uORFs. The uAUG and its context in uORF2 seemed to be more efficient for translation initiation than that in uORF1. Mutation of the start codons in one or both of uORFs (uORF1 or uORF2) could significantly increase the expression of the downstream reporter gene. The start codon mutation in uORF1 produced a higher reporter gene expression than that in uORF2, indicating that the uORF1 could be a stronger inhibitor than the uORF2, and the length of uORFs seemed not to be crucial for down-regulating translation. The expression of both uORFs could co-regulate the associated gene expression. Substituting the rare codons in uORF1, uORF2 or both with less rare codons dramatically increased the expression of the downstream reporter gene. Rare codon mutations in both uORFs were much more efficient in up-regulating the associate gene expression than mutations in either of the two uORFs alone.","Qiao, Hong; Lu, Nan; Du, Enqi; Yao, Lunguang; Xiao, Huazhong; Lu, Songya; Qi, Yipeng",Virus research,137,1

The most common afforestation strategy envisages planting seedlings, which are germinated and grown to the desired age at tree nurseries, with plastic shelters to increase growth and survival of trees. This article presents a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study that compares the environmental performance of current and prospective scenarios for shelter-aided seedling planting compared with a base case where shelters are not employed. The study focuses on the UK, but results and conclusions are valid for other temperate oceanic regions. The scenarios investigated are a combination of different shelters materials and end-of-life (EoL) strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) planting seedling without shelters is the most preferable option across most environmental impact categories (including Climate Change), and in terms of weighted results, (ii) polypropylene shelters are preferable to bio-based alternatives, including polylactic acid-starch blends and bio-polypropylene, (iii) recycling is the most environmentally advantageous EoL treatment. Our study also showed that that the carbon emissions of the scenarios investigated are negligible when compared to the amount of carbon sequestered by a tree in 25 years.","Chau, Charnett; Paulillo, Andrea; Lu, Nancy; Miodownik, Mark; Lettieri, Paola",The Science of the total environment,137,1

METHODS One hundred patients undergoing LAR-TME with a proximal diverting stoma were analyzed between 2013 and 2016. Postoperative CRP and PCT levels were measured on the 3rd and the 6th postoperative days. RESULTS There were 11 clinical leaks with a negative impact in univariate analysis on AL of male gender, larger and stenotic tumours, intraoperative blood loss > 200 mL, the need for perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative anaemia and an operating time exceeding 180 minutes. On multivariate analysis, only perioperative blood transfusion was an independent AL risk factor. Recorded CRP was higher in AL patients when compared with non-AL cases on both the 3rd postoperative day (152.4 mg/L vs. 93 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.0001) and the 6th postoperative day (130.5 mg/L vs. 68.2 mg/L; P < 0.0001). The PCT levels also significantly differed between AL and non-AL cases on the 3rd postoperative day (0.5 ng/mL vs. 0.2 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.0001) and the 6th postoperative day (1.16 ng/mL vs. 0.1 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.0001). Both CRP and PCT showed high negative predictive values (NPV) for the diagnosis of an AL on both postoperative days. CONCLUSION Following low restorative proctectomy, the high NPV of CRP and PCT measurements for the diagnosis of anastomotic leaks may assist decision-making for early hospital discharge.","Chernyshov, Stanislav; Alexeev, Mikhail; Rybakov, Evgeny; Tarasov, Mikhail; Shelygin, Yuri; Zarodniuk, Irina; Sukhina, Marina",Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,137,28

""Choice"" is central to occupational therapy's theoretical tradition, which maintains that individuals can impact their well-being through wisely choosing their occupations. However, the assumption that opportunities to choose are universally available is negated by research evidence. PURPOSE. To review the ideology of ""choice"" in occupational therapy theory, and to encourage more critical approaches toward determinants of occupational opportunity and choice. KEY ISSUES. Evidence indicates that within Canada, and throughout the world, opportunities to make occupational choices are inequitably distributed among people of different socioeconomic classes, castes, genders, races, abilities, sexualities, citizenship statuses, and experiences of colonialism. IMPLICATIONS. Because occupation is a determinant of health and well-being, social injustices that create inequitable occupational choices are unfair violations of occupational rights. The occupational therapy profession's espoused aim of enhancing well-being through occupation demands theories that explicitly recognize the socially structured and inequitable shaping of choice, and consequent impact on people's occupational rights.","Hammell, Karen Whalley",Canadian journal of occupational therapy.

Although antivirals are an integral tool in effective influenza management, the potential for the emergence of antiviral-resistant viruses can lead to uncertainty and hesitation among front-line prescribers and policy makers. Here, we provide an overview of influenza antiviral resistance in context, exploring the key concepts underlying its development and clinical impact. Due to the acute nature of influenza in immunocompetent patients, resistant viruses that develop during antiviral treatment of a single patient (""treatment-emergent resistance"") are usually cleared in a relatively short time, with no impact on future antiviral efficacy. In addition, although available data are limited by small numbers of patients, they show that antiviral treatment still provides clinical benefit to the patient within whom resistance emerges. In contrast, the sustained community transmission of resistant variants in the absence of treatment (""acquired resistance"") is of greater concern and can potentially render front-line antivirals ineffective. Importantly, however, resistant viruses are usually associated with reduced fitness such that their widespread transmission is relatively rare. Influenza antivirals are an essential part of effective influenza management due to their ability to reduce the risk of complications and death in infected patients. Although antiviral resistance should be taken seriously and requires continuous careful monitoring, it is not comparable to antibiotic resistance in bacteria, which can become permanent and widespread, with far-reaching medical consequences. The benefits of antiviral treatment far outweigh concerns of potential resistance, which in the vast majority of cases does not have a significant clinical impact.","Holmes, Edward C; Hurt, Aeron C; Dobbie, Zuzana; Clinch, Barry; Oxford, John S; Piedra, Pedro A",Clinical microbiology reviews,137,1

Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Although the prevalence is unknown, there have been more than 300 cases reported in the literature. MIS-C appears to be more common in Black and Hispanic children in the US. MIS-C typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present in vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Empiric treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and other immunomodulatory agents have been frequently used. Most patients recover within days to a couple of weeks and mortality is rare, although the medium- and long-term sequelae, particularly cardiovascular complications, are not yet known. This review describes the published data on MIS-C, focusing on cardiac complications, and provides clinical considerations for cardiac evaluation and follow-up.","Alsaied, Tarek; Tremoulet, Adriana H; Burns, Jane C; Saidi, Arwa; Dionne, Audrey; Lang, Sean M; Newburger, Jane W; de Ferranti, Sarah; Friedman, Kevin G",Circulation,137,29

The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the link between infantile colic and the gastro-intestinal microbiome. AREAS COVERED The gastro-intestinal microbiome may already start to develop in the womb and grows exponentially immediately after birth. Factors influencing the microbiome can cause dysbiosis and precipitate symptoms of colic through several mechanisms such as increased gas-production and low grade gut inflammation. Other possible factors are immaturity of the enterohepatic bile acid cycle and administration of antibiotics and other medications during the perinatal period. An effective treatment for all colicky infants has yet to be discovered, but the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 was shown to be effective in breastfed infants with colic. The scientific databases ""Pubmed"" and ""Google scholar"" were searched from inception until 02/2020. Relevant articles were selected based on the abstract.

These new technologies will undoubtedly bring solutions to long-standing problems and health conditions. However, they will likely also have unintended effects or ethical implications accompanying them. It may be presumed that the research behind new technologies has been evaluated from an ethical perspective; however, the evidence that this has been done is scant. OBJECTIVE This study aims to understand whether and in what manner PhD dissertations focused on health technologies describe actual or possible ethical issues resulting from their research. METHODS The purpose of scoping reviews is to map a topic in the literature comprehensively and systematically to identify gaps in the literature or identify key evidence. The search strategy for this protocol will include electronic databases (eg, ProQuest, PubMed, Diva, SwePub, and LIBRIS). Searches will be limited to PhD dissertations published in the United States and Sweden in the last 10 years. The study will be mapped in 5 stages: (1) identifying the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) study selection, (4) retrieving and charting the data, and (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. RESULTS The findings of this study will indicate if and how researchers, PhD students, and their supervisors are considering ethics in their studies, including both research ethics and the ethical implications of their work.

Those studies that mainly focused on young children, reached different conclusions regarding both the existence of such a link and the season with the highest risk. The purpose of this study was to reinvestigate the relationship between birth season and asthma in a very large cohort, larger than in all previous studies, focusing on adolescents. METHODS The medical records of consecutive 17-year-old conscripts, born between 1978 and 1999, undergoing medical evaluation before their military service, were reviewed. The prevalence of asthma among conscripts was calculated according to the season of birth. RESULTS Data from 6 26 460 males and 4 54 104 females were collected. Asthma prevalence was 6.6% of the males and 5.8% of the females. Asthma prevalence was highest among those born in the summer and was approximately 9% higher in women and 6% higher in men than those born in the winter. Those born in the winter had the lowest prevalence of asthma. June was the birth month with the highest prevalence of asthma in both genders together with September among males. CONCLUSIONS Being born in the summer, especially in June, is associated with an increased risk of asthma compared with a winter birth among Israeli army conscripts. Further research is required to determine the impact of the season of birth on the risk of asthma in higher risk populations.","Goldberg, Shmuel; Stein, Avital; Picard, Elie; Joseph, Leon; Kedem, Ron; Sommer, Adir; Tzur, Dorit; Cohen, Shlomo",Pediatric pulmonology,137,19

One end of the sample was sent for histological evaluation, and the other was used for burst pressure testing in a blinded fashion. Versatility was defined as the performance of the surgical instrument based on the following five variables, using a score from 1 to 5 (1=worst, 5=best), adjusted by coefficient of variable importance with weighted distribution: hemostasis, 0.275; histologic sealing, 0.275; cutting, 0.2; dissection, 0.15; and tissue manipulation, 0.1. There were 80 trials per vessel group and 60 trials per instrument group, giving a total of 240 samples. RESULTS Versatility score was higher (P<.01) and dissection time was shorter (P<.01) using TB compared with the other three devices. Bursting pressure was similar among TB and the other three instruments. Thermal spread at surgery was similar between TB and HA (P=.4167), TB and EnSeal (P=.6817), and TB and LIG (P=.8254). Difference in thermal spread was noted between EnSeal and HA (P=.0087) and HA and LIG (P=.0167). CONCLUSION TB has a higher versatility compared with the other instruments tested with faster dissection speed, similar bursting pressure, and acceptable thermal spread. This new energy device is an appealing, safe alternative for cutting, coagulation, and tissue dissection during surgery and should decrease time and increase versatility during surgical procedures.","Milsom, Jeffrey; Trencheva, Koiana; Monette, Sebastien; Pavoor, Raghava; Shukla, Parul; Ma, Junjun; Sonoda, Toyooki",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Among the most serious contemporary infectious agents are multiple antibiotic-resistant strains of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which present a formidable public health challenge that is no longer limited to hospitalized patients. To address key hypotheses regarding microbial strain evolution or virulence, conventional genotyping methods do not offer enough power to resolve minor changes between closely related strains. The application of next-generation high-throughput genotyping technologies, as illustrated in a recent analysis of a highly resistant S. aureus strain, can provide new clues about the geographical origin and intrahospital spread of important microbial pathogens.","Aziz, Ramy K; Nizet, Victor",Science translational medicine,137,1

Recent reports, however, raise concern for a new hyperinflammatory entity in a subset of pediatric COVID-19 patients. METHODS We report a fatal case of confirmed COVID-19 with hyperinflammatory features concerning for both multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and primary COVID-19. RESULTS This case highlights the ambiguity in distinguishing between these two entities in a subset of pediatric patients with COVID-19-related disease and the rapid decompensation these patients may experience. CONCLUSIONS Appropriate clinical suspicion is necessary for both acute disease and MIS-C. SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests obtained early in the diagnostic process may help to narrow down the differential but does not distinguish between acute COVID-19 and MIS-C. Better understanding of the hyperinflammatory changes associated with MIS-C and acute COVID-19 in children will help delineate the roles for therapies, particularly if there is a hybrid phenotype occurring in adolescents.","Beaudry, Jeanette T; Dietrick, Barbara; Lammert, Dawn B; Constas, Alexander; McCaw, Julia; Hammond, John; Buendia, Matthew; Stein, Julie E; Pekosz, Andrew; Schuette, Jennifer; Mostafa, Heba H; Hooper, Jody E; Bernier, Meghan; Agwu, Allison; Feldman, Leonard S",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,137,5

We followed a concurrent triangulation design. For the quantitative analysis, we extended the theory of planned behavior to identify possible reasons for stockpiling nonperishable food. The results suggest that ""attitude,"" ""subjective norm,"" and the ""fear of future unavailability"" were main drivers of stockpiling behavior in our sample. Additionally, we analyzed answers to open questions capturing participants' own explanations of why they did or did not stockpile nonperishable food. By contrasting the results, we found that our qualitative results validate some of our quantitative findings but also deliver new insights. For instance, a key stated reason for stockpiling nonperishable food was to reduce shopping frequency.","Lehberger, Mira; Kleih, Anne-Katrin; Sparke, Kai",Appetite,137,1

Our objective was to assess trans-peritoneal (TP) and retro-peritoneal (RP) hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HALDN). In this single-centre retrospective study, we analysed results from 317 living-donor renal transplants (RT) performed between 2008 and 2016. Donor and recipient outcomes were compared between TP-HALDN (n=235) and RP-HALDN (n=82). Conversion to open nephrectomy (0.4% vs 0%; P=1.000), intra-operative complications (1.7% vs 1.2%; P=1.000), and 1-year overall post-operative complications (11.9% vs 17.1%; P=0.258) rates were similar in TP-HALDN and RP-HALDN. Overall surgical site infections were higher in RP-HALDN (6.1% vs 1.7%; P=0.053) whereas incisional hernias were only recorded following TP-HALDN (3.4% vs 0%; P=0.118). The duration of the procedure was 11-minute shorter for TP-HALDN than RP-HALDN (P<0.001) but extraction time was equivalent (2, IQR 1.5-2.5 minutes; P=1.000).

PURPOSE (1) Develop disaster-preparedness protocols specific to the COVID-19 pandemic for an urban OBOT program, and (2) evaluate the impacts of the protocol and telehealth on care. METHODS Disaster-preparedness protocols specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were developed for an urban OBOT program, implemented on March 16, 2020. Retrospective chart review compared patients from January 1, 2020 to March 13, 2020, to patients from March 16, 2020 to April 30, 2020, abstracting patient demographics and comparing show and no-show rates between studied groups. RESULTS The disaster-preparedness protocol was developed under a deliberative process to address social issues of the urban underserved population. Of 852 visits conducted between Jan 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020, a 91.7% show rate (n = 166/181) was documented for telemedicine visits after protocol implementation compared with a 74.1% show rate (n = 497/671) for routine in-person care (P = .06) without significant differences between the study populations. The no-show rate was significantly lower after protocol implementation (8.3% vs 25.9%; P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS OBOTs require organized workflows to continue to provide services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, in the face of relaxed federal regulations, has the opportunity to enhance addiction care, creating a more convenient as well as an equally effective mechanism for OBOTs to deliver care that should inform future policy.","O'Gurek, David T",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,137,11

A total of 214 patients were studied over a period of five years. Of these patients, 189 (88.3%) and 25 (11.7%) underwent video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and an open approach for treatment, respectively. There were 35 (16.4%) postoperative recurrences. METHODS The data on patient characteristics, surgical details, and perioperative outcomes were analyzed. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics between recurrent and non-recurrent cases, and used logistic regression models to predict the risk factors for postoperative recurrence. RESULTS The differences in the age, gender, lesion site, location, ipsilateral SP (ISP), and contralateral SP (CSP) did not reach statistical significance between the two groups. However, the incidence of recurrence was higher in the subjects without any smoking history, and who had comorbidities, and a history of surgery for ISP. Concerning intraoperative factors, there were no significant differences with regard to the approach, buttress stapling, covering, surgeon, or length of the operation. The postoperative recurrence rate was higher in the patients who had been hand-stitched compared to those who had undergone instrument-based repair for blebs. There were no significant differences in the perioperative outcomes. The logistic regression models indicated that non smokers, those with comorbidities, and those who had previously undergone surgery for ISP had a higher rate of postoperative recurrence. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that a history of no smoking, the existence of comorbidities, previous surgery for ISP, and hand stitching increase the risk of postoperative recurrence. Therefore, surgeons must be aware of these risk factors, and more carefully monitor such patients for recurrence.","Uramoto, Hidetaka; Shimokawa, Hidehiko; Tanaka, Fumihiro",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,137,1

Much of the current literature on mentoring in gastroenterology is based on expert opinion rather than data. In this study, we aimed to identify gender-related barriers to successful mentoring relationships from the mentor and mentee perspectives. METHODS A voluntary, web-based survey was distributed to physicians at 20 academic institutions across the United States. Overall, 796 gastroenterology fellows and faculty received the survey link, with 334 physicians responding to the survey (42% response rate), of whom 299 (90%; 129 women and 170 men) completed mentorship questions and were included in analysis. RESULTS Responses of women and men were compared. Compared with men, more women preferred a mentor of the same gender (38.6% women vs 4.2% men, P < 0.0001) but less often had one (45.5% vs 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Women also reported having more difficulty finding a mentor (44.4% vs 16.0%, P < 0.0001) and more often cited inability to identify a mentor of the same gender as a contributing factor (12.8% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0004). More women mentors felt comfortable advising women mentees about work-life balance (88.3% vs 63.8%, P = 0.0005). Nonetheless, fewer women considered themselves effective mentors (33.3% vs 52.6%, P = 0.03). More women reported feeling pressured to mentor because of their gender (39.5% vs 0.9% of men, P < 0.0001). Despite no gender differences, one-third of respondents reported negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their ability to mentor and be mentored.

Cholecystectomy lends itself well to a SILS approach. As these procedures have become more widely adapted, it is important to determine the approximate learning curve to decrease two surgical endpoints: (1) time to completion of the procedure; and (2) decreased incidence of conversion. METHODS We prospectively reviewed our series of 50 cholecystectomies done using the SILS approach between May 2008 to September 2008. All cases were performed by two advanced laparoscopic surgeons at a single institution. Data was collected immediately after the case and entered into an Excel database. Cases were performed by insufflating the abdomen with a Veress needle through the umbilicus followed by placement of 5-mm ports at the umbilicus. RESULTS Patient ages ranged between 21 and 82 years with a median age of 45 years. Body mass index (BMI) range was 21 to 42 kg/m with a mean of 30 kg/m. Average length of time for cases was 1 hour 9 minutes with a range between 55 minutes and 120 minutes. The average length of time for the first 25 cases was 80 minutes. When compared with cases 26 to 50 the average length of time was 60 minutes (P<0.05). The conversion rate to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 10%. Conversion was accomplished through the addition of a 5-mm port elsewhere on the abdominal cavity. After the tenth case, the incidence of conversion went down to zero. When conversions were further stratified, they occurred within each individual surgeon's first ten cases. CONCLUSIONS The learning curve for successful consistent completion of SILS cholecystectomy cases appears to be after 25 cases. In addition, conversion rates drop dramatically after the first ten cases.","Feinberg, Elyssa J; Agaba, Emmanuel; Feinberg, Michelle L; Camacho, Diego; Vemulapalli, Pratibha","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",137,31

The first is physiologic alterations, which every physician should be aware of in order to reassure parents. These usually disappear with age and do not require any treatment. Among congenital and inherited conditions, the nail-patella syndrome, with its pathognomonic triangular lunula, should not be missed as recognition of the disease allows early diagnosis of associated pathologies. The most common infection is the periungual wart, whose treatment is delicate. Herpetic whitlow should be distinguished from bacterial whitlow as their therapeutic approaches differ. Dermatologic diseases encompass eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus, lichen striatus, trachyonychia, and parakeratosis pustulosa. Lichen planus, when it presents as in adults, is important to recognize because, if not treated, it may lead to permanent nail loss. Systemic or iatrogenic nail alterations may be severe but are usually not the first clue to the diagnosis. Beau lines on several fingernails are very common in children after temperature crest. Tumors are rare in children. Radiographic examination allows confirmation of the diagnosis of subungual exostosis. Other cases should undergo biopsy. Single-digit longitudinal melanonychia in children is mostly due to nevi. Its management should be tailored on a case-by-case basis.

Seventy-two cases of CTEPH were diagnosed in the National Pulmonary Hypertension Unit (NPHU) in Ireland between 2010 and 2020. This accounted for 6% of all referrals to the unit and translates to an estimated annual incidence of 1.39 per million population (95% confidence interval, 0.33-2.46). The prevalence of diagnosed CTEPH in Ireland in 2020 was estimated at 12.05 per million population (95% CI 9.00-15.10). The average duration of symptoms prior to CTEPH diagnosis was 23 (±22) months. Patients with CTEPH were more likely to be male (n = 40, 56%), older (60 ± 17 years) and have identifiable risk factors for CTEPH (n = 61, 85%) at diagnosis.

Case report A 90-year-old man presented with severe unilateral pneumonia, and despite conventional mechanical ventilation management with use of a single lumen endotracheal tube and high positive endo-expiratory pressure (PEEP), oxygenation and hemodynamics deteriorated. We then performed ILV using a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) and two ventilators, each set at a different respiratory mode. With continuous administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent, the ventilator for the left lung (non-affected lung) was set to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode, whereas the ventilator for the right lung (affected lung) was set to bi-level mode, 1 breath/min, and high PEEP. ILV and the high PEEP applied to the affected lung prevented hyperinflation of the non-affected lung and increased pulmonary blood perfusion on the non-affected side. Thus, ILV immediately improved oxygenation and hemodynamics by correcting ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Discussion Although ECMO is a valid treatment option for patients with severe respiratory failure, it is highly invasive intervention. ILV performed with use of a DLT is less invasive and more useful than ECMO.

Hyperinflammation triggers a hypercoagulable state, also thought to play a key role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Disease severity is linked to age, sex and comorbid conditions, which in turn may be linked to oxidative stress and pre-existing depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). There is increasing evidence that the host genome may determine disease outcome. Since most information pertaining to COVID-19 has thus far been extrapolated from the 'global North', similar studies in African populations are warranted. Many studies are aimed at finding a therapeutic strategy based on scientific rationale.

Proliferation of CAR T-cells after infusion and their persistence have been reported as important factors. Laboratory tools are needed for the monitoring of patients. We developed a vector-based, simple and accurate real-time qPCR to measure axi-cel vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood samples. Primers and probe targeting the 5'LTR region of the gammaretroviral vector (mouse stem cell virus or MSCV) were designed for amplification. To generate standard curves MSCV plasmid was subcultured and quantified using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The method was applied to quantify VCN in blood samples from patients treated with axi-cel. The limit of quantification of the qPCR assay was established at 2.2 copies/μL in DNA eluate. The qPCR method was well correlated with flow cytometry (FC) findings; however, the assay appeared to be more sensitive than FC. The kinetics observed in blood samples from treated patients was in agreement with previously reported findings. In conclusion, we developed a sensitive and accurate qPCR assay for the quantification of transgenic CAR T-cells, which can be a useful additional tool for the monitoring of patients treated with of axi-cel.","Baras, Agathe; Bocket, Laurence; Beauvais, David; Hallaert, Christophe; Varlet, Pauline; Agha, Ibrahim Yakoub; Hober, Didier; Alidjinou, Enagnon Kazali",The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,137,1

However, there are inconsistencies in the current body of evidence regarding the magnitude of the effects of alternative set structures (i.e., cluster sets and rest redistribution) on these acute mechanical, metabolic, and perceptual responses during and after RT. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse current evidence on the differences between traditional and alternative (cluster and rest redistribution) set structures on acute mechanical, metabolic, and perceptual responses during and after RT, and to discuss potential reasons for the disparities noted in the literature. METHODS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and five databases were searched until June 2019. Studies were included when they were written in English and compared at least one acute mechanical, metabolic, or perceptual response between traditional, cluster or traditional and rest redistribution set structures in healthy adults. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were performed where possible. RESULTS Thirty-two studies were included. Pooled results revealed that alternative set structures allowed for greater absolute mean [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.60] and peak velocity (SMD = 0.41), and mean (SMD = 0.33) and peak power (SMD = 0.38) during RT. In addition, alternative set structures were also highly effective at mitigating a decline in velocity and power variables during (SMD = 0.83-1.97) and after RT (SMD = 0.58) as well as reducing lactate accumulation (SMD = 1.61) and perceived exertion (SMD = 0.81). These effects of alternative set structures on velocity and power decline and maintenance during RT were considerably larger than for absolute velocity and power variables. Sub-group analyses controlling for each alternative set structure independently showed that cluster sets were generally more effective than rest redistribution in alleviating mechanical, metabolic, and perceptual markers of fatigue. CONCLUSION Alternative set structures can reduce mechanical fatigue, perceptual exertion, and metabolic stress during and after RT. However, fundamental differences in the amount of total rest time results in cluster sets generally being more effective than rest redistribution in alleviating fatigue-induced changes during RT, which highlights the importance of classifying them independently in research and in practice. Additionally, absolute values (i.e., mean session velocity or power), as well as decline and maintenance of the mechanical outcomes during RT, and residual mechanical fatigue after RT, are all affected differently by alternative set structures, suggesting that these variables may provide distinct information that can inform future training decisions.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to identify factors predicting successful aAVF maturation and to determine positive technical aspects of sPTA. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records and radiological images of 59 patients who had undergone sPTA for non-maturing aAVFs. We analysed images from pre-surgical mapping Doppler ultrasonography, angiography, and angioplasty and follow-up Doppler ultrasonography performed within two weeks after sPTA. We assessed the following factors, for their ability to predict successful aAVF maturation: 1) patient factors (age; sex; co-morbidities; and aAVF age, side and type); 2) vessel factors (cephalic vein diameter and depth, presence of accessory veins, and pre- and postoperative radial artery disease); 3) lesion factors (stenosis number, location and severity); and 4) technical factors (presence of residual stenosis and anatomic success ratio (ASR) on follow-up Doppler ultrasonography). RESULTS The technical and clinical success rates were both 94.9% (56/59); the mean ASR was 0.84. An ASR of ≥ 0.7 and no significant residual stenosis (< 30%) (both P < 0.001) on two-week follow-up Doppler ultrasonography predicted successful aAVF maturation. CONCLUSION For more precise prediction of successful aAVF maturation after sPTA, short-term follow-up Doppler ultrasonography (< 2 weeks) was useful. If the ASR was < 0.7 or if residual stenosis was ≥ 30%, immediate repeat sPTA is recommended.","Jeon, Eui-Yong; Cho, Young Kwon; Cho, Sung Bum; Yoon, Dae Young; Suh, Seong O",Iranian journal of radiology : a quarterly journal published by the Iranian Radiological Society,137,1

These include income, education, employment, culture, language, healthcare access, social support, race, ethnicity, structural racism, discrimination, social support, neighborhood characteristics, and others. SDOH manifest as persistent inequalities in cardiovascular risk factors and disease, and, therefore, contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related morbidity and mortality. This article reviews how SDOH affect CVD risk and the role they play in CVD prevention. RECENT FINDINGS The 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline on the primary prevention of CVD recommends that clinicians evaluate SDOH on an individual basis to inform treatment decisions for CVD prevention efforts. Recent evidence shows that low socioeconomic status, adverse childhood experiences, less social support, reduced health literacy, and limited healthcare access are associated with higher CVD risk and poorer health outcomes. A 2020 AHA statement emphasized the role of structural racism as a fundamental driver of health disparities. The AHA 2030 Impact Goals state a desire to achieve health equity by identifying and removing barriers to healthcare access and quality. SUMMARY SDOH affect CVD prevention efforts. The SDOH that affect cardiovascular risk factors, diseases, and outcomes are complex and intersect. Addressing them can be challenging and will require a multilevel and multidisciplinary approach, involving public health measures, changes in health systems, team-based care, and dismantling of structural racism. More studies are needed to investigate the effect of interventions that improve SDOH and prevent CVD or lower CVD risk.","Mannoh, Ivy; Hussien, Merna; Commodore-Mensah, Yvonne; Michos, Erin D",Current opinion in cardiology,137,1

We show that these models can be utilized to predict glycan immunogenicity and the pathogenicity of bacterial strains, as well as investigate glycan-mediated immune evasion via molecular mimicry. We also develop glycan-alignment methods and use these to analyze virulence-determining glycan motifs in the capsular polysaccharides of bacterial pathogens. These resources enable one to identify and study glycan motifs involved in immunogenicity, pathogenicity, molecular mimicry, and immune evasion, expanding our understanding of host-microbe interactions.","Bojar, Daniel; Powers, Rani K; Camacho, Diogo M; Collins, James J",Cell host & microbe,137,1

A large number of SARS patients experienced large joint arthralgia, although this was, for the most part, not associated with any abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging. The main musculoskeletal complications of SARS were osteonecrosis and reduced bone mass, and these arose not from the disease per se but as a sequel to treatment of SARS with high-dose steroids. SARS patients were almost universally steroid naive with no other known predisposition to osteonecrosis. Prevalence of osteonecrosis in SARS patients treated with steroids ranged from 5% to 58%. Osteonecrosis most commonly affected the proximal femur and femoral condyles and was most strongly related to cumulative steroid dose and duration of steroid therapy. Osteonecrosis risk was <1% in patients receiving <3 g and 13% in patients receiving >3 g cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose. Most osteonecrotic lesions tended to improve with a reduction in lesion volume over a follow-up period of 5 years.

METHODS A 3.7-F scanning fiber angioscope was used in 6 Yorkshire pigs to image branch vessel selection, subintimal dissection, wire snaring, and stent placement. The angioscope was introduced in a coaxial fashion within a standard 6-F guide catheter. A clear field of view was provided using continuous heparinized saline flush through the outer guide catheter. The flush flow rate was manually adjusted to provide clear imaging depending on the diameter of the vessel and local blood flow conditions. RESULTS The scanning fiber angioscope was compatible with off-the-shelf catheters and devices commonly used in peripheral and aortic interventions. Video-rate, high-resolution images were obtained during all the interventions tested and provided information that was complementary to simultaneously acquired fluoroscopy. The scanning fiber angioscope was able to detect subintimal dissection and branch vessel stent coverage with higher resolution than fluoroscopy alone. CONCLUSION Endoluminal imaging with the scanning fiber angioscope is feasible with current endovascular devices and provides additional relevant information that cannot be assessed fluoroscopically.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the ability of leak compensation in acute care ventilators during invasive and noninvasive ventilation (NIV). METHODS Using a lung simulator, the impact of system leaks was compared on 7 ICU ventilators and 1 dedicated NIV ventilator during triggering and cycling at 2 respiratory mechanics (COPD and ARDS models) settings, various modes of ventilation (NIV mode [pressure support ventilation], and invasive mode [pressure support and continuous mandatory ventilation]), and 2 PEEP levels (5 and 10 cm H(2)O). Leak levels used were up to 35-36 L/min in NIV mode and 26-27 L/min in invasive mode. RESULTS Although all of the ventilators were able to synchronize with the simulator at baseline, only 4 of the 8 ventilators synchronized to all leaks in NIV mode, and 2 of the 8 ventilators in invasive mode. The number of breaths to synchronization was higher during increasing than during decreasing leak. In the COPD model, miss-triggering occurred more frequently and required a longer time to stabilize tidal volume than in the ARDS model. The PB840 required fewer breaths to synchronize in both invasive and noninvasive modes, compared with the other ventilators (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Leak compensation in invasive and noninvasive modes has wide variations between ventilators. The PB840 and the V60 were the only ventilators to acclimate to all leaks, but there were differences in performance between these 2 ventilators. It is not clear if these differences have clinical importance.","Oto, Jun; Chenelle, Christopher T; Marchese, Andrew D; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,137,24

In addition to the progression of the disease, these symptoms are aggravated by physical inactivity. Therefore, home confinement due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions could further worsen these symptoms. This study aims to analyze the effect of home confinement on objective and subjective sleep quality, cardiac autonomic control based on heart rate variability (HRV), and health-related quality of life in people with MS. METHODS Actigraphic and subjective sleep quality (Karolinska Sleep Diary, KSD), HRV (Polar-H7), and quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54) were measured before and after 2 months of home confinement in 17 people with MS (7:10 men/women; age: 43.41±10.88 years; body mass index: 24.87±3.31 kg/m2; Expanded Disability Status Scale: 2.85±1.34 a.u.). RESULTS Actigraphic sleep quality (sleep efficiency: ES=1.27, p=0.01, sleep time: ES=0.81, p=0.01) and subjective sleep quality (sleep quality: ES=-0.34, p=0.05), sleep comfort: ES=0.60; p=0.03, ease of falling asleep: ES=0.70; p=0.01, ease of waking up: ES=0.87, p<0.01, and having enough sleep: ES=0.87, p<0.01) significantly decreased after home confinement. No differences were observed in HRV or quality of life variables (p≥0.13). CONCLUSIONS Home confinement has worsened the sleep quality, but not in cardiac autonomic control or quality of life, in people with MS. These data highlight the importance of implementing home physical training programs in this population when situations similar to home confinement occur, thus minimizing the negative effects of physical inactivity and their associated comorbidities.","Luis, Andreu-Caravaca; Domingo, Ramos-Campo; Pedro, Manonelles; Oriol, Abellán-Aynés; H, Chung Linda; Jacobo Á, Rubio-Arias",Physiology & behavior,137,12

Herein we investigate associations between VL and parameters such as severity of symptoms, disposition (admission vs direct discharge), length of hospitalization, and admission to the intensive care unit, length of need for oxygen support and overall survival in a cohort of 205 patients from a tertiary care center in New York City. VL was determined using q-PCR and Log10 transformed for normalization. Univariate and multivariate regression models were used to test these associations. We found that diagnostic viral load is significantly lower in hospitalized patients than in patients not hospitalized (log10 VL = 3.3 vs.4.0; p=0.018) after adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, and comorbidities. Higher VL was associated with shorter duration of the symptoms in all patients and hospitalized patients only and shorter hospital stay (coefficient =-2.02,-2.61, -2.18; p<0.001, p=0.002, p=0.013, respectively). No significant association was noted between VL, admission to ICU, length of oxygen support, and overall survival. Our findings suggest a higher shedding risk in less symptomatic patients; an important consideration for containment strategies in SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we identify a novel association between viral load and history of cancer.

METHODS Persons who presented to the emergency department (ED) or were hospitalized with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms at the academic medical center in Forsyth County, North Carolina were prospectively enrolled and underwent nasal/throat swab testing for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus identified through active surveillance were compared by capture-recapture analysis to those identified through independent, passive surveillance (physician-ordered influenza testing). This approach estimated the number of total cases, including those not captured by either surveillance method. A second analysis estimated the total number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases by multiplying weekly influenza percentages determined via active surveillance by weekly counts of influenza-associated discharge diagnoses from administrative data. Market share adjustments were used to estimate influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1,000 residents. RESULTS Capture-recapture analysis estimated that 753 residents (95% confidence interval [CI], 424-2,735) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were seen in the academic medical center from September 2009 through mid-April 2010; this result yielded an estimated 4.7 (95% CI, 2.6-16.9) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1,000 residents. Similarly, 708 visits were estimated using weekly influenza percentages and influenza-associated discharge diagnoses, yielding an estimated 4.4 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus ED visits or hospitalizations per 1,000 residents. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that the burden of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in ED and inpatient settings by capture-recapture analysis was 4-5 per 1,000 residents; this rate was approximately 8-fold higher than that detected by physician-ordered influenza testing.","Peters, Timothy R; Snively, Beverly M; Suerken, Cynthia K; Bischoff, Werner; Vannoy, Lauren; Blakeney, Elizabeth; Bischoff, Tammy; Palavecino, Elizabeth; Sherertz, Robert; Poehling, Katherine A",North Carolina medical journal,137,7

Hence, local outlier analysis and emerging spatiotemporal hot spot analysis were performed to analyze the spatiotemporal clustering pattern and cold\hot spot trends of COVID-19 cases based on space-time cube during the period from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020. The main findings are as follows. 1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the current totality incidence rate has decreased. 2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases was uneven. In terms of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan city were the center as both cities had high-high clustering pattern with a surrounding unstable multiple type pattern in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing city. Those regions are continuously in the hot spot on the spatiotemporal tendency. 3) The spatiotemporal analysis technology based on the space-time cube can analyze comprehensively the spatiotemporal pattern of epidemiological data and produce a visual output of the consequences, which can reflect intuitively the distribution and trend of data in space-time.

METHODS This experimental study was performed using 42 female Wistar-Albino rats distributed in 6 groups subsequent to transection of right sciatic nerves. Group I underwent external circumferential neurolysis; Group II received suture repair; Group III had local polymeric hydrogel based tissue adhesive administration; Group IV received suture repair and polymeric hydrogel based tissue adhesive application together; Group V had gelatin based tissue adhesive application and Group VI had suture repair and gelatin based tissue adhesive together. After a 6-week follow-up period, biopsies were obtained from site of neural injury and groups were compared with respect to histopathological scoring based on inflammatory, degenerative, necrotic and fibrotic changes. RESULTS There were remarkable differences between control group and study groups with respect to inflammation (p=0.001), degeneration (p=0.002), necrosis (p=0.007), fibrosis (p<0.001) and vascularity (p=0.001). Histopathological scores were similar between study groups and the only noteworthy difference was that Group V displayed a lower score for necrosis and higher score in terms of vascularization. CONCLUSION Our results imply that tissue adhesives can be useful in repair of peripheral nerve injuries by decreasing the surgical trauma and shortening the duration of intervention. Results with gelatin based tissue adhesive are especially promising since more intense vascularity was observed in tissue after application. However, trials on larger series with longer durations of follow-up are essential for reaching more reliable conclusions.","Altun, Idiris; Çıralık, Harun",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,137,1

However, older people have rarely been the focus of studies on colorectal cancer. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to carry out a retrospective analysis of this patient subgroup. Methods A retrospective study of clinical data of patients aged over 80 years who died from colorectal cancer in our hospital between 1993 and 2020 was performed. Logistic regression, the Kaplan-Meier method, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the overall survival and treatment outcomes of the patients. Results A total of 87 patients were included in the study. The overall median survival was 45 months. In most patients, the primary lesion was located in the right colon. One-quarter of the patients refused to accept any treatment. Patients with stage IV tumors, who accounted for the largest proportion of the study population, displayed a higher rate of abandoning treatment than did patients of other stages. Almost all patients with stages II and III accepted surgery. Patients who underwent surgery to treat their colorectal cancer had longer survival than those who did not. Conclusions Old age should not be a reason for giving up treatment for colorectal cancer. The treatment of colorectal cancer patients aged 80 years and above requires individualized evaluation and more aggressive treatment to achieve greater benefits.","Shen, Lei; Meng, Ke; Wang, Yifei; Yu, Xiangli; Wang, Ping; Zhang, Xiaomei",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,137,1

Through this study, we aim to learn more about the dysfunctions and rehabilitation needs of COVID-19 patients. METHODS In this survey, the basic information, dysfunctions, and rehabilitation needs of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who were selected by convenience sampling in Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, were obtained using a self-designed questionnaire. The research was conducted from February 29, 2020 to March 2, 2020. RESULTS A total of 280 patients were finally included, who were mainly over 51 years of age (64.2%). The main physical dysfunctions that the patients had were sleep disorders (63.6%), decreased activity endurance (61.4%), and respiratory dysfunction (57.9%), while the main psychological dysfunctions included anxiety (62.1%) and fear (50.0%). Rehabilitation that mainly requested by the patients included exercise guidance, dietary instruction, traditional Chinese medicine therapy, physical therapy, and Chinese traditional health exercises. CONCLUSIONS The demand for rehabilitation is high among COVID-19 patients, which requires the quick establishment of a comprehensive and individualized rehabilitation program, to be fulfilled.","Li, Zhengliang; Zheng, Chanjuan; Duan, Can; Zhang, Yangpu; Li, Qinglin; Dou, Zulin; Li, Jianan; Xia, Wenguang",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,137,1

The frequency of severe congenital abnormalities after maternal ZIKV infection revealed an unexplained geographic variability, especially between the Northeast and the rest of Brazil. Several reasons for this variability have been discussed. Prior immunity against DENV, that affects ZIKV seems to be the most likely explanation. Here we summarise the current evidence regarding the prominent co-factor to potentially explain the geographic variability. This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted up to May 15th, 2020, focussing on immunological interactions from Zika virus with previous Dengue virus infections as potential teratogenic effect for the foetus. Eight out of 339 screened studies reported on the association between ZIKV, prior Dengue virus infection and microcephaly, mostly focusing on antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) as potential pathomechanism. Prior DENV infection was associated with enhancement for ZIKV infection and increased neurovirulence in one included in vitro study only. Interestingly, the seven in vivo studies exhibited a heterogeneous picture with three studies showing a protective effect of prior DENV infections and others no effect at all. According to several studies, socio-economic factors are associated with increased risk for microcephaly. Very few studies addressed the question of unexplained variability of infection-related microcephaly. Many studies focussed on ADE as mechanism without measuring microcephaly as endpoint. Interestingly, three of the included studies reported a protective effect of prior DENV infection against microcephaly. This systematic review strengthens the hypothesis that immune priming after recent DENV infection is the crucial factor for determining protection or enhancement activity. It is of high importance that the currently ongoing prospective studies include a harmonized assessment of the potential candidate co-factors.","Petzold, Stephanie; Agbaria, Nisreen; Deckert, Andreas; Dambach, Peter; Winkler, Volker; Drexler, Jan Felix; Horstick, Olaf; Jaenisch, Thomas",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,137,1

Biopsy specimens of tumors from the patients enrolled in the JCOG0701 are collected and the association between clinical outcomes and histopathologic features such as expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), p53, and p16 were investigated. METHODS Five slices of undyed slides from biopsy specimens were sent to the National Cancer Center Hospital and all the specimens were assessed for the expression of EpCAM, p53, and p16. The primary objective was to investigate the association between 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and expression of EpCAM, p53, and p16. RESULTS A total of 88 out of 370 patients were enrolled in this ancillary study. The 3-year PFS for tumors with strong expression of EpCAM was 70.6% (95% CI 43.1%-86.6%), while that of tumors without strong expression of EpCAM was 77.5% (95% CI 65.9%-85.5%) with no remarkable difference between groups (P = .67). Likewise, there was no significant difference in 3-year PFS between tumors regardless of p53 or p16 status. However, in a subgroup analysis for 17 patients with a strong expression of EpCAM, AF showed better 3-year PFS than SF (100% vs 54.5%, P = .07). CONCLUSIONS From the current study, it could not be concluded that EpCAM, p16, and p53 were prognostic factors for early-stage glottic cancer after primary radiation therapy. AF might be an appropriate fractionation for tumors with a strong expression of EpCAM.

Within the last decades it was also shown that NMD carries virus-restricting capacities and thus could be considered a part of the cellular antiviral system. As this was shown to affect primarily positive-sense single stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses there is only scarce knowledge if this also applies to negative-sense single stranded RNA ((-)ssRNA) viruses. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) harbor a segmented (-)ssRNA genome. During their replication IAVs produce numerous RNA transcripts and simultaneously impair cellular transcription and translation. The viral mRNAs hold several molecular patterns which can elicit NMD and in turn would lead to their degradation. This, in consequence, may mitigate viral propagation. Thus, we examined if a knockdown or a pharmacological inhibition of NMD key components may influence IAV replication. Additionally, we performed similar experiments with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), another (-)ssRNA virus, but with a non-segmented genome. Although it seemed that a knockdown of up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1), the central NMD factor, slightly increased viral mRNA and protein levels, no significant alteration of viral replication could be observed, implying that the NMD machinery may not have restricting capacities against (-)ssRNA viruses.

Infection prevention and control is an integral part of pediatric practice in ambulatory medical settings as well as in hospitals. Infection prevention and control practices should begin at the time the ambulatory visit is scheduled. All health care personnel should be educated regarding the routes of transmission and techniques used to prevent the transmission of infectious agents. Policies for infection prevention and control should be written, readily available, updated every 2 years, and enforced. Many of the recommendations for infection control and prevention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for hospitalized patients are also applicable in the ambulatory setting. These recommendations include requirements for pediatricians to take precautions to identify and protect employees likely to be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials while on the job. In addition to emphasizing the key principles of infection prevention and control in this policy, we update those that are relevant to the ambulatory care patient. These guidelines emphasize the role of hand hygiene and the implementation of diagnosis- and syndrome-specific isolation precautions, with the exemption of the use of gloves for routine diaper changes and wiping a well child's nose or tears for most patient encounters. Additional topics include respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette strategies for patients with a respiratory tract infection, including those relevant for special populations like patients with cystic fibrosis or those in short-term residential facilities; separation of infected, contagious children from uninfected children when feasible; safe handling and disposal of needles and other sharp medical devices; appropriate use of personal protective equipment, such as gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection; and appropriate use of sterilization, disinfection, and antisepsis. Lastly, in this policy, we emphasize the importance of public health interventions, including vaccination for patients and health care personnel, and outline the responsibilities of the health care provider related to prompt public health notification for specific reportable diseases and communication with colleagues who may be providing subsequent care of an infected patient to optimize the use of isolation precautions and limit the spread of contagions.","Rathore, Mobeen H; Jackson, Mary Anne",Pediatrics,137,1

It is expressed in immune cells and plays important roles in pathogen surveillance and cell-mediated responses to infectious organisms. There is an abundance of literature on the role of P2RX7 in inflammatory diseases and the role of these receptors in host-pathogen interactions. Here, we describe the current knowledge of the role of P2RX7 in the host response to a variety of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. We describe in vitro and in vivo evidence for the critical role these receptors play in mediating and modulating immune responses. Our observations indicate a role for P2X7 signaling in sensing damage-associated molecular patterns released by nearby infected cells to facilitate immunopathology or protection. In this review, we describe how P2RX7 signaling can play critical roles in numerous cells types in response to a diverse array of pathogens in mediating pathogenesis and immunity to infectious agents.","Soare, Alexandra Y; Freeman, Tracey L; Min, Alice K; Malik, Hagerah S; Osota, Elizabeth O; Swartz, Talia H",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,137,24

While they are also applied to tracheostomized patients with spontaneous breathing, their performance in this role has not yet been clarified. We carried out a bench study to investigate the effects of spontaneous breathing parameters and oxygen flow on the humidification performance of 11 HMEs. METHODS We evaluated the humidification provided by 11 HMEs for tracheostomized patients, and also by a system delivering high-flow CPAP, and an oxygen mask with nebulizer heater. Spontaneous breathing was simulated with a mechanical ventilator, lung model, and servo-controlled heated humidifier at tidal volumes of 300, 500, and 700 mL, and breathing frequencies of 10 and 20 breaths/min. Expired gas was warmed to 37°C. The high-flow CPAP system was set to deliver 15, 30, and 45 L/min. With the 8 HMEs that were equipped with ports to deliver oxygen, and with the high-flow CPAP system, measurements were taken when delivering 0 and 3 L/min of dry oxygen. After stabilization we measured the absolute humidity (AH) of inspired gas with a hygrometer. RESULTS AH differed among HMEs applied to tracheostomized patients with spontaneous breathing. For all the HMEs, as tidal volume increased, AH decreased. At 20 breaths/min, AH was higher than at 10 breaths/min. For all the HMEs, when oxygen was delivered, AH decreased to below 30 mg/L. With an oxygen mask and high-flow CPAP, at all settings, AH exceeded 30 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS None of the HMEs provided adequate humidification when supplemental oxygen was added. In the ICU, caution is required when applying HME to tracheostomized patients with spontaneous breathing, especially when supplemental oxygen is required.","Chikata, Yusuke; Oto, Jun; Onodera, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Masaji",Respiratory care,137,1

Herein, targeting multifunctional hydrophilic nanomicelles, AgBiS2@DSPE-PEG2000-FA (ABS-FA), were obtained and employed for tumor treatment. In a cascade amplification mode, ABS-FA exhibited favorable properties of actively enhancing Computed Tomography/Infrared (CT/IR) imaging and gently relieving ambient oxygen concentration by cooperative photothermal and sonodynamic therapy. Compared with traditional Bi2S3 nanoparticles, the CT imaging capability of the probe was augmented (43.21%), and the photothermal conversion efficiency was increased (33.1%). Furthermore, remarkable ultrasonic dynamics features of ABS-FA were observed, with increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (24.3%) being obtained compared to Ce6, a commonly used sonosensitizer. Furthermore, ABS-FA exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on HeLa cell migration at 6 μg/mL, which to some extent demonstrated its suppressive effect on tumor growth. A lower dose, laser and ultrasonic power, and a shorter processing time endowed ABS-FA with excellent photothermal and sonodynamic effects. By mild cascade mode, the hypoxic condition of the tumor site was largely improved, and a suitable oxygen-rich environment was provided, thereby endowing ABS-FA with a superior synergistic enhanced treatment effect compared with the single mode approach, which ultimately realized the purpose of ""one injection, multiple treatment"". Moreover, our data showed that ABS-FA was given with a biological safety profile while harnessed in vivo. Taken together, as a synergistically-enhanced medical diagnosis and treatment method, the One-for-All nanoplatform will pave a new avenue for further clinical applications.","Cheng, Kai; Zhang, Ruo-Yun; Yang, Xiao-Quan; Zhang, Xiao-Shuai; Zhang, Fang; An, Jie; Wang, Zhuo-Ya; Dong, Ying; Liu, Bo; Zhao, Yuan-Di; Liu, Tiancai",ACS applied materials & interfaces,137,23

Despite work highlighting the link between previous epidemics and elevated suicide rates, there is limited research on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 907). Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Further, a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for suicide risk screening and access to mental health services during the current pandemic. Particular attention should be paid to employing public health campaigns to disseminate information on such services to reduce the enormity of distress and emotional impairment associated with COVID-19 in the United States.","Ammerman, Brooke A; Burke, Taylor A; Jacobucci, Ross; McClure, Kenneth",Journal of psychiatric research,137,27

METHODS We reviewed a prospectively collected database of all RNUs performed by a single surgeon (R.A.) since institution of our clinical pathway in 2008 that includes pelvic drain omission, bladder catheter removal the morning after surgery, and discharge on POD#1. Patient demographics, and perioperative and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Ability to adhere to the pathway and achieving the described parameters and whether any resulting complications occurred were determined. RESULTS RNU was performed in 29 patients with mean age and body mass index of 69 years (50-90 years) and 30 kg/m(2) (19-41 kg/m(2)), respectively. No patient required a pelvic drain, and 2 were discharged with a catheter. All but 2 patients (93%) were discharged on POD#1. Overall, successful pathway application was achieved in 26 of 29 patients (90%) including no drain, catheter removal on the morning after surgery, and discharge on POD#1. No patient developed urine leak or other complications related to early catheter removal. CONCLUSION Our clinical pathway after RNU allows safe omission of a pelvic drain with early discontinuation of the bladder catheter and discharge on the POD#1 in most patients. To our knowledge, similar pathways have not been previously achieved with nephroureterectomy by any approach, but should be considered by surgeons treating urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract.","Khemees, Tariq A; Nasser, Samiha M; Abaza, Ronney",Urology,137,1

Vitamin-K antagonists have a number of well documented shortcomings. Recently the results of randomised trials for three new oral anticoagulants that do not exhibit the limitations of vitamin-K antagonists have been published. These include direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran). The studies (RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE, AVERROES) provide promising results for the new agents, including higher efficacy and a significantly lower incidence of intracranial bleeds compared with warfarin or aspirin. The new drugs show similar results in secondary as well as in primary stroke prevention in patients with AF. Apixaban was demonstrated to be clearly superior to aspirin and had the same rate of major bleeding complications. Meta-analyses show that the novel anticoagulants are superior to warfarin for the reduction of stroke, major bleeding and intracranial bleeds. New anticoagulants add to the therapeutic options for patients with AF, and offer a number of advantages over warfarin, for both the clinician and patient, including a favorable bleeding profile and convenience of use. Aspirin is no longer an option in secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Consideration of these new anticoagulants will improve clinical decision making.","Diener, H C; Easton, J D; Hankey, G J; Hart, R G",Best practice & research. Clinical haematology,137,16

In infected cells, nsp1 engages in a multi-pronged mechanism to inhibit host gene expression by binding to the 40S ribosome to block the assembly of translationally competent ribosome, and then inducing endonucleolytic cleavage and the degradation of host mRNAs. Here, we report a previously undetected mechanism by which nsp1 exploits the nuclear pore complex and disrupts nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of biomolecules. We identified members of the nuclear pore complex from nsp1-associated protein assembly and found that expression of nsp1 in HEK cells disrupts Nup93 localization around the nuclear envelope without triggering proteolytic degradation, while the nuclear lamina remains unperturbed. Consistent with its role in host shutoff, nsp1 alters the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of a RNA binding protein, nucleolin. Our results suggest that nsp1, alone, can regulate multiple steps of gene expression including nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.","Gomez, Garret N; Abrar, Fareeha; Dodhia, Maya P; Gonzalez, Fabiola G; Nag, Anita",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,137,1

Changes required of providers were substantial and could lead to increased burnout and, subsequently, increased turnover intentions. This study examined burnout experienced by mental health services providers in the context of COVID-19 and through the lens of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model. We examined the effects of work changes on burnout and subsequent turnover intentions, and how job and personal resources may have buffered the extent to which work changes due to COVID-19 impacted burnout. Methods: Service providers (n = 93) from six community mental health centers (CMHCs) in one Midwestern state in the United States completed surveys as part of service contracts to implement evidence-based practices. Path analysis tested the unconditional indirect relations between work changes and turnover intentions through burnout. Moderated mediation determined whether the indirect effect of work changes on turnover intentions via burnout varied in strength by job and personal resources. Results: Work changes had a significant indirect effect on turnover intentions through burnout ( β ^ = .140, 95% CI = .072, .217). This indirect effect varied as a function of two job resources, organizational trust and perceived organizational support. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Burnout was relatively low only when work changes were low and job resources levels high. When work changes were high, burnout was similarly high across levels of job resources. To minimize burnout, organizations should limit task, setting, and team-related work changes to the extent possible.

We developed a novel data-independent acquisition (DIA)/ MS-based workflow for high-throughput, in-depth and estimated absolute quantification of plasma proteins (termed HIAP-DIA), without depleting high-abundant proteins, in a single-shot experiment. In HIAP-DIA workflow, we generated an ultra-deep cumulative undepleted and depleted spectral library which contained 55157 peptides and 5328 proteins, optimized column length (50 cm) and gradient (90 min) of liquid chromatography instrumentation, optimized 50 DIA segments with average isolation window 17 Da, and selected reference proteins for estimated absolute quantification of all plasma proteins. 606 proteins were quantified in triplicate, and 427 proteins were quantified with coefficient of variation <20% in plasma proteome. R-squared value of overlapped 208 endogenous PQ500 estimated protein amounts from HIAP-DIA and absolute quantification with internal standards was 0.82, indicating high quantification accuracy of HIAP-DIA. As a pilot study, the HIAP-DIA approach described here was applied to a myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) disease cohort. We achieved absolute quantification of 789 plasma proteins in 22 clinical plasma samples, spanning >6 orders of magnitude with quantification limit 10-20 ng/ml, and discovered 95 differentially expressed proteins providing insights into MDS pathophysiology.

Evidence that ACE2 is an important regulator of hypertensive cardiac remodeling in humans has not been addressed directly yet. METHODS A total of 161 patients with essential hypertension and 47 age- and sex-matched normotensive healthy subjects were consecutively recruited. Serum concentration levels of ACE2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cardiac structural and functional parameters were measured by echocardiography. RESULTS Serum ACE2 concentrations were higher in hypertensive patients compared to healthy subjects (170.31 [83.50-707.12] pg/ml in patients versus 59.28 [39.71-81.81] pg/ml in healthy subjects, P<0.001). After adjustment for confounders, including age, sex, body mass index, snoring, smoking, duration of hypertension, comorbidities, medication use, mean arterial pressure and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, serum ACE2 concentrations were positively correlated with left atrial diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients. Moreover, multiple regression analyses adjusting for covariates revealed that serum ACE2 concentrations were also independently associated with left ventricular ejection fraction and late diastolic filling velocities of the mitral inflow. CONCLUSIONS This study reveals an elevated serum concentration of ACE2 and independent associations between serum ACE2 and echocardiographic parameters in hypertensive patients.","Li, Shichao; Wang, Zhijun; Yang, Xiuhong; Hu, Bo; Huang, Yuling; Fan, Sujing",Peptides,137,1

This study aims to ascertain physician practices and patients' experiences regarding delivery of bad news. METHODS An online, anonymous questionnaire was sent to 400 ophthalmologists practising glaucoma to gather information as to how they deliver bad news to their patients. A parallel survey was also conducted amongst 100 established glaucoma patients to know whether how their doctor had delivered the diagnosis of glaucoma to them. After this, resident doctors were trained in SPIKES strategy and the patient survey was repeated in 100 new patients. RESULTS Two hundred and eighteen out of 400 ophthalmologists responded to our survey resulting in a survey yield of 54.5%. About 56.5% ophthalmologists dealt with disclosing the diagnosis >20 times a month; 70% of responders always discussed about the true severity of disease up-front. Only 8.70% respondents had formal training for breaking the bad news. Results of first phase of patient survey revealed that nearly one-third of patients (27%), felt that their doctor used incomprehensible medical terminology and 42% patients said that their doctor downplayed their diagnosis. Only 12% provided information to their patients about reliable sources to gather additional information. After the resident doctors were trained in SPIKES strategy, the second phase of patient survey had marked positive change in the way information was delivered. CONCLUSION The current study shows that despite years of clinical experience, many ophthalmologists face difficulty in delivering bad news for a sight threatening disease such as glaucoma. Therefore, SPIKES strategy or a similar protocol must be taught to practising ophthalmologists at all levels, to alleviate worries of patients suffering from chronic, visually debilitating diseases.","Ichhpujani, Parul; Kalra, Gagan; Singla, Ekta; Kumar, Suresh",International ophthalmology,137,1

Methods: Thirty-four COVID-19 patients diagnosed with RT-PCR in the isolation ward of the Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui autonomous region (infectious diseases hospital) from the January 22 to February 4, 2020 were selected as the research subjects. The clinical data were collected. Excel was used to describe the relationship between clinical classification and age distribution, contact history and date of onset. SPSS 25.0 statistical software was used for analysis. The general information, clinical symptoms, blood test, virus nucleic acid test results, epidemiology, CT imaging, treatment and prognosis were analyzed. Results: There were 5 mild cases (5/34), 24 ordinary cases (24/34), 5 severe cases (5/34). The elderly was more common in severe patients. The main clinical symptoms were fever (27/34)and dry cough(26/34). The peripheral blood showed normal or decreased leukocyte count (33/34), decreased lymphocyte count (12/34). The increase of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer was related to the severity of the disease. Some patients had mild liver and kidney damage. Six patients were diagnosed through 3 or more times of nucleic acid tests. Sixteen cases had Wuhan related history,13 cases were close contacts, 5 cases had no confirmed route. The clustered infections were found in 6 families. In typical cases, CT showed single or multiple patchy ground glass shadow with thickening of interlobular septum. In severe cases, diffuse lesions of both lungs were found, with ground glass shadow, consolidation shadow and strip shadow coexisting. Thirty-four patients were treated with interferon-α and Lopinavir/Ritonavir with good prognosis. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were similar to that of general viral pneumonia but with strong infectivity. Close contact and family aggregation caused disease outbreaks. COVID-19 could not be excluded if two nucleic acid tests were negative and high-resolution CT was helpful for differential diagnosis.

This review aims to appraise and summarise evidence relating to PGD in older adults (≥65 years), a growing population group, most likely to experience bereavement and often assumed to cope well. METHOD Literature from Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science was searched. Epidemiological and non-epidemiological studies including data on frequency of PGD in older adults bereaved by mainly natural causes were included and a descriptive analysis undertaken. RESULTS From 2059 records, three epidemiological and six non-epidemiological studies were included. Most studies had good internal but not external validity. Conditional prevalence for PGD ranged between 3.2% and 48.8%. Heterogeneity in sample characteristics and study methodology contributed to this variability resulting in a descriptive analysis. The prevalence rate of 9.1% by Kersting et al was the best available estimate for PGD in older adults for western countries. The small number of epidemiological studies and the use of varying PGD-constructs which did not match International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria were the main limiting factors. CONCLUSION This first review on PGD prevalence in older adults suggests that, despite studies' methodological short comings, a similar proportion of older adults experience PGD as the general bereaved adult population (1:10). With older adults forming the largest subgroup among the bereaved, health and social care systems need to adapt their provision of care to address the specific needs of older adults.","Thiemann, Pia; Street, Anna Naomi; Heath, Sarah Eleanor; Quince, Thelma; Kuhn, Isla; Barclay, Stephen",BMJ supportive & palliative care,137,26

However, no selective inhibitors are available for a multitude of medically important viruses, most of which are (re-)emerging RNA viruses. As it is impossible to develop drugs against each of these viruses, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAA) are a prime strategy to cope with this challenge. RECENT FINDINGS We propose four categories of antiviral molecules that hold promise as BSAA. Several nucleoside analogues with broad antiviral activity have been described and given the relatively conserved nature of viral polymerases, it may be possible to develop more broad-spectrum nucleoside analogues. A number of viral proteins are relatively conserved between families and may also be interesting targets. Host-targeting antiviral drugs such as modulators of lipid metabolism and cyclophilin inhibitors can be explored as well. Finally, the potent and broad antiviral function of the immune system can be exploited by the development of immune-modulating BSAA. SUMMARY Despite the recent advances, the BSAA field is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, the discovery and development of such molecules will be a key aim of antiviral research in the coming decades.","Debing, Yannick; Neyts, Johan; Delang, Leen",Current opinion in infectious diseases,137,16

Objective To compare adolescents' substance use and physical activity behaviors before and after stay-at-home restrictions. Design, Setting, and Participants Ongoing prospective cohort study of tobacco use behaviors among ninth- and tenth-grade students enrolled at 8 public high schools in Northern California from March 2019 to February 2020 and followed up from September 2019 to September 2020. Race/ethnicity was self-classified from investigator-provided categories and collected owing to racial/ethnic differences in tobacco and substance use. Exposures In California, a COVID-19 statewide stay-at-home order was imposed March 19, 2020. In this study, 521 six-month follow-up responses were completed before the order and 485 were completed after the order. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of substance use (ie, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes, other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol) and physical activity (active ≥5 days/week) was compared at baseline and follow-up. A difference-in-difference approach was used to assess whether changes from baseline to 6-month follow-up varied if follow-up occurred after the stay-at-home order, adjusting for baseline behaviors and characteristics. All models were weighted for losses to follow-up using the inverse probability method. Weights were derived from a logistic regression model for having a follow-up response (dependent variable), as predicted by baseline characteristics and behaviors. Results Of 1423 adolescents enrolled at baseline, 1006 completed 6-month follow-up (623 [62%] were female, and 492 [49%] were non-Hispanic White). e-Cigarette use declined from baseline to 6-month follow-up completed before the stay-at-home order (17.3% [89 of 515] to 11.3% [58 of 515]; McNemar χ2 = 13.54; exact P < .001) and 6-month follow-up completed after the stay-at-home order (19.9% [96 of 482] to 10.8% [52 of 482]; McNemar χ2 = 26.16; exact P < .001), but the extent of decline did not differ statistically between groups responding before vs after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.47-1.52; P = .58). In contrast, being physically active was unchanged from baseline if follow-up was before the order (53.7% [279 of 520] to 52.9% [275 of 520]; McNemar χ2 = 0.09; exact P = .82) but declined sharply from baseline if follow-up was after the order (54.0% [261 of 483] to 38.1% [184 of 483]; McNemar χ2 = 30.72; exact P < .001), indicating a pronounced difference in change from baseline after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69; P < .001). Overall in the cohort, reported use of other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol did not differ meaningfully before and after the order. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort, a reduction in e-cigarette use occurred independently of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but persistent cannabis and alcohol use suggest continued need for youth substance use prevention and cessation support. Declining physical activity during the pandemic is a health concern.","Chaffee, Benjamin W; Cheng, Jing; Couch, Elizabeth T; Hoeft, Kristin S; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie",JAMA pediatrics,137,1

Besides mRNA and adenoviral vector vaccines, effective protein-based vaccines are needed for immunization against current and emerging variants. We have developed a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, a robust production platform known for its scalability, low cost, and safety. Baculoviruses were constructed encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins: full-length S, stabilized secreted S, or the S1 domain. Since subunit S only partially protected mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenge, we produced S1 for conjugation to bacteriophage AP205 VLP nanoparticles using tag/catcher technology. The S1 yield in an insect-cell bioreactor was ∼11 mg/liter, and authentic protein folding, efficient glycosylation, partial trimerization, and ACE2 receptor binding was confirmed. Prime-boost immunization of mice with 0.5 μg S1-VLPs showed potent neutralizing antibody responses against Wuhan and UK/B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variants. This two-component nanoparticle vaccine can now be further developed to help alleviate the burden of COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Vaccination is essential to reduce disease severity and limit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Protein-based vaccines are useful to vaccinate the world population and to boost immunity against emerging variants. Their safety profiles, production costs, and vaccine storage temperatures are advantageous compared to mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines. Here, we use the versatile and scalable baculovirus expression vector system to generate a two-component nanoparticle vaccine to induce potent neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These nanoparticle vaccines can be quickly adapted as boosters by simply updating the antigen component.","van Oosten, Linda; Altenburg, Jort J; Fougeroux, Cyrielle; Geertsema, Corinne; van den End, Fred; Evers, Wendy A C; Westphal, Adrie H; Lindhoud, Simon; van den Berg, Willy; Swarts, Daan C; Deurhof, Laurens; Suhrbier, Andreas; Le, Thuy T; Torres Morales, Shessy; Myeni, Sebenzile K; Kikkert, Marjolein; Sander, Adam F; de Jongh, Willem Adriaan; Dagil, Robert; Nielsen, Morten A; Salanti, Ali; Søgaard, Max; Keijzer, Timo M P; Weijers, Dolf; Eppink, Michel H M; Wijffels, René H; van Oers, Monique M; Martens, Dirk E; Pijlman, Gorben P",mBio,137,29

At the same time, economic strain may operate as a risk factor for a wide range of undesired mental and physical health outcomes in Black communities. Aim The current study investigated the combined effects of education and economic strain on the following five health outcomes in Black older adults in underserved areas of South Los Angeles: depressive symptoms, number of chronic diseases, pain intensity, self-rated health, and sick days. Methods This cross-sectional study included 619 Black older adults residing in South Los Angeles. Data on demographic factors (age and gender), socioeconomic characteristics, economic strain, health insurance, living arrangement, marital status, health behaviors, depressive symptoms, pain intensity, number of chronic diseases, sick days, and self-rated health were collected. Five linear regressions were used to analyze the data. Results Although high education was associated with less economic strain, it was the economic strain, not educational attainment, which was universally associated with depressive symptoms, pain intensity, self-rated health, chronic diseases, and sick days, independent of covariates. Similar patterns emerged for all health outcomes suggesting that the risk associated with economic strain and lack of health gain due to educational attainment are both robust and independent of type of health outcome. Conclusion In economically constrained urban environments, economic strain is a more salient social determinant of health of Black older adults than educational attainment. While education loses some of its protective effects, economic strain deteriorates health of Black population across domains. There is a need for bold economic and social policies that increase access of Black communities to cash at times of emergency. There is also a need to improve the education quality in the Black communities.","Assari, Shervin; Cobb, Sharon; Saqib, Mohammed; Bazargan, Mohsen",Journal of mental health & clinical psychology,137,1

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of the routine use of transcystic choledochoscopy following IOC (dual common bile duct examination: DCBDE), which may improve the diagnostic accuracy of CBD stones and facilitate one-stage clearance, in LC for suspected choledocholithiasis. METHODS Between May 2017 and November 2018, 38 patients with suspected choledocholithiasis were prospectively enrolled in this study, regardless of whether they underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy. Transcystic choledochoscopy was routinely attempted following IOC in LC. RESULTS Five cases were excluded due to cholecystitis, bile duct anomaly, or liver cirrhosis. DCBDE was performed in the remaining 33 patients. The biliary tree was delineated by IOC in all patients. Subsequently, choledochosope was performed in 32 patients except for one who was found to have pancreaticobiliary malunion in IOC. The scope was successfully passed into the CBD in 25 (78.1%) patients. Choledochoscopy detected 3 (9.4%) cases of cystic duct stones and 4 (12.5%) cases of CBD stones which were not identified by IOC. All those stones were removed via cystic duct. There were no intra- and postoperative complications, except for two cases of wound infection and one case of a transient increase in serum amylase. CONCLUSIONS DCBDE in LC is a safe and promising approach for intraoperative diagnosis and one-stage treatment of suspected choledocholithasis.","Matsumura, Tatsuki; Komatsu, Shunichiro; Komaya, Kenichi; Fukami, Yasuyuki; Arikawa, Takashi; Saito, Takuya; Osawa, Takaaki; Kurahashi, Shintaro; Uchino, Tairin; Kato, Shoko; Toda, Yoko; Kaneko, Kenitiro; Sano, Tsuyoshi",Surgical endoscopy,137,15

METHODS All patients aged 80 years or older who underwent surgery between January 2000 and December 2013 at a high-level heart center were included in the study. The in-hospital data of study patients were obtained from the electronic database and from the hospital files. Survival data were analyzed as a long-term outcome. RESULTS A total of 245 patients aged 80-93 years were evaluated in the study. The patients were followed up 5.4±3.7 years after open-heart surgery. In-hospital mortality rates were 10% in elective cases and 15.1% overall. Age ≥85 years, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emergency surgery were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The median survival time was found to be 4.4±0.3 years for all participants. The long-term survival of patients who underwent emergency cardiac surgery was significantly lower than that of elective patients (log-rank <0.001). CONCLUSION Octogenarians have satisfactory long-term outcomes after open-heart surgery when operated electively. On the other hand, patients operated under emergency conditions have worse inhospital outcomes and long-term follow-up results.","Aksüt, Mehmet; Günay, Deniz; Özer, Tanıl; Yerlikhan, Özge Altaş; Selçuk, Emre; Kırali, Mehmet Kaan",Brazilian journal of cardiovascular surgery,137,12

OBJECTIVE The study aims to pilot test the efficacy of a single-session videoconference-delivered empowered relief (ER) intervention compared to waitlist control (WLC) conditions among individuals with chronic pain. We hypothesized that ER would be superior to WLC in reducing pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, and other pain-related outcomes at 1-3 months posttreatment. METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving a web-based sample of adults (N=104) aged 18-80 years with self-reported chronic pain. Participants were randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 unblinded study groups: ER (50/104, 48.1%) and WLC (54/104, 51.9%). Participants allocated to ER completed a Zoom-delivered class, and all participants completed follow-up surveys at 2 weeks and 1, 2, and 3 months posttreatment. All the study procedures were performed remotely and electronically. The primary outcome was pain catastrophizing 1-month posttreatment, with pain intensity, pain bothersomeness, and sleep disruption as secondary outcomes. We also report a more rigorous test of the durability of treatment effects at 3 months posttreatment. Data were collected from September 2020 to February 2021 and analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis. The analytic data set included participants (18/101, 17.8% clinic patients; 83/101, 82.1% community) who completed at least one study survey: ER (50/101, 49.5%) and WLC (51/104, 49%). RESULTS Participants (N=101) were 69.3% (70/101) female, with a mean age of 49.76 years (SD 13.90; range 24-78); 32.7% (33/101) had an undergraduate degree and self-reported chronic pain for 3 months. Participants reported high engagement (47/50, 94%), high satisfaction with ER (mean 8.26, SD 1.57; range 0-10), and high satisfaction with the Zoom platform (46/50, 92%). For the between-groups factor, ER was superior to WLC for all primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months posttreatment (highest P<.001), and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.45 to 0.79, indicating that the superiority was of moderate to substantial clinical importance. At 3 months, clinically meaningful pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) reductions were found for ER but not for WLC (ER: PCS -8.72, 42.25% reduction; WLC: PCS -2.25, 11.13% reduction). ER resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity, sleep disturbance, and clinical improvements in pain bothersomeness. CONCLUSIONS Zoom-delivered ER had high participant satisfaction and very high engagement. Among adults with chronic pain, this single-session, Zoom-delivered, skills-based pain class resulted in clinically significant improvement across a range of pain-related outcomes that was sustained at 3 months. Web-based delivery of ER could allow greater accessibility of home-based pain treatment and could address the inconveniences and barriers faced by patients when attempting to receive in-person care.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the well- -being of the seafarers during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and their evaluation of the precautions taken by the shipping companies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventy-two seafarers completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12) with three extra questions on how the COVID-19 precautions were taken on board. RESULTS The mean Likert score was 13.9 for the whole sample, corresponding to ""no problems"" while a subgroup of 40% had mean Likert sum scores of 16.1 (level 15-23) corresponding to ""starting problems."" In response to the extra items, 50% of the seafarers did not feel safe doing their job in relation to the epidemic and 60% did not think everything has been done to ensure their health at work in relation to the epidemic. Thirty per cent suffered of insomnia to the extent of becoming concerned and 26% had been unhappy and depressed during the latest tours of duty. CONCLUSIONS The hypothesis that excess work-related stress has been put on the seafarers in this specific situation was confirmed and calls for prevention.

Information on COVID-19-related hyponatremia is partially conflicting, whereas data on hypernatremia in this context are scarce. We assessed, in a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients: the prevalence of sodium alterations at admission and throughout their hospitalization; their association with inflammation/organ damage indexes; their short-term prognostic impact. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS 117 patients (81 males, 64±13 years) hospitalized for COVID-19 between 1st March and 30th April 2020 were retrospectively followed-up for their first 21 days of stay by collecting all serum sodium measurements, basal CRP and serum lactate levels, maximum IL-6 and information on care setting, required ventilation, length of hospitalization, in-hospital death. RESULTS At admission, 26.5% patients had hyponatremia, 6.8% had hypernatremia. During their hospitalization, 13.7% patients experienced both disorders (""mixed dysnatremia""). Lower sodium levels at admission were correlated with higher CRP (p=0.039) and serum lactate levels (p= 0.019), but not IL-6. Hypernatremia and a wider sodium variability were associated to maximum required ventilation, need of ICU assistance and duration of the hospitalization. Mean estimated time to ICU admission was 20 days shorter in patients exposed to sodium alterations at any time of their hospital course (Log-Rank test p=0.032). CONCLUSIONS Sodium alterations frequently affect hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hyponatremia could indicate pulmonary involvement, whereas hypernatremia is associated to prolonged hospitalization and need for intensive care/mechanical ventilation, particularly when resulting from prior hyponatremia. Optimizing in-hospital sodium balance is crucial to improve patients' prognosis.","Martino, Marianna; Falcioni, Paolo; Giancola, Giulia; Ciarloni, Alessandro; Salvio, Gianmaria; Silvetti, Francesca; Taccaliti, Augusto; Arnaldi, Giorgio",Endocrine connections,137,27

We hypothesized that patient preparedness would be equivalent after preoperative counseling phone calls versus preoperative counseling office visits before prolapse surgery. METHODS This was an equivalence randomized controlled trial of women undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery. Participants were randomized to receive standardized counseling via a preoperative phone call or office visit. The primary outcome was patient preparedness measured on a 5-point Likert scale by the Patient Preparedness Questionnaire at the postoperative visit. A predetermined equivalence margin of 20% was used. Two 1-sided tests for equivalence were used for the primary outcome. RESULTS We randomized 120 women. The study was concluded early because of COVID-19 and subsequent surgery cancellations. There were 85 participants with primary outcome data (43 offices, 42 phones). Mean age was 62.0 years (±1.0) and 64 (75.3%) had stage III or stage IV prolapse. The primary outcome, patient preparedness measured at the postoperative visit, was equivalent between groups (office, n = 43 [97.7%]; phone, n = 42 [97.6%], P < 0.001). Most women reported they would have preferred a phone call (n = 66, 65.5%) with more women in the phone group expressing this preference than the office group (office 40.5% vs phone 90.5%, P < 0.001). Ultimately, nearly all women (96.5%) were satisfied with their method of counseling. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative counseling phone calls were equivalent to office visits for patient preparedness for pelvic organ prolapse surgery. This study demonstrates patient acceptance of phone calls for preoperative counseling. Telehealth modalities should be considered as an option for preoperative patient counseling.","Sassani, Jessica C; Grosse, Philip J; Kunkle, Lauren; Baranski, Lindsey; Ackenbom, Mary F",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,137,1

Human IFIT1 binds to cap0 (m7GpppN) RNA, which lacks methylation on the first and second cap-proximal nucleotides (cap1, m7GpppNm, and cap2, m7GpppNmNm, respectively). These modifications are signatures of ""self"" in higher eukaryotes, whereas unmodified cap0-RNA is recognized as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell. IFIT1 inhibits translation at the initiation stage by competing with the cap-binding initiation factor complex, eIF4F, restricting infection by certain viruses that possess ""nonself"" cap0-mRNAs. However, in mice and other rodents, the IFIT1 orthologue has been lost, and the closely related Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c. Although murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA-binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown. Here, we found that Ifit1b preferentially binds to cap1-RNA, whereas binding is much weaker to cap0- and cap2-RNA. In murine cells, we show that Ifit1b can modulate host translation and restrict WT mouse coronavirus infection. We found that Ifit1c acts as a stimulatory cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their translation inhibition. In this way, Ifit1c acts in an analogous fashion to human IFIT3, which is a cofactor to human IFIT1. This work clarifies similarities and differences between the human and murine IFIT families to facilitate better design and interpretation of mouse models of human infection and sheds light on the evolutionary plasticity of the IFIT family.","Mears, Harriet V; Sweeney, Trevor R",The Journal of biological chemistry,137,1

States dashboards, however, reflect idiosyncratic design practices based on their content, function, and visual design and platform. There has been little guidance for what state dashboards should look like or contain, leading to significant variation. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of our study was to catalog how information, system function, and user interface were deployed across the COVID-19 state dashboards. Our secondary objective was to group and characterize the dashboards based on the information we collected using clustering analysis. METHODS For preliminary data collection, we developed a framework to first analyze two dashboards as a group and reach agreement on coding. We subsequently doubled coded the remaining 48 dashboards using the framework and reviewed the coding to reach total consensus. RESULTS All state dashboards included maps and graphs, most frequently line charts, bar charts, and histograms. The most represented metrics were total deaths, total cases, new cases, laboratory tests, and hospitalization. Decisions on how metrics were aggregated and stratified greatly varied across dashboards. Overall, the dashboards were very interactive with 96% having at least some functionality including tooltips, zooming, or exporting capabilities. For visual design and platform, we noted that the software was dominated by a few major organizations. Our cluster analysis yielded a six-cluster solution, and each cluster provided additional insights about how groups of states engaged in specific practices in dashboard design. CONCLUSION Our study indicates that states engaged in dashboard practices that generally aligned with many of the goals set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Essential Public Health Services. We highlight areas where states fall short of these expectations and provide specific design recommendations to address these gaps.","Fareed, Naleef; Swoboda, Christine M; Chen, Sarah; Potter, Evelyn; Wu, Danny T Y; Sieck, Cynthia J",Applied clinical informatics,137,7

The Zambian urban adherence club (AC) is a health service innovation designed to improve on-time drug pickup and retention in HIV care through off-hours facility access and pharmacist-led group drug distribution. Similar models of differentiated service delivery (DSD) have shown promise in South Africa, but observational analyses of these models are prone to bias and confounding. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of ACs in Zambia using a more rigorous study design. METHODS AND FINDINGS Using a matched-pair cluster randomized study design (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02776254), 10 clinics were randomized to intervention (5 clinics) or control (5 clinics). At each clinic, between May 19 and October 27, 2016, a systematic random sample was assessed for eligibility (HIV+, age ≥ 14 years, on ART >6 months, not acutely ill, CD4 count not <200 cells/mm3) and willingness to participate in an AC. Clinical and antiretroviral drug pickup data were obtained through the existing electronic medical record. AC meeting attendance data were collected at intervention facilities prospectively through October 28, 2017. The primary outcome was time to first late drug pickup (>7 days late). Intervention effect was estimated using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox proportional hazards model to derive an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR). Medication possession ratio (MPR) and implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity) were additionally evaluated as secondary outcomes. Baseline characteristics were similar between 571 intervention and 489 control participants with respect to median age (42 versus 41 years), sex (62% versus 66% female), median time since ART initiation (4.8 versus 5.0 years), median CD4 count at study enrollment (506 versus 533 cells/mm3), and baseline retention (53% versus 55% with at least 1 late drug pickup in previous 12 months). The rate of late drug pickup was lower in intervention participants compared to control participants (aHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.45, p < 0.001). Median MPR was 100% in intervention participants compared to 96% in control participants (p < 0.001). Although 18% (683/3,734) of AC group meeting visits were missed, on-time drug pickup (within 7 days) still occurred in 51% (350/683) of these missed visits through alternate means (use of buddy pickup or early return to the facility). Qualitative evaluation suggests that the intervention was acceptable to both patients and providers. While patients embraced the convenience and patient-centeredness of the model, preference for traditional adherence counseling and need for greater human resources influenced intervention appropriateness and feasibility from the provider perspective. The main limitations of this study were the small number of clusters, lack of viral load data, and relatively short follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS ACs were found to be an effective model of service delivery for reducing late ART drug pickup among HIV-infected adults in Zambia. Drug pickup outside of group meetings was relatively common and underscores the need for DSD models to be flexible and patient-centered if they are to be effective.

These enticing pluripotent stem cells (comprising both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells) have been successfully used to generate a wide array of hematopoietic cells in vitro, from primitive hematoendothelial precursors to mature myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lineage cells. However, to date, PSC-derived cells have demonstrated only limited potential for long-term multilineage hematopoietic engraftment in vivo - the test by which putative HSCs are defined. Successful generation and characterization of HSCs from hPSCs not only requires an efficient in vitro differentiation system that provides insight into the developmental fate of hPSC-derived cells, but also necessitates an in vivo engraftment model that allows identification of specific mechanisms that hinder or promote hematopoietic engraftment. In this chapter, we will describe a method that utilizes firefly luciferase-expressing hPSCs and bioluminescent imaging to noninvasively track the survival, proliferation, and migration of transplanted hPSC-derived cells. Combined with lineage and functional analyses of engrafted cells, this system is a useful tool to gain insight into the in vivo potential of hematopoietic cells generated from hPSCs.","Hexum, Melinda K; Tian, Xinghui; Kaufman, Dan S",Methods in molecular biology,137,31

METHODS Records of all distal pancreatectomies carried out from January 2009 to June 2013 were reviewed and stratified according to operative complexity. Patient factors and outcomes were recorded. Total variable costs (TVCs) were tabulated for each patient, and stratified by category [e.g. 'floor', 'operating room' (OR), 'radiology']. Costs for index admissions and 30-day readmissions were compared between LDP and ODP groups. RESULTS Of 153 procedures, 115 (70 LDP, 45 ODP) were selected for analysis. The TVC of the index admission was US$3420 less per patient in the LDP group (US$10 480 versus US$13 900; P = 0.06). Although OR costs were significantly greater in the LDP cohort (US$5756 versus US$4900; P = 0.02), the shorter average hospitalization in the LDP group (5.2 days versus 7.7 days; P = 0.01) resulted in a lower overall cost. The total cost of index hospitalization combined with readmission was significantly lower in the LDP cohort (US$11 106 versus US$14 803; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In appropriately selected patients, LDP is more cost-effective than ODP. The increased OR cost associated with LDP is offset by the shorter hospitalization. These data clarify targets for further cost reductions.","Rutz, Daniel R; Squires, Malcolm H; Maithel, Shishir K; Sarmiento, Juan M; Etra, Joanna W; Perez, Sebastian D; Knechtle, William; Cardona, Kenneth; Russell, Maria C; Staley, Charles A; Sweeney, John F; Kooby, David A",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,137,1

Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations are non-reassuring fetal heart rate characteristics, which do not uniformly predict poor fetal outcome but can prompt obstetricians to proceed with cesarean delivery. The objective of this manuscript is to identify a strategy to reduce the primary cesarean section rate in patients with prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations in labor. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study over a 5-year period at an academic medical center, including patients undergoing primary cesarean section following labor induction, augmentation, or spontaneous labor who were noted to have prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration(s) in the 1 h prior to the time of delivery. Two groups were compared: ""crash"" cesarean sections versus ""emergent"" cesarean sections. The primary outcome was if fetal heart tones were rechecked in the operating room prior to cesarean section incision. Secondary outcomes included maternal-fetal monitoring versus Doppler fetal heart tones in the operating room, return to baseline noted in the operating room, fetal outcomes, fetal monitoring characteristics, and anesthesia type between crash versus emergent groups. RESULTS Of 1969 term singleton cesarean sections, 119 patients met our inclusion criteria (emergent group n = 80) (crash group n = 39), which accounted for 13.9% of all primary cesarean sections during the study period. The emergent group had a significantly higher rate of reassessment of fetal heart tones in the operating room n = 61 (76.2%) versus the crash group n = 15 (38.4%) (p ≤ 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences regarding fetal outcomes between the two groups. The crash group had a higher rate of category 1 fetal heart rate tracing prior to the prolonged deceleration, a longer median prolonged deceleration, and a deeper median nadir of the prolonged deceleration; these differences were statistically significant. The prolonged-to-delivery interval was significantly shorter in the crash group (median = 15 min) than tin he emergent group (median = 33 min) (p ≤ 0.0001). The crash group also had a higher rate of general anesthesia (n = 11, 28.2%) than the emergent group (n = 6, 7.5%) (p = 0.002). The crash group was specifically investigated. Of the 15 patients with fetal heart tones rechecked in the crash group, 7 had returned to baseline in the operating room, but underwent cesarean section without fetal monitoring. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that the practice of placing patients on fetal monitor upon arrival to the operating room prior to performing crash cesarean delivery could reduce the rate of primary cesarean deliveries performed for prolonged decelerations in labor. When fetal heart tones have returned to baseline upon arrival in the operating room, the decision to proceed with cesarean delivery can be reconsidered. However, many clinical factors must be taken into consideration, and the decision to proceed is ultimately at the discretion of the obstetrics provider.","Morgan, John A; Hankins, Miriam E; Wang, Yuping; Hutchinson, Donna; Sams, Hannah L; Voltz, John H; McCathran, Charles E; Kaye, Alan D; Lewis, David F",Advances in therapy,137,19

There is complex underlying pathophysiology with further derailment likely caused by acute cardiovascular changes associated with surgery. The implications for post-operative recovery are unclear, particularly in frail and older patients. We retrospectively explored patient notes for evidence of post-operative orthostatic intolerance in relation to pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. METHODS Supine and 1-minute and 3-minute standing blood pressure measures obtained from adult patients before mainly general, orthopedic or uro/gynecology surgery were compared to post-operative outcome, specifically, evidence in patient notes about falls, feeling dizzy/unsteady and/or fearful to stand. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a 20 mmHg or more and/or 10 mmHg or more fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within ~3 minutes of standing after lying supine for an electrocardiogram. RESULTS Whilst all patients included had a 1-minute standing blood pressure assessment (N = 170), 3-minute assessment was performed less commonly (N = 113). Nevertheless, one-quarter (23.5%; N = 40) of 170 patients had pre-operative orthostatic hypotension. This was not clearly explained by cardiac or neurological disease or by common medications, but did occur more frequently in older patients and in those aged 65 years or more with higher clinical frailty scale scores. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of patients progressing to surgery within the planned study timescale (N = 143/170; 84.1%). Nevertheless, patients with orthostatic hypotension stayed longer in hospital post-operatively and were more likely to have an episode of fall, unsteadiness and/or dizziness documented (un-prompted) in their notes. CONCLUSIONS These data provide further impetus for research into modifiable perioperative risk factors associated with orthostatic hypotension. These risks are not confined to those with a pre-existing dysautonomia diagnosis.","Hogan, Alexandra M; Luck, Claire; Woods, Sarah; Ortu, Andrea; Petkov, Svet",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,137,0

This phenomenon is referred to as catch-up growth"". After some time, the growth velocity decreases to the physiological value, i.e. the value that is observed in healthy children. The treatment is continued until the time of the growth process is completed. The continuity of the therapy makes it impossible to assess whether the catch-up phenomenon occurs only at the beginning of the treatment or may be observed after treatment cessation and its re-introduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS Growth velocity was evaluated in a group of 35 patients with GHD after repeated therapy application, in which, due to non-medical reasons, the rhGH treatment was abandoned for a short time. RESULTS Patients with GHD after treatment re-introduction presented the catch-up growth phenomenon and obtained growth velocity results that were significantly higher than those observed during primary treatment.

This therapy is well established in the literature, has shown efficacy, and is an important tool for the treatment of both cancer and noncancer pain; however, it has become clear in recent years that intrathecal drug delivery is associated with risks for serious morbidity and mortality. METHODS The Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference is a meeting of experienced implanting physicians who strive to improve care in those receiving implantable devices. Employing data generated through an extensive literature search combined with clinical experience, this work group formulated recommendations regarding awareness, education, and mitigation of the morbidity and mortality associated with intrathecal therapy to establish best practices for targeted intrathecal drug delivery systems. RESULTS Best practices for improved patient care and outcomes with targeted intrathecal infusion are recommended to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality. Areas of focus include respiratory depression, infection, granuloma, device-related complications, endocrinopathies, and human error. Specific guidance is given with each of these issues and the general use of the therapy. CONCLUSIONS Targeted intrathecal drug delivery systems are associated with risks for morbidity and mortality that can be devastating. The panel has given guidance to treating physicians and healthcare providers to reduce the incidence of these problems and to improve outcomes when problems occur.","Deer, Timothy R; Levy, Robert; Prager, Joshua; Buchser, Eric; Burton, Allen; Caraway, David; Cousins, Michael; De Andrés, José; Diwan, Sudhir; Erdek, Michael; Grigsby, Eric; Huntoon, Marc; Jacobs, Marilyn S; Kim, Philip; Kumar, Krishna; Leong, Michael; Liem, Liong; McDowell, Gladstone C; Panchal, Sunil; Rauck, Richard; Saulino, Michael; Sitzman, B Todd; Staats, Peter; Stanton-Hicks, Michael; Stearns, Lisa; Wallace, Mark; Willis, K Dean; Witt, William; Yaksh, Tony; Mekhail, Nagy",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,137,1

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective multicenter case series. ANIMALS Mares (n = 157). METHODS Indications for surgery were neutering, fertility problems, elimination of hormone-related abnormal behavior, ovarian tumors as well as nonregressive ovarian hematomas or cysts. Ovariectomy (n = 206) were performed by a standard laparoscopic procedure in 157 standing sedated mares. Dissection and hemostasis were achieved by using either (1) a linear stapling device, (2) bipolar electrosurgical instruments, with or without a modified Roeder knot, (3) a vessel-sealing system, or (4) a diode-laser with ligation. For some larger ovarian masses (>20 cm diameter), a 2-step surgical procedure was used with standing flank laparoscopic ovariectomy followed by ovarian retrieval through a median celiotomy. Surgical techniques, outcome, and perioperative complications of each method were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Laparoscopic dissection of the ovary was accomplished in all mares. Because of the size of the ovarian tumor (n = 7) or in 1 mare with behavioral problems (n = 1), the dissected ovary was removed through a median celiotomy under general anesthesia. Seventeen mares (10.8%) developed postoperative complications (eg, incisional drainage, incisional infection, seroma formation, dehiscence, transient fever and mild abdominal discomfort). All mares with flank incisional problems had ovarian size >12 cm and in 15 (88%) of these mares electrosurgical instruments were used for mesovarial dissection. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ovariectomy in standing sedated mares provides good surgical access and is associated with low morbidity.","Röcken, Michael; Mosel, Gesine; Seyrek-Intas, Kamil; Seyrek-Intas, Deniz; Litzke, F; Verver, Jorrit; Rijkenhuizen, Astrid B M",Veterinary surgery : VS,137,17

However, it is difficult to approach the pulmonary artery for lobectomy in congenital lung malformations with incomplete or absent interlobar fissures. Multidetector computed tomographic images and computed tomography pulmonary angiography gave us helpful information before the operation. We performed thoracoscopic lobectomy for congenital pulmonary airway malformations with absent interlobar fissures and adhesions in accordance with information from multidetector computed tomographic images. CASE PRESENTATION A 14-year-old Japanese girl received a diagnosis of congenital pulmonary airway malformation when she presented with pneumonia. Using multidetector computed tomography and three-dimensional reconstruction provides meticulous characterization of the anatomy in pediatric patients. We confirmed that her left A4+5 artery arose from her left pulmonary artery medial to A6. Her left pulmonary artery was divided just proximal to the A6 origin before the lobes were separated safely. We took advantage of using a stapler to divide the fissureless thick parenchyma. Perioperative diagnosis was congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. CONCLUSIONS We used preoperative multidetector computed tomography to outline the bronchovascular anatomy and guide hybrid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in a fissureless left lung.","Nakata, Mitsuyuki; Yoshida, Shigetoshi; Saito, Takeshi; Terui, Keita; Mitsunaga, Tetsuya; Ohno, Sachie; Mise, Naoko; Oita, Satoru; Yoshida, Hideo",Journal of medical case reports,137,1

In the non-controlled single center trials, however, the rates of treatment failure vary. Operator experience and ablation technique may explain some of the different outcomes. In the controlled trials, a major limitation is the lack of adequate randomization. In case reports, original series and overview articles, transarterial embolization (TAE) before percutaneous RFA was promising to increase tumor control and to reduce complications. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature on TAE as add-on to percutaneous RFA for renal tumors. Specific data regarding technique, tumor and patient characteristics as well as technical, clinical and oncologic outcomes have been analyzed. Additionally, an overview of state-of-the-art embolization materials and the radiological perspective of advanced image-guided tumor ablation (TA) will be discussed. In conclusion, TAE as add-on to percutaneous RFA is feasible and very effective and safe for the treatment of T1a tumors in difficult locations and T1b tumors. Advanced radiological techniques and technologies such as microwave ablation, innovative embolization materials and software-based solutions are now available, or will be available in the near future, to reduce the limitations of bland RFA.

Although physicians prescribe multiple antihypertensive drugs and promote lifestyle modifications, the real-world blood pressure (BP) control rate remains poor. To improve BP target achievement, we developed a novel digital therapeutic-the HERB software system -to manage hypertension. Here, we performed a randomized pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of the HERB system for hypertension. We recruited 146 patients with essential hypertension from March 2018 to March 2019. We allocated eligible patients to the intervention group (HERB system + standard lifestyle modification) or control group (standard lifestyle modification alone). The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 24 weeks in 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The baseline characteristics in each group were well balanced; the mean age was approx. 57 years, and 67% were male. In the primary end point at 24 weeks, HERB intervention did not lower the mean change of 24-hour SBP by ABPM compared with the controls (adjusted difference: -0.66 mmHg; p = .78). In an exploratory analysis focusing on antihypertensive drug-naïve patients aged <65, the effects of the HERB intervention were significantly greater than the control for reducing 24-hour SBP by ABPM at 16 weeks (adjusted difference: -7.6 mmHg; p = .013; and morning home SBP at 24 weeks (adjusted difference - 6.0 mmHg; p = .012). Thus, the HERB intervention did not achieve a primary efficacy end point.

Oncology nurse burnout is likely to be an increasingly significant issue for cancer services as the true cost of the pandemic is revealed. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers are reported widely, inevitably leading to poor prognosis and more aggressive treatments for patients. Gaining a better understanding of oncology nurse burnout, its prevalence and causes as well as strategies to reduce or prevent it will help to improve patient care and support staff wellbeing during and after the pandemic. Methodology: A search of the literature related to oncology nurse burnout, covering North America and Europe over 5 years (August 2014-January 2020), resulted in 31 articles for review. None of the studies were carried out in the UK, suggesting a need for robust investigations into oncology nurse burnout in the British health service. Summary: The prevalence of burnout among oncology nurses before the COVID-19 outbreak appeared to be high and is likely to have increased as a result of the pandemic. However, the studies investigating oncology nurse burnout are small and cross-sectional, with low-quality methods. The literature suggests the major causes of burnout arise in the workplace, particularly aspects of the environment that prevent nurses from working according to their values. Although burnout is frequently attributed to workplace factors, interventions remain focused on individuals' coping mechanisms and rarely on the workplace factors that are known to cause it.","Nwanya, Melanie; Rowberry, Deborah",British journal of nursing,137,5

On reflection of clinical practice during this time, it was noted by the ICU team that the majority of ventilated patients appeared to have lost weight during their stay. Unfortunately, there was no ability to weigh patients during the pandemic, so this weight loss was a subjective observation. Regardless, this observation lead the ICU dietitian to retrospectively audit prescribed versus delivered feed. It was found that only 10% of admissions received the prescribed daily volume of feed within the first 7 days of admission. A further 6% of admissions were within 10% of achieving daily prescribed target volumes. The main reasons for this were proning patients, high gastric residual volumes and the overwhelming nature of the pandemic. Three areas of practice have been highlighted that will improve feed delivery should a second wave occur. 1. A nasojejunal team comprising 20 members of the ICU multidiciplinary team will be established to insert bedside nasojejunal tubes in all ICU patients on admission. 2.

Individuals approaching or within older adulthood may be especially vulnerable to these psychosocial stressors and their impact on mental health outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify protective factors for older adults. The purpose of the present study was to determine the relative contribution of coping flexibility (CF) and two distinct coping strategies, forward-focused and trauma-focused, on negative affect in persons 50 years of age and older during the COVID-19 pandemic.Method: Data were collected using an online survey, including questions about demographic information, coping, depression, and anxiety. Participants aged 50 and over were included in our analyses of depression (N = 800) and anxiety (N = 638).Results: Both higher CF and higher forward-focused coping predicted lower depression and lower anxiety. In contrast, higher trauma-focused coping predicted slightly higher depressive symptoms but was not a significant predictor of anxiety.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that higher forward-focused coping may serve as a protective factor in older adults during the pandemic and, therefore, may be an effective treatment target for mental health interventions.","Jordan, Leslie S; Woodard, John L; Pena, Gabriel S; Arnold-Nedimala, Naomi A; Won, Junyeon; Callow, Daniel D; Smith, J Carson",Aging & mental health,137,1

PROs are an underutilized tool in the perioperative setting. Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) have primarily focused on traditional measures of health care quality such as complications and hospital length of stay. These measures do not capture postdischarge outcomes that are meaningful to patients such as function or freedom from disability. PROs can be used to facilitate shared decisions between patients and providers before surgery and establish benchmark recovery goals after surgery. PROs can also be utilized in quality improvement initiatives and clinical research studies. An expert panel, the Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI) workgroup, conducted an extensive literature review to determine best practices for the incorporation of PROs in an ERP. This international group of experienced clinicians from North America and Europe met at Stony Brook, NY, on December 2-3, 2016, to review the evidence supporting the use of PROs in the context of surgical recovery. A modified Delphi method was used to capture the collective expertise of a diverse group to answer clinical questions. During 3 plenary sessions, the POQI PRO subgroup presented clinical questions based on a literature review, presented evidenced-based answers to those questions, and developed recommendations which represented a consensus opinion regarding the use of PROs in the context of an ERP. The POQI workgroup identified key criteria to evaluate patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for their incorporation in an ERP. The POQI workgroup agreed on the following recommendations: (1) PROMs in the perioperative setting should be collected in the framework of physical, mental, and social domains. (2) These data should be collected preoperatively at baseline, during the immediate postoperative time period, and after hospital discharge. (3) In the immediate postoperative setting, we recommend using the Quality of Recovery-15 score. After discharge at 30 and 90 days, we recommend the use of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0, or a tailored use of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. (4) Future study that consistently applies PROMs in an ERP will define the role these measures will have evaluating quality and guiding clinical care. Consensus guidelines regarding the incorporation of PRO measures in an ERP were created by the POQI workgroup. The inclusion of PROMs with traditional measures of health care quality after surgery provides an opportunity to improve clinical care.","Abola, Ramon E; Bennett-Guerrero, Elliott; Kent, Michael L; Feldman, Liane S; Fiore, Julio F; Shaw, Andrew D; Thacker, Julie K M; Gan, Tong J; Miller, Timothy E; Hedrick, Traci L; McEvoy, Matthew D; Mythen, Michael G; Bergamaschi, Roberto; Gupta, Ruchir; Holubar, Stefan D; Senagore, Anthony J; Wischmeyer, Paul E; Carli, Franco; Evans, David C; Guilbert, Sarah; Kozar, Rosemary; Pryor, Aurora; Thiele, Robert H; Everett, Sotiria; Grocott, Mike",Anesthesia and analgesia,137,1

This study describes a new localization method using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) and compares it against conventional percutaneous CT-guided methods. METHODS Between January 2016 and May 2018, 18 consecutive patients with a total of 27 pulmonary nodules underwent ENB localization using patent blue vital dye before thoracoscopy for lung resection at the National Taiwan University Hospital. Over the same period, 268 patients had a total of 325 pulmonary nodules localized by a CT-guided method. Propensity analysis was applied to minimize bias during comparison. RESULTS Patients were selected using a propensity-score based process, matched for potential risk factors for localization failure, to ensure equal potential prognostic factors in both groups. After matching, the ENB group had 15 patients with a total of 24 pulmonary nodules, and the CT group had 30 patients with 48 pulmonary nodules. No major procedure-related complications occurred in either group. The target pulmonary nodule was not successfully localized for one patient in the ENB group and three in the CT group. The lesions were fully excised after conversion to mini-thoracotomy. Pathological examination confirmed the accuracy of the dye staining. Analysis found a non-significant difference in the success rate of these two localization methods. However, the following parameters were significantly different: interval between localization to surgery, global time, and rate of pneumothorax (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS In the era of minimally invasive surgery, surgeons need an efficient one-step way to manage pulmonary nodules. Patent blue vital injection with ENB guidance in the operating room is a new, effective approach to localize small, deep-seated and non-palpable pulmonary lesions, comparable with CT-guided localization.","Kuo, Shuenn-Wen; Tseng, Ying-Fan; Dai, Kuan-Yu; Chang, Yeun-Chung; Chen, Ke-Cheng; Lee, Jang-Ming",Journal of clinical medicine,137,16

A method for efficiently removing HMGB1 from the systemic circulation could be a promising therapy for HMGB1-mediated inflammatory diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study, we produced a new adsorbent material by chemically treating polystyrene fiber. We first determined whether the adsorbent material efficiently adsorbed HMGB1 in vitro using a bovine HMGB1 solution and a plasma sample from a swine model of acute liver failure. We then constructed a column by embedding fabric sheets of the newly developed fibers into a cartridge and tested the ability of the column to reduce plasma HMGB1 levels during a 4-hour extracorporeal hemoperfusion in a swine model of acute liver failure. RESULTS The in vitro adsorption test of the new fiber showed high performance for HMGB1 adsorption (96% adsorption in the bovine HMGB1 solution and 94% in the acute liver failure swine plasma, 2 h incubation at 37°C; p < 0.05 vs. incubation with no adsorbent). In the in vivo study, the ratio of the HMGB1 concentration at the outlet versus the inlet of the column was significantly lower in swine hemoperfused with the newly developed column (53 and 61% at the beginning and end of perfusion, respectively) than in those animals hemoperfused with the control column (94 and 93% at the beginning and end of perfusion, respectively; p < 0.05). Moreover, the normalized plasma level of HMGB1 was significantly lower during perfusion with the new column than with the control column (p < 0.05 at 1, 2, and 3 h after initiation of perfusion). CONCLUSION These data suggest that the newly developed column has the potential to effectively adsorb HMGB1 during hemoperfusion in swine.","Nishiyama, R; Shinoda, M; Tanabe, M; Oshima, G; Takano, K; Miyasho, T; Fuchimoto, Y; Yamada, S; Inoue, T; Shimada, K; Suda, K; Tanaka, M; Hayashida, T; Yagi, H; Kitago, M; Obara, H; Itano, O; Takeuchi, H; Kawachi, S; Maruyama, I; Kitagawa, Y",European surgical research.

This concept was prominently elaborated by Thomas S. Kuhn more than 50 years ago in what remains one of the most cited science philosophy books of all time. Kuhn described how ""normal science"" experiences anomalies, which bring it to crisis and revolution from which a new, immature scientific paradigm results, which over time becomes the new normal. Building on an analysis on how this applies to toxicology and its change in approach in 2008, we concluded at the time that toxicology had encountered a number of such anomalies and was moving into crisis. Here, the progress along Kuhn's trajectory over the last 12 years of a scientific revolution is discussed. We conclude that this decade has shown up even more anomalies, and the perception of crisis has spread and consolidated.

Social-Emotional Learning offers preventive mental health education for children through well-established, evidenced-based curricula. Although there are clear benefits of Social-Emotional Learning curricula, which can help children achieve long-term success emotionally and academically, Social-Emotional Learning curricula are not easily accessible for refugee children, often because of language and socioeconomic barriers. In this pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted Social-Emotional Learning program that included culturally specific, multilingual, trauma-informed wellness, and physical education during the COVID-19 pandemic: EMPOWER (Emotions Program Outside the Clinic With Wellness Education for Refugees). We used the Intervention Mapping framework which guided the (1) planning, (2) program development, and (3) mixed-method evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the EMPOWER pilot. We found that this adaptation was well-received by Afghan refugee families and that COVID-19 safety measures were well-understood after participation. Challenges emerged around videoconferencing connectivity and around finding a common language for discussing emotions. Future iterations of the program and evaluations will require continued partnerships with community members and organizations. As we continue and expand EMPOWER, we aim to evaluate short-term improvement in Social-Emotional Learning competence as well as long-term mental and behavioral health outcomes for children and their families.","Rosenberg, Julia; McDonough Ryan, Patricia; O'Brien, Caroline; Ganjavi, Fereshteh; Sharifi, Mona",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,137,31

Their small size (7 kDa) in combination with the high (subnanomolar) affinity for a number of cancer-associated molecular targets makes them suitable for molecular imaging. Earlier studies demonstrated that the selection of radionuclide and chelator may substantially influence the tumor-targeting properties of affibody molecules. Moreover, the placement of chelators for labeling of affibody molecules with (99m)Tc at different positions in affibody molecules influenced both blood clearance rate and uptake in healthy tissues. This introduces an opportunity to improve the contrast of affibody-mediated imaging. In this comparative study, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) was conjugated to the synthetic affibody molecule Z(HER2:S1) at three different positions: DOTA-A1-Z(HER2:S1) (N-terminus), DOTA-K58-Z(HER2:S1) (C-terminus), and DOTA-K50-Z(HER2:S1) (middle of helix 3). The affinity for HER2 differed slightly among the variants and the K(D) values were determined to be 133 pM, 107 pM and 94 pM for DOTA-A1-Z(HER2:S1), DOTA-K50-Z(HER2:S1), and DOTA-K58-Z(HER2:S1), respectively. Z(HER2:S1)-K50-DOTA showed a slightly lower melting point (57 °C) compared to DOTA-A1-Z(HER2:S1) (64 °C) and DOTA-K58-Z(HER2:S1) (62 °C), but all variants showed good refolding properties after heat treatment. All conjugates were successfully labeled with (111)In resulting in a radiochemical yield of 99% with preserved binding capacity. In vitro specificity studies using SKOV-3 and LS174T cell lines showed that the binding of the radiolabeled compounds was HER2 receptor-mediated, which also was verified in vivo using BALB/C nu/nu mice with LS174T and Ramos lymphoma xenografts. The three conjugates all showed specific uptake in LS174T xenografts in nude mice, where DOTA-A1-Z(HER2:S1)and DOTA-K58-Z(HER2:S1) showed the highest uptake. Overall, DOTA-K58-Z(HER2:S1) provided the highest tumor-to-blood ratio, which is important for a high-contrast imaging. In conclusion, the positioning of the DOTA chelator influences the cellular processing and the biodistribution pattern of radiolabeled affibody molecules, creating preconditions for imaging optimization.","Perols, Anna; Honarvar, Hadis; Strand, Joanna; Selvaraju, Ramkumar; Orlova, Anna; Karlström, Amelie Eriksson; Tolmachev, Vladimir",Bioconjugate chemistry,137,0

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of all pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within Nuvance Health system. Study design Data were abstracted from the medical records of each patient and descriptive analysis was performed. Variables included demographics, COVID testing results, symptoms, management, labor course, neonatal information, and complications. Results Total of 40 patients were identified. Average age was 29.6 years old, 35% were Hispanic, and approximately one in three patients had comorbidities. Of the patients who had repeated testing, the average number of days between first positive test and negative test was 36.8 days (+/- 19.9 days). Three out of four women reported symptoms. Of the 40 pregnant women who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 25 of them delivered. About 84% of the women delivered after 37 weeks. Twelve percent of the women delivered under 33 and 6/7 weeks. Most patients had vaginal deliveries (68%) and the remaining had cesarean deliveries. Neonatal outcomes included: mean 1 and 5 min Apgar scores of 8 and 8.8, respectively and the mean birth weight was 3212 g. Twenty neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and were all found to be negative. Conclusion Overall, with routine prenatal care and preventive measures, pregnant patients and neonates in our study had good outcomes. At this time, there appears to be no evidence of vertical transmission.","Ogamba, Ifeoma; Kliss, Andrea; Rainville, Nicole; Chuang, Linus; Panarelli, Erin; Petrini, Joann; Zilberman, Dimitry",Journal of perinatal medicine,137,1

Effort-adapted modes of assisted breathing are presented and their potential advantages are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Adaptive support ventilation, proportional assist ventilation with load adjustable gain factors and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist are ventilatory modes that follow the concept of adapting the assist to a defined target, instantaneous changes in respiratory drive or lung mechanics. Improved patient ventilator interaction, sufficient unloading of the respiratory muscles and increased comfort have been recently associated with these ventilator modalities. There are, however, scarce data with regard to outcome improvement, such as length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay or mortality (commonly accepted targets to demonstrate clinical superiority). SUMMARY Within recent years, a major step forward in the evolution of assisted (effort-adapted) modes of mechanical ventilation was accomplished. There is growing evidence that supports the physiological concept of closed-loop effort-adapted assisted modes of mechanical ventilation. However, at present, the translation into a clear outcome benefit remains to be proven. In order to fill the knowledge gap that impedes the broader application, larger randomized controlled trials are urgently needed. However, with clearly proven drawbacks of conventional assisted modes such as pressure support ventilation, it is probably about time to leave these modes introduced decades ago behind.","Moerer, Onnen",Current opinion in critical care,137,1

However, there is a scarcity of comparative studies on how modalities of conferencing programs impact health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare laptop-based with smartphone-based videoconferencing programs on nursing home residents' perceptions of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support. METHODS This retrospective secondary analysis used data from two previous studies on the effectiveness of videoconferencing programs (laptop-based and smartphone-based) to improve outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support (type and source) among nursing home residents. Generalised estimating equations compared differences from baseline measures with measures at 1 and 3 months between the two groups with and without adjusting for the effects of confounding variables. RESULTS With the exception of age, there were no differences in demographics between participants in the laptop and smartphone groups. Neither changes from baseline in mean scores for loneliness nor depressive symptoms differed between groups. However, changes in mean scores from baseline between groups were significantly greater in the smartphone-based group compared with the laptop-based group for three types of social support: informational and appraisal at 1 and 3 months; and emotional at 3 months. Changes from baseline in mean scores for social support from friends (at 1 and 3 months) and other sources (at 3 months) were also significantly greater for the smartphone group compared with the laptop group. DISCUSSION The two modalities of videoconferencing did not differ in effects on depressive symptoms or loneliness. However, smartphones had a greater effect on the type and source of social support compared with laptops. Whether the small screen of a smartphone reduces users' anxiety and allows them to talk more on screen is worth studying.","Tsai, Hsiu-Hsin; Cheng, Ching-Yu; Shieh, Wann-Yun",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,137,17

DESIGN Retrospective analysis of a 4-year database of five fertility centres. The study population included women with normal/high ovarian reserve, who underwent autologous MS-IVF (daily ≤150 IU gonadotrophin) with fresh and subsequent frozen embryo transfer(s) (FET) from surplus embryos. Only the first cycle of each patient was included. Cycles with >150 IU daily average of gonadotrophin were excluded. 'Freeze-all embryo' (FAE) cycles were analysed separately. RESULTS A total of 862 consecutive cycles fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 592 were eligible for fresh embryo transfer, 239 had non-elective 'freeze-all' cycles. Median age (25-75th percentile) of women who had fresh embryo transfer was 35 (32-37) years, median antral follicle count 19 (14-28) and anti-Müllerian hormone 19.2 (13-28.9) pmol/l. LBR/fresh cycle and CLBR inclusive of FAE cycles in the <35, 35-37, 38-39 and 40-42 year age groups were 37.8% and 45.1%, 36.0% and 41.6%, 18.4% and 29.1%, and 8.9% and 18.1%, respectively. The LBR following fresh embryo transfer plateaued after nine oocytes (40.3%) or four embryos (40.8%). The CLBR optimized when 12 oocytes (42.9%) or nine embryos (53.8%) were obtained. The LBR per oocyte peaked in women under 35 years when <5 oocytes were retrieved (11.4%), then declined with age and with higher oocyte yield. There were no cases of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). CONCLUSION Nine oocytes, or four embryos, can optimize fresh transfer cycle LBR in MS-IVF. The CLBR are optimized with 12 oocytes, or nine embryos in predicted normal responders, while safeguarding against OHSS.","Datta, Adrija Kumar; Campbell, Stuart; Felix, Nirmal; Singh, Jasdev Singh Harbhajan; Nargund, Geeta",Reproductive biomedicine online,137,1

Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society, but their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2-4. Here, we compile new data on 1,717 local, regional, and national non-pharmaceutical interventions deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large, beneficial, and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these six countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 62 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting roughly 530 million total infections. These findings may help inform whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified, or lifted, and they can support decision-making in the other 180+ countries where COVID-19 has been reported7.","Hsiang, Solomon; Allen, Daniel; Annan-Phan, Sébastien; Bell, Kendon; Bolliger, Ian; Chong, Trinetta; Druckenmiller, Hannah; Huang, Luna Yue; Hultgren, Andrew; Krasovich, Emma; Lau, Peiley; Lee, Jaecheol; Rolf, Esther; Tseng, Jeanette; Wu, Tiffany",Nature,137,16

The commensurate structure with a modulation wavevector q = 5c*/6 was analyzed in a conventional manner in 3D space, while a structure model in (3+1)-dimensional superspace was used for the other two crystals with modulation wavevectors slightly differing from 5c*/6. The superstructure of the commensurate phase was described using the space group P4/n and a common superspace group I4/m(00γ)00 was used for the (3+1)D structures of all three crystals. The whole structure of each crystal consists of two substructures. Basis vectors a and b are common, but c is different for the two substructures. The first substructure is a host framework constructed by (Li/Al)O4 tetrahedra sharing edges. A linear connection of cavities is seen to be channel-like, in which Sr ions locate as guest cations forming the second substructure. The crystal of q = 5c*/6 contains five Sr ions per six cavities in a channel. Sr ions are distributed at seven sites, some of which are partially occupied. Statistical disorder of local structure models for the location of Sr ions in the channel was assumed to explain the results.

However, this international multicenter study sought to evaluate the safety of single-layer devices, which are the newest generation of the WEB intrasaccular flow-disrupter family. They have been designed to offer smaller-sized devices with a lower profile to optimize navigability and delivery, which may, in turn, broaden their range of use. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from all consecutive patients treated with a single-layer WEB device, in 10 European centers from June 2013 to May 2014 were included. Clinical presentations, technical details, intra- and perioperative complications, and outcomes at discharge were recorded. Clinical and angiographic data at last follow-up were also analyzed when available. RESULTS Ninety patients with 98 WEB-treated aneurysms were included in this study. In 93 cases (95%), WEB placement was possible. Complete occlusion at the end of the procedure was obtained in 26 instances (26%). Additional treatment during the procedure (coiling and/or stent placement) was necessary in 12 cases (12.7%). Procedure-related complications occurred in 13 cases, leading to permanent neurologic deficits in 4 patients (4.4%). Early vascular imaging follow-up data were available for 44 patients (57%), with an average time interval of 3.3 months. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality rates at last follow-up were 2.2% and 1.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the feasibility and safety of the single-layer WEB device was comparable with that of the double-layer. However, further studies are needed to evaluate long-term efficacies.","Caroff, J; Mihalea, C; Klisch, J; Strasilla, C; Berlis, A; Patankar, T; Weber, W; Behme, D; Jacobsen, E A; Liebig, T; Prothmann, S; Cognard, C; Finkenzeller, T; Moret, J; Spelle, L",AJNR.

Management of anastomotic leakage has become a serious concern for surgeons. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of transnasal inner drainage using a Salem Sump tube for anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy. METHODS We inserted a Salem Sump tube into the esophagus through one nostril. By using a 0.035-inch guide wire under fluoroscopic guidance, we advanced this drainage tube into the abscess through the site of the anastomotic leakage. We also used upper endoscopy if necessary. RESULTS We performed transnasal inner drainage in five patients with anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy. The average interval from the operation to diagnosis of anastomotic leakage was 7.8 days (median: 7, range: 3-18 days). The average duration of drainage was 15.8 days (median: 16, range: 11-21 days). No patients required additional surgical treatment and there was no operative mortality. No stricture was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Transnasal inner drainage is successful, and may decrease the duration of drainage and reduce surgery-related mortality caused by anastomotic leakage. Additionally, this technique enables treatment of abscesses that cannot be managed by percutaneous drainage because of their locations, and can be safely undertaken in most institutions. Transnasal inner drainage is a safe, useful, inexpensive, and minimally invasive method, which may be an option for management of post-esophagectomy anastomotic leakage.","Kosumi, Keisuke; Baba, Yoshifumi; Ozaki, Nobuyuki; Akiyama, Takahiro; Harada, Kazuto; Shigaki, Hironobu; Imamura, Yu; Iwatsuki, Masaaki; Yoshida, Naoya; Watanabe, Masayuki; Baba, Hideo",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,137,1

The lockdown has decreased microbial populations and heavy metals. Fe, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb and Cr exceeded the drinking water limits, respectively, in 77%, 45%, 27%, 18%, 9% and 91% of the pre-lockdown samples.

A retrospective comparison of SILS and traditional multiport laparoscopic (MP) inguinal hernia repair was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of the minimally invasive laparoscopic technique. METHODS All laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs performed by three surgeons at a single institution during 4 years were reviewed. Statistical evaluation included descriptive analysis of demographics including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and hernia location (uni- or bilateral), in addition to bivariate and multivariate analyses of surgical technique and outcomes including operative times, conversions, and complications. RESULTS The study compared 129 patients who underwent SILS inguinal hernia repair and 76 patients who underwent MP inguinal hernia repair. The cases included 190 men (92.68 %) with a mean age of 55.36 ± 18.01 years (range, 8-86 years) and a mean BMI of 26.49 ± 4.33 kg/m(2) (range, 17.3-41.7 kg/m(2)). These variables did not differ significantly between the SILS and MP cohorts. The average operative times for the SILS and MP unilateral cases were respectively 57.51 and 66.96 min. For the bilateral cases, the average operative times were 81.07 min for SILS and 81.38 min for MP. A multivariate analysis using surgical approach, BMI, case complexity, and laterality as the covariates demonstrated noninferiority of the SILS technique in terms of operative time (p = 0.031). No conversions from SILS to MP occurred, and the rates of conversion to open procedure did not differ significantly between the cohorts (p = 1.00, Fisher's exact test), nor did the complication rates (p = 0.65, χ (2)). CONCLUSIONS As shown by the findings, SILS inguinal herniorrhaphy is a safe and feasible alternative to traditional MP inguinal hernia repair and can be performed successfully with similar operative times, conversion rates, and complication rates. Prospective trials are essential to confirm equivalence in these areas and to detect differences in patient-centered outcomes.","Buckley, F Paul; Vassaur, Hannah; Monsivais, Sharon; Sharp, Nicole E; Jupiter, Daniel; Watson, Rob; Eckford, John",Surgical endoscopy,137,1

The risk factors of ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastasis were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The influencing factors were used to establish a nomogram for predicting ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes metastasis in T1 breast cancer. The model calibration，predictive ability and clinical benefit in the modeling group and the verification group were analyzed by C index，receiver operating characteristic curve，calibration curve and decision curve analysis （DCA） curve，respectively. :Univariate analysis showed that lymph node metastasis was related with primary tumor size，vascular tumor thrombus，Ki-67，histopathological grade，and molecular type （<0.05 or <0.01）. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the primary tumor > vascular tumor thrombus，Ki-67 positive，estrogen receptor （ER） positive，and histopathological grade 2-3 were independent risk factors of axillary lymph node metastasis （<0.05 or <0.01）. Based on the independent risk factors，a nomogram prediction model was established. The C indexes of the model group and the validation group were 0.739 （95%:0.693-0.785） and 0.736 （95%:0.678-0.793），respectively.

MEASURES The effect of a systematic, fast-track transition from oncological treatment to specialised palliative care at home on patient symptom burden was studied in the Domus randomised clinical trial. Participants had incurable cancer and limited treatment options. The intervention was provided by specialised palliative home teams (SPT) based in hospice or hospital and was enriched with a psychological intervention for patient and caregiver dyad. Symptom burden was measured with Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS-r) at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months follow-up and analysed with mixed models. Survival and place of death was analysed with Kaplan-Meier and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS The study included 322 patients. Tiredness was significantly improved for the Domus intervention group at 6 months while the other nine symptom outcomes were not significantly different from the control group. Exploring the efficacy of intervention provider demonstrated significant differences in favour of the hospice SPT on four symptoms and total symptom score. Patients with children responded more favourably to the intervention. The long-term follow-up demonstrated no differences between the intervention and the control groups regarding survival or home deaths. CONCLUSIONS The Domus intervention may reduce tiredness. Moreover, the intervention provider and having children might play a role concerning intervention efficacy. The intervention did not affect survival or home deaths.

At present, the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the main method to confirm COVID-19 infection. The intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic overwhelms limited clinical resources in particular, but not only, in developing countries, resulting in many patients not being tested for the infection and in large queues of potentially infected individuals waiting to be tested while providing a breeding ground for the disease. We describe here a rapid, highly sensitive, point-of-care, molecular test amenable for use at home, in the clinic, and at points of entry by minimally trained individuals and with minimal instrumentation. Our test is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (COVID-19 LAMP) and for higher sensitivity on nested nucleic acid, two stage isothermal amplification (COVID-19 Penn-RAMP). Both tests can be carried out in closed tubes with either fluorescence or colorimetric (e.g., leuco crystal violet LCV) detection. COVID-19 LAMP performs on par with COVID-19 RT-PCR. COVID-19 RAMP has 10 fold better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing purified targets and 100 times better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing rapidly prepared sample mimics. Due to fortunate scarcity of COVID-19 infections in the USA, we were not able to test our assays and methods with patient samples. We hope that such tests will be carried out by colleagues in impacted countries.

The release probability depends on action potential-evoked presynaptic Ca2+ entry, but also on the resting Ca2+ level. Whether these basic aspects of presynaptic calcium homeostasis show any consistent trend along the axonal path, and how they are controlled by local network activity, remains poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of the recently advanced FLIM-based method to monitor presynaptic Ca2+ with nanomolar sensitivity. We find that, in cortical pyramidal neurons, action potential- evoked calcium entry (range 10-300 nM), but not the resting Ca2+ level (range 10-100 nM), tends to increase with higher order of axonal branches. Blocking astroglial glutamate uptake reduces evoked Ca2+ entry but has little effect on resting Ca2+ whereas both appear boosted by the constitutive activation of group 1/2 metabotropic glutamate receptors. We find no consistent effect of transient somatic depolarisation or hyperpolarisation on presynaptic Ca2+ entry or its basal level. The results unveil some key aspects of presynaptic machinery in cortical circuits, shedding light on basic principles of synaptic connectivity in the brain.","Tyurikova, Olga; Zheng, Kaiyu; Nicholson, Elizabeth; Timofeeva, Yulia; Semyanov, Alexey; Volynski, Kirill; Rusakov, Dmitri A",Journal of neurochemistry,137,1

In contrasting these different environments, this article offers the first comparison of the policy response to AIDS in the BRICS nations and seeks to understand the way in which political context matters for conditioning the response to a major epidemic. Using a comparative historical approach, we find that while collaborative state-civil society relations have produced an aggressive response and successful outcomes in Brazil, democratic openness and state-civil society engagement has not necessarily correlated with an aggressive response or better outcomes in the other cases. Response to the epidemic has been worst by far in democratic South Africa, followed by Russia, where in the former, denialism and antagonistic state-civil society relations fuelled a delayed response and proved extremely costly in terms of human lives. In Russia, a lack of civil societal opportunity for mobilization and non-governmental organization (NGO) growth, political centralization and the state's unwillingness to work with NGOs led to an ineffective government response. Top-down bureaucratic rule and a reluctance to fully engage civil society in democratic India substantially delayed the state's efforts to engage in a successful partnership with NGOs. Nevertheless, China has done surprisingly well, in spite of its repressive approach and narrow engagement with civil society. And in all cases, we find the relationship between state and civil society to be evolving over time in important ways. These findings suggest the need for more research on the links between democratic openness, political repression and policy responses to epidemics.","Gómez, Eduardo J; Harris, Joseph",Health policy and planning,137,1

Leucocytes produce different interleukins (IL), including IL-6, so we hypothesized that synovial fluid IL-6 could be a more accurate predictor of PJI than synovial fluid WBC count and %PMN. The main aim of our study was to compare the predictive performance of all three diagnostic tests in the detection of PJI. Methods Patients undergoing total hip or knee revision surgery were included. In the perioperative assessment phase, synovial fluid WBC count, %PMN, and IL-6 concentration were measured. Patients were labeled as positive or negative according to the predefined cut-off values for IL-6 and WBC count with %PMN. Intraoperative samples for microbiological and histopathological analysis were obtained. PJI was defined as the presence of sinus tract, inflammation in histopathological samples, and growth of the same microorganism in a minimum of two or more samples out of at least four taken. Results In total, 49 joints in 48 patients (mean age 68 years (SD 10; 26 females (54%), 25 knees (51%)) were included. Of these 11 joints (22%) were infected.

This study was designed to investigate how spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s) regulates different modes of RPE cell death in vitro. METHODS Human ARPE19 cells were incubated with 25 μM N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E) and irradiated with blue light. Expressions of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and XBP1s were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. STF-083010 was used to suppress XBP1s expression. ARPE19 cell apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and flow cytometry. Receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) was detected by Western blot. Changes in the morphology of ARPE19 cells were identified by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS Blue light-induced A2E-containing ARPE19 cell damage caused a transient elevation of GRP78 and XBP1s, while RIP3 rose in the late stage. STF-083010 effectively inhibited XBP1s expression and brought about the aggravation of apoptosis together with an alleviation of RIP3 expression. Most of the dying cells exhibited apoptotic morphology. CONCLUSION A2E, along with blue light, brought about apoptosis and necroptosis of ARPE19 cells, and XBP1s was transiently elevated. The suppression of XBP1s induced ARPE19 cell death by promoting apoptosis rather than necroptosis. XBP1s might play a role in the pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases.","Lu, Bing; Zhang, Pengfei; Zhou, Minwen; Wang, Wenqiu; Gu, Qing; Feng, Jingyang; Luo, Xueting; Sun, Xiangjun; Wang, Fenghua; Sun, Xiaodong",Ophthalmic research,137,1

This scoping review studied the patient-related factors of medication adherence. METHODS We searched Medline Ovid, Scopus, and Cochrane Library from January 2009 to June 2021 to find the most recent original qualitative studies or systematic reviews that addressed the patient-related factors of medication adherence in treating chronic conditions. We used the PRISMA-ScR checklist to ensure the quality of the study. RESULTS The initial search revealed 4404 studies, of which we included 89 qualitative studies in the scoping review. We inductively organized the patient-related factors causing barriers, as well as the facilitators to medication adherence. The studies more often dealt with barriers than facilitators. We classified the factors as patient-specific, illness-specific, medication-related, healthcare and system-related, sociocultural, as well as logistical and financial factors. Information and knowledge of diseases and their treatment, communication, trust in patient-provider relationships, support, and adequate resources appeared to be the critical facilitators in medication adherence from the patient perspective. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Patients are willing to discuss their concerns about medications. Better communication and better information on medicines appear to be among the critical factors for patients. The findings of this scoping review may help those who plan further interventions to improve medication adherence.","Kvarnström, Kirsi; Westerholm, Aleksi; Airaksinen, Marja; Liira, Helena",Pharmaceutics,137,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 22 patients of the 156 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between March 27, 2020 and March 31, 2020 at our quaternary care academic medical center and who underwent CT imaging within 1 week of admission were included in this retrospective study. Demographics and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Two thoracic radiologists independently categorized each CT study on the basis of RSNA/STR/ACR consensus guidelines. Disagreement in categorization was resolved by consensus discussion with a third thoracic radiologist. RESULTS At the time of imaging, 16 patients (73%) were suspected of COVID-19, and 6 patients (27%) were not. Common symptoms at presentation were fever (73%), cough (77%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (59%). An overall 63% of suspected COVID-19 patients exhibited shortness of breath, whereas 0 unsuspected COVID-19 patients did (P=0.02). On the basis of the RSNA consensus guidelines, 68%, 18%, 9%, and 5% of studies were categorized as ""typical appearance,"" ""indeterminate appearance,"" ""atypical appearance,"" and ""negative for pneumonia,"" respectively. There was no difference of category distribution between suspected and unsuspected COVID-19 patients (P=0.20), with ""typical appearance"" being the most prevalent in both (69% vs. 67%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS It is important to recognize imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia even in unsuspected patients. Implementation of the RSNA/STR/ACR consensus guidelines may increase consistency of reporting and convey the level of suspicion for COVID-19 to other health care providers, with ""typical appearance"" especially warranting further attention.","Lang, Min; Som, Avik; Mendoza, Dexter P; Flores, Efren J; Li, Matthew D; Shepard, Jo-Anne O; Little, Brent P",Journal of thoracic imaging,137,12

However, the involvement of mitophagy in this process and its contribution to the protection of mitochondrial function remains unknown. The present study explored the characteristics of mitophagy after cerebral ischemia and the effect of rapamycin on mitochondrial function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Neurological deficits scores; infarct volumes; mitophagy morphology; and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and mitochondrial membrane potentials (Δψm) were examined. The expression of LC3, Beclin-1 and p62 in the mitochondrial fraction combined with transmission electronic microscopy were used to explore mitophagic activity after ischemia. We also blocked autophagosome formation using 3-methyladenine (3-MA) to check the linkage between the mitochondrial protective effect of rapamycin and enhanced mitophagy. We observed that rapamycin significantly enhanced mitophagy, as evidenced by the increase in LC3-II and Beclin-1 expression in the mitochondria and p62 translocation to the mitochondria. Rapamycin reduced infarct volume, improved neurological outcomes and inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction compared with the control animals (p<0.05). However, these protective effects were reversed by 3-methyladenine treatment after rapamycin. The present study indicates that rapamycin treatment attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction following cerebral ischemia, which is linked to enhanced mitophagy.","Li, Qiang; Zhang, Ting; Wang, Jixian; Zhang, Zhijun; Zhai, Yu; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Sun, Xiaojiang",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,137,24

ECG was synthesized from thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid and 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-amino-D-glucopyranose, followed by reduction in sodium and liquid ammonia to yield ECG (52%). ECG was chelated with (99m)Tc/tin (II) and (68)Ga/(69)Ga chloride for in vitro and in vivo studies in mesothelioma. The highest tumor uptake of (99m)Tc-ECG is 0.47 at 30 min post injection, and declined to 0.08 at 240 min post injection. Tumor uptake (%ID/g), tumor/lung, tumor/blood, and tumor/muscle count density ratios for (99m)Tc-ECG (30-240 min) were 0.47 ± 0.06 to 0.08 ± 0.01; 0.71 ± 0.07 to 0.85 ± 0.04; 0.47 ± 0.03 to 0.51 ± 0.01, and 3.49 ± 0.24 to 5.06 ± 0.25; for (68)Ga-ECG (15-60 min) were 0.70 ± 0.06 to 0.92 ± 0.08; 0.64 ± 0.05 to 1.15 ± 0.08; 0.42 ± 0.03 to 0.67 ± 0.07, and 3.84 ± 0.52 to 7.00 ± 1.42; for (18)F-FDG (30-180 min) were 1.86 ± 0.22 to 1.38 ± 0.35; 3.18 ± 0.44 to 2.92 ± 0.34, 4.19 ± 0.44 to 19.41 ± 2.05 and 5.75 ± 2.55 to 3.33 ± 0.65, respectively.

Information about cryopreserved riboflavin and UV light-treated PLTs is scarce. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Twenty-four buffy coat (BC) PLT concentrates were grouped into 12 type-matched pairs, pooled, and divided into 12 non-PRT-treated control units and 12 riboflavin and UV light PRT-treated test units. Both were cryopreserved with 5% DMSO and stored at -80°C for 1 year. The cryopreservation method used was designed to avoid the formation of aggregates. PLT variables (PLT recovery, swirling, pH, MPV, and LDH) and hemostatic function measured by thromboelastography (TEG) were analyzed before cryopreservation (day 1) and post-cryopreservation at day 14 and months 3, 6, and 12 of storage at -80°C. The analyses were carried out within 1-h post-thaw. RESULTS No aggregates were found in either PLT group at any time. Swirling was observed in both groups. MPV increased and mean pH values decreased over time (p < .001), but the mean pH value was never below 6.4 in either group after 12 months of storage at -80°C. PLT recovery was good and clotting time became significantly shorter over the storage period in both groups (p < .001). CONCLUSION Our cryopreservation and thawing method prevented aggregate formation in cryopreserved riboflavin-UV-light-treated PLTs, which exhibited good recovery, swirling, pH > 6.4, and procoagulant potential, as evidenced by a reduced clotting time after 12 months of storage at -80°C. The clinical relevance of these findings should be further investigated in clinical trials.","Jimenez-Marco, Teresa; Ballester-Servera, Carme; Quetglas-Oliver, Miguel; Morell-Garcia, Daniel; Torres-Reverte, Natalia; Bautista-Gili, Antonia M; Serra-Ramon, Neus; Girona-Llobera, Enrique",Transfusion,137,5

CTA and DUS data of 281 proximal ICA stenoses [143 patients; 65.7 % male; age (mean (years) ± SD, range) 72.2 ± 11.1, 40-99] were retrospectively analyzed. For both methods, two independent raters estimated the degree of stenosis according to NASCET and ECST criteria. DUS raters applied revised German DUS criteria. For agreement and IR assessment, the linear weighted Kappa statistic was used. Correlation between DUS and CTA was substantial irrespective of the applied classification [weighted Kappa: 0.77 (NASCET)/0.79 (ECST)]. IR for DUS was almost perfect (weighted Kappa: 0.94) and better than for CTA [weighted Kappa: 0.78 (NASCET)/0.78 (ECST)].

Methods A total of 110 consecutive patients with posterior circulation stroke who underwent endovascular treatment in our institute in the period 1991-2015 were included. Recanalization rate according to modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia score and neurological outcome at three months according to modified Rankin Scale were the main outcomes. Collateral circulation, procedural complications and radiological outcome were evaluated in the radiological examinations. Results The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 31 (IQR: 13-31) and median time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 300 (IQR: 175-463) minutes. Successful recanalization was seen in 80 of 110 patients (73%). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) was seen in 38 patients (35%) while moderate favorable outcome (≤3) was seen in 48 patients (44%). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 10 patients (9%). An association between collateral circulation, recanalization rate and outcome was seen.

However, these properties can be transient and depend on multiple factors. Here, we developed a multifunctional hydrogel system to synergistically enhance the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs, using a combination of sustained inflammatory licensing and three-dimensional (3D) encapsulation in hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties. The immunomodulatory extracellular matrix hydrogels (iECM) consist of an interpenetrating network of click functionalized-alginate and fibrillar collagen, in which interferon γ (IFN-γ) loaded heparin-coated beads are incorporated. The 3D microenvironment significantly enhanced the expression of a wide panel of pivotal immunomodulatory genes in bone marrow-derived primary human MSCs (hMSCs), compared to two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture. Moreover, the inclusion of IFN-γ loaded heparin-coated beads prolonged the expression of key regulatory genes upregulated upon licensing, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and galectin-9 (GAL9). At a protein level, iECM hydrogels enhanced the secretion of the licensing responsive factor Gal-9 by hMSCs. Its presence in hydrogel conditioned media confirmed the correct release and diffusion of the factors secreted by hMSCs from the system. Furthermore, co-culture of iECM-encapsulated hMSCs and activated human T cells resulted in suppressed proliferation, demonstrating direct regulation on immune cells. These data highlight the potential of iECM hydrogels to enhance the immunomodulatory properties of hMSCs in cell therapies.","Gonzalez-Pujana, Ainhoa; Vining, Kyle H; Zhang, David K Y; Santos-Vizcaino, Edorta; Igartua, Manoli; Hernandez, Rosa Maria; Mooney, David J",Biomaterials,137,28

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who developed anastomotic leakage at the site where the barbed suture was applied. RESULTS Between July 2012 and March 2015, 242 patients were enrolled. Of 362 anastomoses, the enterotomy hole at 256 sites was closed using the barbed suture. These 256 sites consisted of 95 gastroduodenostomies, 25 gastrogastrostomies, 13 gastrojejunostomies, 90 jejunojejunostomies, 17 esophagojejunostomies and 16 primary closures of the stomach following local gastric resection. There were no anastomosis-related complications, conversion to usual sutures, mechanical closure of the entry hole and reoperation due to adhesive obstructions or mortality over a median follow-up period of 17.8 months. CONCLUSIONS The use of the unidirectional barbed absorbable suture for gastrointestinal closure is safe and effective in laparoscopic gastrectomy.","Lee, Sang-Woong; Kawai, Masaru; Tashiro, Keitaro; Nomura, Eiji; Tokuhara, Takaya; Kawashima, Satoshi; Tanaka, Ryo; Uchiyama, Kazuhisa",Japanese journal of clinical oncology,137,30

Of the available medical supplies, oxygen remains the critical consumable resource in disaster management. Strategic management of oxygen supplies in disaster scenarios remains a priority. Hospitals have large supplies of liquid oxygen and a supply of compressed gas oxygen cylinders that allow several days of reserve, but a large influx of patients from a disaster can strain these resources. Most backup liquid oxygen supplies are attached to the main liquid system and supply line. In the event of damage to the main system, the reserve supply is rendered useless. The Strategic National Stockpile supplies medications, medical supplies, and equipment to disaster areas, but it does not supply oxygen. Contracted vendors can deliver oxygen to alternate care facilities in disaster areas, in the form of concentrators, compressed gas cylinders, and liquid oxygen. Planning for oxygen needs following a disaster still presents a substantial challenge, but alternate care facilities have proven to be valuable in relieving pressure from the mass influx of patients into hospitals, especially for those on home oxygen who require only an electrical source to power their oxygen concentrator.","Blakeman, Thomas C; Branson, Richard D",Respiratory care,137,29

SH protein has a single α-helical transmembrane (TM) domain that forms pentameric ion channels. Herein, we report the first inhibitor of the SH protein channel, pyronin B, and we have mapped its binding site to a conserved surface of the RSV SH pentamer, at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain. The validity of the SH protein structural model used has been confirmed by using a bicellar membrane-mimicking environment. However, in bicelles the α-helical stretch of the TM domain extends up to His-51, and by comparison with previous models both His-22 and His-51 adopt an interhelical/lumenal orientation relative to the channel pore. Neither His residue was found to be essential for channel activity although His-51 protonation reduced channel activity at low pH, with His-22 adopting a more structural role. The latter results are in contrast with previous patch clamp data showing channel activation at low pH, which could not be reproduced in the present work. Overall, these results establish a solid ground for future drug development targeting this important viroporin. Importance: The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is responsible for 64 million reported cases of infection and 160,000 deaths each year. Lack of adequate antivirals fuels the search for new targets for treatment. The small hydrophobic (SH) protein is a 64-amino-acid polypeptide encoded by hRSV and other paramyxoviruses, and its absence leads to viral attenuation in vivo and early apoptosis in infected cells. SH protein forms pentameric ion channels that may constitute novel drug targets, but no inhibitor for this channel activity has been reported so far. A small-molecule inhibitor, pyronin B, can reduce SH channel activity, and its likely binding site on the SH protein channel has been identified. Black lipid membrane (BLM) experiments confirm that protonation of both histidine residues reduces stability and channel activity. These results contrast with previous patch clamp data that showed low-pH activation, which we have not been able to reproduce.","Li, Yan; To, Janet; Verdià-Baguena, Carmina; Dossena, Silvia; Surya, Wahyu; Huang, Mei; Paulmichl, Markus; Liu, Ding Xiang; Aguilella, Vicente M; Torres, Jaume",Journal of virology,137,16

We report the emergence and spread of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant within B.1.575 lineage containing the E484K mutation in the spike protein (named B.1.575.2) in a region of Northern Spain between May and June 2021. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with cycle threshold value less than or equal to 30 were selected to screen of presumptive variants using the TaqPathTM COVID-19 RT-PCR kit and TaqManTM SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Panel. Confirmation of variants was performed by whole genome sequencing. Of the 200 samples belonging to the B.1.575 lineage, 194 (97%) corresponded to the B.1.575.2 sub-lineage, which was related to the presence of the E484K mutation. Of 197 cases registered in GISAID EpiCoV database as lineage B.1.575.2 194 (99.5%) were identified in Pamplona (Spain).

A randomized trial would be needed to establish whether outcomes are truly better with the combination. Deciding on hyperprogression v pseudoprogression while getting anti-PD-1 antibody treatment remains a challenge. Laboratory studies would evaluate how such specific signal transduction inhibition by panitumumab might interfere with immune suppressive mechanisms in metastases, rendering them more sensitive to an induced anti-tumor cellular immune response by an anti-PD-1 antibody.

Here, we quantify the biases caused by the use of inaccurate data in the estimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number R(t). By focusing on Italy and Spain, two of the hardest-hit countries in Europe and worldwide, we show that if the symptoms' onset time-series is inferred from the notification date series, the R(t) curve cannot capture nor describe accurately the early dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the containment measures that were implemented, such as national lockdowns, can be properly evaluated only when R(t) is estimated using the real time-series of dates of symptoms' onset. Our findings show that extreme care should be taken when a pivotal quantity like R(t) is used to make decisions and to evaluate different alternatives.","Starnini, M.; Aleta, A.; Tizzoni, M.; Moreno, Y.",,137,16

According to Philip Strong, the founder of the sociological study of epidemic infectious diseases, not only is an epidemic biological;there is also the potential for three psycho-social epidemics: of fear, moralization, and action. This work empirically tests Strong’s model at scale by studying the use of language of 122M tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted in the U.S. during the whole year of 2020. On Twitter, we identified three distinct phases. Each of them is characterized by different regimes of the three psycho-social epidemics. In the refusal phase, users refused to accept reality despite the increasing number of deaths in other countries. In the anger phase (started after the announcement of the first death in the country), users’ fear translated into anger about the looming feeling that things were about to change. Finally, in the acceptance phase, which began after the authorities imposed physical-distancing measures, users settled into a “new normal” for their daily activities. Overall, refusal of accepting reality gradually died off as the year went on, while acceptance increasingly took hold. During 2020, as cases surged in waves, so did anger, re-emerging cyclically at each wave. Our real-time operationalization of Strong’s model is designed in a way that makes it possible to embed epidemic psychology into real-time models (e.g., epidemiological and mobility models).","Aiello, Luca Maria Quercia Daniele Zhou Ke Constantinides Marios Šćepanović Sanja Joglekar Sagar",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,137,1

Objectives: To investigate whether treatment with RTX is associated with severe infection and death. Methods: We performed an observational, multicenter, French national cohort study querying the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, including highly suspected/ confirmed iRMD-COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint was to assess the severity rate of COVID-19. Severe disease was defined by hospitalization in intensive care unit or death. The secondary objectives were to analyze death rate and length of hospital stay. Two control groups were considered for comparison with RTX treated patients: a first group including all non-RTX treated iRMD patients and a second consisting on RTX untreated iRMD patients with diseases for which RTX is a recognized therapeutic option. Adjusting on potential confounding factors was performed by using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity score method. Results: We collected a total of 1090 records. Patients were mainly females (67.3%, 734/1090) with a mean age of 55.2±16.4 years, and 51.1% (557/1090) were over the age of 55. Almost 70% of the population had at least one comorbidity (756/1090). A total of 63 patients were treated with RTX, mainly for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (31/63, 49.2%). RTX treated patients were more likely to be males, with older age, higher prevalence of comorbidities and corticosteroid use. The control population consisted on 1027 non-RTX treated iRMD patients, and 495 RTX untreated iRMD patients with diseases for which RTX is a recognized therapeutic option. Of the 1,090 patients, 137 developed severe disease (12.6%). After adjusting on potential confounding factors (age, sex, arterial hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body mass index, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, corticosteroid use, chronic renal failure and the underlying disease), severe disease was confirmed to be observed more frequently in patients receiving RTX compared to all RTX untreated iRMD patients (effect size, ES 3.26, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.66 to 6.40, p<0.001) and the subgroup of untreated RTX patients with diseases eligible for RTX therapy (ES 2.62, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.09, p=0.005). Patients who developed a severe disease had a more recent rituximab infusion compared to patients with mild or moderate disease. Indeed, the time between the last infusion of rituximab and the first symptoms of COVID-19 was significantly shorter in patients who developed a severe form of COVID-19 (Figure 1). Eighty-nine patients in our cohort died, resulting in an overall death rate of 8.2%. Death rate was numerically higher in RTX treated patients (13/63, 20.6%) compared to all RTX untreated iRMDs patients (76/1027, 7.4%) and the subgroup of untreated RTX patients with diseases eligible for RTX therapy (49/495, 9.9%). After considering the previously described confounding factors, the risk of death was not significantly increased in patients treated with RTX compared to all RTX untreated iRMDs patients (ES 1.32, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.19, p=0.53) (Table 2) and the subgroup of untreated RTX patients with diseases eligible for RTX therapy (ES 1.48, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.20, p=0.32). In line with a more severe COVID-19 disease, the length of hospital stay was markedly longer in patients treated with RTX compared to both untreated RTX patient groups. Conclusion: RTX therapy is associated with a more severe COVID-19 infection. RTX will have to be applied with particular caution in patients with iRMDs.","Avouac, J.; Drumez, E.; Hachulla, E.; Seror, R.; Georgin-Lavialle, S.; El Mahou, S.; Pertuiset, E.; Pham, T.; Marotte, H.; Servettaz, A.; Domont, F.; Chazerain, P.; Devaux, M.; Claudepierre, P.; Langlois, V.; Mekinian, A.; Maria, A.; Banneville, B.; Fautrel, B.; Pouchot, J.; Thomas, T.; Flipo, R.

In addition to conservative therapy, endovascular spasmolysis can play an important role in the management of this disease. Still, optimal management remains controversial. Stent-retrievers may provide an alternative and additional technique for the treatment of cerebral vasospasms.1Aim of StudyTo investigate the feasibility and safety of mechanical spasmolysis with different stent-retrievers.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed all patients with vasospasms after SAH that were treated with percutaneous spasmolysis using self-expanding and adjustable stent-retrievers and remodeling devices in addition to conventional vasospasm therapy.Results21 vessel-segments with vasospasms in 12 patients were included. Spasmolysis with stent-retrievers was conducted in proximal and distal vessel segments without complications. In 42.9% a good effect, in 52.4% a medium effect and in only one case (4.8%) a poor angiographic effect was achieved, respectively. Spasmolysis was more effective in distal vessel segments compared to proximal (reduction of stenosis 56.6% vs. 26.7%, p<0.05) and more effective with 3 mm compared to 4 mm stent-retrievers (43.6% vs. 25.8%, p=0.059). 71.4% of patients had a favorable outcome (mRS 0–1) at long-term FU (77–226d).ConclusionStent-retrievers are frequently used in interventional stroke therapy and may represent a safe and effective treatment option for intracranial spasmolysis after SAH, especially for the more distal vessel-segments. Compared to conventional balloon-PTA, this method seems promising by its ease of use, low risk of rupture and retained blood flow during dilatation, however further improvement of the radial force is recommended.ReferenceBhogal P, Loh Y, Brouwer P, et al.

This emergence was started from Wuhan, China in 2019 from the zoonotic source and spread worldwide, infecting almost half of the community on this earth. Many of the receptors are involved in proceeding with this infection in the organism's body. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play essential and protective functions from a wide range of microbial pathogens. Small setup of TLR adaptor proteins leads to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF). Consequently, various advanced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and interferon reaction properties can be up-regulated. Similarly, TLR flagging works on autophagy in macrophages. Autophagy is a cell response to starvation that helps to eliminate damaged cytosol organelles and persistent proteins. It is also able to prevent the replication of intracellular pathogens. Several microbes subvert the autophagy pathways to sustain their viability. This review investigates how TLRs can modulate a macrophagic system and analyze the role of natural resistance autophagy.","Iqbal, M.

COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease caused by the β-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by immune-mediated tissue and organ damage. It has been proven that the disease in children is relatively easy compared to adults, and the mechanisms of innate immunity play an important role in this. The aim of the investigation was to study the expression of genes encoding the innate immunity receptors TLR4, TLR7, as well as to analyze changes in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines – interleukin(IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-α–in children with COVID-19, depending on the severity of the disease. Material and methods. The study included 55 children with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Patient groups were formed on the basis of complaints and clinical manifestations. The 1st group of asymptomatic children included 9 people. The 2nd group included children were with a mild form of the course – 36 people, the 3rd group consisted of children with a moderate form of the course (10 people). The group of comparison consisted of 25 healthy children. RNA was isolated from the obtained material and the level of gene expression was determined by polymerase chain reaction in real time, and the level of cytokines in the supernatant was determined by the method of multiplex immunofluorescence analysis. Results. A statistically significant increase in the expression of genes for innate immunity receptors (TLR4, TLR7) in the cells of the mucous membrane of the oropharynx in children with COVID-19 has been shown. The expression of TLR4 and TLR7 was, respectively, 2.6 and 7.2 times higher in children with moderate course compared with the healthy group. At the same time, an increase in the level of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα, IFN-α) at the gene and protein levels, associated with the severity of COVID-19 was revealed. Our study also showed an increase in the production of chemokines, which correlated with the severity of the disease. Discussion. An increase in the expression level of the TLR4 and TLR7 genes by oropharyngeal mucosa cells in children with COVID-19 indicates their role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The main function of TLR4 and TLR7 is to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, namely, the spike glycoprotein involved in the penetration of the virus into target cells and the single-stranded RNA of the virus. Activation of TLR4 and TLR7 leads to Toll-induced expression of genes for proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNFα, IFN-α) and chemokines, a significant increase in gene expression and protein production of which we have demonstrated. This plays a huge role in the development of the inflammatory response and indicates changes in the innate immunity of the mucous membranes in COVID-19. Conclusion. The data obtained by us can be used for further study and determination of molecular genetic markers associated with COVID-19 in children, which will allow us to select the optimal therapy option in the future.","Gankovskaya, L.

The development of highly productive, low-N-tolerant cultivars is important to facilitate green and sustainable agriculture. However, it is unclear how low-N-tolerant cultivars achieve high grain yields under field conditions. In this study, the physiology facilitating the strong growth and efficient resource use of four low-N-tolerant Panicum miliaceum L. cultivars was compared with two low-N-sensitive cultivars using low and typical N fertilization applications (0, 75, and 150 kg N ha−1) on the semiarid Loess Plateau, China in 2019 and 2020. Compared to normal N fertilization, low N fertilization treatments significantly decreased plant photosynthetic capacity by regulating leaf stomatal closing, resulting in reduced dry matter accumulation and transportation, growth inhibition, weakened resource utilization, and consequently, a 28.9% decrease in grain yield. Compared to the low-N-sensitive cultivars, the low-N-tolerant cultivars had improved growth, leaf photosynthetic capacity, and dry matter transportation. These improved physiological characteristics resulted in more effective resource capture in the low-N-tolerant cultivars. This included higher and more efficient radiation use (24.4% and 26.9%), water use (63.5% and 48.2%), and N uptake (37.0% and 33.7%) in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Furthermore, the low-N-tolerant cultivars had increased productivity, with higher grain yields (38.6-41.6%) and harvest index values (16.7-28.2%) under low N conditions in the two years of the study. Overall, the results of this study determined the effect of low N input on broomcorn millet productivity and illustrated the strategies by which low-N-tolerant cultivars increased grain yield in semiarid field conditions.

Tissue injury in one organ appears to trigger disease in remote organs. Kidney and lung are frequently affected, such as when acute kidney injury (AKI) causes acute lung injury (ALI), a frequent clinical condition with high mortality. Here we identify factors secreted from the injured kidney that cause acute lung injury. We developed a murine model mimicking the generation of respiratory failure following acute kidney injury. To identify interorgan crosstalk mediators involved, we performed scRNAseq of mouse kidneys and lungs after AKI. We then applied ligand-receptor (L-R) pairing analysis across cells residing in kidney (ligands) or lung (receptors) to identify kidney-released circulating osteopontin (OPN) as a novel mediator of AKI-induced ALI (AKI-ALI). OPN release very early after AKI largely from tubule cells triggered neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into lungs associated with endothelial leakage, interstitial edema, and functional impairment. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of OPN prevented AKI-ALI. Transplantation of ischemic wt kidneys into wt mice caused AKI-ALI, while transplantation of ischemic OPN-global-knockout kidneys failed to induce lung endothelial leakage and AKI-ALI, identifying circulating kidney-released OPN as sufficient to cause AKI-ALI in vivo. We show that AKI in humans results in elevations in OPN levels in the serum. Increased serum OPN levels in patients with multiorgan failure have been shown to positively correlate with reduced kidney function, respiratory failure, and mortality. Thus, our results identifying OPN as a mediator of AKI-ALI may have important therapeutic implications in human AKI-ALI and multiorgan failure.","Khamissi, Fatima Zohra; Ning, Liang; Kefaloyianni, Eirini; Dun, Hao; Arthanarisami, Akshayakeerthi; Keller, Amy; Atkinson, Jeffrey J.; Li, Wenjun; Wong, Brian; Dietmann, Sabine; Lavine, Kory; Kreisel, Daniel; Herrlich, Andreas",bioRxiv,137,1

However, depending on specific national regulations, possible pathways to becoming parents are different and often reserved only for some categories of people. This is the case, for example, in Italy, where it is more difficult for homosexual people to have a family than it is for others, since national legislation prohibits homosexuals from using any form of third-party reproduction. Consequently, many Italian same-sex couples turn to agencies abroad to realise their desire to have children, giving rise to transnational practices of family formation. The COVID-19 pandemic and severe lockdown policies have exacerbated some critical aspects of this transnational system of access to parenting. To fight the spread of coronavirus, national governments have placed limits on mobility and, consequently, also placed limits on transnational practices and trajectories of family formation. The specific aim of this paper is to provide insights into the experiences of some gay Italian fathers-to-be who have been blocked in their transnational family formation projects because of coronavirus lockdown measures. The focus lies on how these men reacted to feeling “stuck” and seeing their plans of receiving and/or bringing home their children suddenly foiled by the lockdown measures. Particular attention is paid to how these men coped with exacerbated challenges in the transnational practices of reproduction and family formation. © 2021.

Until 2018 HDV was the sole representative of the genus Deltavirus. The subsequent identification of HDV-like agents in non-human hosts indicated a much longer evolutionary history of deltaviruses than previously hypothesized. Interestingly, none of the HDV-like agents were found in co-infection with an HBV-like agent suggesting that these viruses use different helper virus(es). Here we show, using snake deltavirus (SDeV), that HBV represents only a single example of helper viruses for deltaviruses. We cloned the SDeV genome into a mammalian expression plasmid, and by transfection could initiate SDeV replication in cultured snake and mammalian cells. By superinfecting SDeV infected cells with arenaviruses, or by transfecting different viral surface proteins, we could induce infectious SDeV particle production. Our findings indicate that deltaviruses can likely use a multitude of helper viruses or even viral glycoproteins to form infectious particles. Persistent and recurrent infections would be beneficial for the spread of deltaviruses. It seems plausible that new human and veterinary disease associations with deltavirus infections will be identified in the future.","Szirovicza, Leonora; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi",bioRxiv,137,2

Although they have proven to be very effective in the general population, little is known about their efficacy in immunocompromised patients. HIV-infected individuals’ response to vaccine may vary according to the type of vaccine and their level of immunosuppression. We evaluated immunogenicity of an mRNA anti-SARS CoV-2 vaccine in HIV-positive individuals. Methods HIV-positive individuals (n=121) were recruited from HIV clinics in Montreal and stratified according to their CD4 counts. A control group of 20 health care workers naïve to SARS CoV-2 was used. The participants’ Anti-RBD IgG responses were measured by ELISA at baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine). Results Eleven of 121 participants had anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline, and a further 4 had incomplete data for the analysis. Mean anti-RBD IgG responses were similar between between the HIV negative control group (n=20) and the combined HIV+ group (n=106) (p = 0.72). However, these responses were significantly lower in the group with <250 CD4 cells/mm3. (p<0.0001). Increasing age was independently associated with decreased immunogenicity. Conclusion HIV-positive individuals with CD4 counts over 250 cells/mm3 have an anti-RBD IgG response similar to the general population. However, HIV-positive individuals with the lowest CD4 counts (<250 cells/mm3) have a weaker response. These data would support the hypothesis that a booster dose might be needed in this subgroup of HIV-positive individuals, depending on their response to the second dose.","Nault, Lauriane; Marchitto, Lorie; Goyette, Guillaume; Tremblay-Sher, Daniel; Fortin, Claude; Martel-Laferrière, Valérie; Trottier, Benoît; Richard, Jonathan; Durand, Madeleine; Kaufmann, Daniel; Finzi, Andrés; Tremblay, Cécile",bioRxiv,137,10

Of particular note, all RCTs for remdesivir (Veklury®), the only antiviral treatment approved by the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 intervention, excluded patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min. Regardless, some physicians have ventured to utilize this drug on patients with SRI, positing that the benefits might outweigh the risks of its use. The intent of this literature review was to examine the pharmacology of remdesivir and evaluate the published clinical literature on the topic to determine more definitively whether it might be safe to use in this population. A total of 59 articles were evaluated, seven of which contained descriptions of SRI patients treated with remdesivir for COVID-19, for a total of 176 patients. Interestingly, none of the patients experienced severe adverse reactions attributable to the use of remdesivir, and none of the investigators recommended against its use. While there is not yet clear evidence to suggest improvement in mortality, decreased morbidity and duration of illness are likely to lower mortality rates among these patients. Therefore, these findings suggest that, for patients with SRI diagnosed with COVID-19, the benefits of using remdesivir likely outweigh the risks.

Both hypertrophic and polyploid features of AT2 cells can be attenuated by inhibiting the integrated stress response (ISR) using the small molecule ISRIB. These data suggest that AT2 polyploidization may be a feature of alveolar epithelial injury.

In an attrition bias analysis imputing ''no symptoms'' to missing values, the hesperidin group shows reduction of 14.5 % of group A symptoms from 50.9% to 36.4% (OR: 0.55, 0.32-0.96, p = 0.03). Anosmia, the most frequent persisting symptom (29.3%), was lowered by 7.3% at 25.3 % in the hesperidin group vs 32.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.29). Mean number of symptoms in placebo and hesperidin was 5.10 {+/-} 2.26 vs 5.48 {+/-} 2.35 (day 1) and 1.40 {+/-} 1.65 vs 1.38 {+/-} 1.76 (day 14) (p = 0.92). In conclusion, most non-vaccinated COVID-19 infected subjects remain symptomatic after 14 days with anosmia being the most frequently persisting symptom. Hesperidin 1g daily may help reduce group A symptoms. Earlier treatment of longer duration and/or higher dosage should be tested.","Dupuis, J.; Laurin, P.; Tardif, J.-C.; Hausermann, L.; Rosa, C.; Guertin, M.-C.; Thibaudeau, K.; Gagnon, L.; Cesari, F.; Robitaille, M.; Moran, J.

In some countries, despite the presence of smart meters, a fragmentary data availability and/or the lack of standardization hinders the creation of post-metering value-added services and confines such innovative solutions to the prototypal and experimental level. We take inspiration from the technology adopted in Italy, where the national regulatory authority actively supported the definition of a solution agreed upon by all the involved stakeholders. In this context, smart meters are enabled to convey data to low voltage end users through a power line communication channel (CHAIN 2) in near real-time. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it describes the proof of concept that the channel underwent and its subsequent validation (with performances nearing 99% success rate). On the other hand, it defines a classification framework (I2MA) for post-metering value-added services, in order to categorize each use case based on both level of service and expected benefits, and understand its maturity level. As an example, we apply the methodology to the 16 use cases defined in Italy. The lessons learned from the regulatory, technological, and functional approach of the Italian experience bring us to the provision of recommendations for researchers and industry experts. In particular, we argue that a well-functioning post-metering value-added services' market can flourish when: i) distribution system operators certify the measurements coming from smart meters; ii) national regulatory authorities support the technological innovation needed for setting up this market; and iii) service providers create customer-oriented solutions based on smart meters' data.","Serra, Daniele; Mardero, Daniele; Stefano, Luca Di; S.p.A., Samuele Grillo E-Distribuzione; Italy,; Milano, Politecnico di",,137,24

The metric is calculated as a function of date and location to illustrate patterns of disease, showing growing or waning cases and deaths. The metrics enable the direct comparison of the time distribution of cases and deaths, revealing data coherence and revealing how patterns varied over a one-year period. We also compare different methods of estimating actual infections and deaths to get a better perspective on the timing and dynamics of the pandemic by state. We used three example states to graphically compare metrics as functions of date, and also compared statistics derived from all 50 states. Over the period studied, average case day and average death day vary by two to five months among the 50 states, depending on data source, with the earliest averages in New York and surrounding states, as well as Louisiana. The average day of death has preceded the average day of case in Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data for most states and most dates since June of 2020.

In January 2020, countries across the globe began implementing various levels of safety measures to slow the spread of the virus. Safety measures have run the gamut of restrictions: physical distancing guidelines, proper handwashing practices, and the use of face masks are on the lower end of the restriction spectrum, while travel restrictions, business closures, and country-wide lockdowns are instances of more stringent measures. Policy responses have drastically differed among governments across the globe, but the economic strife has plagued countries regardless of their COVID-19 response plan. Lockdowns in the first half of 2020 impeded economic activity, leading to a reduction in industrial activity and hence emissions. During this time period, observations from publicly available satellite sensors have shown that concentrations of various atmospheric pollutants, nitrogen dioxide especially, have decreased. The Asia-Pacific region was no exception, with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand all experiencing slowdown in growth and large reductions in various economic sectors. Using these five Asia-Pacific countries, we will analyze how government policy, lockdowns, and travel restrictions implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak have slowed economic growth in the transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors, and in turn, impacted air quality and water quality.

The twin geophysical crises of catastrophic bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a public reckoning around our guardianship of the environment, as well as our relationship with science and indigenous knowledge. Congruent with this was the rapid transformation of both schools and universities to online learning, causing the most significant rupture to the traditional ‘grammar of schooling’ for decades. This unprecedented conflation of crises has resulted in the unusual situation where education can be radically transformed, as the material conditions that usually remain latent (thus negating the possibility for change) suddenly exist. As a result, there has been an increased openness to pedagogies of potentiality, as schools and universities resist the urge to ‘return to normal’. Amongst these pedagogies, the philosophy of Bernard Stiegler is unique in its direct response to the entropic state with a counter-impulse, negantropy, which seeks to harness our technological capacity under an ethos of care and unite it with our existential purpose to flourish and thrive. This paper will consider the possibilities of Stiegler’s utopian call for action in relation to the Australian context, as schools and universities reconceptualise the sharing of knowledge and the purpose of education that seeks to rectify the gaps of the past. © 2021 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.","Forrest, K.",Educational Philosophy and Theory,137,20

Mass vaccination campaigns started in Brazil on January/2021 with CoronaVac followed by ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines. Target populations initially included vulnerable groups such as people older than 80 years, with comorbidities, of indigenous origin, and healthcare workers. Younger age groups were gradually included. Methods. A national cohort of 66.3 million records was compiled by linking registry-certified COVID-19 vaccination records from the Brazilian National Immunization Program with information on severe COVID-19 cases and deaths. Cases and deaths were aggregated by state and age group. Mixed-effects Poisson models were used to estimate the rate of severe cases and deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and the corresponding estimates of vaccine effectiveness by vaccine platform and age group. The study period is from mid-January to mid-July 2021. Results. Estimates of vaccine effectiveness preventing deaths were highest at 97.9% (95% CrI: 93.5-99.8) among 20-39 years old with ChAdOx1 nCov-19, at 82.7% (95% CrI: 80.7-84.6) among 40-59 years old with CoronaVac, and at 89.9% (87.8--91.8) among 40-59 years old with partial immunization of BNT162b2. For all vaccines combined in the full regimen, the effectiveness preventing severe cases among individuals aged 80+ years old was 35.9% (95% CrI: 34.9-36.9) which is lower than that observed for individuals aged 60-79 years (61.0%, 95% CrI: 60.5-61.5). Conclusion. Despite varying effectiveness estimates, Brazil's population benefited from vaccination in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes. Results, however, suggest significant vaccine-specific reductions in effectiveness by age, given by differences between age groups 60-79 years and over 80 years.","Villela, D. A. M.; de Noronha, T.

To better inform and direct the efforts of graduate career offices, forty-five stakeholders external and internal to academic institutions were identified and interviewed to gather and categorize perspectives on topics critical to career and professional development offices. Using a stakeholder network visualization tool developed by the authors, stakeholder engagement can be rapidly assessed to ascertain areas where offices have strong connections and other areas where additional efforts could be directed to enhance engagement. General themes from interviews with internal and external stakeholders are discussed to provide graduate career educators with various stakeholder subgroup perspectives to help prepare for successful interactions.

This study examined how physician leaders managed to quickly design a new model for acute-care physicians' work, adopted across four large hospitals in a public health authority in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The research employed a qualitative case study methodology, with inductive analysis of interview transcripts and documents. Shortly after a physician work model redesign, we interviewed key informants: the physician leaders and others who participated in or supported the model's development. Participants were chosen based on their leadership role and through snowballing. All those who were approached agreed to participate. Results: A process model describes leadership actions during four phases of work model development (priming, early planning, readying for operations and transition). These actions were: (1) recognising the threat, (2) committing to action, (3) forming and organising, (4) building and relying on relationships, (5) developing supporting processes and (6) designing functions and structure. We offer three additional contributions to knowledge about leadership in a time of crisis: (1) leveraging peer-professional leadership to initiate, formalise and organise change processes, (2) designing a new work model on existing and emerging evidence and (3) building and relying on relationships to unify various actors. Conclusions: The model of peer-professional leadership can deepen understanding of how to lead professionals. Our findings could assist peer-professional and organisational leaders to encourage quick redesign of professionals' work in response to new phases of the COVID-19 pandemic or other crises. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

To date, there is no published study to evaluate different mechanisms of post/para COVID-19 transverse myelitis. However, the post/para COVID-19 transverse myelitis mechanism seems to be heterogeneous;the activation of a silent autoimmune disease can probably justify some unusual clinical presentations of a viral illness.

In 21 healthy immunocompetent subjects all of whom demonstrated circulating IgG antibodies 4 months after mRNA1273 or BNT162b vaccination, a) the strength of S-IgG was stable while RBD-IgG declined, b) S2-reactive B-cell frequencies increased progressively (p=0.002) c) S1-reactive CD8+T-cells and CD19+B-cells were undetectable after a transient increase, and d) monocytic and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC, PMN-MDSC) increased after the first vaccine dose. Compared with 4-month measurements from immunocompetent subjects, single samples from 20 vaccinated immunocompromised (IC) subjects revealed a) circulating S-IgG and RBD-IgG in 13 (65%) and 9 (45%) subjects, respectively, b) no differences in S2-reactive T- and B-cells, c) undetectable S1-reactive T- and B-cells, and d) fewer S-reactive CD8+T-cells and CD19+B-cells (p<0.05). Among 11 IC recipients who failed to make RBD-IgG, frequencies of PMN-MDSC were significantly higher (p<0.0004) compared with IC or immunocompetent subjects with RBD-IgG. COVID-19 vaccination induces stable antibodies to the spike protein and expands circulating B-cells reactive to the conserved spike protein sequence in immunocompetent subjects. MDSC which are known to suppress T- and B-cells, and which increase after vaccination, may limit post-vaccination responses especially among immunocompromised subjects. Antibody and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2-specific spike antigenic sequences appear to be less durable.","Sindhi, R.; Ashokkumar, C.; Singh, V.; Spishock, B.; Saunders, M.; Mabasa, A.; Sindhi, E.; Sethi, P.; Reddy, A.; Subramaniam, S.; Nibhanupudy, B.",,137,1

Conversely, women seem more likely to suffer from long-term consequences of the disease and pronounced negative social and economic impacts. Sex- and gender-specific risk factors of COVID-19-related long-term effects are unknown. Methods: We conducted a multicentre prospective observational cohort study of 5838 (44.6% women) individuals in Switzerland who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA between February and December 2020. Of all surviving individuals who met the inclusion criteria, 2799 (1285 [45.9%] women) completed a follow-up questionnaire. Findings: After a mean follow-up time of 197{+/-}77 days, women more often reported at least one persistent symptom (43.0% vs 31.5%, p<0.001) with reduced exercise tolerance and reduced resilience being the most frequently reported symptom in both sexes.

Of course, this is definitely not the first time that Revelation’s themes and imagery have been pulled out and used to try and explain the current situation. In fact, the Book of Revelation is well-known as ‘the’ book of the New Testament where information about the present as well as the future can be found. Unfortunately, in situations like these, people simply do not bother to draw from the reservoir of experiences on which the author of Revelation naturally expected his hearer or reader to draw. This phenomenon is made worse by the fact that the primary study of the text has moved into the academic institution and, by inference, away from the faith movement. This may make earnest scholarly biblical study of the Apocalypse seem irrelevant to the general concerns of the faith community and the world. But the Book of Revelation does provide an indispensable resource for helping Christians conceive of their place in the contemporary world and meditate on the role the church is to play in a modern, secular society. John’s Apocalypse is not a mere nostalgic trip down memory lane;it is a form of anamnesis or recollection – in recalling or performing the narrative, the past is made physically present. By way of a performative reading of the Book of Revelation, this article makes use of a more practical exegetical dimension.

Due to a lack of extensive genomic sequencing and contact tracing data, its key epidemiological properties have not been well characterized. Methods: We utilized nine epidemiological and population datasets collected in New York City (NYC), where B.1.526 emerged, and comprehensive modeling to estimate the changes in transmissibility, immune escape potential, and infection fatality risk (IFR) for B.1.526. Findings: Estimated transmission rate in the neighborhood where B.1.526 was initially detected was consistently higher than other neighborhoods in NYC and further increased during the weeks preceding B.1.526 detection, likely due to its early spread there. Overall, models estimated that B.1.526 had transmissibility about 15-25% higher than previously circulating variants and that it could escape immunity in 0-10% of previously infected persons. In addition, B.1.526 substantially increased IFR in older adults: by 46% (95% CI: 7.4 - 84%) among 45-64 year-olds, 82% (95% CI: 20 - 140%) among 65-74 year-olds, and 62% (95% CI: 45 - 80%) among 75+ during Nov 2020 - Apr 2021, compared to baseline IFR estimated for preexisting variants. Interpretation: New variants like B.1.526 likely spread in the population weeks prior to detection, and partial immune escape (e.g., resistance to therapeutic antibodies) could offset prior medical advances and increase IFR. Early preparedness for and close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants, their epidemiological characteristics, and disease severity are thus crucial to COVID-19 pandemic response as it remains a global public health threat.","Yang, W.; Greene, S.; Peterson, E.

This research examines Organizational Culture during Crises (OCC) as an antecedent to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to evaluate the factors that determine the intention to adopt a virtual classroom across multiple disciplines by the faculty of a reputed Indian university. Data collected from a sample of 353 respondents was analyzed to test the research model using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings of the study reveal that OCC plays a positive and significant role in determining the intention of faculties to adopt a virtual classroom. We also found that OCC also significantly influences performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence. The results imply proper framing of policies by top management of Higher Education Institutions (HEI) for the smooth adoption of virtual classrooms by faculty when confronted by crises. © 2021 The Author(s).

This equation accounts for asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic or latent transmission as well as contact tracing and isolation, and leads to a transparent definition of the instantaneous reproduction number R. For different parameter values, the model equation admits different classes of solutions. These solution classes correspond to, inter alia, containment of the outbreak via public health measures, exponential growth despite public health measures, containment despite reopening and second wave following reopening. We believe that the spread of COVID in every localized area such as a city, district or county can be accounted for by one of our solution classes. In regions where R > 1 initially despite aggressive epidemic management efforts, we find that if the mitigation measures are sustained, then it is still possible for R to dip below unity when far less than the region's entire population is affected, and from that point onwards the outbreak can be driven to extinction in time. We call this phenomenon partial herd immunity. Our analysis indicates that COVID-19 is an extremely vicious and unpredictable disease which poses unique challenges for public health authorities, on account of which case races among various countries and states do not serve any purpose and present delusive appearances while ignoring significant determinants.","Shayak, B; Sharma, Mohit M",,137,27

In particular, Delta variant (B.1.617.2 lineage) has become predominant in many countries. These variants raised the concern for their potential immune escape to the currently approved vaccines. ZF2001 is a subunit vaccine received emergency use authorization (EUA) in both China and Uzbekistan, with more than 100-million doses administrated with a three-dose regimen. The tandem-repeat dimer of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) was used as the antigen. In this work, we evaluated the neutralization of ZF2001-elicited antisera to SARS-CoV-2 variants including all four variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and other three variants of interest (Epsilon, Eta and Kappa) by pseudovirus-based assay. We found antisera preserved majority of the neutralizing activity against these variants. E484K/Q substitution is the key mutation to reduce the RBD-elicited sera neutralization. Moreover, ZF2001-elicited sera with a prolonged intervals between the second and third dose enhanced the neutralizing titers and resilience to SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Zhao, Xin; Zheng, Anqi; Li, Dedong; Zhang, Rong; Sun, Huan; Wang, Qihui; Gao, George F.; Han, Pengcheng; Dai, Lianpan",bioRxiv,137,1

The 1st group of patients (n=28) finished the programme on 31st December, 2019. The 2nd group of patients were enrolled in programme on 1st January, 2020 (n=12). When on 12th of March in Latvia health care restriction started due the COVID-19 situation, we were forced to change our structure of LAT-EIP.ResultsThe average patient age of patients was 29.9 (SD±7.1) years in the 1st group, in 2nd group average age is 26.2 (SD±5.9) accordingly in years. In the 1st group 60.7% of patients visited the psychiatrist 6-10 times vs 8.33% in 2nd group, in the 1st group 32.1 % of patients had 2-5 visits with psychiatrist vs 75% in 2nd group. There were 72 family sessions in 1st group, whereas in 2nd group the family sessions were excluded. During the programme 7% (n=2) of patients in the 1st group were rehospitalized vs 25% (n=3).ConclusionsThe structure of LAT-EIP had change at the time of COVID-19 restrictions, unfortunately our work lack the statistical power. From the descriptive statistics, we can speculate that the rehospitalization rate is higher because of the lack of regular contact with psychiatrist and the lack of psychoeducation with families.","Kokina, N.; Sile, L.; Butorins, B.; Pocopko, A.; Lesina, A.; Kikuste, S.; Sapele, I.; Rancans, E.",European Psychiatry,137,5

However, the exact pathogenesis of the spontaneous pneumothorax occurrence and its cause remains unknown. Accordingly, the present study examined 30 patients with acute COVID-19-induced respiratory failure who were under biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and medical ventilator machines. Methods: This study is a retrospective study and was performed on patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure who were admitted to the intensive care unit. The study population included 30 patients (10 patients with pneumothorax complication and 20 other patients without this complication). All study patient demographic data and device parameters (physiological parameters observed by the device) were collected and compared with each other. Results: Overall, 30 patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were selected during the 3 months from April to July 2020, with complications of spontaneous pneumothorax and emphysema detected in the collected chest X-ray images of 10 patients. In general, the results showed that p-plateau and p-peak parameters in the group with pneumothorax were significantly higher than the other group. Alternately, it was observed that static compliance for the group with pneumothorax was significantly lower than the uncomplicated group. Further, the mortality rates obtained were equal to 80% for the group with pneumothorax complication and 55% for the other group. Conclusion: Spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with ARDS and COVID-19 is a rare complication with a high mortality rate that occurs even in patients without intubation and patients undergoing BIPAP. Hence, if low static compliance and high pulmonary pressures are observed for patients, physicians should seek the complication diagnosis and treatment following changes in patients' symptoms. © 2021 Medknow.

One of them is using deep learning techniques to classify a masked or non-masked face. Previous research used the MobileNetV2 transfer learning model, which resulted in an F-Measure value below 0.9. Of course, this result made the detection system not accurate enough. In this research, we propose a model with more parameters, namely the DenseNet201 model. The number of parameters of the DenseNet201 model is five times more than that of the MobileNetV2 model. The results obtained from several up to 30 epochs show that the DenseNet201 model produces 99% accuracy when training data. Then, we tested the matching feature on video data, the DenseNet201 model produced an F-Measure value of 0.98, while the MobileNetV2 model only produced an F-measure value of 0.67.

Utilizing telemedicine could markedly enhance group visit scalability and sustainability. However, there are limited data demonstrating telemedicine use for group visits. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of provider encounters conducted via telemedicine in group visits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a 6-month diabetes group visit program and compared in-person (months 1–3) versus telemedicine (videoconferencing) (months 4–6) patient-provider encounters. Participants completed the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) at 6-months (primary outcome). To ensure telemedicine did not negatively affect clinical outcomes, we compared in-person versus telemedicine differences in HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and attendance. RESULTS: The TUQ revealed that participants (N=19) found telemedicine useful and easy to use (4.9/5.0, 4.4/5.0, respectively) and with excellent interface (4.3/5.0), interaction (4.6/5.0), reliability (4.2/5.0), and satisfaction (4.4/5.0). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between arms: HbA1c (in-person: −0.60%, telemedicine: −0.52%, p=0.86), blood pressure (systolic: p=0.475, diastolic: p=0.683), weight (p=0.982), BMI (p=0.981), attendance (in-person: 75.44%, telemedicine: 70.12%, p=0.551). CONCLUSION: Provider telemedicine encounters in group visits are feasible and acceptable. This is a promising model to address provider limitations in group visits and increase access to care.

Subsequent purification and identification revealed the presence of truncated CXCL11 variants missing up to 6 amino acids. In combination with CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV, the metalloprotease aminopeptidase N (APN), identical to the myeloid cell marker CD13, rapidly processed CXCL11, but not CXCL8, to generate truncated CXCL11 forms. Truncated CXCL11 had reduced binding, signaling, and chemotactic properties for lymphocytes and CXCR3- or CXCR7-transfected cells. CD13/APN-truncated CXCL11 failed to induce an intracellular calcium increase but was still able to bind and desensitize CXCR3 for intact CXCL11 signaling. CXCL11 efficiently bound to CXCR7, but CXCL11 was not able to induce calcium signaling or ERK1/2 or Akt phosphorylation through CXCR7. CD26-truncated CXCL11 failed to attract lymphocytes but still inhibited microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) migration. However, further processing of CXCL11 by CD13 resulted in significant reduction of inhibition of HMVEC migration. Taken together, during inflammation or cancer, CXCL11 processing by CD13 may lead to a reduced number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and in a more angiogenic environment.","Proost, Paul; Mortier, Anneleen; Loos, Tamara; Vandercappellen, Jo; Gouwy, Mieke; Ronsse, Isabelle; Schutyser, Evemie; Put, Willy; Parmentier, Marc; Struyf, Sofie; Van Damme, Jo",Blood,137,17

Only 33% of Ion-Aid-treated calves recovered; Revibe- and Life-Guard-treated calves had high recovery rates of 92% and 83%, respectively. The much higher recovery rates with Life-Guard and Revibe were attributed to the presence of an alkalizing agent in these preparations.

All the data were analyzed by descriptive epidemiology. RESULTS (1) The number of probable cases with contact history was significantly higher than the excluded cases. (2) The proportion of probable cases with contact history descended with epidemic development, but this situation did not occur in health care workers (HCWs). (3) The fatality rate of probable cases with contact history was significantly higher than the cases without contact history (OR = 1.489).

Poliovirus VP2 gene copy numbers were assessed by reverse transcription followed by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The mean zeta potential of the viruses was -20 mV. Relatively large numbers of polioviruses (10(3) or 4 x 10(3) TCID(50)/0.1 ml) could be removed by adsorption to the electrode, drastically decreasing TCID and copy numbers of poliovirus genome in the water. Virus elimination was dependent on electric current and time. Thus, the positively-charged carbon felt electrode effectively adsorbed polioviruses.

To analyse some clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of Covid-19 in the context of the Czech Republic and to compare them with the data from the most recent literature. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study analysed data on patients admitted to the IDC between 12 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The study cohort included 53 patients with Covid-19, 25 females and 28 males, with an average age of 57 years. The parameters analysed were clinical symptoms, average length of hospital stay, complications, and death. Additional data concerned the age, weight, smoking habits, history of comorbidities, and selected laboratory results. These data were compared between groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19. Finally, imaging findings, serology results, and therapy outcomes were studied. Statistical analysis was performed using the SigmaStat software. RESULTS Eleven (20.8%) patients had a mild course of the disease, 16 (30.2%) patients had a moderate course, 22 (41.5%) patients had a severe course, and four (7.5%) patients had a critical course. The study patients presented with the following clinical symptoms: fever in 88.5% of cases, cough in 84.6% of cases, difficulty breathing in 77.4% of cases, diarrhoea in 23.1% of cases, chest pain in 17.3% of cases, and anosmia in 11.5% of cases. The average length of hospital stay was eight days. The most common complication was a bacterial superinfection, reported in 17 (32.1%) study patients. The overall case fatality rate for Covid-19 in our study was 5.7%. The average age of the study cohort was 57 years, and patients with a severe course of the disease were of older average age than those with a less severe course of the disease (p < 0.05). The predominant comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The analysis of the baseline laboratory data showed significant differences between the groups of patients differing in severity of the course of Covid-19 in CRP, procalcitonin, and d-dimers but not in lymphocyte count. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs was performed in 22 patients, and 21 of them had typical findings for Covid-19. The average MuLBSTA score for Covid-19 pneumonia severity in our study cohort was 11.5 points and was not associated with the severity of the course of the disease. Serology tests were performed in 43 study patients, with 29 (67.4%) of them turning out positive in the first test and other five (11.6%) testing positive when retested. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was given experimentally as monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin (AZI) to 24 (45.3%) patients. Two patients on HCQ therapy also received inosinum pranobexum (isoprinosine) for severe lymphopenia, one patient received convalescent plasma, six patients were given AZI alone, and one patient was treated with inosinum pranobexum alone. Altogether 37.7% of study patients were prescribed other antibiotics for confirmed or suspected bacterial superinfection. Standard clinical and pharmaceutical care was provided to patients with particular focus on the safety of off-label drug use. HCQ was with drawn in three patients due to a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc). CONCLUSIONS In the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, our study patients showed comorbidities and risk factors which are consistent with the international literature, but the course of the disease was mostly moderate to severe, with a low proportion of critically ill patients and fatal outcomes. As soon as new information became available, new diagnostic and therapeutic options were introduced into routine practice. Based on our experience, we are well prepared for a possible second wave of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of the diagnostics, but the therapeutic options still remain very limited.","Bartovská, Z; Andrle, F; Beran, O; Zlámal, M; Řezáč, D; Murinova, I; Holub, M","Epidemiologie, mikrobiologie, imunologie : casopis Spolecnosti pro epidemiologii a mikrobiologii Ceske lekarske spolecnosti J.E.

191368,191368,191368,[The experimental coronavirus infection of monkeys].,12.615415,8.207688,1994,"Several related viral shell disorder (disorder of shell proteins of viruses) models were built using a disorder predictor via AI. The parent model detected the presence of high levels of disorder at the outer shell in viruses, for which vaccines are not available. Another model found correlations between inner shell disorder and viral virulence. A third model was able to positively correlate the levels of respiratory transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs). These models are linked together by the fact that they have uncovered two novel immune evading strategies employed by the various viruses. The first involve the use of highly disordered ""shape-shifting"" outer shell to prevent antibodies from binding tightly to the virus thus leading to vaccine failure. The second usually involves a more disordered inner shell that provides for more efficient binding in the rapid replication of viral particles before any host immune response. This ""Trojan horse"" immune evasion often backfires on the virus, when the viral load becomes too great at a vital organ, which leads to death of the host. Just as such virulence entails the viral load to exceed at a vital organ, a minimal viral load in the saliva/mucus is necessary for respiratory transmission to be feasible. As for the SARS-CoV-2, no high levels of disorder can be detected at the outer shell membrane (M) protein, but some evidence of correlation between virulence and inner shell (nucleocapsid, N) disorder has been observed. This suggests that not only the development of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, unlike HIV, HSV and HCV, is feasible but its attenuated vaccine strain can either be found in nature or generated by genetically modifying N.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A Keith; Foster, James A; Uversky, Vladimir N",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

DESIGN Retrospective chart analysis from the county hospital-sponsored disaster-relief clinic in large urban city, including a study of 239 patients with 292 PMR conditions. The total number of patients seen in the Astrodome Medical Clinic was 11,245. The Astrodome database was reviewed for PMR condition diagnostic codes. A retrospective chart analysis was conducted, including date of visit, age, gender, ethnicity, and PMR diagnosis category. Descriptive statistics were obtained for the entire sample. chi2 or t tests were used to determine gender, age, or date-of-service predominance for the most common diagnostic categories. RESULTS Mean +/- SD age was 45.7 +/- 14.3 yrs; 56% were women, 43% were men (1% unspecified), and 76% were African American. The majority (75%) of PMR conditions presented in the first week. Most frequent were swollen feet and legs (22%), leg pain and cramps (17%), headache (12%), and neck and back pain (10%). Persons with headaches were younger than those without (41.3 vs. 46.3 yrs, P = 0.048). Persons with neck and/or back pain were older than those without those conditions (51.3 vs. 44.8 yrs, P = 0.004). Women had more headaches (20.9%) than did men (6.7%, P = 0.002). There were no Caucasians with leg pain/cramps, whereas 20.2% of African Americans had this condition (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS This study documents the time of clinic presentation and most frequent types of PMR conditions of patients treated in the Astrodome Clinic after a historic hurricane. Most PMR conditions were treated by PMR personnel during the first week. Thus, future disaster planning should include PMR professionals as early responders.","Chiou-Tan, Faye Y; Bloodworth, Donna M; Kass, Joseph S; Li, Xiaoqi; Gavagan, Thomas F; Mattox, Kenneth; Rintala, Diana H",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,137,19

The spleen is the third most frequent localization of echinococcus after liver and lungs. Partial laparoscopic pericystectomy can be done without the loss of blood and scattering of scolexes with spleen preservation and conservation of its immune function. We present the patient with a large (1 8 x 16 x 12 cm) echinococcal cyst of the spleen that compressed the surrounding organs (stomach, transverse colon, pancreas and left kidney), and prevented normal passage causing vomiting after every meal. In this patient, PAIR procedure (puncture, aspiration, injection, reaspiration) and conservative treatment was attempted on several occasions without success. Finally, laparoscopic partial pericystectomy was performed, evacuating the contents of the cyst. The surgery lasted 120 minutes. Postoperatively the patient was without complications. Hospitalization lasted five days. Six months later, the patient is without problems. These echinococcus cysts of the spleen cannot be solved using PAIR technique and conservative treatment. Laparoscopic partial pericystectomy is a better solution than open surgery due to less trauma to the patient, especially in elderly people.","Busić, Zeljko; Kolovrat, Marijan; Ðuzel, Antonija; Rakić, Mislav; Cavka, Mislav; Begović, Amela; Kopljar, Mario; Patrlj, Leonardo",Lijecnicki vjesnik,137,31

Although immune responses have been shown to play an important role in demyelination, the precise effector mechanism(s) is unknown. Potentially autoreactive cytotoxic cells could contribute to the destruction. We tested whether an autoreactive cell induced by TMEV infection mediated cytotoxicity by using a 5-h (51)Cr release assay in SJL/J mice. Spleen cells from TMEV-infected mice were stimulated with irradiated TMEV antigen-presenting cells and used as effector cells. The effector cells differed from conventional cytotoxic T cells since these cells could kill both TMEV-infected and uninfected syngeneic or semisyngenic cell lines (PSJLSV and BxSF11gSV) but could not kill an allogeneic cell line (C57SV). The TMEV-induced autoreactive cells were also different from conventional natural killer (NK) cells or lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, because they could kill neither NK cell-sensitive YAC-1 nor NK cell-resistant P815 and EL4 cells. Induction of autoreactive cells was not detected in vaccinia virus infection. The autoreactive killing required direct cell-to-cell contact and was mediated by a Fas-FasL pathway but not by a perforin pathway. The phenotype of the killer cells was CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(+). Intracerebral inoculation of the effector cells into naive mice caused meningitis and perivascular cuffing not only in the brain parenchyma but also in the spinal cord, with no evidence of viral antigen-positive cells. This is the first report demonstrating that TMEV can induce autoreactive cytotoxic cells that induce central nervous system pathology.","Tsunoda, Ikuo; Kuang, Li-Qing; Fujinami, Robert S",Journal of virology,137,28

After recombination with an immunostimulatory sequence (ISS), the gene was cloned into the plasmid pIRES to produce pIRES-ISS-S1. On confirmation of the expression of S1 protein by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), after the transfection of pIRES-ISS-S1 into BHK-21 cells, the DNA vaccine was repeatedly administrated to BALB/c mice. CD4+ and CD8+ spleen T lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) to evaluate T cell-mediated immune responses, the antigen-specific responses of T cells were evaluated by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay, and the level of IgG in antisera from immunized mice was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed that the counts of spleen CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were increased, that the T cell-mediated immune responses showed antigen specificity, and that IgG was significantly induced with DNA vaccines pIRES-ISS-S1 and pIRES-S1 at titers of 1:320 and 1:160, respectively.

A high proportion of recently caught wild mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus (86%), mouse cytomegalovirus (79%), mouse thymic virus (78%), mouse adenovirus (68%), mouse parvovirus (59%) and minute virus of mice (41%). Seroprevalences of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), orthopoxvirus, reovirus-3 and murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4, also called murine gamma-herpesvirus [MHV-68]) were low (3-13%), and no animals were seropositive to Sendai virus, pneumonia virus or polyomavirus. Seroprevalence in wild-caught animals that had been in captivity for over six months was generally consistent with the range found in recently caught wild animals, while seroprevalence was generally much lower in captive-bred mice despite no attempt to prevent viral spread. A notable exception to this was LCMV, which appeared to have spread efficiently through the captive population (both captive-bred and wild-caught animals). Given the known viral life cycles in laboratory mice, it appears that viral persistence in the host was an important contributing factor in the spread of infection in captivity.","Becker, S D; Bennett, M; Stewart, J P; Hurst, J L",Laboratory animals,137,9

One of the more serious clinical phenotypes is secondary to mutations at IFN-γ receptor 1 gene, characterized by an early onset and more severe disease. CLINICAL REPORT We present a 3-month-old female patient with systemic M. tuberculosis complex who has a homozygous mutation, it affects the splicing site at IFNGR1 c.201-1G> T. At time of this report, she is with antimycobacterial treatment in the protocol of pluripotent hematopoietic cell transplantation (TCHP). CONCLUSION It has been reported that antiphimic treatment should be maintained until the immune system is restored by the TCHP. If patients receive THCP before the age of 1 year old, they have a better prognosis. Diminish the levels of IFN-γ in plasma before the procedure is associated to better results.","Martínez-Morales, María Cecilia; Deswarte, Carolina; Castañeda-Casimiro, Jessica; Bustamante, Jacinta; Blancas-Galicia, Lizbeth; Scheffler-Mendoza, Selma",Revista alergia Mexico,137,28

We performed a study on the aetiology of CAP and assessed possible implications for patient management in the Netherlands. METHODS Patients with CAP attending the emergency department of a general hospital were invited to participate in the study. We used an extensive combination of microbiological techniques to determine recent infection with respiratory pathogens. Furthermore, we collected data on clinical parameters and potential risk factors. RESULTS From November 2007 through January 2010, 339 patients were included. Single bacterial infection was found in 39% of these patients, single viral infection in 12%, and mixed bacterial-viral infection in 11%. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently identified pathogen (22%; n=74). Infection with atypical bacteria was detected in 69 (20%) of the patients. CONCLUSION Initial empirical antibiotics should be effective against S. pneumoniae, the most common pathogen identified in CAP patients. The large proportion of patients with infection with atypical bacteria points to the need for improved diagnostic algorithms including atypical bacteria, especially since these atypical bacteria are not covered by the first-choice antibiotic treatment according to the recently revised Dutch guidelines on the management of CAP.","van Gageldonk-Lafeber, A B; Wever, P C; van der Lubben, I M; de Jager, C P C; Meijer, A; de Vries, M C; Elberse, K; van der Sande, M A B; van der Hoek, W",The Netherlands journal of medicine,137,17

Internal initiation of protein synthesis occurs without any requirement for viral proteins. Furthermore, it is maintained when host cell protein synthesis is almost abolished. By using in vitro translation systems, two distinct families of IRES elements which have very different predicted RNA secondary structures have been defined. The cardiovirus and aphthovirus elements function very efficiently in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, whereas the enterovirus and rhinovirus elements function poorly in this system. However, supplementation of this translation system with additional cellular proteins can stimulate translation directed by the enterovirus and rhinovirus RNAs and reduce production of aberrant initiation products. The characterization of cellular proteins interacting with the picornavirus IRES is a major focus of research. Many different protein species can be observed to interact with regions of the IRES by in vitro analyses, e.g., UV cross-linking. However, the function and significance of many of these interactions are not always known. For two proteins, La and the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, evidence has been obtained for a functional role of their interaction with IRES elements.","Belsham, G J; Sonenberg, N",Microbiological reviews,137,1

Due to COVID-19, participation in wellness programs for this population has been restricted. To provide program participants with continued accessibility, one regional wellness program for adults with disabilities adopted a virtual format. The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of a virtual wellness program for this population. METHODS Study subjects consisted of adults with disabilities who participated in a regional virtual wellness program. A survey was developed and disseminated electronically to study participants through Qualtrics software. Part 1 of the survey included demographic information, while Part 2 surveyed participants' perceptions and satisfaction with the virtual program using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS 10 out of 14 participants responded to the survey. Results indicated that the majority (80%) of participants utilized the program at least 1-2 times/week. All participants reported that, despite preferring in-person wellness classes, they were satisfied with the virtual format of the program. Positive responses were also reported for survey items related to self-perceived health and functional benefits from participation, degree of staff and peer support offered through virtual means, ease of technology use, and the degree of safety within the virtual environment. DISCUSSION Given the health status of adults with disabilities during an ongoing global pandemic, continued restrictions limiting participation with in-person wellness programs is anticipated. Virtual formats may offer an advantageous solution to provide adults with disabilities with continued access to this essential programming. While the current study showed positive self-perceived health and functional benefits from participation, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of this format through expanded and standardized objective outcome measures and to better understand factors that may impact participation.","Roca, Courtney",Journal of allied health,137,4

METHODS (1) Two hospitalized community acquired SARS cases with their clinical data and epidemiologically linked transmission clusters in our hospital were analyzed; (2) The clinical data from 41 SARS cases were summarized. RESULTS (1) The contagiousness of SARS virus in SARS patients was extremely strong, especially in their acute stage. (2) The majority of clinical manifestations were fever (100% cases), and there were no obvious respiratory symptoms in more than half of the patients (53.7%) at early SARS stage (day 1 to day 3), accompanied by leucopenia(52.6%) and lymphopenia (68.4%). (3) Timely administration of Ribavirin, Methylprednisolone, immunoenhancer (such as interferon alpha-2b, thymosin-alpha1) to SARS patients was efficacious to certain extent in controlling the development of the disease. CONCLUSION It is very important for clinicians to pay great attention to protect themselves from infection of SARS. Early discovery of SARS, early isolation of SARS patients, and early treatment are very helpful to improving patient's prognosis and controlling SARS overspread.","Gao, Zhan-cheng; Zhu, Ji-hong; Sun, Yan; Ding, Xiu-lan; Ma, Ji-shun; Cui, Yu-xian; Du, Xiang-ke; Gao, Tong; He, Quan-ying",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,137,19

METHODS The clinical data of 108 SARS in-patients were analyzed. RESULTS Among the 108 cases, 35 males (32.4%) and 73 females (67.6%), aged 37 +/- 9 (range 13 approximately 83 years), most were white-collar workers, medical workers accounting for 28.7%. 87.0% had a definite contact history. 20.4% were complicated by other internal diseases. The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough, pectoralgia, chest distress, headache, etc. Involvement of multiple organs was often. The incubation period was 2 approximately 14 days. The course included early stage, progressive stage, climax, and convalescence. Mild type accounted for 4.6%, common type 39.8%, severe type 20.4%, and extremely severe type 35.2%. At the early stage, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count and ratio of lymphocyte, proalbumin, transferring, CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) cell count were remarkably decreased, and C-reactive protein, alpha-acid glycoprotein, and alpha(2)-globulin were remarkably increased. X-ray chest film showed solitary or multiple local exudative changes, mostly in pulmonary lower field. During the progressive stage the hyaline or consolidation images were enlarged. High solution CT showed solitary or multiple cotton wadding like images and ground glass-like or consolidation images. Hypoxemia was common. At the progressive stage application of adrenocortical hormones and non-invasive mechanical ventilation helped stop the progress of disease. Ninety-four cases were discharged, 14 cases died. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) regards SARS as one of epidemic febrile diseases. Treatment by combination of TCM and Western medicine was effective. CONCLUSION SARS mainly affects youth and people in their prime of life. It has its own characteristic clinical manifestations. The classification system of 5 types and 4 stages helps judge the condition. Treatment by combination of TCM and Western medicine is encouraged.","Zhao, Chun-hui; Guo, Yan-bin; Wu, Hao; Li, Xiu-hui; Guo, Xin-hui; Jin, Rong-hua; Dign, Hui-guo; Meng, Qing-hua; Lang, Zhen-wei; Wang, Wei; Yan, Hui-ping; Huang, Chun; Liu, De-gong",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,137,28

This study aimed to compare outcome of diathermy and scalpel in RELIF procedure in PSD surgery. METHODS Patients undergoing RELIF procedure due to PSD at Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital between January 2012 and September 2012 were randomly assigned to diathermy (n=30) or scalpel (n=30) groups. The primary outcomes measured were duration of operation, drainage volume, postoperative numerical pain intensity scale (NPIS) scores, complications, duration of hospitalization length and time to return to daily activity. RESULTS The mean age was 26.2 years (17-44 years). The mean operation duration was significantly lower in diathermy group (p=0.0001). Postoperative total NPIS score within the first 24 h was significantly lower in diathermy group (p=0.001). However, there were not any significant differences in term of NPIS scores in day 3 and day 7. There were no significant differences in terms of total drain output, drain removal time and length of hospital stay. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of duration to sit comfortably, return to daily activity and work. Recurrence of PSD was emerged in one patient in the diathermy group. CONCLUSION Diathermy dissection in RELIF procedure in pilonidal sinus surgery is a safe technique and decreased operation time and postoperative pain.","Das, Koray; Uzun, Abdurrahman Selcuk; Bozkurt, Hilmi; Karateke, Faruk; Menekse, Ebru; Nacar, Halil; Ozdogan, Mehmet",Annali italiani di chirurgia,137,1

In striking contrast to the influenza C virus enzyme, the MHV-S esterase was unable to release acetate from bovine submandibulary gland mucin. Furthermore, MHV-S could not remove influenza C virus receptors from erythrocytes. Analysis with free sialic acid derivatives revealed that the MHV-S HE protein specifically de-O-acetylates 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetyl sialic acid (Neu4, 5Ac2) but not 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl sialic acid (Neu5,9Ac2), which is the major substrate for esterases of influenza C virus and bovine coronaviruses. In addition, the MHV-S esterase converted glycosidically bound Neu4,5Ac2 of guinea pig serum glycoproteins to Neu5Ac. By expression of the MHV esterase with recombinant vaccinia virus and incubation with guinea pig serum, we demonstrated that the viral HE possesses sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity. In addition to observed enzymatic activity, MHV-S exhibited affinity to guinea pig and horse serum glycoproteins. Binding required sialate-4-O-acetyl groups and was abolished by chemical de-O-acetylation. Since Neu4,5Ac2 has not been identified in mice, the nature of potential substrates and/or secondary receptors for MHV-S in the natural host remains to be determined. The esterase of MHV-S is the first example of a viral enzyme with high specificity and affinity toward 4-O-acetylated sialic acids.","Regl, G; Kaser, A; Iwersen, M; Schmid, H; Kohla, G; Strobl, B; Vilas, U; Schauer, R; Vlasak, R",Journal of virology,137,1

The authors aimed to investigate the changes in cerebral oxygenation and haemoglobin concentration and their associations during paediatric cardiac surgery in order to elucidate the physiology underlying cerebral deoxygenation. An observational retrospective study on 399 patients who underwent paediatric cardiac surgery was conducted. With use of NIRS, cerebral oxygen saturation as expressed by tissue oxygen index (TOI) before and after surgery, concentration changes in oxygenated haemoglobin (Δ[HbO2]) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (Δ[HHb]) after surgery were studied as were the associations between these values and clinical variables. TOI decreased after surgery (preoperative versus postoperative value, 66.0% [56.9, 71.3] versus 63.2% [54.3, 69.4], median [25th, 75th percentile], P <0.001) and the decrease was greater in higher category groups in the Risk Adjusted Classification for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1).

A great uncertainty is associated with the disease progression, as the risk of severe COVID-19 is not uniform among all the patients. Systemic inflammation has been reported as a predictor for COVID-19 outcomes. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers are shown to be associated with endothelial dysfunction, cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19. There is a growing body of evidence, that these findings exert influence in the causation of mortality in patients with severe Covid-19. The present study is carried out with an aim to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients by interrelating their clinical severity with inflammatory markers and CT (Computed tomography) severity score (CTSS). OBJECTIVES The aim of the study is to correlate COVID-19 severity with inflammatory markers and CT severity score. We also aim to determine the optimal cut-off values for inflammatory markers and CT severity scores in order to establish their interrelationship to the disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS It is a hospital-based retrospective observational study. The study was conducted over a period of four months (July 2020 to October 2020) based on data obtained from the records of patients, admitted with a laboratory confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection. The current study included a total of 84 patients, admitted to ICU with the severe COVID-19.Study tools included serum CRP, serum ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 25-point CT severity score obtained from HRCT (high resolution computerized tomography) chest. RESULTS Out of 84 patients recruited, 54 patients were survivors and 30 patients were non-survivors (deceased). 78% of the study population was male and 22% was female. For survivors, average CTSS was 12.43 ± 5.7 and whereas average CTSS for non-survivors was 18.87 ± 4.68(p<0001). Average D-dimer was 2.5 ± 1.43 in the survivor group and 3.39 ± 0.95 for non-survivors (p<0.004). Correlation coefficient of CTSS with FiO2 is 0.685 (p<0.0001). The optimal cut-off value for predicting mortality for D-dimer is >2.4 (p<0.0012) and for CTSS is >15 (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION The disease severity was significantly correlated with CTSS and D- dimer. Severe COVID-19 was also associated with a high NLR (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio) and moderately elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, Ferritin, IL-6).

Here, we describe the development and validation of an oligonucleotide resequencing array for interrogating the entire 30-kb SARS-CoV genome in a rapid, cost-effective fashion. Using this platform, we sequenced SARS-CoV genomes from Vero cell culture isolates of 12 patients and directly from four patient tissues. The sequence obtained from the array is highly reproducible, accurate (>99.99% accuracy) and capable of identifying known and novel variants of SARS-CoV. Notably, we applied this technology to a field specimen of probable SARS and rapidly deduced its infectious source. We demonstrate that array-based resequencing-by-hybridization is a fast, reliable, and economical alternative to capillary sequencing for obtaining SARS-CoV genomic sequence on a population scale, making this an ideal platform for the global monitoring of SARS-CoV and other small-genome pathogens.","Wong, Christopher W; Albert, Thomas J; Vega, Vinsensius B; Norton, Jason E; Cutler, David J; Richmond, Todd A; Stanton, Lawrence W; Liu, Edison T; Miller, Lance D",Genome research,137,28

The occurrence of possible mixed bacterial-viral infections is unknown. METHODS We searched for viruses in leukemic children with blood culture-positive bacterial infections. The prospective multicenter survey included 156 febrile episodes in 51 children with acute leukemia. The mean follow-up time was 1.5 years per patient (27,743 patient-days at risk). Sixteen viruses were searched for from nasal swab and stool samples using virus culture, virus antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction tests. RESULTS Bacterial blood cultures were positive in 19 (11%) febrile episodes among 17 children. In half of the septic episodes (11 of 19), a virus was also found. Rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common viruses detected.

METHODS The age of 32 patients ranged from 19 to 72 years, the average was 43.06 years. Among them, 13 patients were having serious primary diseases, i.e. cardio-cerebral-vascular disease in 9 patients, diabetes in 2 patients, renal dysfunction in 1 patient, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 1 patient. The treatment included antiviral agents, glucocorticoid, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and immunologic enhancement, etc. Cure rate, mortality and complications were analyzed. RESULTS Among 32 patients, 24 were cured, 2 died of respiratory failure, 6 died of their primary diseases, and the overall mortality was 25.00 percent. Superimposed infection occurred in 12 patients, and among 17 patients who required noninvasive ventilation, 3 patients were complicated by lung injury (mediastinal emphysema, pneumothorax). In addition, hyperglycemia was found in 4 patients, upper intestinal hemorrhage occurred in another 4 patients and cardiac failure occurred in 6 patients. CONCLUSION The treatment of the pre-existing diseases should be emphasized in the treatment of critical SARS. Glucocorticoid should not be used for a long-term. Vigilance should be paid to avoid lung injury during mechanical ventilation.","Lu, Wei; Zhang, Hong-sheng; Wang, Feng-mei; Wang, Shao-jun; Wu, Xiao-di; Zhang, Na-xin; Kan, Zhi-chao; Qin, Ying-zhi; Xiao, Lang",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,137,12

Specimens originated from one to eight week old turkey poults, with mild to severe diarrhea, from 114 flocks in 42 commercial operations located in southern Quebec. The acute phase of enteritis occurred usually in poults between two and four weeks of age. Clarified intestinal contents were examined by direct electron microscopy and enzyme immunoassays. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed with antisera to bovine rotavirus group antigen, avian reovirus types 1 to 5, and the prototype strain of the turkey enteric coronavirus. The presence of viruses could be demonstrated by electron microscopy in 55.3% of the specimens, and at least five different viruses were incriminated either alone or in combination. The coronavirus was by far the most common enteric virus with a prevalence of 47.5%. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, rotavirus, reovirus and turkey coronavirus were detected in 14.5%, 18.1% and 61.4% of the specimens, respectively.

At the same time, Brazil's health system has struggled to ensure equitable and quality health services. One response to the broad promises and notable shortcomings has been a sharp rise in right-to-health litigation, most often seeking access to medicines. While much has been written about the characteristics of patient-plaintiffs and the requested medicines in right-to-health litigation in Brazil, little research has examined potential community-level and institutional drivers of judicialization and their role as mechanisms of accountability. To explore these dimensions, we used a mixed-effects analytical model to examine a representative sample of lawsuits for access to medicines filed against the state of Rio Grande do Sul in 2008. We found that the presence of a Public Defender's Office was associated with a sevenfold increase in the likelihood of a municipality having a medicine-requesting lawsuit. This effect was maintained after controlling for a series of municipality characteristics. As low- and middle-income countries seek to achieve universal health coverage within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals, Brazil's experience may be illustrative of the challenges that health systems will face and the institutional mechanisms that will emerge, advancing accountability and individual patients' interests in response.","Socal, Mariana P; Amon, Joseph J; Biehl, João",Health and human rights,137,5

Based on similarities in genome organization and protein expression, the arteriviruses have recently been grouped together with the coronaviruses and toroviruses in the newly established order Nidovirales. Previously, we reported the construction of pEDI, a full-length cDNA copy of EAV DI-b, a natural defective interfering (DI) RNA of 5.6 kb (R. Molenkamp et al., J. Virol. 74:3156-3165, 2000). EDI RNA consists of three noncontiguous parts of the EAV genome fused in frame with respect to the replicase gene. As a result, EDI RNA contains a truncated replicase open reading frame (EDI-ORF) and encodes a truncated replicase polyprotein. Since some coronavirus DI RNAs require the presence of an ORF for their efficient propagation, we have analyzed the importance of the EDI-ORF in EDI RNA replication. The EDI-ORF was disrupted at different positions by the introduction of frameshift mutations. These were found either to block DI RNA replication completely or to be removed within one virus passage, probably due to homologous recombination with the helper virus genome. Using recombination assays based on EDI RNA and full-length EAV genomes containing specific mutations, the rates of homologous RNA recombination in the 3'- and 5'-proximal regions of the EAV genome were studied. Remarkably, the recombination frequency in the 5'-proximal region was found to be approximately 100-fold lower than that in the 3'-proximal part of the genome.","Molenkamp, R; Greve, S; Spaan, W J; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,137,16

During the initial course of the disease, COVID-19 was perceived as a pneumonia-like illness. However, recent findings of COVID-19 patients suggest that the virus has the potential to disseminate to different tissues and organs, and cause significant complications. SUMMARY: Neurological symptoms are of great significance as these usually present in and complicate critical cases. Many case reports and case series have documented the findings of neurological complications in COVID-19 patients. From the existing data, the most frequent symptoms in these patients were broadly classified into the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system, and skeletal muscular symptoms. CNS symptoms include meningitis, encephalitis, cerebrovascular complications, peripheral nervous system symptoms include anosmia, ageusia, and skeletal muscular symptoms include myalgias. It is postulated that the cause may be direct CNS injury through blood and neuronal pathways or indirectly because of an immune-mediated response, hypoxia caused by decreased oxygen saturation, or by the binding of subacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors. Striking radiologic findings in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms have also emerged. CONCLUSIONS: As subacute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 may potentially have lethal implications on the nervous system, it is important that neurologists are better informed about the spectrum of clinical manifestations, radiologic findings, and likely mechanisms of injury. Understanding the symptoms and radiologic imaging allows clinicians to consider brain imaging in any patient with suspected COVID-19 and neurological symptoms.","Khan, Alizay R; Farooqui, Muhammad O; Jatoi, Nadia N; Jawaid, Samreen; Mahdi, Danial; Khosa, Faisal",Neurologist,137,15

The study period was from database inception until December 31, 2020. The data was downloaded from Scopus as a ""csv"" file. The data was analyzed to reveal prominent contributing countries, institution, authorship patterns, the degree of collaboration, international research collaboration, prominent sources for publications, frequent author keywords, the impact of research in terms of citations, and healthcare groups targeted in research. Results: In total, 4576 records were retrieved. The analysis revealed an increasing growth in number of publications with time. There was a sharp peak in 2020. Recent literature on e-learning in health education included keywords such as flipped classroom, mobile learning, blended learning, and COVID-19. Countries in the European region and the region of the Americas have the highest contribution while countries in the African and the South-East Asian region have the least contribution. There was an increasing trend in the degree of author collaboration with time. However, the extent of international research collaboration was inadequate. The USA had the least percentage of documents with international authors (18%) while Sweden had the highest (70.6%). Documents published from Canada had the highest number of citations per document. The Karolinska Institute, based in Sweden, was the most active institution.

Objective: This is a case report on the rapid implementation of a telehealth hub at an academic nurse-managed community clinic in response to the national COVID-19 emergency. We also identify factors of success and challenges associated with the transition to telehealth. Methods: This study was conducted at the George Mason University Mason and Partners clinic, which serves the dual mission of caring for community clinic patients and providing health professional education. We interviewed the leadership team of Mason and Partners clinics and summarized our findings. Results: Mason and Partners clinics reacted quickly to the COVID-19 crisis and transitioned to telehealth within 2 weeks of the statewide lockdown. Protocols were developed for a coordination hub, a main patient triage and appointment telephone line, a step-by-step flowchart of clinical procedure, and a team structure with clearly defined work roles and backups. The clinics were able to maintain most of its clinical service and health education functions while adapting to new clinic duties that arose during the pandemic. Conclusions: The experiences learned from the Mason and Partners clinics are transferable to other safety net clinics and academic nurse-led community clinics.

In addition, increased importance of health concerns when making food choices (OR = 1.34, p < .005) as well as more frequent cooking (OR = 1.35, p < .001), and greater avoidance of supermarkets (OR = 1.15, p = .049) were associated with greater probability of less food waste. Scarcity and greater reliance on cooking may encourage individuals to reflect on food waste practices. Further research should explore how these factors may be targeted to reduce food waste beyond the pandemic.","Rodgers, Rachel F; Lombardo, Caterina; Cerolini, Silvia; Franko, Debra L; Omori, Mika; Linardon, Jake; Guillaume, Sebastien; Fischer, Laura; Tyszkiewicz, Matthew Fuller-",Appetite,137,11

Both courses of action have been shown to be critical to the success of epidemic control. Under this scenario, the timely adoption of effective strategies allows the outbreak to be decelerated at early stages. The objective of this study is to present an epidemic model specially tailored for the study of the COVID-19 epidemics, and the model is aimed at allowing the integrated study of epidemic control strategies and dimensioning of the required medical infrastructure. Along with the theoretical model, a case study with three prognostic scenarios is presented for the first wave of the epidemic in the city of Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas state, Brazil. Although the temporary collapse of the medical infrastructure is hardly avoidable in the state-of-affairs at this time (April 2020), the results show that there are feasible control strategies that could substantially reduce the overload within reasonable time. Furthermore, this study delivers and presents an intuitive, straightforward, free, and open-source online platform that allows the direct application of the model. The platform can hopefully provide better response time and clarity to the planning of contingency measures.","Grzybowski, J.M.V.; Da Silva, R. V.; Rafikov, M.",Math. Probl. Eng.,137,13

We review the broader literature on TNF to rationalize why abruptly-acquired neurodegenerative states do not exhibit the remorseless clinical progression seen in those states with gradual onsets. We propose that the three typically non-worsening neurodegenerative syndromes, post-stroke, post-traumatic brain injury (TBI), and post cardiac arrest, usually become and remain static because of excess cerebral TNF induced by the initial dramatic peak keeping microglia chronically activated through an autocrine loop of microglial activation through excess cerebral TNF. The existence of this autocrine loop rationalizes post-damage repair with perispinal etanercept and proposes a treatment for cerebral aspects of COVID-19 chronicity. Another insufficiently considered aspect of cerebral proinflammatory cytokines is the fitness of the endogenous cerebral anti-TNF system provided by norepinephrine (NE), generated and distributed throughout the brain from the locus coeruleus (LC). We propose that an intact LC, and therefore an intact NE-mediated endogenous anti-cerebral TNF system, plus the DAMP (damage or danger-associated molecular pattern) input having diminished, is what allows post-stroke, post-TBI, and post cardiac arrest patients a strong long-term survival advantage over Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease sufferers. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease patients remorselessly worsen, being handicapped by sustained, accumulating, DAMP and PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) input, as well as loss of the LC-origin, NE-mediated, endogenous anti-cerebral TNF system. Adrenergic receptor agonists may counter this.","Clark, I A; Vissel, B",J Alzheimers Dis,137,16

We aim to characterize the prevalence and clinical implications of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-centre study involving patients admitted between January 16th and March 10th 2020. The composite endpoint was defined as the presence of at least one of the following, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: A total of 472 consecutive cases admitted to 51 certified COVID-19 tertiary care hospitals were enrolled (median age was 43 [32-53.5] years and 53.0% were male). There were 101 (21.4%) patients presented with comorbidities, including hypertension (15.0%), diabetes mellitus (7.8%), coronary artery disease (2.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.3%) and cerebrovascular disease (1.9%). The composite endpoint occurred in 65 (13.8%) patients. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.85, per 10-year increment), antecedent hypertension (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.09-7.29), neutrophil counts (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.14-1.56) and lactate dehydrogenase level (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01) were independently associated with the presence of composite endpoint. Hypertensive patients, compared with controls, had a greater chance of experiencing the composite endpoint (p < .001) and each individual endpoint, i.e. ICU admission (p < .001), mechanical ventilation (p < .001) and death (p = .012). In the stepwise regression analysis of anti-hypertensive medications, none of the therapy predicted the composite endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. KEY MESSAGES Hypertension was identified as the comorbidity associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 in this retrospective cohort. Patients with hypertension could experience an increased risk of the composite endpoint.

In this paper we identify and describe the multiple causes of fragmentation in development assistant for health at the global level. The study is of particular relevance since the emergence of new global health problems such as COVID-19 heightens the need for global health actors to work in coordinated ways. Our study is part of the Lancet Commission on Synergies between Universal Health Coverage, Health Security and Health Promotion. METHODS: We used a mixed methods approach. This consisted of a non-systematic literature review of published papers in scientific journals, reports, books and websites. We also carried out twenty semi-structured expert interviews with individuals from bilateral and multilateral organisations, governments and academic and research institutions between April 2019 and December 2019. RESULTS: We identified five distinct yet interconnected sets of factors causing fragmentation: proliferation of global health actors; problems of global leadership; divergent interests; problems of accountability; problems of power relations. We explain why global health actors struggle to harmonise their approaches and priorities, fail to align their work with low- and middle-income countries' needs and why they continue to embrace funding instruments that create fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Many global actors are genuinely committed to addressing the problems of fragmentation, despite their complexity and interconnected nature. This paper aims to raise awareness and understanding of the causes of fragmentation and to help guide actors' efforts in addressing the problems and moving to more synergistic approaches.","Spicer, Neil; Agyepong, Irene; Ottersen, Trygye; Jahn, Albrecht; Ooms, Gorik",Global Health,137,1

Re-usable elastomeric respirators may provide a suitable alternative. Proprietary elastomeric respirator filters may become depleted as demand increases. An alternative may be the virus/bacterial filters used in anaesthesia circuits, if they can be adequately fitted onto the elastomeric respirators. In addition, many re-usable elastomeric respirators do not filter exhaled breaths. If used for sterile procedures, this would also require modification. We designed a 3D-printed adaptor that permits elastomeric respirators to interface with anaesthesia circuit filters and created a simple modification to divert exhaled breaths through the filter. We conducted a feasibility study evaluating the performance of our modified elastomeric respirators. A convenience sample of eight volunteers was recruited. Quantitative fit testing, respiratory rate and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded during fit testing exercises and after 1 h of wear. All eight volunteers obtained excellent quantitative fit testing throughout the trial. The mean (SD) end-tidal carbon dioxide was 4.5 (0.5) kPa and 4.6 (0.4) kPa at baseline and after 1 h of wear (p = 0.148). The mean (SD) respiratory rate was 17 (4) breaths.min-1 and 17 (3) breaths.min-1 at baseline and after 1 h of wear (p = 0.435).

The secondary aim is to investigate associations between app quality and adoption. Finally, app features contributing to higher app quality were identified. METHODS: Eligible COVID-19 contact tracing apps were those released by national health authorities of European Union member states, former member states, and countries of the European Free Trade Association, all countries with comparable legal standards concerning personal data protection and app use voluntariness. The Mobile App Rating Scale was used to assess app quality. An interdisciplinary team, consisting of two health and two human-computer interaction scientists, independently conducted Mobile App Rating Scale ratings. To investigate associations between app quality and adoption rates and infection rates, Bayesian linear regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We discovered 21 national COVID-19 contact tracing apps, all demonstrating high quality overall and high-level functionality, aesthetics, and information quality.

Lower levels of engagement-oriented app design were detected, with substantial variations between apps. By regression analyses, the best-case adoption rate was calculated by assuming apps achieve the highest ratings. The mean best-case adoption rates for engagement and overall app quality were 39.5% and 43.6%, respectively. Higher adoption rates were associated with lower cumulative infection rates. Overall, we identified 5 feature categories (symptom assessment and monitoring, regularly updated information, individualization, tracing, and communication) and 14 individual features that contributed to higher app quality. These 14 features were a symptom checker, a symptom diary, statistics on COVID-19, app use, public health instructions and restrictions, information of burden on health care system, assigning personal data, regional updates, control over tracing activity, contact diary, venue check-in, chats, helplines, and app-sharing capacity. CONCLUSIONS: European national health authorities have generally released high quality COVID-19 contact tracing apps, with regard to functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the app's engagement-oriented design generally was of lower quality, even though regression analyses results identify engagement as a promising optimization target to increase adoption rates.

These 14 features were a symptom checker, a symptom diary, statistics on COVID-19, app use, public health instructions and restrictions, information of burden on health care system, assigning personal data, regional updates, control over tracing activity, contact diary, venue check-in, chats, helplines, and app-sharing capacity. CONCLUSIONS: European national health authorities have generally released high quality COVID-19 contact tracing apps, with regard to functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the app's engagement-oriented design generally was of lower quality, even though regression analyses results identify engagement as a promising optimization target to increase adoption rates. Associations between higher app adoption and lower infection rates are consistent with simulation study results, albeit acknowledging that app use might be part of a broader set of protective attitudes and behaviors for self and others. Various features were identified that could guide further engagement-enhancing app development.","Kahnbach, Leonie; Lehr, Dirk; Brandenburger, Jessica; Mallwitz, Tim; Jent, Sophie; Hannibal, Sandy; Funk, Burkhardt; Janneck, Monique",J Med Internet Res,137,8

Studies have shown that PDCoV uses a conserved region of the aminopeptidase N protein to infect cell lines derived from multiple species, including humans, pigs, and chickens. Because PDCoV is a potential zoonotic pathogen, investigations of its prevalence in humans and its contribution to human disease continue. We report experimental PDCoV infection and subsequent transmission among poultry. In PDCoV-inoculated chicks and turkey poults, we observed diarrhea, persistent viral RNA titers from cloacal and tracheal samples, PDCoV-specific serum IgY antibody responses, and antigen-positive cells from intestines.","Boley, Patricia A; Alhamo, Moyasar A; Lossie, Geoffrey; Yadav, Kush Kumar; Vasquez-Lee, Marcia; Saif, Linda J; Kenney, Scott P",Emerg Infect Dis,137,16

METHODS: A group of behavioural and social scientists advising the UK government on COVID-19 contributed to the analysis and writing of advice through the Government Office for Science. The question was as follows: What are the options for increasing adherence to social distancing (staying at home except for essential journeys and work) and shielding vulnerable people (keeping them at home and away from others)? This was prior to social distancing legislation being implemented. The first two authors produced a draft, based on analysis of the current government guidance and the application of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework to identify and evaluate the options. RESULTS: For promoting social distancing, 10 options were identified for improving adherence. They covered improvements in ways of achieving the BCW intervention types of education, persuasion, incentivization, and coercion. For promoting shielding of vulnerable people, four options were identified covering the BCW intervention types of incentivization, coercion, and enablement. CONCLUSIONS: Responding to policymakers very rapidly as has been necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by using a framework to structure the thinking and reporting of multidisciplinary academics and policymakers.","Michie, Susan; West, Robert; Rogers, M Brooke; Bonell, Chris; Rubin, G James; Amlôt, Richard",Br J Health Psychol,137,16

In the current threat landscape, a targeted phishing attack (i.e., spear phishing) often constitutes the first action of a threat actor during an intrusion campaign. To tackle this threat, many data-driven approaches have been proposed, which mostly rely on the use of supervised machine learning under a single-layer approach. However, such approaches are resource-demanding and, thus, their deployment in production environments is infeasible. Moreover, most previous works utilise a feature set that can be easily tampered with by adversaries. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-layered detection framework in which a potential phishing domain is classified multiple times by models using different feature sets. In our work, an additional classification takes place only when the initial one scores below a predefined confidence level, which is set by the system owner. We demonstrate our approach by implementing a two-layered detection system, which uses supervised machine learning to identify phishing attacks. We evaluate our system with a dataset consisting of active phishing attacks and find that its performance is comparable to the state of the art.","Rendall, Kieran; Nisioti, Antonia; Mylonas, Alexios",,137,30

Furthermore, it has brought the whole planet to a halt as a result of the worldwide introduction of lockdown and killed millions of people. While this virus has a low fatality rate, the problem is that it is highly infectious, and as a result, it has infected a large number of people, putting a strain on the healthcare system, hence, Covid-19 identification in patients has become critical. The goal of this research is to use X-rays images and computed tomography(CT) images to introduce a deep learning strategy based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect and identify the Covid-19 disease. We have implemented two different classifications using CNN(binary classification and multiclass classification). A total of 3,877 image datasets from CTs and X-rays were utilised to train the model in binary classification, with 1,917 images from Covid-19 infected individuals among them. The experimental results for binary classification show an overall accuracy of 99.64%, recall(or sensitivity) of 99.58%, the precision of 99.56%, F1-score of 99.59%, and ROC of 100%. For multiple classifications, the model was trained using a total of 6,077 images, with 1,917 images of Covid-19 infected people, 1,960 images of normal healthy people, and 2,200 images of pneumonia infected people. The experimental results for multiple classifications show an accuracy of 98.28%, recall(or sensitivity) of 98.25%, the precision of 98.22%, F1-score of 98.23%, and ROC of 99.87%.

Such adaptation is not likely to have emerged suddenly but, instead, may have evolved step by step with each step favored by natural selection. It is thus necessary to develop a theory about the origin in order to guide the search. Here, we propose such a model whereby evolution occurs in both the virus and the hosts (where the evolution is somatic; i.e., in the immune system). The hosts comprise three groups - the wild animal hosts, the nearby human population, and farther-away human populations. The theory suggests that the conditions under which the pandemic has initially evolved are: (i) an abundance of wild animals in the place of origin (PL0); (ii) a nearby human population of low density; (iii) frequent and long-term animal-human contacts to permit step-by-step evolution; and (iv) a level of herd immunity in the animal and human hosts. In this model, the evolving virus may have regularly spread out of PL0 although such invasions often fail, leaving sporadic cases of early infections. The place of the first epidemic (PL1), where humans are immunologically naïve to the virus, is likely a distance away from PL0. Finally, this current model is only a first attempt and more theoretical models can be expected to guide the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.","Ruan, Yongsen; Wen, Haijun; He, Xionglei; Wu, Chung-I",,137,26

As a method to measure public preparedness, we sought to explore the association between public interest in preventive measures and the easing of SAH orders - specifically the increases in COVID-19 cases and fatalities after the orders expired. METHODS: Search volume was collected from Google Trends for ""hand sanitizer,"" ""social distancing,"" ""COVID testing,"" and ""contact tracing"" for each state. Bivariate correlations were computed to analyze associations between public interest in preventive measures, changes in confirmed COVID-19 cases after SAH expirations, COVID-19 case-fatality rates, and by-state presidential voting percentages. RESULTS: A higher interest in preventive measures was associated with lower rates of confirmed cases after SAH orders had expired (r = -0.33), higher state-wide deaths per capita (r = 0.42), and case-fatality rates (r = 0.60). Moderate to strong negative correlations were found between states' percentage of voters supporting the Republican nominee in 2016 and proportion of queries for average preventive measures (r = -0.77). CONCLUSION: Our investigation shows that increased public interest in COVID-19 prevention was associated with longer SAH orders and less COVID-19 cases after the SAH orders' expiration; however, it was also associated with higher case-fatality rates.","Hartwell, Micah; Greiner, Benjamin; Kilburn, Zach; Ottwell, Ryan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,137,14

Although older patients with preexisting chronic illnesses are more prone to develop severe complications, younger, healthy individuals might also exhibit serious manifestations. Previous studies directed to detect genetic susceptibility factors for earlier epidemics have provided evidence of certain protective variations. Following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, viral entry into cells followed by recognition and response by the innate immunity are key determinants of COVID-19 development. In the present review our aim was to conduct a thorough review of the literature on the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as key agents affecting the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity. Several SNPs within the scope of our approach were found to alter susceptibility to various bacterial and viral infections. Additionally, a multitude of studies confirmed genetic associations between the analyzed genes and autoimmune diseases, underlining the versatile immune consequences of these variants. Based on confirmed associations it is highly plausible that the SNPs affecting viral entry and innate immunity might confer altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complex clinical consequences. Anticipating several COVID-19 genomic susceptibility loci based on the ongoing genome wide association studies, our review also proposes that a well-established polygenic risk score would be able to clinically leverage the acquired knowledge.","Grolmusz, Vince Kornél; Bozsik, Anikó; Papp, János; Patócs, Attila",Front Immunol,137,29

Covid-19 has high ability of transmission from human to another human, and due to its fast spread globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Covid-19 is pandemic disease on March 11, 2020. Several articles have reported many common ENT-related symptoms as an early sign of COVID19. To measure the prevalence of insomnia and dysgeusia in COVID19 patients in Saudi Arabia and investigate their functional and psychological effects on patients. This study evaluated the impact of insomnia and dysgeusia on COVID-19 patients' quality of life using the short version of the Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQODNS) Questionnaire. It was done from 5 June to 30 July 2020, in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. A total of 274 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were participated. The most common ENT-related symptoms were headache 69%, insomnia 65.3%, and dysgeusia 64.6%. Interestingly, insomnia can greatly affect patients' daily life, as around 37.6% of our patients had problems with taking part in daily activities, 42% felt isolated, 68.1% had changes in appetite, 51.4% had more stress, and 28.2% had increased anger secondary to loss of smell. In Addition, 62% (110) of patients who lost their taste declared that their daily activities were affected. ENT-related symptoms are one of the most COVID19 manifestations. The duration of both insomnia and dysgeusia is an important contributing factor on the patients' functional & psychological state as it may prolong their isolation period. Therefore, Otolaryngologists considered the first-line physicians for many of Covid-19 patients, which makes us at higher risk to be infected with Covid-19 too. It is also particularly important for Otolaryngologists to develop a management guideline to reduce the duration and severity of all ENT-related features.","AlShakhs, Abdullah; Almomen, Ali; AlYaeesh, Ibrahim; AlOmairin, Ahmed; AlMutairi, Adia A; Alammar, Zainab; Almomen, Hassan; Almomen, Zainab",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,137,26

Our objective was to describe the characteristics, outcomes and management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at a single designated pandemic centre in Montréal, Canada. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed on consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU at the Jewish General Hospital, a designated pandemic centre in Montréal, between Mar. 5 and May 21, 2020. Complete follow-up data corresponding to death or discharge from hospital health records were included to Aug. 4, 2020. We summarized baseline characteristics, management and outcomes, including mortality. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were included in this study. Twenty-one patients (19.8%) died during their hospital stay, and the ICU mortality was 17.0% (18/106); all patients were discharged home or died, except for 4 patients (2 awaiting a rehabilitation bed and 2 awaiting long-term care). Twelve of 65 patients (18.5%) requiring mechanical ventilation died. Prone positioning was used in 29 patients (27.4%), including in 10 patients who were spontaneously breathing; no patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. High-flow nasal cannula was used in 51 patients (48.1%). Acute kidney injury was the most common complication, seen in 20 patients (18.9%), and 12 patients (11.3%) required renal replacement therapy. A total of 53 patients (50.0%) received corticosteroids. INTERPRETATION: Our cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 had lower mortality than that previously described in other jurisdictions. These findings may help guide critical care decision-making in similar health care systems in further COVID-19 surges.","Yang, Stephen Su; Lipes, Jed; Dial, Sandra; Schwartz, Blair; Laporta, Denny; Wong, Evan; Baldry, Craig; Warshawsky, Paul; McMillan, Patricia; Hornstein, David; de Marchie, Michel; Jayaraman, Dev",CMAJ Open,137,20

In order to assess the relationship between job features and labour market outcomes, we define two indexes proxying the pre-COVID-19 technical remote work feasibility as well as the level of social interaction with other people while working. Moreover, we use an indicator that classifies ISCO-08 3-digit job titles based on the essential nature of the good or service provided. We find that job characteristics have been major determinants of the probability of undergoing work interruptions and their duration. In addition, we show that women have been negatively affected by the Pandemic to a much larger extent than men, suggesting the relevance of the intrinsic characteristics of jobs they are mainly involved in, and the role of gender selection into specific activities. Not only females were more likely to have undergone work interruptions but they also exhibited larger probabilities of longer work breaks. A similar impact is seen for self-employed and less-educated workers.

The current work investigated the emotional and behavioral reactions people experience in response to COVID-19 through their internet searches. We hypothesised that when the prevalence rates of COVID-19 increase, people would experience more fear, which in turn would predict more searches for protective behaviors, health-related knowledge, and panic buying. METHODS: Prevalence rates of COVID-19 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia were used as predictors. Fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying were measured using internet search volumes in Google Trends. RESULTS: We found that increased prevalence rates of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying. This pattern was consistent across four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Fear-related emotions explained the associations between COVID-19 and the content of their internet searches. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that exposure to COVID-19 prevalence and fear-related emotions may motivate people to search for relevant health-related information so as to protect themselves from the pandemic.","Du, Hongfei; Yang, Jing; King, Ronnel B; Yang, Lei; Chi, Peilian",Appl Psychol Health Well Being,137,21

Although several diagnostic methods have been developed in this regard, their accuracy for clinical application is not very clear yet. To compare the diagnostic value of laboratory tests for the detection of COVID-19 infection, this study provides an upcoming review of the newly developed detection methods. Sensitivity, specificity, detection limit, and turn-around-time of these methods are compared and challenges for their application in clinical settings are reviewed. PubMed and Google Scholar web sites were used for the systematic search until April 9, 2020 to identify the published studies based on the following keywords: “Detection”, “Coro-navirus 2019”, “SARS-CoV-2”, and “Sensitivity”. Out of 526 results, a total of 54 articles, including 46 studies on detection methods, were considered eligible for the review. The results showed that most of the proposed tests focused on molecular methods, while immunological and point-of-care tests were investigated in 13 studies. There were also a few commercial automated methods for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples, most of which are not examined in the current review, as no data about their sensitivity and specificity were presented. Although the assessment of publication biases showed that 64% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity for RT-PCR are close to reality, most of the related reports for serological methods are not valid and further studies are needed to confirm their utility in clinical settings. Moreover, the RT-PCR test alone cannot act as a gold standard because of bias in measurements. Therefore, antibody tests and other proposed methods could be used as supplementary diagnostic tests to improve RT-PCR accuracy. Although clinical findings are invaluable, in many cases, they can provide more valuable supportive data than serological tests.","Shirvani, Armin; Azimi, Leila; Ghanaie, Roxana Mansour; Alebouyeh, Masoud; Fallah, Fatemeh; Tabatabaei, Sedigheh Rafiei; Rajabnejad, Maryam; Armin, Shahnaz; Fahimzad, Seyed Alireza; Shirvani, Fariba; Maham, Saeid; Karimi, Abdollah",Arch.

Physician education has evolved over centuries, from the apprenticeship of barber-surgeon through generations of bedside teachers and now evolving use of technology based instruction. All of these educational practices are based on expert assessment of effective techniques for imparting experience and knowledge to a new group of learners, the young doctor. In the past several decades, exponential growth in both medical innovation and technology development has occurred, leaving the current landscape of medical education with a substantial amount of medical data as well as innovative platforms for information access and distribution. These rapid changes have led to stark differences between medical educators and learners in their world views and preferences relating to teaching and learning. Therefore, understanding how the current generation of medical trainees perceives the world, accesses and retains information is imperative to effective education.

METHODS: A representative sample of 360 US adults completed an online survey including changes in feeling bored and eating because of boredom since the COVID-19 pandemic. An ANCOVA and multivariate analysis of covariance were used to examine relationships between intuitive eating, diet quality, and snacking in individuals who experienced: (1) increases in feeling bored and eating because of boredom, (2) eating because of boredom only, (3) increases in feeling bored only, and (4) no change/decreases in feeling bored and eating because of boredom. RESULTS: Individuals who increased feeling bored and eating because of boredom and increased eating because of boredom only snacked more and scored lower in intuitive eating. Diet quality did not differ across groups. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although diet quality did not differ, eating because of boredom is potentially a negative impact on diet quality.

COVID-19 has a similar pattern of infection, clinical symptoms, and chest imaging findings to influenza pneumonia. In this retrospective study, we analysed clinical and chest CT data of 24 patients with COVID-19 and 79 patients with influenza pneumonia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the temperature, systolic pressure, cough and sputum production could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the clinical features are 0.783 and 0.747, and the AUC value is 0.819. Univariate analysis demonstrates that nine CT features, central-peripheral distribution, superior-inferior distribution, anterior-posterior distribution, patches of GGO, GGO nodule, vascular enlargement in GGO, air bronchogram, bronchiectasis within focus, interlobular septal thickening, could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the CT features are 0.750 and 0.962, and the AUC value is 0.927. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression model combined the variables from the clinical variables and CT features models was made. The combined model contained six features: systolic blood pressure, sputum production, vascular enlargement in the GGO, GGO nodule, central-peripheral distribution and bronchiectasis within focus. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the combined features are 0.87 and 0.96, and the AUC value is 0.961. In conclusion, some CT features or clinical variables can differentiate COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. Moreover, CT features combined with clinical variables had higher diagnostic performance.","Zhao, Shuang; Huang, Zixing; Zeng, Hanjiang; Chen, Zhixia; Luo, Fengming; Zhang, Chongwei; Song, Bin",Sci Rep,137,16

Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective antiviral agent. To date, considerable research has been conducted to develop different approaches to COVID-19 therapy. In addition to early observational studies, which could be limited by study design, small sample size, non-randomized design, or different timings of treatment, an increasing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of antiviral agents are being carried out. This study reviews the updated findings of RCTs regarding the clinical efficacy of eight antiviral agents against COVID-19, including remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, baloxavir, umifenovir, darunavir/cobicistat, and their combinations. Treatment with remdesivir could accelerate clinical improvement; however, it lacked additional survival benefits. Moreover, 5-day regimen of remdesivir might show adequate effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Favipiravir was only marginally effective regarding clinical improvement and virological assessment based on the results of small RCTs. The present evidence suggests that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. However, the sample sizes for analysis were relatively small, and all studies were exclusively conducted in Iran. Further larger RCTs in other countries are warranted to support these findings. In contrast, the present findings of limited RCTs did not indicate the use of lopinavir/ritonavir, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, baloxavir, umifenovir, and darunavir/cobicistat in the treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chao, Chien-Ming; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,137,20

We aimed to determine the extent of knowledge, self-reported preventive behavior, and risk perception of the COVID-19 outbreak among college students in Libya. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 20 to April 30, 2020. The participants were students of medical and non-medical subjects from Libyan educational institutes. Data on participants' characteristics, knowledge, preventive behavior, and risk perception were collected. Results: Approximately 3669 participants completed the questionnaire, of which 2547 (69.4) were medical students and 1122 (30.6%) were non-medical students. The mean knowledge score on COVID-19 was 8.62 (SD: 1.26, range: 0-12), corresponding to 71.8% correct answers. A significant difference was observed between medical and non-medical students in terms of knowledge (p < 0.001). Overall, the knowledge score of the students differed significantly with respect to age, current year of study, and financial source (p < 0.05). The mean score of preventive behavioral measures toward COVID-19 (out of 8) was 7.42 (SD: 0.95, range: 0-8), and the overall preventive measure score was estimated to be approximately 7.42/8*100, which corresponds to 92.7% for both medical and non-medical students. Conclusion: Notably, college students were observed to have substantial knowledge, preventive behavior, and a positive attitude toward COVID-19.

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients have a high IA incidence and risk of rupture. Dysfunction/absence of primary cilia in PKD endothelial cells (ECs) may impair mechano-transduction of WSS and favour vascular disorders. The molecular links between primary cilia dysfunction and IAs are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type and primary cilia-deficient Tg737orpk/orpk arterial ECs were submitted to physiological (30 dynes/cm2) or aneurysmal (2 dynes/cm2) WSS and unbiased transcriptomics were performed. Tg737orpk/orpk ECs displayed a 5-fold increase in the number of WSS-responsive genes compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, we observed a lower trans-endothelial resistance and a higher endothelial permeability, which correlated with disorganized intercellular junctions in Tg737orpk/orpk cells. We identified ZO-1 as a central regulator of primary cilia-dependent endothelial junction integrity. Finally, clinical and histological characteristics of IAs from non-PKD and PKD patients were analysed. IAs in PKD patients were more frequently located in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory than in non-PKD patients. IA domes from the MCA of PKD patients appeared thinner with less collagen and reduced endothelial ZO-1 compared with IA domes from non-PKD patients. CONCLUSION: Primary cilia dampen the endothelial response to aneurysmal low WSS. In absence of primary cilia, ZO-1 expression levels are reduced, which disorganizes intercellular junctions resulting in increased endothelial permeability. This altered endothelial function may not only contribute to the severity of IA disease observed in PKD patients, but may also serve as a potential diagnostic tool to determine the vulnerability of IAs.","Diagbouga, Mannekomba R; Morel, Sandrine; Cayron, Anne F; Haemmerli, Julien; Georges, Marc; Hierck, Beerend P; Allémann, E; Lemeille, Sylvain; Bijlenga, Philippe; Kwak, Brenda R",Cardiovasc. res,137,1

Radiology is thus confronted with the effects of the pandemic. The aim of this study was to use natural language processing (NLP) to automatically analyze the number and distribution of fractures during the pandemic and in the 5 years before the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a pre-trained commercially available NLP engine to automatically categorize 5397 radiological reports of radiographs (hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, knee, pelvis/hip) within a 6-week period from March to April in 2015-2020 into ""fracture affirmed"" or ""fracture not affirmed."" The NLP engine achieved an F1 score of 0.81 compared to human annotators. RESULTS: In 2020, we found a significant decrease of fractures in general (p < 0.001); the average number of fractures in 2015-2019 was 295, whereas it was 233 in 2020. In children and adolescents (p < 0.001), and in adults up to 65 years (p = 0.006), significantly fewer fractures were reported in 2020. The number of fractures in the elderly did not change (p = 0.15). The number of hand/wrist fractures (p < 0.001) and fractures of the elbow (p < 0.001) was significantly lower in 2020 compared with the average in the years 2015-2019. CONCLUSION: NLP can be used to identify relevant changes in the number of pathologies as shown here for the use case fracture detection. This may trigger root cause analysis and enable automated real-time monitoring in radiology.","Jungmann, Florian; Kämpgen, B; Hahn, F; Wagner, D; Mildenberger, P; Düber, C; Kloeckner, R",Skelet. radiol,137,23

Whereas it appears that social distancing is an effective strategy for mitigating spread, it may also result in a variety of unintended negative consequences to individuals' psychological well-being and mental health. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the present study examined associations among some demographic variables (gender, age, marital and working statuses, and having a family member or a friend infected with COVID-19), acceptance of social distancing, mood changes, and quality of life (QoL) in Qatar, a high-income Middle Eastern Arabic-speaking country. Older, married, and working participants were more accepting of social distancing than younger, unmarried, and non-working participants, respectively. Participants indicated that, during this time, they became more distressed, upset, scared, irritable, nervous, and afraid, and less inspired and determined. In a stark contrast, more individuals indicated that they became more interested, alert, and attentive, whereas higher percentages of participants reported feeling less guilty, hostile, and ashamed. Social distancing correlated positively with negative affect, whereas social avoidances correlated positively with positive affect and with physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL. Finally, positive affect correlated positively, and negative affect correlated negatively, with these four domains of QoL. These results highlight the need for public health and clinical providers to consider peoples' psychological well-being and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Megreya, Ahmed M; Latzman, Robert D; Al-Ahmadi, Aisha M; Al-Dosari, Nasser F",Int J Ment Health Addict,137,20

The purpose of the study is to identify the critical factors that affect the global sustainable supply chain process in the cross-sectional panel of 38 European countries, 14 North American countries, 40 Asian countries, and a heterogeneous panel of 111 countries. The results show that an increase in susceptible coronavirus cases and death tolls limits the supply chain process because of nationwide closures of industries and business activities. In contrast, an increase in the number of recovered cases supports economic activities and improved logistic performance index across countries. The innovation accounting matrix shows that since August 2020, the global coronavirus cases will decline and start resuming economic activities to increase the supply chain process. The result is further supported by the estimates of reduction in the proportion of death to recovered cases (case fatality ratio 1) to increase sustainable logistics activities. However, the supply chain process could affect an increasing death toll and case fatality ratio 2 (i.e., the proportion of death to registered cases) over time. The global economies should ensure a free flow of sustainable logistics supply, especially the supply of healthcare medical equipment that would help control the coronavirus pandemic, which escapes from the nations from a global depression.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Zaman, Khalid; Kabbani, Ahmad",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Setting: University hospital in Madrid (Spain). Participants: Sixty-one patients (74% male) who presented COVID-19 were readmitted during the 3 weeks after discharge from hospital. Interventions: Nested case-control study paired (1:1 ratio) by age, sex and period of admission. Outcome Measures: Rate of readmission rate of patients discharged after suffering COVID-19 and identification of the clinical variables associated with it. Results: Out of 1368 patients who were discharged during the study period, 61 patients (4.4%) were readmitted. Immunocompromised patients (N=10.2%) were at increased risk for readmission (p=0.04). There was also a trend towards a higher probability of readmission in hypertensive patients (p=0.07). Cases had had a shorter hospital stay and a higher prevalence of fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge. There were no significant differences in oxygen levels measured at admission and discharge by pulse oximetry intra-subject or between the groups. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at hospital admission tended to be higher in cases than in controls (p=0.06). Neither glucocorticoids nor anticoagulants prescribed at hospital discharge were associated with a lower readmission rate. Patients who were readmitted due to a thrombotic event (8 patients, 13.1%) presented a higher level of D-dimer at discharge of initial admission. Conclusion: The rate of readmission after discharge from hospital for COVID-19 was low. Immunocompromised patients and those presenting with fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge were at greater risk of readmission to hospital.","Parra, Lina Marcela; Cantero, Mireia; Morrás, Ignacio; Vallejo, Alberto; Diego, Itziar; Jiménez-Tejero, Elena; Múñez, Elena; Asensio, Ángel; Fermández-Cruz, Ana; Ramos-Martinez, Antonio",Int J Gen Med,137,16

The traditional format of gross laboratory sessions experienced a direct impact and few reports documented curricular delivery changes specific to laboratory format. The purpose of this study was to assess the adaptations incorporated in gross anatomy laboratories by anatomists, during May-August 2020, in response to Covid-19. MATERIALS/METHODS Data were collected through the IRB-approved Virtual Anatomy During Covid-19 survey that consisted of 20 questions, including open-ended prompts asking participants to describe the structure of a ?typical? laboratory session during Covid-19. Responses were solicited from professional anatomy associations during June 2020. Open-ended responses describing anatomy laboratory teaching methods used during Covid-19 were coded. Descriptive codes were applied to the data according to published methods to summarize verbatim responses. Responses were tabulated and converted to frequencies and percentages. Chi square test assessed differences among the responses when applicable. Alpha&lt;5%. RESULTS Descriptions of gross anatomy lab teaching during Covid-19 were coded into four categories : (1) delivery format, (2) format of laboratory practice, (3) type of anatomy digital resources used, and (4) format of student teaching groups. In the first category, synchronous (46.7%), asynchronous (15.6%), and/or a combination of the two (18.8%) were the most frequent laboratory delivery formats (P&lt;0.001). In the second category, student-led dissection (17.2%), prosection (10.9%), and/or utilization of commercial and/or in-house anatomical resources (26.2%) were the most frequent laboratory practices (P&lt;0.001). Within this category, a subcategory was discovered in which physical distancing and personal protective equipment practices were reported (15.6%). Concerning the third category, anatomy digital resources (26.2%) were used for asynchronous laboratory preparation and laboratory sessions. In the final category, student small groups (29.7%) were used in remote sessions where ?breakout rooms? permitted students to meet with peers and/or faculty. Large groups (9.4%) were used for faculty to review and present the assigned laboratory topic. CONCLUSION Anatomists largely taught through a remote, synchronous delivery format that relied on cadaveric specimens and digital anatomy resources, as well as small group learning. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION: This study shows that anatomists were able to adapt the gross anatomy laboratory sessions to synchronous, virtual mediums;however, the impact of these changes to the learner during this unconventional time remains to be determined.","Dennis, Jennifer Attardi Stefanie Bentley Danielle Brown Kirsten Farkas Gary Goldman Haviva Harmon Derek Harrell Kelly Klein Barbie Ramnanan Christopher Barremkala Malli",The FASEB Journal,137,12

Hence, we evaluated the latter associations of chemosensory dysfunction, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on chemosensory dysfunction and history of chronic systemic comorbidities, if any, was obtained from 149 COVID-19 patients in an infectious disease hospital in UAE, using their medical records, as well as from a face-to-face questionnaire survey. Additionally, a modified SNOT-22 questionnaire that measures disease-specific quality of life in patients with upper respiratory tract affections was also administered. RESULTS: Chemosensory dysfunction was reported by 94.6% of the cohort, and anosmia with dysgeusia was significantly more in males than females with severe COVID-19. Males with moderate COVID-19 and systemic comorbidities were more likely to present with chemosensory dysfunction in comparison with females. SNOT-22 questionnaire revealed that nasal blockage and runny nose were more prevalent in mild/moderate, than in the severe, state of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the commonality of chemosensory dysfunction during COVID-19 progression, and the significantly more pronounced combined dysfunction in males with severe COVID-19, and comorbidities.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia; Mohammad, Osman Elfadil; Panduwawala, Chamila; Bandara, Nihal; Ngo, Hien Chi",Oral dis,137,16

The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with &#945;< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). RESULTS: All six of the questions - 1) ""I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;"" 2) ""I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;"" 3) ""I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;"" 4)""I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;"" 5) ""I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;"" and 6) ""I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles"" - showed statistical significant change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions - ""I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;"" and ""This training was valuable"" - received high scores on the Likert scale. CONCLUSION: This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.","Owens, Michael D; Lloyd, Michael L; Brady, Tyler M; Gross, Robin",West J Emerg Med,137,6

Here, we report for the first time that the 11S proteasomal activator PA28Î³ regulates the intracellular abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (nCoV N). Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator PA28Î³ as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As a result of their interaction, nCoV N could be degraded by PA28Î³-20S in vitro degradation assay. This was also demonstrated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The stability of nCoV N in PA28Î³-knockout cells was greater than in PA28Î³-wildtype cells. Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockout of the PA28Î³ gene in cells led to the transport of nCoV N from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PA28Î³ enhanced proteolysis of nCoV N compared to that in PA28Î³-N151Y cells containing a dominant-negative PA28Î³ mutation, which reduced this process. These results suggest that PA28Î³ binding is important in regulating 20S proteasome activity, which in turn regulates levels of the critical nCoV N nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Zhang, Haiyang; Tu, Jialu; Cao, Chulei; Yang, Ting; Gao, Liangcai",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,137,16

This paper focuses on one of these partnerships and reconstructs how the Covid-19 outbreak impacted on efforts to embed responsiveness, participation and equity into the governance structure of the newly-established partnership. An advisory group bringing together individuals with personal experience of SMD was involved in the identification of the priorities to be pursued. However, the first lockdown and the requirement to house all rough sleepers forced the partnership to abandon them to focus on housing. Complications also emerged in attempts made to embed participation in the work of the partnership, as the peer mentors lacked the skills and resources necessary to embrace new forms of remote working. Finally, the unexpected depth of the needs in the client group also raised unforeseen complications in terms of how to allocate available support equitably. The case study offers two lessons: first, police can play a strategic role at the local level in tackling vulnerability and disadvantage;second, police and health partnerships need to be considered in terms of theircommitment to democratic values, not just their effectiveness. The paper concludes by offering some broader considerations on the intersection between policing and public health in light of the pandemic.

It is unknown to which extent presymptomatic residents and staff contribute to the spread of the virus. AIMS: To assess the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents and staff in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a large outbreak in a Dutch NH. METHODS: Observational study in a 185-bed NH with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, followed by weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2, including sequencing of positive samples, was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. RESULTS: 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms in residents and staff are insufficiently recognized, reported or attributed to a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, residents without (recognized) symptoms showed the same potential for viral shedding as residents with symptoms. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast mitigation of the outbreak.","van den Besselaar, Judith H; Sikkema, Reina S; Koene, Fleur M H P A; van Buul, Laura W; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Frénay, Ine; Te Witt, René; Koopmans, Marion P G; Hertogh, Cees M P M; Buurman, Bianca M",Age ageing,137,16

Then, we evaluated their properties as hypoxia imaging probes for positron emission tomography (PET) compared with conventional compounds ([68Ga]DN-2 and [68Ga]NN-2). METHODS: The precursors of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were synthesized through a two-step reaction, and then reacted with 68GaCl3 to be 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds. FaDu cells were treated with 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds and then incubated under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. The radioactivity of these cells was measured 2 h after incubation. The biodistribution and PET/CT imaging of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds in FaDu-bearing Balb/c nude mice were evaluated 2 h after intravenous injection. RESULTS: The 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were synthesized with radiochemical purities over 95%. In the in vitro study, the levels of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds were significantly higher in hypoxic cells than in normoxic cells. In hypoxic cells, the compounds we designed in this study demonstrated higher accumulation than the conventional compounds. In the in vivo biodistribution study, [68Ga]DN-3 exhibited the highest accumulation in tumor. In the in vivo PET/CT imaging study, the tumor tissues of the FaDu-xenografted mice were visualized at 2 h after intravenous administration of 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that the length of the linkers connecting nitroimidazole to a bifunctional chelate affect PET imaging of hypoxic tumors with 68Ga-radiolabeled compounds.","Shimizu, Yoichi; Nakai, Yukihiro; Iikuni, Shimpei; Watanabe, Hiroyuki; Nakamoto, Yuji; Ono, Masahiro",Ann. nucl. med,137,16

However, there has been considerable confusion and disagreement regarding the degree to which masks protect the wearer from airborne particles. Objectives: To evaluate the fitted filtration efficiency (FFE) of various consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks that are intended to improve mask fit or comfort. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this study conducted in a research laboratory between June and August 2020, 7 consumer-grade masks and 5 medical procedure mask modifications were fitted on an adult male volunteer, and FFE measurements were collected during a series of repeated movements of the torso, head, and facial muscles as outlined by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol. The consumer-grade masks tested included (1) a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops that was tested with an optional aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert in place, (2) a cotton bandana folded diagonally once (ie, ""bandit"" style) or in a (3) multilayer rectangle according to the instructions presented by the US Surgeon General, (4) a single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties, (5) a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops, (6) a single-layer woven polyester gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana, and (7) a 3-layer woven cotton mask with ear loops. Medical procedure mask modifications included (1) tying the mask's ear loops and tucking in the side pleats, (2) fastening ear loops behind the head with 3-dimensional-printed ear guards, (3) fastening ear loops behind the head with a claw-type hair clip, (4) enhancing the mask/face seal with rubber bands over the mask, and (5) enhancing the mask/face seal with a band of nylon hosiery over the fitted mask. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcome was the measured FFE of common consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks. Results: The mean (SD) FFE of consumer grade masks tested on 1 adult male with no beard ranged from 79.0% (4.3%) to 26.5% (10.5%), with the 2-layer woven nylon mask having the highest FFE. Unmodified medical procedure masks with ear loops had a mean (SD) FFE of 38.5% (11.2%). All modifications evaluated in this study increased procedure mask FFE (range [SD], 60.3% [11.1%] to 80.2% [3.1%]), with a nylon hosiery sleeve placed over the procedure mask producing the greatest improvement. Conclusions and Relevance: While modifications to improve medical procedure mask fit can enhance the filtering capability and reduce inhalation of airborne particles, this study demonstrates that the FFEs of consumer-grade masks available to the public are, in many cases, nearly equivalent to or better than their non-N95 respirator medical mask counterparts.","Clapp, Phillip W; Sickbert-Bennett, Emily E; Samet, James M; Berntsen, Jon; Zeman, Kirby L; Anderson, Deverick J; Weber, David J; Bennett, William D",JAMA intern. med.

This disease and its worldwide impact have sparked tremendous interest in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of COVID-19. This accumulating body of evidence has centered around case series and often empiric therapies as controlled trials are just getting underway. What is clear is that patients appear to be at higher risk for thrombotic disease states including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are also at higher risk for morbidity and mortality if infected. These patients are commonly treated with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications and less commonly thrombolysis during hospitalization, potentially with great benefit but the management of these medications can be difficult in potentially critically ill patients. In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients. The task force incorporated experts in Cardiology, Vascular Medicine, Hematology, Vascular Surgery, Pharmacy, and Vascular Neurology. Current guidelines, consensus documents, and policy documents from specialty organizations were used to formulate health system recommendations. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to provide guidance to the utilization of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in patients with known or suspected COVID-19.","Watson, Ryan A; Johnson, Drew M; Dharia, Robin N; Merli, Geno J; Doherty, John U",Hosp Pract (1995),137,12

Wearable devices that can measure physiologic changes in biometrics including heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, respiratory, activity (such as steps taken per day) and sleep patterns, and blood oxygen saturation show utility for the early detection of infection before clinical presentation of symptoms. Recent algorithms developed using preliminary wearable datasets show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable before clinical symptoms in >80% of adults. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other pathogens in SOTR, and their household members, could facilitate early interventions such as self-isolation and early clinical management of relevant infection(s). Ongoing studies testing the utility of wearable devices such as smartwatches for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other infections in the general population are reviewed here, along with the practical challenges to implementing these processes at scale in pediatric and adult SOTR, and their household members.

Although children are less commonly infected by SARS-CoV-2 than their adult counterparts, and their symptoms are generally milder, a severe type of COVID-19 cannot be precluded. MethodsAt first, demographic, clinical, laboratory measurement data, and outcomes for 26 COVID-19 infected children of less than 12 years of age, admitted to King Abdallah Hospital, Bisha, Saudi Arabia, were retrieved from the electronic medical records for the observational retrospective study. Later, electronic and manual database searches were carried out for pediatric severe COVID-19-related articles. The relevant data from 20 eligible studies and the present retrospective study were analyzed to assess the association of demographic characteristics and comorbidities with COVID-19 severity. ResultsIn the retrospective study, 5 (19%) of the children presented with severe symptoms admitted to PICU, 18 (69%) presented with cough, 5 (19%) with diarrhea, 7 (27%) with underlying comorbidities, 4 (15%) with respiratory illnesses, 3 (12%) with cardiovascular diseases and 2 (8%) were obese. None of the patient characteristics showed any significant association with COVID-19 severity. Of the 21 studies selected for meta-analyses, 14 studies were included in the analysis of the association between any comorbidity and disease severity, resulting in OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.38 - 5.26, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between cardiovascular comorbidities and disease severity 14 studies were included giving OR: 4.06, 95%CI: 1.86 - 8.87, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between respiratory comorbidity and disease severity 15 studies were included giving OR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.54 - 2.74, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between obesity and disease severity 10 studies were included, giving OR: 2.48, 95%CI: 1.16 - 5.32, P < 0.05, for analysis of the association between age <10 years old and diseases severity, 16 studies were included, giving OR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.65 - 0.97, P < 0.05, and for analysis of the association between female gender and disease severity, 19 studies were included, giving OR: 0.83, 95%CI: 0.59 - 1.18, P > 0.05.

This report comprises the cases of 3 patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy who were evaluated with thromboelastography (TEG) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to enable personalized anticoagulant therapy. CASE REPORT Three patients presented with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, who developed thrombohemorrhagic coagulopathy.Case 1: A 72-year-old woman on long-term warfarin therapy for a history of venous thromboembolism developed a right upper lobe pulmonary embolus, despite an international normalized ratio of 6.4 and aPTT of 120.7 s. TEG enabled successful anticoagulation with heparin, and her pulmonary infarct was no longer present 2 weeks later.Case 2: A 55-year-old woman developed a rectus sheath hematoma while on heparin, and TEG demonstrated increased fibrinolysis despite COVID-19 patients more commonly undergoing fibrinolytic shutdown.Case 3: A 43-year-old woman had significant thrombus burden while severely hypocoagulable according to laboratory testing. As the venous thrombi enlarged in a disseminated intravascular coagulopathic-like state, the heparin dose was escalated to achieve a target aPTT of 70 to 80 s, resulting in a flat line TEG tracing. CONCLUSIONS These 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with complex and varied clinical histories demonstrated the clinical value of TEG combined with the measurement of aPTT to facilitate personalized anticoagulation, resulting in good clinical outcomes.","Bunch, Connor M; Thomas, Anthony V; Stillson, John E; Gillespie, Laura; Lin, Kevin P; Speybroeck, Jacob; Kwaan, Hau C; Fulkerson, Daniel H; Zamlut, Mahmud; Khan, Rashid; Walsh, Mark M",Am J Case Rep,137,29

We show that social distancing following US state-level emergency declarations substantially varies by income. Using mobility measures derived from mobile device location pings, we find that wealthier areas decreased mobility significantly more than poorer areas, and this general pattern holds across income quantiles, data sources, and mobility measures. Using an event study design focusing on behavior subsequent to state emergency orders, we document a reversal in the ordering of social distancing by income: Wealthy areas went from most mobile before the pandemic to least mobile, while, for multiple measures, the poorest areas went from least mobile to most. Previous research has shown that lower income communities have higher levels of preexisting health conditions and lower access to healthcare. Combining this with our core finding-that lower income communities exhibit less social distancing-suggests a double burden of the COVID-19 pandemic with stark distributional implications.","Weill, Joakim A; Stigler, Matthieu; Deschenes, Olivier; Springborn, Michael R",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,137,1

During virus outbreaks, anxiety is widespread. However, the role of trait health anxiety, cyberchondria, and coping in the context of virus anxiety during the current COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been studied. An online survey was conducted in the German general population (N = 1615, 79.8 % female, Mage = 33.36 years, SD = 13.18) in mid-March 2020, which included questionnaires on anxiety associated with SARS-CoV-2, trait health anxiety, cyberchondriaPandemic (i.e. excessive online information search), and emotion regulation. The participants reported a significantly increasing virus anxiety in recent months (previous months recorded retrospectively), especially among individuals with heightened trait health anxiety. CyberchondriaPandemic showed positive correlations with current virus anxiety (r = .09-.48), and this relationship was additionally moderated by trait health anxiety.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on severe COVID-19 patients with hyper-inflammatory features admitted outside intensive care units (ICUs). Patients treated with intravenous TCZ in addition to standard of care were compared to patients treated with standard of care alone. Safety and efficacy were assessed over a 28-day follow-up. RESULTS: 65 patients were included. Among them, 32 were treated with TCZ. At baseline, all patients were on high-flow supplemental oxygen and most (78% of TCZ patients and 61% of standard treatment patients) were on non-invasive ventilation. During the 28-day follow-up, 69% of TCZ patients experienced a clinical improvement compared to 61% of standard treatment patients (p = 0.61). Mortality was 15% in the tocilizumab group and 33% in standard treatment group (p = 0.15). In TCZ group, at multivariate analysis, older age was a predictor of death, whereas higher baseline PaO2:FiO2 was a predictor of clinical improvement at day 28. The rate of infection and pulmonary thrombosis was similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: At day 28, clinical improvement and mortality were not statistically different between tocilizumab and standard treatment patients in our cohort. Bacterial or fungal infections were recorded in 13% of tocilizumab patients and in 12% of standard treatment patients. Confirmation of efficacy and safety will require ongoing controlled trials.","Campochiaro, Corrado; Della-Torre, Emanuel; Cavalli, Giulio; De Luca, Giacomo; Ripa, Marco; Boffini, Nicola; Tomelleri, Alessandro; Baldissera, Elena; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Monti, Giacomo; De Cobelli, Francesco; Zangrillo, Alberto; Tresoldi, Moreno; Castagna, Antonella; Dagna, Lorenzo",Eur J Intern Med,137,16

The presentation of the disease ranges from asymptomatic manifestations through to acute respiratory distress syndrome with the necessity of mechanical ventilation. Cytokine storm and maladaptive responses to the viral spread in the body could be responsible for the severity of disease. Many patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI) during the course of their disease, especially in more severe cases. Many factors could cause kidney damage during infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It is still unclear whether direct viral damage or the overexpression of cytokines and inflammatory factors are preeminent. According to autoptic studies, in most of the cases, AKI is due proximal tubular damage. However, cases of collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were reported as well in the absence of signs of direct viral infection of the kidney. Considering that severe hypoxia is a hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the involvement of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) system is very likely, possibly influencing the inflammatory response and outcome in both the lungs and kidneys. Several bodies of evidence have shown a possible role of the HIF pathway during AKI in various kidney disease models. Similar observations were made in the setting of acute lung injury. In both organs, HIF activation by means of inhibition of the prolyl-hydroxylases domain (PHD) could be protective. Considering these promising experimental data, we hypothesize that PHD inhibitors could be considered as a possible new therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Del Vecchio, Lucia; Locatelli, Francesco",Clin Kidney J,137,23

It is imperative to study and develop pharmacological treatments suitable for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Ascorbic acid is a crucial vitamin necessary for the correct functioning of the immune system. It plays a role in stress response and has shown promising results when administered to the critically ill. Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties have been investigated in numerous studies. There is evidence that vitamin C and quercetin co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping antiviral and immunomodulatory properties and the capacity of ascorbate to recycle quercetin, increasing its efficacy. Safe, cheap interventions which have a sound biological rationale should be prioritized for experimental use in the current context of a global health pandemic. We present the current evidence for the use of vitamin C and quercetin both for prophylaxis in high-risk populations and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients as an adjunct to promising pharmacological agents such as Remdesivir or convalescent plasma.","Colunga Biancatelli, Ruben Manuel Luciano; Berrill, Max; Catravas, John D; Marik, Paul E",Front Immunol,137,16

RECENT FINDINGS: Acute vestibular syndrome is defined as sudden-onset, continuous vertigo lasting longer than 24 hours with associated nausea and vomiting, all of which are worsened with head movement. Acute vestibular syndrome is provoked by a variety of central and peripheral causes, the most common of which are vestibular neuritis and acute stroke (posterior circulation). A clinical approach focusing on timing, associated history, and ocular motor findings can improve diagnostic accuracy and is more sensitive and specific than early neuroimaging. Because of the shared neurovascular supply, both peripheral and central vestibular disorders can manifest overlapping signs previously considered solely peripheral or central, including vertical skew, nystagmus, abnormal vestibular ocular reflex, hearing loss, and gait instability. Although acute vestibular syndrome is typically benign, stroke should be considered in every person with acute vestibular syndrome because it can act as a harbinger of stroke or impending cerebellar herniation. Treatment is focused on physical therapy because the evidence is minimal for the long-term use of medication. SUMMARY: The diagnosis of acute vestibular syndrome first requires the elimination of common medical causes for dizziness. Next, underlying pathology must be determined by distinguishing between the most common causes of acute vestibular syndrome: central and peripheral vestibular disorders. Central vestibular disorders are most often the result of ischemic stroke affecting the cerebellar arteries. Peripheral vestibular disorders are assumed to be caused mostly by inflammatory sources, but ischemia of the peripheral vestibular apparatus may be underappreciated. By using the HINTS Plus (Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test of Skew with Plus referring to hearing loss assessment) examination in addition to a comprehensive neurologic examination, strokes are unlikely to be missed. For nearly all acute vestibular disorders, vestibular physical therapy contributes to recovery.","Steenerson, Kristen K",Continuum (Minneap Minn),137,1

Using structure-based drug selection for identification of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, old drugs such as macrolides (MAC) were predicted to be effective for COVID-19. Lately, the anti-viral effects of macrolides have attracted considerable attention. Very recently, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment was reported to be effective for COVID-19.

We reviewed all relevant articles pertaining to kidney, upper tract urothelial cell, bladder, prostate, penile, and testicular cancer in regard to diagnostic, surgical, or treatment delay. RESULTS: The majority of urologic cancers rely on surgery as primary treatment. Treatment of unfavorable intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer, can likely be delayed for 3 to 6 months without affecting oncologic outcomes. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer and testicular cancer can be treated initially with chemotherapy. Surgical management of T3 renal masses, high-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma, and penile cancer should not be delayed. CONCLUSION: The majority of urologic oncologic surgeries can be safely deferred without impacting long-term cancer specific or overall survival. Notable exceptions are muscle-invasive bladder cancer, high-grade upper tract urothelial cell, large renal masses, testicular and penile cancer.

We asked whether they preferred to use a range of methods, such email, phone calls, letters and live messaging, in scenarios from education to customer services to friends and family. When contacting unknown people or organisations, we found that generally email was preferred, and phone calls were very unpopular. However, for friends, family and people they felt comfortable with, they preferred both face-to-face and written forms of communication (e.g. email and text message).Implications for practice, research or policyThe findings suggest that services should move away from a reliance on phone calls for communication. They should make sure that access to support is not dependent on the phone, and instead offer written options such as email and live messaging which are more accessible. Future research should investigate the impact of COVID-19 on autistic people's communication preferences, as video calling has become much more commonly used and potentially combines benefits and challenges of other modes discussed in this article.","Howard, Philippa L; Sedgewick, Felicity",Autism,137,3

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The web-based survey COVIDRA was developed to assess 5 domains including RA symptoms, attitudes towards medication, employment status, physical exercise and mental health. The questionnaire was sent to RA patients through e-mail and social media of the Portuguese Society of Rheumatology and two patient associations;and it was filled locally at two rheumatology centers in Lisbon. Recruitment took place during June and July 2020. RESULTS: We obtained 441 valid questionnaires. Most respondents were female (88.4%), caucasian (93.6%) with a mean age of 58 years. The majority had disease lasting &gt;10 years and were treated with csDMARDs (63.2%) and/or bDMARDs/tsDMARDS (23.7%). Over 40% experienced symptom worsening during confinement, almost half considered moderate or severe. Mobility restriction and increased stress, anxiety or depression were responsible for this worsening. Only 2.5% reduced or withheld their immunosuppressive medication due to fear of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. After confinement, 16.2% of those previously employed were in a lay-off regime and 3% lost their jobs. Most employed RA patients practiced telework during confinement. The majority of patients decreased or did not practice any physical exercise (80.5%). Symptoms of anxiety and depression developed or worsened in 67.3% and 51.9% respectively, approximately one third were considered moderate or severe. CONCLUSIONS: Portuguese RA patients experienced significant symptom worsening, anxiety and depression during the first wave confinement. Only a minority changed their immunosuppressive treatment for fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Published literature on these matters shows results very similar to ours.","Araujo, F. C.; Goncalves, N.

No período de setembro de 2002 a outubro de 2004, foram coletadas 220 amostras de fezes de animais capturados pelos CCZ de Guarulhos, Cotia e Barueri, cidades do Estado de São Paulo. O método de coleta foi através de swabs estéreis profundamente ao intestino dos animais anestesiados, mantidos sob refrigeração e em caldo BHI. As bactérias foram isoladas por semeadura em Mac Conkey, ágar sangue e Sabouraud. Houve crescimento de microrganismos em 100% delas. Foram isolados os seguintes microrganismos: 120 (54,54%) estirpes de E. coli em cultura pura e 76 (34,54%) estirpes em associação com outros agentes, Proteus mirabilis (2,27%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2,27%), dentre outros microrganismos. Deve-se ressaltar ainda o isolamento de leveduras (Candida albicans) em associação com outros agentes a partir de 05 (2,27%) amostras de swabs retais.

In this article we propose a new mechanism and suggest innovative therapeutic avenues for its prevention. We have reported that particles of cell-free chromatin (cfCh) that are released from the billions of cells that die in the body everyday can illegitimately integrate into genomes of healthy cells to trigger dsDNA breaks. The latter leads to apoptosis and/or intense activation of inflammatory cytokines in the affected cells. We hypothesise that a similar phenomenon of dsDNA breaks and inflammation is involved in cytokine storm. The abundant cfCh particles that are released from dying host cells following viral/microbial invasion initiate a cascading effect of more cell death resulting in a vicious cycle of further DNA damage, apoptosis and hyper-inflammation which culminate in cytokine storm. We propose that this unrelenting vicious cycle of cellular DNA damage and cytokine storm may be the underlying cause of high mortality from severe COVID-19. We discuss results of our preclinical studies wherein we have shown that endotoxin induced cytokine storm in mice can be reversed by three different agents that have the ability to inactivate cfCh. These agents may be worthy of investigation in clinical trials to reduce mortality from COVID-19.","Shabrish, Snehal; Mittra, Indraneel",Front Immunol,137,24

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing dyslipidaemia. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to January 31, 2021, reporting data on dyslipidaemia among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic. RESULTS: Eighteen studies, enrolling 74.132 COVID-19 patients [mean age 70.6 years], met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 17.5% of cases (95% CI: 12.3-24.3%, p < 0.0001), with high heterogeneity (I2=98.7%). Pre-existing dyslipidaemia was significantly associated with higher risk of short-term death (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.19-2.41, p = 0.003), with high heterogeneity (I2=88.7%). Due to publication bias, according to the Trim-and-Fill method, the corrected random-effect ORs resulted 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.28, p < 0.0001 (one studies trimmed).

However, seagrass belowground production and decomposition have rarely been quantified in the field. To assess the significance of seagrass belowground production to carbon sequestration, belowground carbon budgets were constructed in intertidal seagrass beds of the late-successional species Thalassia hemprichii and the early-successional species Haloduleuninervis in southern Taiwan. For both species, the turnover rates of the belowground portions were much longer than that of the aboveground portion, so the belowground biomass was much higher than the aboveground biomass. The leaf productivity of both species was significantly higher than the belowground productivity, but most of the leaf production decomposed within a year. The lower turnover and slower decomposition rates of the belowground portions allowed the late-successional seagrass T. hemprichii to store more carbon in the sediments than the early-successional seagrass H. uninervis. Long-term changes for the past 20 years in the sediment depth showed that the sediments of seagrass beds were increasing in the habitats at low elevation but were decreasing or had no clear trends in the habitats at high elevation or on the windward side. The carbon storage rates according to the belowground production of T. hemprichii and H. uninervis were 0.3-4.7 and 1.5-2.3 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively, which can potentially contribute 53% of the long-term organic carbon storage in the low-elevation sediments.","Zou, Yi-Fang; Chen, Kuan-Yu; Lin, Hsing-Juh",Sci Total Environ,137,1

Although this has reversed some of the progress made in reducing the global burden of tuberculosis (TB) disease, there is an opportunity to incorporate lessons learned to improve TB programmes going forward. APPROACH: We use Pakistan as a case study to discuss three important adaptations in light of COVID-19: bringing care closer to patients; strengthening primary health care systems; and proactively addressing stigma and fear. FINDINGS: COVID-19 control in Pakistan has restricted people's ability to travel and this has forced the TB programme to reduce the need for in-person health facility visits and bring care closer to patients' homes. Strategies that may be useful for providing more convenient care to patients in the future include: : remote treatment support using telemedicine; collaborating with private healthcare providers; and establishing community medicine collection points. As part of the response to COVID-19 in Pakistan, the out-patient departments of major tertiary and secondary care hospitals were closed, and this highlighted the importance of strengthening primary healthcare for both better pandemic and TB control.

Since there is currently no vaccine available in the market, the identification of potential drugs is urgently needed to control the pandemic. In this study, 92 phytochemicals from medicinal plants growing in the Andean region were screened against SARS-CoV-2 3 C-like protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in their active sites through molecular docking. The cutoff values were set from the lowest docking scores of the FDA-approved drugs that are being used to treat COVID-19 patients (remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir). Compounds with docking scores that were lower than cutoff values were validated by molecular dynamics simulation with GROMACS, using root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). Furthermore, binding free energies were estimated using the MM-PBSA method, and ADMET profiles of potential inhibitors were assessed. Computational analyses revealed that the interaction with hesperidin (theoretical binding energies, &#916;Gbind = -15.18 kcal/mol to 3CLpro and &#916;Gbind = -9.46 kcal/mol to RdRp) remained stable in both enzymes, unveiling its remarkable potential as a possible multitarget antiviral agent to treat COVID-19. Importantly, lupinifolin with an estimated binding affinity to 3CLpro higher than hesperidin (&#916;Gbind = -20.93 kcal/mol) is also a potential inhibitor of the 3CLpro.

By comparing 2019-2020 seasonal influenza activity through March 29, 2020 with the 2011-2019 seasons, we found that COVID-19 outbreaks and related NPIs may have reduced influenza in Southern and Northern China and the United States by 79.2% (lower and upper bounds: 48.8%-87.2%), 79.4% (44.9%-87.4%) and 67.2% (11.5%-80.5%). Decreases in influenza virus infection were also associated with the timing of NPIs.

However, data are scarce concerning the trajectories of severe mental disorders after the end of c-/m-ECT. This prospective study investigates the clinical outcome of patients with versus without modifications of their c-/m-ECT schedules. METHODS: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT capacities were restricted at many clinics in early 2020. All patients receiving c-/m-ECT in March and April 2020 at our department (n = 53, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) were followed up for six months to investigate the impact of treatment modifications imposed by the pandemic. Based on individual decisions, c-/m-ECT was either (a) continued without modification, (b) continued with reduced frequency, or (c) discontinued. RESULTS: Both reduced frequency and discontinuation of c-/m-ECT were associated with significant clinical deterioration as measured by CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression Scale - Global Improvement) during the six-month follow-up when compared to the subgroup of patients without any treatment modification (p = 0.005, p = 0.011). Furthermore, patients with discontinued or reduced c-/m-ECT showed significantly higher rates of rehospitalizations (p = 0.028) and new acute courses of ECT (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of a heterogeneous and relatively small sample, our study strongly corroborates the effectiveness of c-/m-ECT in a real-world population. Especially, patients with shorter time since index ECT seem to be at high risk for severe clinical deterioration in the case of treatment discontinuation or reduction.","Methfessel, Isabel; Besse, Matthias; Belz, Michael; Zilles-Wegner, David",Acta psychiatr. scand,137,20

Therefore, it is necessary to understand and manage all of the implicated factors in order to maintain a high standard of care, even in sub-par circumstances. Methods: This was a three-phase, mixed-design study. Initially, the Delphi method allowed us to analyze the causes of poor outcomes in a cohort of an aggregate of Italian COVID-19 wards via an Ishikawa diagram. Then, for each retrieved item, a score was assigned according to a pros/cons, opportunities/threats system. Scores were also assigned according to potential value/perceived risk. Finally, the performances of MCs (Medicine-COVID-19 wards) and MCFs (Medicine-COVID-19-free: Internal Medicine wards) units were represented via a Barber's nomogram. Results: MCFs hospitalized 790 patients (-23.90% compared to 2019 Internal Medicine admissions). The main risk factors for mortality were patients admitted from local facilities (+7%) and the presence of comorbidities (>3: 100%, &#8805;5: 24.7%). A total of 197 (25%) patients were treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The most deaths (57.14%) occurred in patients admitted from local facilities.

Much remains unknown about host cells and tissues affected by coronavirus infections, including the hematopoietic system. Here, we discuss the recent findings examining effects that coronavirus infection or exposure has on hematopoietic cells and the clinical implications for these effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have centered on SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and mature immune cells may be susceptible to infection and are impacted functionally by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These findings have important implications regarding hematologic complications arising from COVID-19 and other coronavirus-induced disease, which we discuss here. SUMMARY: Infection with coronaviruses sometimes leads to hematologic complications in patients, and these hematologic complications are associated with poorer prognosis. These hematologic complications may be caused by coronavirus direct infection or impact on primitive hematopoietic cells or mature immune cells, by indirect effects on these cells, or by a combination thereof. It is important to understand how hematologic complications arise in order to seek new treatments to improve patient outcomes.","Ropa, James; Trinh, Thao; Aljoufi, Arafat; Broxmeyer, Hal E",Curr Opin Hematol,137,10

The purpose of the current study was to characterize driving behavior changes among adolescents as a function of COVID-19 restrictions. It was hypothesized that adolescent driving would be reduced by COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger teens, non-minorities, females, non-working teens, and those with higher prosocial tendencies. METHODS: Participants were licensed drivers in ""REACT,"" a longitudinal study of adolescent driving attention. Upon enrollment in REACT, drivers were required to be age 16 or 18, have been issued a driver's license within the last two weeks, and be fluent in written/spoken English. The current observational cohort study was of drivers reporting driving exposure between February 8 and April 22, 2020. Linear mixed-effects models estimated differences in driving changes between COVID-19 periods. RESULTS: Results indicated a decrease across pre-COVID-19 period (February 8 - March 13, 2020) in days driven per week and vehicle miles driven (VMD) was explained by the change of slope post-COVID-19 restrictions (March 14 - April 22, 2020). Post-COVID-19, driving days per week decreased by 37 % and VMD decreased by 35 %. This decrease was lower in ethnic minorities, older adolescents, and employed adolescents. Those with greater dire prosocial tendencies showed greater post-COVID-19 driving decline. DISCUSSION: Findings provide early evidence of COVID-19 restriction-related adolescent driving changes suggesting older, employed, minority teens and teens with lower prosocial tendencies are less likely to reduce driving behavior. These observations provide a foundation for more extensive studies of adolescent drivers during various driving and contact restrictions and inform future public health campaigns for social distancing.","Stavrinos, Despina; McManus, Benjamin; Mrug, Sylvie; He, Harry; Gresham, Bria; Albright, M Grace; Svancara, Austin M; Whittington, Caroline; Underhill, Andrea; White, David M",Accid Anal Prev,137,19

Though a positive result is highly specific for the virus, the false negative rate of the test can vary from 20% to 100%. This can have implications including, but not limited to, delay in treatment, improper management, and more costly and invasive testing. We present a case of a 54 year old male who presented for hypoxic respiratory failure diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) after extensive workup including 5 negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests (NP RT-PCR). Case The patient is a 54 year old male with a past medical history significant for morbid obesity and well controlled asthma who presented for dyspnea on exertion. Throughout the patient's hospitalization, his oxygen requirements rapidly increased leading to a short course of ventilator support. CT angiogram of the chest on presentation did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism however did show bilateral multi-lobar ground glass opacities. The patient admitted to recently removing an old carpet at work but denied any other significant inhalational exposures. Dozens of his co-workers recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Extensive workup including respiratory virus panel, 5 NP RT-PCR tests one week apart, basic rheumatologic serologies, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel were all unremarkable. Treatment for community acquired pneumonia was completed without improvement. Empiric treatment with steroids was started. BAL and trans-bronchial biopsies were initially unremarkable (Table 1). Repeat imaging demonstrated multiple sub-segmental pulmonary emboli. RT-PCR of the BAL specimen and serum antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were collected, both of which resulted positive. The patient was eventually discharged on oral anticoagulation, a short prednisone taper, and 2L oxygen via nasal cannula on exertion with scheduled outpatient follow-up. Conclusion NP RT-PCR has become the gold standard diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2, but it does not come without imperfections. Timing of the test in relation to symptoms, assay limit of detection, and sample collection technique all affect the results. Our patient's clinical presentation, known recent exposure, and imaging findings increased his probability of having SARS-CoV-2. However, NP RT-PCR was negative on 5 separate occasions. Limitations of this test may therefore extend beyond our current understanding. After obtaining SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis from the BAL, this obviated the need for a thoracoscopic biopsy and treatment with prolonged steroids. BAL RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing consequently may play a necessary role in such patients with negative NP RT-PCR testing.","Patel, S.; Villgran, V.

Hence, this study aims to investigate the association between population migration and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China while investigating its measures for pandemic prevention and control. Subject and methods: A susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dormancy (SEIRD) model for the spread of COVID-19 in China was created to theoretically simulate the relationship between the populations migrating from Wuhan and the number of confirmed cases. Data from Baidu's real-time dynamic pandemic monitoring system were elicited to empirically examine the theoretical inferences. Results: Populations migrating from Wuhan to other cities increased the initial number of latently infected cases in these cities, raising the number of confirmed cases. Hence, implementing social distancing between the susceptible and infected populations could effectively lower the number of infected cases. Using data from Baidu's real-time dynamic pandemic monitoring system, the empirical results revealed that an increase of 1000 persons migrating from Wuhan raised the number of confirmed cases by 4.82 persons. Conclusion: This study confirmed the positive association between population migration and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Based on the theoretical and empirical analysis, China's pandemic prevention and control measures are discussed.","Yang, Hualei; Hu, Sen; Zheng, Xiaodong; Wu, Yuanyang; Lin, Xueyu; Xie, Lin; Shen, Zheng",Z Gesundh Wiss,137,30

The objectives of this preliminary study were to compare responses of pulmonary circulation parameters to 100% oxygen (O2 ) and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in infants with BPD and PH using echocardiography. Responses between fetal growth restriction (FGR) and appropriate for gestational age infants were compared. Ten infants <28 weeks GA at birth were assessed at &#8805;36 weeks corrected gestation. Baseline echocardiography1 was performed which was repeated (echocardiography2) after 30 minutes of O2 . After a gap of 2-3 hours, iNO was administered for 15 minutes and echocardiography3 was performed, followed by iNO weaning. The gestation and birthweight of the cohort were 25.9 ± 1.6 weeks and 612 ± 175 g. Assessments were performed at 38.7 ± 1.4 weeks corrected gestational age. Baseline time to peak velocity: right ventricular ejection time (TPV/RVETc) increased from 0.24 ± 0.02 to 0.27 ± 0.02 (O2 , p = .01) and 0.31 ± 0.03 (iNO, p < .001), indicating a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR]. Baseline tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) increased from 8.1 ± 0.6 mm to 9.3 ± 0.7 mm (O2 , p = .01) and 10.5 ± 1.1 mm (iNO, p = .0004), indicating improved ventricular systolic performance. Percentage change for all parameters was greater with iNO. Significant correlations between cardiac performance and PVR were noted. FGR infants noted higher baseline PVR (TPV/RVETc, 0.21 ± 0.02 vs. 0.25 ± 0.01, p = .002), lower ventricular performance (TAPSE, 7 ± 1.2 mm vs. 8.6 ± 6 mm, p = .003), and lower percentage change with O2 and iNO.

The causative pathogen is a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with genomic similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The disease is transmitted among humans either through direct contact or via droplets from sneeze or cough. Most infected persons remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but some patients may develop severe clinical features, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis and even death. People of advanced age and/or with underlying diseases (including diabetes mellitus) are at greater risk. The innate and adaptive immune system are responsible for protecting the body against viral infection. Nevertheless, it is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the immune system through immunomodulating mechanisms which intensify its pathogenesis. A delayed or reduced response of the innate immune system is critical for the development of pathogenesis of the virus. People with diabetes are more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. The present article speculates that special aspects of the immune dysfunction caused by chronic hyperglycaemia is the main reason for this susceptibility.","Milionis, Charalampos; Milioni, Stella Olga",J Diabetes Metab Disord,137,23

The paper presents the instructional theory developed through two implementations and discusses how this instructional theory may enrich learning regardless of the constraints during the COVID19 pandemic, in which small-group meetings are possible but large-class meetings are moved online. Although, in theory, wikis should be a powerful technology to support collaborative learning, empirical research reveals challenges regarding student motivation, group dynamics, and assessment. To bridge the gaps between theory and practice, we used the design-based research approach (DBR) and collaborated with two expert practitioners to develop the instructional theory. The research process includes an initial theory, implementations in two cases, and theory refinement. Data collection and analysis involve literature review, multiple individual interviews with experts before and during implementations, weekly class observations, focus-group interviews with students during implementation, content analysis of class wikis, and focus-group interviews with experts for theory refinement. The results of the study presented in this paper focus on the refined instructional theory, which was grounded in theoretical work, expert instructors' heuristic knowledge, and local effectiveness. In addition, this paper includes design principles with some considerations to support learning in COVID19 environments. In other words, the success of using wikis to foster a culture of sharing, and to increase student motivation and participation in individual or group project work, as well as in community knowledge building for an entire class, may enrich learning during the pandemic by creating learner-centered, knowledge-centered, assessment-centered, and community-centered learning environments.","Lin, C.

Mobile health (mHealth) apps, such as meditation apps, are a novel method for improving health and behaviors. These apps may be a critical health promotion strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic and could potentially be used to address rural health disparities. However, limited research has assessed whether meditation app health outcomes are associated with rural and urban residence, and it is unclear whether disparities in health and behaviors between rural and urban populations would persist among meditation app users. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status, psychological outcomes, and physical activity among users of a mobile meditation app. We further aimed to explore associations between rural or urban status and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity, and to explore changes in these outcomes in rural versus urban app users over time. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a national survey conducted among subscribers to the meditation app Calm. Eligible participants completed online baseline surveys from April to June 2020, and follow-up surveys from June to September 2020, assessing demographics, psychological outcomes, physical activity, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. RESULTS: Participants (N=8392) were mostly female (7041/8392, 83.9%), non-Hispanic (7855/8392, 93.6%), and White (7704/8392, 91.8%); had high socioeconomic status (income &#8805;US $100,000: 4389/8392, 52.3%; bachelor's degree or higher: 7251/8392, 86.4%); and resided in a metropolitan area core (rural-urban commuting area code 1: 7192/8392, 85.7%). Rural or urban status was not associated with baseline stress, depression, anxiety, pre-COVID-19 and current physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Repeated-measures models showed overall decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived effects of COVID-19 on physical activity from baseline to follow-up, and no significant changes in stress or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress and mental health over time. Models also showed no significant main effects of rural or urban status, COVID-19 statewide prevalence at baseline, or change in COVID-19 statewide prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find associations between rural or urban status and psychological outcomes (ie, stress, depression, and anxiety), physical activity, or perceived effects of COVID-19 on stress, mental health, and physical activity. Rural or urban status does not appear to drive differences in outcomes among meditation app users, and the use of mHealth apps should continue to be explored as a health promotion strategy in both rural and urban populations. Furthermore, our results did not show negative cumulative effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes and physical activity among app users in our sample, the majority of whom were urban, White, female, and of high socioeconomic status. Further research is needed to investigate meditation app use as a health promotion strategy in rural and urban populations.","Bhuiyan, Nishat; Puzia, Megan; Stecher, Chad; Huberty, Jennifer",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,137,32

We examined the pathogen-specific nature of this autoreactivity by examining anti-BPI in bacteremia patients.Methods: Antibodies to bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and bacterial antigens were measured in sera by ELISA from five patient cohorts (n=214). Antibody avidity was investigated.Results: Bacteremic patient sera (n=32) exhibited IgG antibody autoreactivity against BPI in 64.7% and 46.7% of patients with positive blood cultures for P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively. Autoantibody titers correlated with IgG responses to bacterial extracts and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A prospective cohort of bacteremic patient sera exhibited anti-BPI IgG responses in 23/154 (14.9%) patients with autoreactivity present at the time of positive blood cultures in patients with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including 8/60 (13.3%) patients with S. aureus Chronic tissue infection with Staphylococcus aureus was associated with BPI antibody autoreactivity in 2/15 patients (13.3%). Previously, we have demonstrated that BPI autoreactivity in CF patient sera exhibits high avidity. Here, a similar pattern was seen in BE patient sera. In contrast, sera from patients with bacteremia exhibited low avidity.Conclusions: These data indicate that low-avidity IgG responses to BPI can arise acutely in response to bacteremia and this association is not limited to P. aeruginosa. This is to be contrasted with chronic respiratory infection with P. aeruginosa, suggesting that either the chronicity or the site of infection selects for the generation of high avidity responses with biologic consequences for airway immunity.","Theprungsirikul, J; Thaden, J T; Wierzbicki, R M; Burns, A S; Skopelja-Gardner, S; Fowler, V G; Winthrop, K L; Martin, I W; Rigby, W F C",Infect. immun,137,24

The resultant flours were known as GNF-60, GNF-70, GNF-80, and GNF-90, respectively. The effect of drying on rheology and technofunctional properties was studied. The drying at different temperatures resulted in significant changes in technofunctional and pasting properties of GNF. The water and oil absorption capacities increased with the increase in drying temperature from 0.45 to 0.70 g/g and 0.35 to 0.46 g/g, respectively. The viscosity of the GNF decreased with the increase in drying temperature from 1592 to 990 cP. The increase in the drying temperature resulted in an increase in the swelling power and solubility from 7 to 11 g/g and 29% to 117%, respectively. The rise in temperature increased the gelatinisation peak temperature and reduced the gelatinization enthalpy.. The shear rate dependency on study shear stress and study shear viscosity showed a nonNewtonian behavior for all the samples. The storage modulus, G ' was found greater than the loss modulus, G '' and increased with the rise in temperature from 60 to 90 degrees C indicating the dominance of elastic behavior. The FTIR and XRD spectra revealed structural characteristic peaks with increased intensities at a higher temperature. The drying of the GNF at different temperatures is being reported for the first time and resulted in a significant alteration of the technofunctional and rheological properties. The study will serve a basis for the exploration of the GNF in industrial-related processing operations. Practical implications According to the report jointly published by the World Health Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization and the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, about 650 million of the total world's population went hungry in 2019, with the expected 120 million addition to this figure due to Covid-19 pandemic by the end of 2020. The economically lower class people are mainly involved in hunger and malnutrition due to either unavailability or higher costs of the nutritionally rich food resources. Exploration of underutilized and nutritionally rich sources becomes the need of the hour in this type of situation. Gorgon nut being a nutritionally rich and underutilized crop of mainly Asian continent, can serve as an affordable food source to fight this hunger and malnutrition problem.","Bhat, M. S.; Arya, S.

The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management. The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic. For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation.","Chen, Zhimin; Fu, Junfen; Shu, Qiang; Wang, Wei; Chen, Yinghu; Hua, Chunzhen; Li, Fubang; Lin, Ru; Tang, Lanfang; Wang, Tianlin; Wang, Yingshuo; Xu, Weize; Yang, Zihao; Ye, Sheng; Yuan, Tianming; Zhang, Chenmei; Zhang, Yuanyuan",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,137,16

This study examined the long-term outcomes and response to NIV in a large adult CF cohort. METHODS: All patients attending a UK adult CF Centre receiving NIV as treatment for hypercapnic respiratory failure over a nine-year period were studied prospectively. Detailed clinical data was recorded and longitudinal data measurements were examined for the three years pre and post NIV initiation to assess effect of this intervention. RESULTS: 94 patients, mean age 29.9 (SD 9.7) years, percent predicted FEV1 21.5 (7.3), received NIV. All patients commenced NIV in a hospital setting. 21 remain alive, 24 received double lung transplant, 49 died without lung transplantation. NIV use was associated with a stabilisation and improvement in both FEV1 and FVC from NIV set up to three years post follow-up, in addition to an increase in body mass index and attenuation of PCO2 (all p<0.001). No single parameter was found to predict long-term NIV response but baseline PCO2 (p=0.005), CRP (p=0.004) and age (p=0.009) were identified as independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: NIV use in CF adults is associated with improvements in lung function and attenuation of hypercapnia which is maintained for up to three years post NIV initiation. Outcomes for CF patients with severe pulmonary disease commenced on NIV have significantly improved with fifty percent of patients expected to survive for approximately five years.","Wadsworth, L E; Belcher, J; Bright-Thomas, R J",J. cyst. fibros,137,27

These measures carry social and economic costs, so societies may be unable to maintain them for more than a short period of time. Intervention policy design often relies on numerical simulations of epidemic models, but comparing policies and assessing their robustness demands clear principles that apply across strategies. Here we derive the theoretically optimal strategy for using a time-limited intervention to reduce the peak prevalence of a novel disease in the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered epidemic model. We show that broad classes of easier-to-implement strategies can perform nearly as well as the theoretically optimal strategy. But neither the optimal strategy nor any of these near-optimal strategies is robust to implementation error: small errors in timing the intervention produce large increases in peak prevalence. Our results reveal fundamental principles of non-pharmaceutical disease control and expose their potential fragility. For robust control, an intervention must be strong, early, and ideally sustained. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for non-pharmaceutical epidemic mitigation strategies that can be effective even if they are limited in duration. Here, the authors derive analytically optimal and near-optimal time-limited strategies for limiting the epidemic peak in the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model and show that, due to the sensitivity of such strategies to implementation errors, timely action is fundamental to non-pharmaceutical disease control.","Morris, D.

Mitral valve thrombosis has a higher incidence than aortic valve thrombosis with a nearly 5-fold increase. Various factors contribute to MVT. The most common cause of valve thrombosis is poor adherence/disruption of anticoagulation therapy. Low cardiac output is known to increase the risk of prosthetic valve thrombosis. Other factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and other patient comorbidities might also play a role. Decreased flow promotes hypercoagulability. Lower pressure in the left atrium (and higher velocities in the left ventricle) can partially contribute to the higher incidence of mitral MVT versus aortic MVT. The presenting symptoms usually depend on the severity of the valve thrombosis; nonobstructive valve thrombosis patients have progressive dyspnea, signs of heart failure, and systemic embolization with strokes being the most common complication. In this article, we present a case of a middle-aged woman with a history of mitral and aortic mechanical prosthesis who presented with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary edema due to mechanical aortic valve prosthesis thrombosis. She had an isolated mechanical aortic valve prosthesis thrombosis with intact mitral valve, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been described.

We assessed the rate and clinical presentation of COVID-19, and adherence to therapy in a large cohort of patients with ARD followed-up in a tertiary University-Hospital in Northeast Italy. METHODS: Between April 9th and April 25th, 2020, after SARS-CoV-2 infection peak, a telephone survey investigating the impact of COVID-19 on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) was administered. Demographics, disease activity status, therapy, occupational exposure, and adherence to social distancing advise were also collected. RESULTS: 916 patients (397 SLE, 182 AAV, 176 SSc, 111 RA, 50 IIM) completed the survey. 148 patients developed at least one symptom compatible with COVID-19 (cough 96, sore throat 64, fever 64, arthromyalgias 59, diarrhea 26, conjunctivitis 18, ageusia/hyposmia, 18).

Design/Methodology/Approach: Desk research and interview method have been applied in this paper. The literature review concerned two areas, i.e., the analytical approach to management and the management of university educational processes. Unstructured interviews conducted with university authorities located in Poland were the second research method applied. Findings: Based on literature studies, conducted interviews and authors' personal experience, the original model of academic teachers' remote work evaluation that implements an analytical approach and utilises data mart concept and business intelligence tools has been created. This model contains the following elements, the conceptual model of data mart allowing the evaluation of courses realisation and teachers job, KPIs utilised in this evaluation, and the dashboard presenting KPI's values. Two main areas representing courses evaluation and teachers' evaluation have been considered. Practical Implications: The authors propose the solution that utilises an analytical approach to improve the management of the evaluation process of educational processes at the university. Created model may be a valuable source of inspiration for university authorities responsible for ensuring the high efficiency of these processes, and for people responsible for developing teachers' competencies. According to the authors, the implementation of this model can contribute to the improvement of the academic education. Originality/Value: An analytical approach in evaluation of educational processes proposed by authors is innovative in nature and is particularly important in the context of increasingly widespread remote education. Its adoption to management states a big challenge for university authorities.","Muryjas, Piotr Wawer Monika Rzemieniak Magdalena",European Research Studies,137,6

If this checkup is the only screening opportunity, women who do not attend or whose depressive episode occurs at a different time may not be identified. We evaluated women's encounters with postpartum health care to identify screening opportunities for postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS). Materials and Methods: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data for 2012-2015 from eight jurisdictions (n = 23,990, representing 1,939,865 women) were used to calculate percentage of women reporting attendance at postpartum checkups, well-child visits, or postpartum home visitation, by presence of PDS. PDS were assessed using a modified two-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Using Modified Poisson regression, adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare health services by PDS, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Almost all women with or without PDS attended a postpartum checkup (85.1% and 91.4%; aPR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.99) and their infants attended a well-child visit (97.3% and 98.9%; aPR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00); 13.7% and 10.9% received home visitation (aPR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02-1.35). Of women with PDS who missed their postpartum checkup, 13.5% reported infant attendance at well-child visits, and 2.0% received home visitation. Of women with PDS, 98.8%, 86.1%, and 11.2% attended 1, 2, or 3 health services. Conclusion: A large percentage of women with PDS may attend well-child visits or receive home visitation, representing opportunities for depression screening and referral for care.","Haight, Sarah C; Ko, Jean Y; Yogman, Michael W; Farr, Sherry L",J. womens health (Larchmt.),137,16

So far COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and modes of death under state of the art care have not been systematically studied. METHODS: This retrospective observational monocenter cohort study was performed after implementation of a non-restricted, dynamic tertiary care model at the University Medical Center Freiburg, an experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) referral center. All hospitalised patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, secondary endpoints included major complications and modes of death. A multistate analysis and a Cox regression analysis for competing risk models were performed. Modes of death were determined by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Between February 25, and May 8, 213 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 65 years, 129 patients (61%) were male. 70 patients (33%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 57 patients (81%) received mechanical ventilation and 23 patients (33%) ECMO support. Using multistate methodology, the estimated probability to die within 90 days after COVID-19 onset was 24% in the whole cohort. If the levels of care at time of study entry were accounted for, the probabilities to die were 16% if the patient was initially on a regular ward, 47% if in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 57% if mechanical ventilation was required at study entry. Age ≥65 years and male sex were predictors for in-hospital death. Predominant complications–as judged by two independent reviewers–determining modes of death were multi-organ failure, septic shock and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. CONCLUSION: In a dynamic care model COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality remained very high. In the absence of potent antiviral agents, strategies to alleviate or prevent the identified complications should be investigated.

Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across different countries and projected pandemic outcomes. We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea. We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce economic and social instability.","Potluri, Rahul; Lavu, Deepthi",,137,1

COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public willingness to be vaccinated. Methods We used a multi-methods approach - involving an online cross-sectional survey and semi-structured interviews - to investigate parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years) who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey. Nineteen survey participants were interviewed. Findings Most survey participants reported they would likely accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%). Less than 4% of survey participants reported that they would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Survey participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves than their child/children. Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Survey participants from lower-income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine. In open-text survey responses and interviews, self-protection from COVID-19 was reported as the main reason for vaccine acceptance. Common concerns identified in open-text responses and interviews were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, mostly prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine. Conclusion Information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public. To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority and lower-income groups who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.","Bell, Sadie; Clarke, Richard; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Walker, Jemma L; Paterson, Pauline",Vaccine,137,20

However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS) coronaviruses contain more than one fusion peptide sequences. We have shown that the internal fusion peptide 1 (IFP1) of SARS-CoV is far more efficient than its N-terminal counterpart (FP) to induce hemifusion between small unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, the ability of IFP1 to induce hemifusion formation increases dramatically with growing cholesterol content in the membrane.

The COVID-19 pandemic heightens this risk. This pilot aims to enhance professional fulfillment and support while decreasing risk and prevalence of burnout in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) trainees through virtual delivery of a Balint-like group incorporating brief emotional awareness modules. METHODS: Six CAP trainees participated. Eight 60-min sessions held every 2 weeks were co-facilitated by a psychologist and psychiatrist who developed the curricular content. Five of the eight semi-structured sessions combined a brief emotional awareness enhancing module with a Balint-based approach to case review. The authors assessed trainee well-being, professional fulfillment, and sense of professional support pre- and post-intervention with the Well-being Index (WBI), Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI), and the authors’ own supplemental survey. Descriptive statistics were reported. RESULTS: Trainees found the curriculum feasible and useful. Surveys showed a reduction in burnout from three to zero participants (p = 0.03) and specific improvements in enthusiasm (p = 0.013), empathy with colleagues (p = 0.093), and connectedness with colleagues (p = 0.007) and patients (p = 0.042) at work. There were also improvements in happiness (p = 0.042) and valued contributions at work (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: A novel well-being curriculum focused on combining brief emotional awareness enhancing modules with a Balint-like approach enhances professional fulfillment and a sense of professional support and decreases the risk and prevalence of burnout, even when delivered virtually to a group of CAP fellows. Results support the planned expansion of this low-cost, high-value intervention for trainee well-being.","Chochol, Megan D.; Pease, Eric; Swintak, Cosima; Anand, Uma",Acad Psychiatry,137,29

Seventy-four residents and 53 members of staff were included in the present study. The staff underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2, and both the staff and residents underwent serological tests to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Conversely, 94% of residents and 38% members of the staff were tested positive to the nasopharyngeal swab tests during the second COVID-19 pandemic wave (data collected from November 1 to November 30, 2020). Our experience suggests that, in the presence of a life-threatening pandemic such as SARS-CoV-2 infection, the prompt use of restrictive procedures can prevent the spread and progression of disease in assisted living facilities in the short term but may fail in the long term, especially when the prevalence of the COVID-19 greatly increased outside the facility enhancing the risk of import the disease from outside.

Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza, favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus, rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an epidemic lethal RNA virus infection.

Matériels et méthodes Les PS symptomatiques, les cas contacts et ceux présentant une forte anxiété ont été testés. Le diagnostic de COVID-19 a été réalisé par RT-PCR après prélèvement nasopharyngé. Résultats Au cours de cette période, 30,4 % (1735/5704) des PS ont bénéficié de 3057 écouvillons nasaux. Parmi ceux-ci, 8,0 % (138/1735) étaient infectés par le SRAS-CoV-2. Parmi les PS positifs au SARS-CoV-2, 21,7 % étaient asymptomatiques. Dans les unités COVID et les unités non COVID, le nombre de personnes infectées par le SARS-CoV-2 était respectivement de 5,8 % (13/223) et 8,2 % (125/1512) (p =0,2). Parmi les PS travaillant hors des unités COVID, 6,4 % (12/188) des agents des unités pédiatriques et 8,1 % (126/1547) des agents des unités adultes ou des laboratoires étaient positifs au SARS-CoV-2 (p =0,4). Parmi les PS des unités adultes, 6,4 % (8/125) provenaient de la médecine interne, 5,6 % (7/125) de la neurologie, 5,6 % (7/125) de la pharmacie et 5,6 % (7/125) du service médical d’urgence. Parmi les personnes atteintes du SARS-CoV2, les infirmières, les internes/médecins et les aides-soignants étaient les catégories professionnelles les plus touchées avec respectivement 30,0 % (40/138), 21,0 % (29/138) et 10,9 % (15/138). Parmi les médecins, la majorité étaient des internes (70,0 % ; 20/29). Les travailleurs de plus de 50 ans étaient moins susceptibles d’être positifs au SARS-CoV-2 (3,8 % ; 14/373) que les autres travailleurs plus jeunes (9,1 % ; 124/1362) (p <0,001). Aucun cas grave de COVID-19 n’a été signalé dans notre population au cours de cette période. Conclusion Parmi les PS positifs détectés, 21,7 % (25/115) étaient asymptomatiques. Ces données soulignent l’importance du dépistage systématique des cas contacts même asymptomatiques et de l’utilisation d’équipements de protection individuelle (EPI) pour éviter la transmission. Le pourcentage des cas positifs diminuait à mesure que l’âge augmentait, en particulier après l’âge de 45 ans. Les personnels de plus de 45 ans, étant plus expérimentées et se sentant plus à risque, ont pu être mieux protégées ou affectées à des services moins à risque ou confinés à domicile. Les PS travaillant dans des unités COVID-19 n’étaient pas plus souvent infectés que ceux travaillant dans des unités non COVID-19, probablement parce qu’ils étaient plus conscients des dangers et des risques associés au SARS-CoV-2, qu’ils disposaient de plus d’équipements de protection individuelle, qu’ils les portaient de manière plus stricte et qu’ils étaient mieux informés et formés.","Noel, L.; Marion, E.; Boufercha, R.; Martin, F.; Zandotti, C.; Charrel, R.; Bouhadfane, M.; Lehucher-Michel, M.; Villa, A.",Infectious Diseases Now,137,24

In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the MERS-CoV genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on MERS-CoV transmission, evolution, and origin. METHODS: Full genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from PCR-confirmed clinical samples. Viral genomes were obtained from 21 MERS cases of which 13 had 100%, four 85–95%, and four 30–50% genome coverage. Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published MERS-CoV genomes, was done. FINDINGS: Three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes were identified in Riyadh. Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse. Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein. The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction. INTERPRETATION: We present the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes (21) described so far. MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission. Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV are identified and suggest lower R(0) values. Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people. Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed.

Thus, the major issues to be addressed are the identification of a valuable predictor marker to foresee the disease risk and new therapeutic targets to improve relapsed/resistant patients’ outcome. We identified JAK2 Y1007-1008 as a potential prognosis marker as well as a therapeutic target for patients with progressive disease or relapse and suggest that its inhibition by ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 FDA approved inhibitor, could represent a novel therapeutic approach to overcome therapy resistance and meliorate the outcome of pediatric T-LBL patients. ABSTRACT: Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is the second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in childhood, mainly of T cell origin (T-LBL). Although current treatment protocols allow a complete remission in 85% of cases, the second-line treatment overall survival for patients with progressive or relapsed disease is around 14%, making this the major issue to be confronted. Thus, we performed a Reverse Phase Protein Array study in a cohort of 22 T-LBL patients to find reliable disease risk marker(s) and new therapeutic targets to improve pediatric T-LBL patients’ outcome. Interestingly, we pinpointed JAK2 Y1007-1008 as a potential prognosis marker as well as a therapeutic target in poor prognosis patients. Hence, the hyperactivation of the JAK1/2-STAT6 pathway characterizes these latter patients. Moreover, we functionally demonstrated that STAT6 hyperactivation contributes to therapy resistance by binding the glucocorticoid receptor, thus inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This was further confirmed by specific STAT6 gene silencing followed by dexamethasone treatment. Finally, JAK1/2-STAT6 pathway inhibition by ruxolitinib, an FDA approved drug, in cell line models and in one T-LBL primary sample led to cell proliferation reduction and increased apoptosis. Globally, our results identify a new potential prognostic marker and suggest a novel therapeutic approach to overcome therapy resistance in pediatric T-LBL patients.","Veltri, Giulia; Silvestri, Chiara; Gallingani, Ilaria; Sandei, Max; Vencato, Sara; Lovisa, Federica; Cortese, Giuliana; Pillon, Marta; Carraro, Elisa; Bresolin, Silvia; Biffi, Alessandra; Basso, Giuseppe; Accordi, Benedetta; Mussolin, Lara; Serafin, Valentina",Cancers (Basel),137,31

This study explores coresident networks within an AL community and identifies factors associated with residents’ social ties. METHODS: Acquaintance and companionship networks within the community are described using cross-sectional survey data (N = 38). We use inferential network statistical methods to estimate parameters for factors associated with residents’ acquaintance and companionship ties. RESULTS: Residents reported an average of 10 acquaintances and almost 4 companionships with other residents in the sample. The likelihood a resident had an acquaintance was associated with higher levels of cognitive functioning (p < .05), higher levels of physical limitations (p < .01), living in the AL community for a longer time (p < .01), and less frequent contact with outside family and friends (p < .05). Acquaintances were more likely between residents who moved in around the same time as each other (p < .01), lived on the same floor (p < .001), or had similar levels of physical limitations (p < .05). Companionships were more likely to be reported by male residents (p < .05) and residents with higher levels of cognitive functioning (p < .05) or depressive symptoms (p < .05).

The mosquito-borne Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the Togaviridae family and is an important biodefense pathogen and select agent. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for VEEV infections; therefore, it is imperative to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. We hypothesized that a functional UPS is required for efficient VEEV multiplication. We have shown that at non-toxic concentrations Bortezomib, a FDA-approved inhibitor of the proteasome, proved to be a potent inhibitor of VEEV multiplication in the human astrocytoma cell line U87MG. Bortezomib inhibited the virulent Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain and the attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV. Additional studies with virulent strains of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) demonstrated that Bortezomib is a broad spectrum inhibitor of the New World alphaviruses. Time-of-addition assays showed that Bortezomib was an effective inhibitor of viral multiplication even when the drug was introduced many hours post exposure to the virus. Mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the VEEV capsid protein is ubiquitinated in infected cells, which was validated by confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequent studies revealed that capsid is ubiquitinated on K48 during early stages of infection which was affected by Bortezomib treatment. This study will aid future investigations in identifying host proteins as potential broad spectrum therapeutic targets for treating alphavirus infections.","Amaya, Moushimi; Keck, Forrest; Lindquist, Michael; Voss, Kelsey; Scavone, Lauren; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Roberts, Brian; Bailey, Charles; Schmaljohn, Connie; Narayanan, Aarthi",PLoS One,137,1

However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.","Plante, Jessica A.; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Xia, Hongjie; Johnson, Bryan A.; Lokugamage, Kumari G.; Zhang, Xianwen; Muruato, Antonio E.; Zou, Jing; Fontes-Garfias, Camila R.; Mirchandani, Divya; Scharton, Dionna; Bilello, John P.; Ku, Zhiqiang; An, Zhiqiang; Kalveram, Birte; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Xie, Xuping; Plante, Kenneth S.; Weaver, Scott C.; Shi, Pei-Yong",bioRxiv,137,26

METHODS: The number of diagnosed cases in Fujian Province was collected, and the time distribution of these cases was analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that the COVID-19 prevalence in areas with epidemics due to imported cases could be divided into two stages. The first stage was an outbreak dominated by imported cases, with the data showing an obviously skewed distribution. The second stage was dominated by nonimported cases with sporadic and low-level fluctuations. Moreover, the data demonstrated that the ratio of unexplained infections to nonimported cases was increasing. CONCLUSIONS: A two-stage outbreak in areas with epidemics due to imported cases, effective control of the “source of infection” and blocking of the transmission route can significantly minimize the peak height in the first stage and the spread of the epidemic in the second stage. Control of the epidemic in the second stage requires prevention and control of the aggregation of cases caused by unexplained infections.","Zhang, Wenchang; Liu, Jin; Zhang, Chenyun; Sun, Yi; Huang, Huiling",Int J Public Health,137,20

The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain. The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask.

Complications such as hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: No meta-analysis has explored if or not diabetes related to mortality of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this meta-analysis first aims to explore the possible clinical mortality between diabetes and COVID-19, analyze if diabetes patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are exposed to the worst clinical prognostic risk, and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. RESULTS: Our results showed a close relationship between diabetes and mortality of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.31–2.36; P = 0.0002). The pooled data were calculated with the fixed effects model (FEM) as no heterogeneity appeared in the studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that after omitting any single study or converting a random effect model to FEM, the main results still held. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that diabetes increases the mortality of patients with COVID-19. These results indicated the disturbance of blood glucose in the COVID-19 patients.

Our objective was to review adjustments for hospitals and healthcare professionals across 20 countries. We developed an analytical framework distinguishing between payment adjustments compensating income loss and those covering extra costs related to COVID-19. Information was extracted from the Covid-19 Health System Response Monitor (HSRM) and classified according to the framework. We found that income loss was not a problem in countries where professionals were paid by salary or capitation and hospitals received global budgets. In countries where payment was based on activity, income loss was compensated through budgets and higher fees. New FFS payments were introduced to incentivize remote services. Payments for COVID-19 related costs included new fees for out- and inpatient services but also new PD and DRG tariffs for hospitals. Budgets covered the costs of adjusting wards, creating new (ICU) beds, and hiring staff. We conclude that public payers assumed most of the COVID-19-related financial risk. In view of future pandemics policymakers should work to increase resilience of payment systems by: (1) having systems in place to rapidly adjust payment systems; (2) being aware of the economic incentives created by these adjustments such as cost-containment or increasing the number of patients or services, that can result in unintended consequences such as risk selection or overprovision of care; and (3) periodically evaluating the effects of payment adjustments on access and quality of care.","Waitzberg, Ruth; Sophie, Gerkens; Dimova, Antoniya; Bryndová, Lucie; Vrangbæk, Karsten; Jervelund, Signe Smith; Birk, Hans Okkels; Rajan, Selina; Habicht, Triin; Tynkkynen, Liina-Kaisa; Keskimäki, Ilmo; Or, Zeynep; Gandré, Coralie; Winkelmann, Juliane; Ricciardi, Walter; de Belvis, Antonio Giulio; Poscia, Andrea; Morsella, Alisha; Slapšinskaitė, Agnė; Miščikienė, Laura; Kroneman, Madelon; de Jong, Judith; Tambor, Marzena; Sowada, Christoph; Scintee, Silvia Gabriela; Vladescu, Cristian; Albreht, Tit; Bernal-Delgado, Enrique; Angulo-Pueyo, Ester; Estupiñán-Romero, Francisco; Nils, Janlöv; Mantwill, Sarah; Van Ginneken, Ewout; Quentin, Wilm",Health Policy,137,20

The accreditation standards can be used effectively to guide the surgical teams in the transformation of the specialty. The 17 standards that are used to evaluate surgical teams relate to the activities that represent the continuum of clinical care as well as aspects related to learning. Within the subsections and standards are opportunities for surgeons and surgical teams to use the standards to effectively deliver services and to continuously improve patient care. In 38 recent Canadian Accreditation AIM surveys, that included at least one surgical team, there were a total of 75 recommendations made to the teams.

Methods All patients who were scheduled for elective, outpatient orthopaedic sports medicine procedures at one of two of outpatient surgical centers between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were asked to complete a custom survey during a post-operative clinic visit or phone call at a minimum of two-weeks or were subject to a routine screening questionnaire and temperature screen at the time of the first post-operative follow-up visit. The survey questionnaire assessed for any COVID-19-related symptoms. Surgical case logs were retrieved to review for any cancelled surgeries due to a positive pre-operative COVID-19 test. Results A total of 3.5% of patients (n=39/1119) scheduled for surgery were diagnosed with COVID-19 during preoperative testing, resulting in surgical cancellation. Patients with a positive pre-operative COVID-19 test were found to be significantly younger (46 ± 20 years) when compared to all other patients with a negative test (51 ± 21 years; p=0.002). No patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, reported symptoms concerning for COVID infection, underwent additional testing, or reported close contact with another individual with a positive test or possessed symptoms concerning for COVID-19 at a minimum of two-weeks post-operatively. Conclusion This study found that 3.5% of patients tested positive for COVID-19 and were significantly younger when compared to patients testing negative. No patient investigated for potential infection post-operatively reported the development of any symptoms related to COVID-19 or reported a positive test post-operatively.

How can climate scientists best and effectively communicate their findings to crucial non-expert audiences, including public policy makers and civil society? To address this question, we look at the mismatch between what courts require and what climate scientists are setting as a bar of proof. Our first point is that scientists typically demand too much of themselves in terms of evidence, in comparison with the level of evidence required in a legal, regulatory, or public policy context. Our second point is to recommend that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommend more prominently the use of the category “more likely than not” as a level of proof in their reports, as this corresponds to the standard of proof most frequently required in civil court rooms.

Automated image acquisition has significantly reduced the time and effort required to determine the structures of macromolecular assemblies.

However, there is an urgent need for improved criteria for validating both the reconstruction process and the atomic models derived from cryo-EM data.

Based on our in vitro evidence of antiviral activity of interferon (IFN)-ß activity against Ebola virus, we conducted a single arm clinical study in Guinea to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of IFN β-1a treatment for EVD. Nine individuals infected with Ebola virus were treated with IFN β-1a and compared retrospectively with a matched cohort of 21 infected patients receiving standardized supportive care only during the same time period at the same treatment unit. Cognizant of the limitations of having treated only 9 individuals with EVD, the data collected are cautiously considered. When compared to supportive care only, IFN β-1a treatment seemed to facilitate viral clearance from the blood and appeared associated with earlier resolution of disease symptoms. Survival, calculated from the date of consent for those in the trial and date of admission from those in the control cohort, to the date of death, was 19% for those receiving supportive care only, compared to 67% for those receiving supportive care plus IFN β-1a. Given the differences in baseline blood viremia between the control cohort and the IFN-treated cohort, an additional 17 controls were included for a subset analysis, from other treatment units in Guinea, matched with the IFN-treated patients based on age and baseline blood viremia. Subset analyses using this expanded control cohort suggests that patients without IFN β-1a treatment were ~ 1.5–1.9 fold more likely to die than those treated. Viewed altogether the results suggest a rationale for further clinical evaluation of IFN β-1a.","Konde, Mandy Kader; Baker, Darren P.; Traore, Fode Amara; Sow, Mamadou Saliou; Camara, Alioune; Barry, Alpha Amadou; Mara, Doussou; Barry, Abdoulaye; Cone, Moussa 3; Kaba, Ibrahima; Richard, Amento Ablam; Beavogui, Abdoul Habib; Günther, Stephan; Pintilie, Melania; Fish, Eleanor N.",PLoS One,137,1

Patients who are HMPV positive presented with a wide spectrum of clinical features, including cough (100.0%, 101/101), abnormal pulmonary breath sound (91.1%, 92/101), fever (88.1%, 89/101), expectoration (77.2%, 78/101), coryza (50.5%, 51/101) and wheezing (46.5%, 47/101). The main diagnosis of patients who are HMPV positive was bronchopneumonia (66.7%, 56/84). Fever (≥38˚C) (91.6%, 76/83) was detected more often in patients with only HMPV detected than in patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected (72.2%, 13/18) (P=0.037), whereas diarrhoea was more common in patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected (22.2%, 4/18), compared with patients with HMPV only (3.6%, 3/83) (P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: HMPV is an important respiratory pathogen in children with ARI in Guangzhou, particularly in children ≤5 years old. HMPV has a seasonal variation. Bronchopneumonia is a major diagnosis in patients who are HMPV positive.","Zhang, Ling; Liu, Wenkuan; Liu, Donglan; Chen, Dehui; Tan, Weiping; Qiu, Shuyan; Xu, Duo; Li, Xiao; Liu, Tiantian; Zhou, Rong",BMJ Open,137,2

Much of the public’s behavioural and emotional response to the virus can be understood through the framework of terror management theory, which proposes that fear of death drives much of human behaviour. In the context of the current pandemic, death anxiety, a recently proposed transdiagnostic construct, appears especially relevant. Fear of death has recently been shown to predict not only anxiety related to COVID-19, but also to play a causal role in various mental health conditions. Given this, it is argued that treatment programmes in mental health may need to broaden their focus to directly target the dread of death. Notably, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to produce significant reductions in death anxiety. As such, it is possible that complementing current treatments with specific CBT techniques addressing fears of death may ensure enhanced long-term symptom reduction. Further research is essential in order to examine whether treating death anxiety will indeed improve long-term outcomes, and prevent the emergence of future disorders in vulnerable populations. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1).. To understand terror management theory and its theoretical explanation of death anxiety in the context of COVID-19. (2).. To understand the transdiagnostic role of death anxiety in mental health disorders. (3).. To understand current treatment approaches for directly targeting death anxiety, and the importance of doing so to improve long-term treatment outcomes.","Menzies, Rachel E.; Menzies, Ross G.",Cogn Behav Therap,137,18

To extract and summarize information on potential vaccines and therapeutic agents against COVID-19 at different stages of clinical trials from January to March 2020, we reviewed major clinical trial databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and other primary registries between January and March 15, 2020. Interventional studies at different phases under the COVID-19 pipeline were included. A total of 249 clinical trials were identified between January to March 15, 2020. After filtering observational studies (194 studies), a total of 56 interventional trials were considered. The majority of clinical trials have been conducted on chloroquine (n=10) and traditional Chinese medications (TCMs; n=10), followed by antivirals (n=8), anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressants (n=9), cellular therapies (n=4), combinations of different antivirals therapies (n=3), antibacterial (n=1), and other therapies (n=5).

We aimed to estimate rates of hypertension ATC in the older population and to assess differences in these rates across sociodemographic groups and states in India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a nationally representative survey of individuals aged 45 years and over and their spouses in all Indian states (except one) in 2017 to 2018. We identified hypertension by blood pressure (BP) measurement ≥140/90 mm Hg or self-reported diagnosis if also taking medication or observing salt/diet restriction to control BP. We distinguished those who (i) reported diagnosis (“aware”); (ii) reported taking medication or being under salt/diet restriction to control BP (“treated”); and (iii) had measured systolic BP <140 and diastolic BP <90 (“controlled”). We estimated age–sex adjusted hypertension prevalence and rates of ATC by consumption quintile, education, age, sex, urban–rural, caste, religion, marital status, living arrangement, employment status, health insurance, and state. We used concentration indices to measure socioeconomic inequalities and multivariable logistic regression to estimate fully adjusted differences in these outcomes. Study limitations included reliance on BP measurement on a single occasion, missing measurements of BP for some participants, and lack of data on nonadherence to medication. The 64,427 participants in the analysis sample had a median age of 57 years: 58% were female, and 70% were rural dwellers. We estimated hypertension prevalence to be 41.9% (95% CI 41.0 to 42.9). Among those with hypertension, we estimated that 54.4% (95% CI 53.1 to 55.7), 50.8% (95% CI 49.5 to 52.0), and 28.8% (95% CI 27.4 to 30.1) were aware, treated, and controlled, respectively. Across states, adjusted rates of ATC ranged from 27.5% (95% CI 22.2 to 32.8) to 75.9% (95% CI 70.8 to 81.1), from 23.8% (95% CI 17.6 to 30.1) to 74.9% (95% CI 69.8 to 79.9), and from 4.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 8.1) to 41.9% (95% CI 36.8 to 46.9), respectively. Age–sex adjusted rates were lower (p < 0.001) in poorer, less educated, and socially disadvantaged groups, as well as for males, rural residents, and the employed. Among individuals with hypertension, the richest fifth were 8.5 percentage points (pp) (95% CI 5.3 to 11.7; p < 0.001), 8.9 pp (95% CI 5.7 to 12.0; p < 0.001), and 7.1 pp (95% CI 4.2 to 10.1; p < 0.001) more likely to be aware, treated, and controlled, respectively, than the poorest fifth. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension prevalence was high, and ATC of the condition were low among older adults in India. Inequalities in these indicators pointed to opportunities to target hypertension management more effectively and equitably on socially disadvantaged groups.","Mohanty, Sanjay K.; Pedgaonkar, Sarang P.; Upadhyay, Ashish Kumar; Kämpfen, Fabrice; Shekhar, Prashant; Mishra, Radhe Shyam; Maurer, Jürgen; O’Donnell, Owen",PLoS Med,137,20

Design, Setting, and Participants This study took place at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel in February 2021. Maternal and cord blood sera were collected for antibody measurement from mother/newborn dyads following antenatal vaccination. Exposure SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Main outcome and measures Spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)- specific, IgG levels were evaluated in maternal and cord blood sera. Results The study cohort consisted of 20 parturients, with a median maternal age of 32 years and a median gestational age of 393/7 weeks at the time of delivery. The median time lapsed from the first and second doses of vaccine administration until delivery was 33 [IQR 30-37] and 11 [IQR 9-15] days, respectively. Of the 20 dyads, all women and infants were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG levels in maternal sera were positively correlated to their respective concentrations in cord blood (Rs= 0.72; P<0.001 and Rs = 0.72; P <0.001, respectively).

In the absence of specific vaccines and antiviral drugs, the China National Health Commission has released a series of COVID-19 treatment guidelines, which include symptomatic treatment, antiviral treatment, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Aim of the review To analyze and summarize the role of TCMs in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods Relevant studies on TCMs related to the study aim were undertaken through a literature search to synthesize the extracted data. Results The China National Health Commission guidelines recommend 15 oral and injectable TCMs for COVID-19. Studies on TCMs have demonstrated that these compounds possess broad-spectrum antiviral and antibacterial properties, and they have certain advantages in the treatment of viral pneumonia and other emergent infectious diseases. Many TCMs also have potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Treatment based on syndrome differentiation is one of the significant features in TCM. TCM compounds contain a variety of active ingredients that have proven multi-target effects, making it difficult for viruses to develop drug resistance. A variety of clinical pathways are involved in the actions of these TCMs. These properties allow TCMs to be used in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion TCMs have been widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 in China.

RECENT FINDINGS: In severe COVID-19, there is both direct viral toxicity and dysregulated host response to infection. Although both coinfection and/or secondary infection are present, the latest is of greater concern mainly in resource-poor settings. Patients with severe COVID-19 present a phenotype of multiorgan dysfunction that leads to death in an unacceptable high percentage of the patients, with wide variability around the world. Similarly to endemic sepsis, the mortality of COVID-19 critically ill patients is higher in low-income and middle-income countries as compared with high-income countries. Disparities, including hospital strain, resources limitations, higher incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAI), and staffing issues could in part explain this variability. SUMMARY: The high mortality rates of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 disease are not only related to the severity of patient disease but also to modifiable factors, such as the ICU strain, HAI incidence, and organizational aspects. Therefore, HAI prevention and the delivery of best evidence-based care for these patients to avoid additional damage is important.

The spread of COVID‐19 has escalated the level of fear among public and nurses. Nevertheless, the mechanism that contributes to minimize the fear towards this pandemic remains unexplored. A cross‐sectional survey was adopted to test the relationships among public health education, psychological capital, and fear of COVID‐19. In total, 243 responses were obtained via online survey from nurses. The results revealed that public health education can reduce one’s fear of COVID‐19. Psychological capital emerged as a strong explanatory mechanism for the phenomenon. Drawing on spillover theory, public health education seems to reduce fear of COVID‐19 with the mediating role of psychological capital. Limitations and future directions are at the end of this paper. The study outcomes revealed that organizations should focus on educating nursing staff to overcome fear of COVID‐19.

METHODS: This study of symptomatic COVID-19 cases associated with London workplaces used London Coronavirus Response Centre (LCRC) records from routine telephone calls with cases and employers, from 17th July to 10th September. For each case, symptoms, date of onset, date of testing and the last attendance at work were extracted. Univariable logistic regression was performed to investigate whether age, gender or occupation was associated with workplace attendance after the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 130 symptomatic COVID-19 cases, 42 (32.3%) attended the workplace after their reported date of symptom onset, including 16 (12.3%) with recorded COVID-19 symptoms. Five staff members attended after COVID-19 testing. Males were 66% less likely to attend the workplace after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms compared to females (odds ratio 0.34, P = 0.05).

Approximately 40% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, shed virus RNA in their stool (2); therefore, community-level trends in SARS-CoV-2 infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic (2) can be tracked through wastewater testing (3-6). CDC launched the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) in September 2020 to coordinate wastewater surveillance programs implemented by state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to support the COVID-19 pandemic response. In the United States, wastewater surveillance was not previously implemented at the national level. As of August 2021, NWSS includes 37 states, four cities, and two territories. This report summarizes NWSS activities and describes innovative applications of wastewater surveillance data by two states, which have included generating alerts to local jurisdictions, allocating mobile testing resources, evaluating irregularities in traditional surveillance, refining health messaging, and forecasting clinical resource needs. NWSS complements traditional surveillance and enables health departments to intervene earlier with focused support in communities experiencing increasing concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The ability to conduct wastewater surveillance is not affected by access to health care or the clinical testing capacity in the community. Robust, sustainable implementation of wastewater surveillance requires public health capacity for wastewater testing, analysis, and interpretation. Partnerships between wastewater utilities and public health departments are needed to leverage wastewater surveillance data for the COVID-19 response for rapid assessment of emerging threats and preparedness for future pandemics.","Kirby, Amy E.; Walters, Maroya Spalding; Jennings, Wiley C.; Fugitt, Rebecca; LaCross, Nathan; Mattioli, Mia; Marsh, Zachary A.; Roberts, Virginia A.; Mercante, Jeffrey W.; Yoder, Jonathan; Hill, Vincent R.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,137,1

We conducted a comprehensive study of failed eggs and dead nestlings in bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus) to attempt to elucidate the proximate causes of breeding failure behind the recent decline in productivity in the Spanish Pyrenees. We found high concentrations of multiple veterinary drugs, primarily fluoroquinolones, in most failed eggs and nestlings, associated with multiple internal organ damage and livestock pathogens causing disease, especially septicaemia by swine pathogens and infectious bursal disease. The combined impact of drugs and disease as stochastic factors may result in potentially devastating effects exacerbating an already high risk of extinction and should be considered in current conservation programs for bearded vultures and other scavenger species, especially in regards to dangerous veterinary drugs and highly pathogenic poultry viruses.","Blanco, Guillermo; Lemus, Jesús A.",PLoS One,137,3

METHODS: Adult patients admitted to University Medical Center during research period were recruited in a cross-sectional study, which employed a convenience sampling method with a 4-component questionnaire in order to examine the patients’ consciousness towards COVID-19 spreading prevention based on four aspects: demographic characteristics (10 items), knowledge (14 items), attitudes (6 items), and practices (7 items). RESULTS: The study involved 2769 respondents (18–90 years) with the mean age of 38.05±13.91 years. About two thirds of the respondents obtained diploma degree or higher (63.4%) and shared their living space with others (64.4%). The majority of patients settled in urban area (74.9%). All participants stayed informed about COVID-19, with the most commonly used channels like television (75.2%), the Internet (72.2%) and phone (69.8%). The vast majority showed sufficient knowledge (93.7%) and positive attitudes (76.3%). Just over half of participants remained good practiced of COVID-19 prevention (57.7%). On average, the factors of younger age, higher educational level, frequency and department of admission, and the number of COVID-19 informative channels were significantly associated with sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices regarding preventive action against COVID-19 spreading. The optimistic attitude and having more undergoing chronic diseases were associated with the likelihood of well-practiced COVID-19 preventive measures (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.54–8.55, p=0.003 and OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.98, p=0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that the likelihood of good preventive practices in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic was influenced by attitudes and several sociodemographic factors. More drastic interventions for the prevention of COVID-19 should be widely furnished and equipped in hospitals, through various routes to maximize the efficiency and adherence to prevention practices.","Nguyen, Hoang Bac; Nguyen, Thi Hong Minh; Tran, Thi Thanh Tam; Vo, Thi Hong Nhan; Tran, Van Hung; Do, Thi Nam Phuong; Truong, Quang Binh; Nguyen, Thi Hiep; Ly, Loan Khanh",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,137,32

In general, we find that both a low stock index level and a daily fall in the stock index are associated with greater incidences of stroke. We further partition the data on sex and age. The level effect is found to be significant for either gender, in the 45–64 and 65≥ age groups. In addition, two daily change effects are found to be significant for males and the elderly. Although stockholdings can increase wealth, they can also increase stroke incidence, thereby representing a cost to health.","Chen, Chun-Chih; Chen, Chin-Shyan; Liu, Tsai-Ching; Lin, Ying-Tzu",Soc Sci Med,137,1

We aimed to investigate the consequences of the first COVID-19 lockdown (mid-March - mid-April 2020) on motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in a cohort of French people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). METHODS: PwP were enrolled either by an on-line survey sent from the national France Parkinson association (FP) to reach the French community of PwP or as part of outpatients' telemedicine visits followed by an hospital-based Parkinson Expert Center (PEC). All patients were evaluated using the same standardized questionnaire assessing motor and NMS (including a list of most disabling, new or worsened symptoms and Patient's Global Impression-Improvement scales [PGI-I]) psycho-social queries and quality of life. RESULTS: 2653 PwP were included: 441 (16.6%) in the PEC group and 2122 (83.4%) in the community-based group. Physiotherapy was interrupted among 88.6% of the patients. 40.9% referred a clinical modification of their symptoms. Based on the questionnaire, pain (9.3%), rigidity (9.1%) and tremor (8.5%) were the three most frequently new or worsened reported symptoms. Based on the PGI-I, the motor symptoms were the most affected domain, followed by pain and psychic state. PwP in community-based group tended to have more frequent worsening for motor symptoms, motor complications, pain and confusion than those of the PEC group. CONCLUSIONS: The first COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on motor and NMS of PwP. Efforts should be allocated to avoid interruption of care, including physiotherapy and physical activities and implement telemedicine. .","Fabbri, Margherita; Leung, Clémence; Baille, Guillaume; Béreau, Matthieu; Brefel Courbon, Christine; Castelnovo, Giovanni; Carriere, Nicolas; Damier, Philippe; Defebvre, Luc; Doe de Maindreville, Anne; Fluchere, Frederique; Fuzzatti, Marie; Grabli, David; Maltete, David; Rousseau, Vanessa; Sommet A, Agnès; Thalamas, Claire; Thiriez, Claire; Rascol, Olivier; Ory-Magne, Fabienne",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,137,24

The fear of infection or new, unknown tasks in an unfamiliar setting, for example, may complicate outbreak management. AIM: To gain insight into how healthcare organizations can prepare to meet the needs of their HCWs by capturing the experiences of HCWs with patients with suspected Ebola virus disease. METHODS: We conducted 23 in-depth interviews with HCWs, of whom 20 worked in a Dutch university hospital and three worked in a regional ambulance service. We invited HCWs who cared for patients with suspected Ebola or who were on the team preparing for admission of such patients in the period 2014–2015. FINDINGS: The HCWs were stressed and anxious, but most rated their overall experience as positive. We categorized the reported experiences in three main themes, namely, experiences related to: (i) the novelty of the threat, (ii) the risk of infection and fear of transmission, and (iii) the excessive attention. Our results underline the importance of a supportive working environment suitable for crises. CONCLUSION: The experiences of HCWs dealing with patients with suspected Ebola can direct improvements in generic preparedness for highly transmissible diseases.","Belfroid, E.; van Steenbergen, J.; Timen, A.; Ellerbroek, P.; Huis, A.; Hulscher, M.",J Hosp Infect,137,20

Physicians administered a survey-based questionnaire at recruitment (T0). During follow-up, patients responded to online dedicated surveys modulated according to symptoms at T0. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients completed the follow-up survey. OD and/or GD were observed in 83% and 89% of subjects, respectively. Resolution rates of OD and GD at 30 days from onset were 87% and 82%, respectively. Risk factors for late resolution were grade of dysfunction at onset (total vs partial), gender, and presence of nasal congestion. Three (2%) patients previously reporting complete resolution of symptoms complained of subsequent recurrence of OD and/or GD after a mean of 19 days from resolution of the previous episode.

In this paper, we propose a fast, inexpensive and high-throughput approach using painless nasal-swab self-collection followed by direct RT-qPCR for the sensitive PCR detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This approach was validated in a large prospective cohort study of 1038 subjects, analysed simultaneously using (1) nasopharyngeal swabs obtained with the assistance of healthcare personnel and analysed by classic two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates and (2) nasal swabs obtained by self-collection and analysed with direct RT-qPCR. Of these subjects, 28.6% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swab sampling. Our direct RT-qPCR approach for self-collected nasal swabs performed well with results similar to those of the two-step RT-qPCR on RNA isolates, achieving 0.99 positive and 0.98 negative predictive values (cycle threshold [Ct] < 37). Our research also reports on grey-zone viraemia, including samples with near-cut-off Ct values (Ct ≥ 37). In all investigated subjects (n = 20) with grey-zone viraemia, the ultra-small viral load disappeared within hours or days with no symptoms. Overall, this study underscores the importance of painless nasal-swab self-collection and direct RT-qPCR for mass testing during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and in the post-pandemic era.","Kriegova, Eva; Fillerova, Regina; Raska, Milan; Manakova, Jirina; Dihel, Martin; Janca, Ondrej; Sauer, Pavel; Klimkova, Martina; Strakova, Petra; Kvapil, Petr",Virol J,137,11

This study assessed the role of negative affectivity, right-wing authoritarianism, and anxiety of COVID-19 infection in explaining a variety of the maladjusted behaviors (i.e., “China-phobic” discrimination, panic buying) observed with an Italian sample. Specifically, we examined the effect of Negative Affectivity and Right-Wing Authoritarianism on maladjusted behaviors, and the moderating role of anxiety of infection. Seven hundred and fifty-seven Italian participants completed an online survey between March 3rd to the 7th 2020, which was immediately before the lockdown. A moderated-mediation model was tested using a structural equation modeling approach. Results indicated that both Negative Affectivity and Right-Wing Authoritarianism were positively associated with COVID-19-related maladjusted behavior, and that Right-Wing Authoritarianism mediated the relationship between Negative Affectivity and maladjusted behavior. Furthermore, the effect of Right-Wing Authoritarianism on maladjusted behavior was greater for those with high anxiety of infection, and the indirect effect of Negative Affectivity on maladjusted behavior through Right-Wing Authoritarianism was moderated by infection anxiety. Findings highlight potential psychological paths that may inform communication strategies and public health initiatives aimed at promoting healthy behavior during an outbreak.","Bochicchio, Vincenzo; Winsler, Adam; Pagliaro, Stefano; Pacilli, Maria Giuseppina; Dolce, Pasquale; Scandurra, Cristiano",Front Psychol,137,1

We report incidence of dysphagia, cognitive impairments, and/or dysphonia in patients at acute inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), and summarize facility changes implemented to meet patient needs while maintaining requirements of an IRF. Design This is a retrospective study; data obtained through retroactive chart reviews of electronic medical records. Setting Data gathered at Rusk Rehabilitation NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital (LOH) in New York City. In March 2020, NYU LOH converted 75 orthopedic surgical beds to acute COVID-19 medicine beds. Simultaneously, rehabilitation unit shifted to managing rehabilitation needs of patients with COVID-19 related debility post-ICU/acute care. Participants Subjects include 61 patients, ages 18+, who received SLP services during inpatient rehabilitation with primary diagnosis of COVID-19-acute respiratory failure, ARDS, or COVID-19 related debility. Admissions occurred April 1st-June 30th 2020. Reported demographics include age, gender, and discharge destination. Patients excluded if primary diagnosis was neurological with incidental positive COVID-19. Interventions Patients received daily SLP intervention per IRF requirements. Intensity of daily services (30 vs 60 minute sessions) determined by therapy team based on individual patient needs/tolerance. Main Outcome Measures Dysphagia outcomes are reported using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) for admitting and discharge diets. Data for other disorders presented as incidence findings. Results Data presents strong evidence for presence of dysphagia, cognitive impairments and dysphonia following COVID-19. 31.2% demonstrated dysphagia, 57.3% of patients demonstrated cognitive impairments, and 52.4% of patients demonstrated dysphonia. Practice reflections include: importance of PPE, reducing infection spread, establishing safe objective swallowing assessments, and inclusion of virtual modalities. Conclusions There is a high occurrence of dysphagia, cognitive impairments, and dysphonia in patients with severe cases of COVID-19.

Rates of severe illness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 are greater for males, but the mechanisms for this difference are unclear. Understanding the differences in outcomes between males and females across the age spectrum will guide both public health and biomedical interventions. Methods. Retrospective cohort analysis of SARS-CoV-2 testing and admission data in a health system. Patient-level data were assessed with descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling was used to identify features associated with increased male risk of severe outcomes. Results. In 213,175 SARS-CoV-2 tests, despite similar positivity rates (8.2%F vs 8.9%M), males were more frequently hospitalized (28%F vs 33%M). Of 2,626 hospitalized individuals, females had less severe presenting respiratory parameters and males had more fever. Comorbidity burden was similar, but with differences in specific conditions. Medications relevant for SARS-CoV-2 were used at similar frequency except tocilizumab (M>F). Males had higher inflammatory lab values. In a logistic regression model, male sex was associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes at 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 3.01, 95%CI 1.75, 5.18) and at peak status (OR 2.58, 95%CI 1.78,3.74) among 18-49 year-olds. Block-wise addition of potential explanatory variables demonstrated that only the inflammatory labs substantially modified the OR associated with male sex across all ages. Conclusion. Higher levels of clinical inflammatory labs are the only features that are associated with the heightened risk of severe outcomes and death for males in COVID-19.","Scully, E.

Currently, mainly anti-spike (S)-protein adaptive immunity is investigated. However, also the nucleocapsid (N)- and membrane (M)-proteins should be considered as diagnostic and prophylactic targets. The aim of our study was to explore and compare the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-, M- and N-proteins in context of different COVID-19 manifestations. Analyzing a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease severity, we show that overlapping peptide pools (OPP) of all three proteins can activate SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells with a stronger response of CD4+ compared to CD8+ T-cells. Although interindividual variations for the three proteins were observed, M protein induced the highest frequencies of CD4+ T-cells, suggesting its relevance as diagnostic and vaccination target. Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated the strongest T-cell response, including the highest frequencies of cytokine-producing bi- and trifunctional T-cells, for all three proteins. Although the higher magnitude and superior functionality of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in critical patients can also be a result of a stronger immunogenicity provided by severe infection, it disproves the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. To this end, activation of effector T-cells with differentiated memory phenotype found in our study could cause hyper-reactive response in critical cases leading to immunopathogenesis. Conclusively, since the S-, M-, and N-proteins induce T-cell responses with individual differences, all three proteins should be evaluated for diagnostics and therapeutic strategies to avoid underestimation of cellular immunity and to deepen our understanding of COVID-19 immunity.","Thieme, C.

Therefore, understanding the process of this change at the molecular level facilitates the design of therapeutic agents. With the help of coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations, we provide evidence showing that the conformational dynamics of the S protein are globally cooperative. Importantly, an allosteric path was discovered that correlates the motion of the RBD with the motion of the junction between the subdomain 1 (SD1) and the subdomain 2 (SD2) of the S protein. Building on this finding, we designed non-RBD binding modulators to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by prohibiting the conformational change of the S protein. Their inhibition effect and function stages at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated experimentally. In summary, our studies establish a molecular basis for future therapeutic agent design through allosteric effects.","Wang, Qian; Wang, Lin; Zhang, Yumin; Zhang, XiangLei; Zhang, Leike; Shang, Weijuan; Bai, Fang",J Med Chem,137,1

In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with raised troponin (32.3% vs 6.1%, p<0.001). New onset atrial fibrillation or flutter (6.4% vs 1.0%, p=0.001) and troponin elevation above the ULN (50.3% vs 16.4%, p<0.001) were more common in patients 65 years and older. There was no significant difference in the rate of cardiac complications between males and females. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation in Australia, troponin elevation was common but clinical cardiac sequelae were uncommon. The incidence of atrial arrhythmias and troponin elevation was greatest in patients 65 years and older.","Bhatia, Kunwardeep S.; Sritharan, Hari P.; Chia, Justin; Ciofani, Jonathan; Nour, Daniel; Chui, Karina; Vasanthakumar, Sheran; Jayadeva, Pavithra; Kandadai, Dhanvee; Allahwala, Usaid; Bhagwandeen, Rohan; Brieger, David B.; Choong, Christopher Y.P.; Delaney, Anthony; Dwivedi, Girish; Harris, Benjamin; Hillis, Graham; Hudson, Bernard; Javorsky, George; Jepson, Nigel; Kanagaratnam, Logan; Kotsiou, George; Lee, Astin; Lo, Sidney T.H.; MacIsaac, Andrew I.; McQuillan, Brendan M.; Ranasinghe, Isuru; Walton, Antony; Weaver, James; Wilson, William; Yong, Andy; Zhu, John; van Gaal, William; Kritharides, Leonard; Chow, Clara; Bhindi, Ravinay",Heart Lung Circ,137,20

Prevention and control strategies require an improved understanding of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. We did a rapid review of the literature on SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics with a focus on infective dose. We sought comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We examined laboratory animal and human studies. The literature on infective dose, transmission and routes of exposure was limited specially in humans, and varying endpoints were used for measurement of infection. Despite variability in animal studies, there was some evidence that increased dose at exposure correlated with higher viral load clinically, and severe symptoms. Higher viral load measures did not reflect coronavirus disease 2019 severity. Aerosol transmission seemed to raise the risk of more severe respiratory complications in animals. An accurate quantitative estimate of the infective dose of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is not currently feasible and needs further research. Our review suggests that it is small, perhaps about 100 particles. Further work is also required on the relationship between routes of transmission, infective dose, co-infection and outcomes.","Karimzadeh, Sedighe; Bhopal, Raj; Nguyen Tien, Huy",Epidemiol Infect,137,1

Indeed, public awareness and attitudes can help in disaster risk reduction and management efforts toward reducing mortality and economic losses. In Saudi Arabia, many cities have been recently experiencing incidences of disasters, such as floods, disease epidemics, and sandstorms. However, studies on public perception of disaster risk in the country are few and nascent. Therefore, based on a questionnaire survey (n = 683), this paper explores public perception and attitudes to disaster risks in Dammam, a coastal metropolis in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that although almost two-thirds (64.7%) of the participants are aware of disasters, and 81% are concerned about disaster risks, less than half (47.3%) believe that their settlements could be at risk. While 37% opine that disasters are caused by both natural factors and human activities, about half (54%) indicate that they can personally contribute to reducing disaster risks. Chi-square analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between place of residence and perception of disaster risks (χ2 (6) = 56.18, p < 0.05), and between place of residence and concern about disaster risks (χ2 (12) = 68.47, p < 0.05). The paper recommends raising public awareness and encouraging positive behaviors in reducing disaster risks in the study area and similar environments.","AlQahtany, Ali M.; Abubakar, Ismaila Rimi",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,137,18

Globally, as of 5: 46 pm CET, 6 November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had reported 48 534 508 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1 231 017 deaths. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is the most important medical challenge in decades. Previous research mainly focused on the exploration of lung changes. However, with development of the disease and deepening research, more and more patients showed cardiovascular diseases, even in those without respiratory symptoms, and some researchers have found that underlying cardiovascular diseases increase the risk of infection. Although the related mechanism is not thoroughly studied, based on existing research, we speculate that the interaction between the virus and its receptor, inflammatory factors, various forms of the stress response, hypoxic environment, and drug administration could all induce the development of cardiac adverse events. Interventions to control these pathogenic factors may effectively reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular complications. This review summarizes the latest research on the relationship between COVID-19 and its associated cardiovascular complications, and we also explore possible mechanisms and treatments.","Cao, Qingtai; Lei, HanYu; Yang, MengLing; Wei, Le; Dong, YinMiao; Xu, JiaHao; Nasser, Mi; Liu, MengQi; Zhu, Ping; Xu, LinYong; Zhao, MingYi",Med Sci Monit,137,7

New insights include a detailed knowledge about disease-initiating exogenous factors, endogenous (genetic, somatic, epigenetic) elicitors or facilitators of disease evolution, and drug actions and interactions that underlie efficacy and adverse event profiles in defined cohorts of patients. As a result, precision medicine and personalized medicine are rapidly growing new disciplines that support the clinician in making the correct diagnosis, in predicting outcomes, and in optimally selecting patients for interventional therapies. In addition, precision medicine tools are greatly facilitating the development of new drugs, therapeutic approaches, and new multiparametric prognostic scoring models. However, although the emerging roles of precision medicine and personalized medicine in hematology and oncology are clearly visible, several questions remain. For example, it remains unknown how precision medicine tools can be implemented in healthcare systems and whether all possible approaches are also affordable. In addition, there is a need to define terminologies and to relate these to specific and context-related tools and strategies in basic and applied science. To discuss these issues, a working conference was organized in September 2019. The outcomes of this conference are summarized herein and include a proposal for definitions, terminologies, and applications of precision and personalized medicine concepts and tools in hematologic neoplasms. We also provide proposals aimed at reducing costs, thereby making these applications affordable in daily practice.","Valent, Peter; Orfao, Alberto; Kubicek, Stefan; Staber, Philipp; Haferlach, Torsten; Deininger, Michael; Kollmann, Karoline; Lion, Thomas; Virgolini, Irene; Winter, Georg; Hantschel, Oliver; Kenner, Lukas; Zuber, Johannes; Grebien, Florian; Moriggl, Richard; Hoermann, Gregor; Hermine, Olivier; Andreeff, Michael; Bock, Christoph; Mughal, Tariq; Constantinescu, Stefan N.; Kralovics, Robert; Sexl, Veronika; Skoda, Radek; Superti-Furga, Giulio; Jäger, Ulrich",Hemasphere,137,29

The coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic temporarily halted Memory Clinics, where this is organised, and rate of dementia diagnosis has fallen. Despite increasing use of alternatives to face-to-face (F2F) consultations in other departments, it is unclear whether this is feasible within the traditional Memory Clinic model. AIMS: The main aim of this service improvement project performed during the pandemic was to explore feasibility of telephone (TC) and videoconference (VC) Memory Clinic consultations. METHODS: Consecutive patients on the Memory Clinic waiting list were telephoned and offered an initial appointment by VC or TC. Data extracted included: age, internet-enabled device ownership, reason for and choice of Memory Clinic assessment. We noted Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Blind (TC) and Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-III (VC via Attend Anywhere) scores, and feasibility of consultation. RESULTS: Out of 100 patients, 12 had a home assessment, moved away, been hospitalised, or died. 45, 21 and 6 preferred F2F, VC and TC assessments respectively. 16 were not contactable and offered a F2F appointment. The main reason for preferring F2F was non-ownership, or inability to use an internet-enabled device (80%). VC and TC preference reasons were unwillingness to come to hospital (59%), and convenience (41%). Attendance rate was 100% for VC and TC, but 77% for F2F. Feasibility (successful consultations) was seen in 90% (VC) and 67% (TC) patients. CONCLUSION: For able and willing patients, remote Memory Consultations can be both feasible and beneficial. This has implications for future planning in dementia services.","Collins, Jemima T; Mohamed, Biju; Bayer, Antony",Age Ageing,137,29

Reported here is a baseline study of a suite of host-specific FIB microbial source tracking (MST) markers in the coastal shoreline and reef waters around the island of Saipan. Three sampling campaigns were conducted in September 2017, March 2018, and August 2018. Samples were collected from the nearshore surface waters of Saipan, the reef waters of Saipan Lagoon, and groundwater from beaches along the Saipan Lagoon shoreline. Measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into nearshore waters and isotopic source tracking of nitrogen inputs were conducted concurrently with MST. Environmental DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for MST gene markers of fecal Bacteroidales specifically associated with humans, dogs, cows, and pigs, and for an MST gene marker of Catellicoccus associated with seabirds. MST assessments were combined with local knowledge, assessments of sanitary infrastructure, and routine watershed surveys. This study identified hotspots of human FIB along the western Saipan Lagoon shoreline in both surface waters and groundwater, plus another hotspot of human FIB at a popular tourist bathing area known as the Grotto. FIB hotspots on the Lagoon shoreline coincided with areas of high SGD and nitrogen isotopic data indicating sewage-derived N inputs. It appears that faulty sanitary infrastructure may be contributing to inputs to Saipan Lagoon, while bather shedding is likely a primary input for the Grotto area. Moderate levels of dog fecal contamination were common and widespread across the island. High levels of seabird fecal contamination were more random, both spatially and temporally, and mostly concentrated along the less developed northeast region of Saipan. No significant levels of cow or pig fecal marker were detected in coastal water samples. This study provides demonstration and establishment of analytical capacity to resource management in CNMI for MST technology to aid in trouble-shooting water quality issues involving land-based sources of microbial contaminants to CNMI coastal waters.","Sinigalliano, Christopher; Kim, Kiho; Gidley, Maribeth; Yuknavage, Kathy; Knee, Karen; Palacios, Dean; Bautista, Charito; Bonacolta, Anthony; Lee, Hyo Won; Maurin, Larry",Front Microbiol,137,9

The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. Methods An online questionnaire type of survey was conducted on a convenien ce sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1 to 3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed the mental health related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 mental distress scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principle component analysis, k-means cluster analysis and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with statistical significance set at P<0.05. Result s: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; age 24.78 ± 6.33 years [mean ± standard deviation]). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments and Hubei residence. Types of orthodontic appliance were associated with anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concern of prolonged treatment duration. Frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. Conclusion s: Over one third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, interval from the last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","Xiong, Xin; Wu, Yange; Fang, Xinyi; Sun, Wei; Ding, Qin; Yi, Yating; Huang, Yanmei; Gong, Jinglei; Liu, Jin; Wang, Jun",Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,137,16

A sudden increase in enteric viruses in some water matrices also underpins the prevalence of corresponding waterborne diseases in communities over the same time period. However, few efforts have been focused on water matrices whose viral pollution may best reflect the clinical prevalence in communities. Here, a one-year surveillance of human enteric viruses including Enteroviruses (EnVs), Rotaviruses (HRVs), Astroviruses (AstVs), Noroviruses GII (HuNoVsGII) and Mastadenoviruses (HAdVs) in four representative water matrices: an urban river (UR) running through city, effluent from Wastewater Treatment Plant (EW), raw water for Urban Water Treatment Plant (RW), and tap water (TW) were performed by qPCR. The relationship between the virus detection frequency at each site and their prevalence in clinical PCR assay was further analyzed. We found that the detection frequencies of HRVs, HuNoVsGII, and AstVs in stools peaked in winter, while EnVs peaked in autumn. No EnVs occurred in EW, RW, or TW, but HuNoVsGII and AstVs occurred intensively in winter. For UR, all types of enteric viruses could be detected and the levels of acute gastroenteritis viruses (HRVs, HuNoVsGII, AstVs, and HAdVs) were highest in autumn or winter, whereas EnVs peaked in summer. In terms of correlation analyses, only HRVs and HuNoVsGII levels in UR showed a strong positive correlation with their prevalence in clinical stool samples. This study indicated that HRVs and HuNoVsGII levels in URs may mirror the local virus prevalence, thereby implying the possibility of revealing their local epidemiology by monitoring them in the URs.","Shi, Danyang; Ma, Hui; Miao, Jing; Liu, Weili; Yang, Dong; Qiu, Zhigang; Shen, Zhiqiang; Yin, Jing; Yang, Zhongwei; Wang, Huaran; Li, Haibei; Chen, Zhengshan; Li, Junwen; Jin, Min",Sci Total Environ,137,24

During teleconsultation, diabetes education including insulin injection technique was given by a diabetes educator via a phone call (audio and video) during hospitalization. They were also re-assessed after 2 weeks of discharge from the hospital via teleconsultation or in-person. RESULTS: Out of 100 patients, 72.0% had prior history of diabetes while 28.0% were newly diagnosed. The median age of our cohort was 56 years and median duration of diabetes was 7.0 years. Telemedicine as a mode of consult for diabetes education was accepted by 96.0% of patients during hospitalisation.

Design, Setting, and Participants This case series of children with COVID-19 was conducted in 20 hospitals and 2 nonhospital isolation facilities across the country from February 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Children younger than 19 years who had COVID-19 were included. Exposures Confirmed COVID-19, detected via SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or sputum by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical manifestations during the observation period, including the time and duration of symptom occurrence. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was also analyzed. Results A total of 91 children with COVID-19 were included (median [range] age, 11 [0-18] years; 53 boys [58%]). Twenty children (22%) were asymptomatic during the entire observation period. Among 71 symptomatic cases, 47 children (66%) had unrecognized symptoms before diagnosis, 18 (25%) developed symptoms after diagnosis, and only 6 (9%) were diagnosed at the time of symptom onset. Twenty-two children (24%) had lower respiratory tract infections. The mean (SD) duration of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory samples was 17.6 (6.7) days. Virus RNA was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.1 (7.7) days in asymptomatic individuals. There was no difference in the duration of virus RNA detection between children with upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 18.7 [5.8] days vs 19.9 [5.6] days; P = .54). Fourteen children (15%) were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and/or hydroxychloroquine. All recovered, without any fatal cases. Conclusions and Relevance In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID-19 transmission in the community.

Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global population – and potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on.

No specific antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of COVID-19 till date. Drug repurposing strategy helps to find out the drugs for COVID-19 treatment from existing FDA approved antiviral drugs. In this study, FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were repurposed against the major viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The 3D structures of FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs were retrieved from PubChem. Virtual screening was performed to find out the lead antiviral drug molecules against main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) using COVID-19 Docking Server. Furthermore, lead molecules were individually docked against protein targets using AutoDock 4.0.1 software and their drug-likeness and ADMET properties were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 65 FDA approved small molecule antiviral drugs screened, Raltegravir showed highest interaction energy value of -9 kcal/mol against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and Indinavir, Tipranavir, and Pibrentasvir exhibited a binding energy value of ≥ -8 kcal/mol. Similarly Indinavir showed the highest binding energy of -11.5 kcal/mol against the target protein RdRp and Dolutegravir, Elbasvir, Tipranavir, Taltegravir, Grazoprevir, Daclatasvir, Glecaprevir, Ledipasvir, Pibrentasvir and Velpatasvir showed a binding energy value in range from -8 to -11.2 kcal/mol. The antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine also exhibited good bioavailability and drug-likeness properties. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the screened small molecule antiviral drugs Raltegravir, Indinavir, Tipranavir, Dolutegravir, and Etravirine could serve as potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with further validation studies.","Indu, Purushothaman; Rameshkumar, Marimuthu Ragavan; Arunagirinathan, Narasingam; Al-Dhabi, Naif Abdullah; Arasu, Mariadhas Valan; Ignacimuthu, Savarimuthu",J Infect Public Health,137,1

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important homeostatic component of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 both degrades the vasoconstrictor, angiotensin II and generates the potent vasodilator peptide, angiotensin 1–7. These actions counterbalance those of ACE. 2.. ACE2 is highly expressed in the healthy kidney, particularly in the proximal tubules, where it colocalizes with ACE and angiotensin receptors. 3.. Kidney disease and subtotal nephrectomy is associated with a reduction in renal ACE2 expression, possibly facilitating the damaging effects of angiotensin II in the failing kidney. Acquired or genetic ACE2 deficiency also appears to exacerbate renal damage and albuminuria in experimental models, supporting this hypothesis. 4.. ACE2 also has an important role in blood pressure control. Many models of hypertension are associated with reduced ACE2 expression. Although ACE2 KO animals are normotensive, in states associated with activation of the RAS, ACE2 overexpression improves blood pressure control and reduces angiotensin responsiveness.","Koitka, A; Cooper, ME; Thomas, MC; Tikellis, C",Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,137,17

Current reports indicate that the increased use of social distancing for preventive COID-19 distribution may have a negative effect on patients who suffering from acute medical conditions. Aim. We examined the effect of social distancing on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients' referral to the emergency department (ED) Method. A retrospective archive study was conducted between January 2017 and April 2020 in a comprehensive stroke center. We compare the number of neurologic consultations, time from symptoms onset to ED arrival, patients diagnosis with AIS, number of patients receiving treatment (tPA, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or combine) and in-hospital death. Results. The analysis included a total of 14,626 neurological consultations from the years 2017 to 2020. A significant decrease of 58.6% was noted during the months of January-April of the year 2020 compared to the parallel period of 2017. Percent of final AIS diagnosis for the year of 2020 represent 24.8% of suspected cases, with the highest diagnosis rate demarcated for the year of 2019 with 25.6% of confirmed patients. The most remarkable increase was noted in EVT performance through the examined years (2017, n=21; 2018, n=32; 2019, n=42; 2020, n=47). Conclusion. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in routing constraints on health care system resources that were dedicated for treating COVID-19 patients. The healthcare system must develop and offer complementary solutions that will enable access to health services even during these difficult times.","Saban, M.; Reznik, A.; Shachar, T.; Sivan-Hoffmann, R.",,137,10

Whether baseline NLR could be an independent predictor of in-hospital death in Chinese COVID-19 patients remains to be investigated. Methods A cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to February 29 was retrospectively analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR, were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the independent relationship between the baseline NLR and in-hospital all-cause death. A sensitivity analysis was performed by converting NLR from a continuous variable to a categorical variable according to tertile. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. Results 245 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analyses, and the in-hospital mortality was 13.47%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that there was 8% higher risk of in-hospital mortality for each unit increase in NLR (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.14; P = 0.0147). Compared with patients in the lowest tertile, the NLR of patients in the highest tertile had a 15.04-fold higher risk of death (OR = 16.04; 95% CI, 1.14 to 224.95; P = 0.0395) after adjustment for potential confounders. Notably, the fully adjusted OR for mortality was 1.10 in males for each unit increase of NLR (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.19; P = 0.016). Conclusions NLR is an independent risk factor of the in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients especially for male. Assessment of NLR may help identify high risk individuals with COVID-19.","Liu, Yuwei; Du, Xuebei; Chen, Jing; Jin, Yalei; Peng, Li; Wang, Harry H.X.; Luo, Mingqi; Chen, Ling; Zhao, Yan",J Infect,137,1

Low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that can interfere with the inflammatory cascade, reducing the severity of associated cytokine release. Material & Methods 25 patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 disease were enrolled between November 2020 and May 2021. All patients had SpO2 < 94% on room air, respiratory frequency > 24/min and SpO2/FiO2 ratio (SF ratio) of >89 but < 357. Patients were treated according to standard COVID-19 management guidelines along with single fraction LDRT of 0.5Gy to bilateral whole lungs within 10 days of symptom onset and 5 days of hospital admission. Results LDRT was well tolerated by all patients. There was a statistically significant improvement in oxygenation as given by the SF ratio between pre-RT and day 2 (p<0.05), day 3 (p<0.001) and day 7 (p<0.001) post RT. Demand for supplemental oxygen showed statistically significant reduction between pre-RT and day 2 (p<0.05), day 3 (p<0.001), day 7 (p<0.001) post RT. 88% patients attained clinical recovery within 10 days post LDRT and median time to hospital discharge from day of LDRT was 6 days. Three patients deteriorated and died. Conclusion As per our initial experience, LDRT appears to be a promising modality of treatment with rapid relief of respiratory distress in selected patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This translates to early clinical recovery and hospital discharge in the selected patient group.","Govindaraj, G.; Sasipriya, P.; Sundaram, Vivek; Praveen Kumar, M.; Venkatraman, P.; Manigandan, C.; Janakiraman, T.; Gunasekaran, K.; Prabhu, R.; Brindha, T.; Shree Vaishnavi, R.",Radiother Oncol,137,1

Similar to other high-income countries, Australia has extensively used telehealth services. Virtual health care, including telemedicine in combination with remote patient monitoring, has been implemented in certain settings as part of new models of care that are aimed at managing patients with COVID-19 outside the hospital setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the implementation of and early experience with virtual health care for community management of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted with patients with COVID-19 who availed of a large Australian metropolitan health service with an established virtual health care program capable of monitoring patients remotely. We included patients with COVID-19 who received the health service, could self-isolate safely, did not require immediate admission to an in-patient setting, had no major active comorbid illness, and could be managed at home or at other suitable sites. Skin temperature, pulse rate, and blood oxygen saturation were remotely monitored. The primary outcome measures were care escalation rates, including emergency department presentation, and hospital admission. RESULTS: During March 11-29, 2020, a total of 162 of 173 (93.6%) patients with COVID-19 (median age 38 years, range 11-79 years), who were diagnosed locally, were enrolled in the virtual health care program. For 62 of 162 (38.3%) patients discharged during this period, the median length of stay was 8 (range 1-17) days. The peak of 100 prevalent patients equated to approximately 25 patients per registered nurse per shift. Patients were contacted a median of 16 (range 1-30) times during this period. Video consultations (n=1902, 66.3%) comprised most of the patient contacts, and 132 (81.5%) patients were monitored remotely. Care escalation rates were low, with an ambulance attendance rate of 3% (n=5), emergency department attendance rate of 2.5% (n=4), and hospital admission rate of 1.9% (n=3). No deaths were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based virtual health care is safe for managing most patients with COVID-19 and can be rapidly implemented in an urban Australian setting for pandemic management. Health services implementing virtual health care should anticipate challenges associated with rapid technology deployments and provide adequate support to resolve them, including strategies to support the use of health information technologies among consumers.","Hutchings, Owen Rhys; Dearing, Cassandra; Jagers, Dianna; Shaw, Miranda Jane; Raffan, Freya; Jones, Aaron; Taggart, Richard; Sinclair, Tim; Anderson, Teresa; Ritchie, Angus Graham",J Med Internet Res,137,27

Early plasma volume replacement is required to achieve haemodynamic stability (HDS) and maintain adequate tissue oxygenation. The right choice of fluids to be used for plasma volume replacement (colloid or crystalloid solutions) is still a matter of debate, and large trials investigating the use of colloid solutions containing gelatine are missing. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of plasma volume replacement using either a combined gelatine-crystalloid regime (1:1 ratio) or a pure crystalloid regime. METHODS: This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blind, international, multicentric phase IV study with two parallel groups that is planned to be conducted at European intensive care units (ICUs) in a population of patients with hypovolaemia in severe sepsis/septic shock. A total of 608 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either a gelatine-crystalloid regime (Gelaspan® 4% and Sterofundin® ISO, B. Braun Melsungen AG, in a 1:1 ratio) or a pure crystalloid regime (Sterofundin® ISO) for plasma volume replacement. The primary outcome is defined as the time needed to achieve HDS. Plasma volume replacement will be target-controlled, i.e. fluids will only be administered to volume-responsive patients. Volume responsiveness will be assessed through passive leg raising or fluid challenges. The safety and efficacy of both regimens will be assessed daily for 28 days or until ICU discharge (whichever occurs first) as the secondary outcomes of this study. Follow-up visits/calls will be scheduled on day 28 and day 90. DISCUSSION: This study aims to generate evidence regarding which regimen—a gelatine-crystalloid regimen or a pure crystalloid regimen—is more effective in achieving HDS in critically ill patients with hypovolaemia. Study participants in both groups will benefit from the increased safety of target-controlled plasma volume replacement, which prevents fluid administration to already haemodynamically stable patients and reduces the risk of harmful fluid overload.

A balance must be sought. We analysed our confirmatory testing pathway to produce a more refined approach in preparation for rising case numbers. METHODS: Over a 10-week low prevalence period we performed confirmatory testing on all newly positive results. Turnaround time was measured and results were analysed to identify a threshold that could be applied as a cut-off for future confirmatory testing and reduce overall workload for the laboratory. RESULTS: Between 22/06/20 and 31/08/20 confirmatory testing was performed on 108 newly positive samples, identifying 32 false positive results (30 %). Turnaround time doubled, increasing by an extra 17 h. There was a highly statistically significant difference between initial Relative Light Unit (RLU) of results that confirmed compared to those that did not, 1176 vs 721 (P < 0.00001). RLU = 1000 was identified as a suitable threshold for confirmatory testing in our laboratory: with RLU ≥ 1000, 55/56 (98 %) confirmed as positive, whereas with RLU < 1000 only 12/38 (32 %) confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: False positive SARS-CoV-2 tests can be identified by confirmatory testing, yet this may significantly delay results. Establishing a threshold for confirmatory testing streamlines this process to focus only on samples where it is most required. We advise all laboratories to follow a similar process to identify thresholds that trigger confirmatory testing for their own assays, increasing accuracy while maintaining efficiency for when case numbers are high.","Wilson, Michael J.; Sparkes, Dominic; Myers, Chloe; Smielewska, Anna A.; Husain, Mir Mubariz; Smith, Christopher; Rolfe, Kathryn J.; Zhang, Hongyi; Jalal, Hamid",J Clin Virol,137,18

Older healthcare workers and those who exercise more reported higher job satisfaction. Married healthcare workers, those who exercise more, and those not infected reported higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: This paper identifies belief in a COVID-19 conspiracy theory as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction of healthcare workers.

The concentration of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the hemagglutinin receptor of influenza viruses is a current determinant in protection against infection, particularly following receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, this is a limited assessment of protection, because: (i) NAb titers that incur full protection vary; and (ii) NAb titers do not account for the entire breadth of antibody responses against viral infection. Previous reports have indicated that antibodies that prime ADCC play a vital role in controlling influenza infections, and thus should be quantified for assessing protection against influenza. This report demonstrates a non-radioactive assay that assesses NK cell activation as a marker of ADCC, in which NK cells interact with opsonized viral antigen expressed on the surface of infected Raji target cells resulting in effector cell degranulation (surrogate CD107a expression). A positive correlation was determined between HAI titers and sustained NK cell activation, although NK cell activation was seen in plasma samples with HAI titers below 40 and varied amongst samples with high HAI titers. Furthermore, sustained NK cell degranulation was determined for influenza-vaccinated transchromosomic bovine intravenous immunoglobulin, indicating the potential utility of this therapy for influenza treatment. We conclude that this assay is reproducible and relevant.","Morrison, Brian J.; Roman, Jessica A.; Luke, Thomas C.; Nagabhushana, Nishith; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Williams, Maya; Sun, Peifang",J Virol Methods,137,5

Moreover, the second wave of pandemic will have come to end at first decade of January 2021 in Germany and Iran (but at the end of January 2021 in India as well), so we should restrict ourselves in modelling the first and second waves of pandemic within this time period for these countries. Thus, the model of first approximation is considered here which allows to understand the mean-time trends of COVID-19 evolution for the first + second waves of pandemic for USA, Brazil and Russia, or predict the approximated time period of the upcoming third wave of pandemic in cases of India, Germany and Iran.","Ershkov, Sergey V.; Rachinskaya, Alla",Nonlinear Dyn,137,20

Indian Armed Forces launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on 16 Jan 2021. This study evaluated the effect of vaccination on mortality amongst hospitalized COVID patients. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done on all admitted moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at a designated COVID hospital in New Delhi. The primary outcome assessed the association of being fully vaccinated with mortality. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) (with 95% CI) was performed for each predictor. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis and adjusted odds ratios obtained. RESULTS: The 1168 patients included in the study had a male preponderance with a mean age of 54.6 (± 17.51) years. A total of 266 (23%) patients were partially vaccinated with COVISHIELD® and 184 (16%) were fully vaccinated. Overall, 518 (44.3%) patients had comorbidities and 332 (28.4%) died. Among those fully vaccinated, there was 12.5% (23/184) mortality while it was 31.45 % (309/984) among the unvaccinated (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5, p<0.0001). In a logistic regression model, complete vaccination status and younger age were found to be associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with two doses of COVISHIELD® was associated with lower odds of mortality among hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID.","Muthukrishnan, J.; Vardhan, Vasu; Mangalesh, Sridhar; Koley, Mrinalini; Shankar, Subramanian; Yadav, Arun Kumar; Khera, Anurag",Med J Armed Forces India,137,16

COVID-19 patients often suffer from lung fibrosis, a serious and untreatable condition. There remains no effective treatment for these complications. Out of all cytokines, TNFα and IL-6 play crucial roles in cytokine storm pathogenesis and are likely responsible for the escalation in disease severity. These cytokines also partake in the molecular pathogenesis of fibrosis. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed, that can efficiently and swiftly downregulate TNFα, IL-6, and the inflammatory cytokine cascade, in order to curb inflammation and prevent fibrosis, and lead to disease remission. Cannabis sativa has been proposed to modulate gene expression and inflammation and is under investigation for several potential therapeutic applications against autoinflammatory diseases and cancer. Here, we hypothesized that the extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars may be used to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathways involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Initially, to analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of novel C. sativa cultivars, we used a well-established full thickness human 3D skin artificial EpiDermFTTM tissue model, whereby tissues were exposed to UV to induce inflammation and then treated with extracts of seven new cannabis cultivars. We noted that out of seven studied extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars, three (#4, #8 and #14) were the most effective, causing profound and concerted down-regulation of COX2, TNFα, IL-6, CCL2, and other cytokines and pathways related to inflammation and fibrosis. These data were further confirmed in the WI-38 lung fibroblast cell line model. Most importantly, one of the tested extracts had no effect at all, and one exerted effect that may be deleterious, signifying that careful cannabis cultivar selection must be based on thorough pre-clinical studies. The observed pronounced inhibition of TNFα and IL-6 is the most important finding, because these molecules are currently considered to be the main targets in COVID-19 cytokine storm and ARDS pathogenesis. Novel anti-TNFα and anti-IL-6 cannabis extracts can be useful additions to the current anti-inflammatory regimens to treat COVID-19, as well as various rheumatological diseases and conditions, and ‘inflammaging’ - the inflammatory underpinning of aging and frailty.","Kovalchuk, Anna; Wang, Bo; Li, Dongping; Rodriguez-Juarez, Rocio; Ilnytskyy, Slava; Kovalchuk, Igor; Kovalchuk, Olga",Aging (Albany NY),137,10

The increasing sequencing data have shown abundant single nucleotide variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome. However, it is difficult to quickly analyze genomic variation and screen key mutations of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we developed a visual program, named BioAider, for quick and convenient sequence annotation and mutation analysis on multiple genome-sequencing data. Using BioAider, we conducted a comprehensive genome variation analysis on 3,240 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Herein, we detected 14 substitution hotspots within SARS-CoV-2 genome, including 10 non-synonymous and 4 synonymous ones. Among these hotspots, NSP13-Y541C was predicted to be a crucial substitution which might affect the unwinding activity of NSP13, a key protein for viral replication. Besides, we also found 3 groups of potentially linked substitution hotspots which were worth further study. In particular, we discovered a SR-rich region (aa 184-204) on the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 distinct from SARS-CoV, indicating more complex replication mechanism and unique N-M interaction of SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the quantity of SRXX repeat fragments in the SR-rich region well reflected the evolutionary relationship among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related animal coronaviruses, providing further evidence of its animal origin. Overall, we developed an efficient tool for rapid identification of mutations, identified substitution hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and detected a distinctive polymorphism SR-rich region in N protein. This tool and the detected hotspots could facilitate the viral genomic study and may contribute for screening antiviral target sites.","Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xing-Yi",bioRxiv,137,13

To date, most studies have focused on the mental health consequences of the lockdown measures, while studies assessing how this disease control measure influences the occurrence of fatigue are largely absent. Aim: The aims of this study are two-fold: (a) to examine the levels of lockdown fatigue, and (2) to determine the role of coping behaviours, personal resilience, psychological well-being and perceived health in fatigue associated to the lockdown measure. Methods: This is an online cross-sectional study involving 243 college students in the Central Philippines during the sixth month of the lockdown measure implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Five standardised scales were used to collect the data. Results: Overall, college students reported moderate levels of lockdown fatigue, with a mean score of 31.54 (out of 50). Physical exhaustion or tiredness, headaches and body pain, decreased motivation and increased worry were the most pronounced manifestations of fatigue reported. Gender and college year were identified as important predictors of fatigue. Increased personal resilience and coping skills were associated with lower levels of lockdown fatigue. Conclusion: College students experience moderate levels of fatigue during the mandatory lockdown or home confinement period. Resilient students and those who perceive higher social support experience lower levels of fatigue during the lockdown period compared to students with low resilience and social support. Lockdown fatigue may be addressed by formulating and implementing interventions to enhance personal resilience and social support among college students.","Labrague, L.; Ballad, C. A.",,137,14

This research is an effort to identify the major predictors that have a significant impact on the number of COVID‐19 cases per million population for 83 countries. The findings highlight that a population with a greater share of old people (aged above 65) shows a higher number of COVID‐19 positive cases and a population with a lower median age has fewer cases. This can be explained in terms of higher co‐morbidities and the lower general immunity in the older age group. The analysis restates the widely seen results that a higher median age and greater prevalence of co‐morbidities leads to higher cases per million and lesser population density and interpersonal contact helps in containing the spread of the virus. The study finds foundation in the assertion that a higher temperature might lower the number of cases, or that temperature in general can affect the infectivity. The study suggests that better access to sanitation is a certain measure to contain the spread of the virus. The outcome of this study will be helpful in ascertaining the impact of these indicators in this pandemic, and help in policy formation and decision‐making strategies to fight against it.","Singh, Pawan Kumar; Kiran, Ravi; Bhatt, Rajiv Kumar; Tabash, Mosab I.; Pandey, Alok Kumar; Chouhan, Anushka",J Public Aff,137,33

Mechanistically, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein interacted with the tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), thereby dually regulating the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3, STAT1 and STAT2. Additionally, low-dose N protein combined with TRIM25 could suppress retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) ubiquitination and activation.

Protein deimination causes generation of neo-epitopes, affects gene regulation and also allows for protein moonlighting. Furthermore, PADs have been found to be a phylogenetically conserved regulator for extracellular vesicle (EVs) release. EVs are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material. In this study, post-translationally deiminated proteins in serum and serum-EVs are described for the first time in camelids, using the llama (Lama glama L. 1758) as a model animal. We report a poly-dispersed population of llama serum EVs, positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers and characterised by TEM. In serum, 103 deiminated proteins were overall identified, including key immune and metabolic mediators including complement components, immunoglobulin-based nanobodies, adiponectin and heat shock proteins. In serum, 60 deiminated proteins were identified that were not in EVs, and 25 deiminated proteins were found to be unique to EVs, with 43 shared deiminated protein hits between both serum and EVs. Deiminated histone H3, a marker of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, was also detected in llama serum. PAD homologues were identified in llama serum by Western blotting, via cross reaction with human PAD antibodies, and detected at an expected 70 kDa size. This is the first report of deiminated proteins in serum and EVs of a camelid species, highlighting a hitherto unrecognized post-translational modification in key immune and metabolic proteins in camelids, which may be translatable to and inform a range of human metabolic and inflammatory pathologies.","Criscitiello, Michael F.; Kraev, Igor; Lange, Sigrun",Mol Immunol,137,16

By focusing our analysis on patients with mild to moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, IL-18, and CCL5, along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes. In contrast, female patients mounted significantly more robust T cell activation than male patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was sustained in old age. Importantly, we found that a poor T cell response negatively correlated with patients’ age and was predictive of worse disease outcome in male patients, but not in female patients. Conversely, higher innate immune cytokines in female patients associated with worse disease progression, but not in male patients. These findings reveal a possible explanation underlying observed sex biases in COVID-19, and provide important basis for the development of sex-based approach to the treatment and care of men and women with COVID-19.","Takahashi, Takehiro; Wong, Patrick; Ellingson, Mallory K.; Lucas, Carolina; Klein, Jon; Israelow, Benjamin; Silva, Julio; Oh, Ji Eun; Mao, Tianyang; Tokuyama, Maria; Lu, Peiwen; Venkataraman, Arvind; Park, Annsea; Liu, Feimei; Meir, Amit; Sun, Jonathan; Wang, Eric Y.; Wyllie, Anne L.; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Earnest, Rebecca; Lapidus, Sarah; Ott, Isabel M.; Moore, Adam J.; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Cruz, Charles Dela; Fournier, John B.; Odio, Camila D.; Farhadian, Shelli; Grubaugh, Nathan D.; Schulz, Wade L.; Ko, Albert I.; Ring, Aaron M.; Omer, Saad B.; Iwasaki, Akiko",medRxiv,137,1

Human β-defensins (hBDs) are among these AMPs, but the evidence is not well detailed. Therefore, this case-control study analyzed levels of hBD1, hBD2, hBD3 and hBD4 in serum of 103 patients with severe COVID-19 and 105 healthy controls. Most patients were older than 45 years (80.6%), and more than 50% suffered from chronic diseases (cardiovascular and diabetes). Results revealed that median levels of hBD1 and hBD3 did not show significant differences between patients and controls. On the contrary, HBD2 levels were significantly decreased in patients compared to controls (1036 vs. 1289 ng/L; p < 0.001), while HBD4 levels were significantly increased (4.04 vs. 2.43 ng/L; p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated the predictive significance of hBD2 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.795; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.729–0.861; p < 0.001) and hBD4 (AUC = 0.816; 95% CI = 0.756–0.876; p < 0.001) in discriminating between COVID-19 patients and controls. Logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, gender and body mass index) confirmed the significance of hBD2 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.996; corrected p = 0.004) and hBD4 (OR = 4.948; corrected p < 0.001) in susceptibility to COVID-19. In conclusion, the study indicated that hBD2 showed low levels in serum of patients infected with severe COVID-19, while hBD4 showed elevated levels. These differences in HBDs were not influenced by age, gender, body mass index, or chronic disease.","Al-Bayatee, Noor T.; Ad'hiah, Ali H.",Microb Pathog,137,16

OBJECTIVE: To determine if ARI symptoms are associated with more prolonged RTP, and if days to RTP and symptoms (number, type, duration and severity) differ in athletes with COVID-19 versus athletes with other ARI. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: Online survey. PARTICIPANTS: Athletes with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (ARI(COV)) (n=45) and athletes with other ARI (ARI(OTH)) (n=39). METHODS: Participants recorded days to RTP and completed an online survey detailing ARI symptoms (number, type, severity and duration) in three categories: ‘nose and throat’, ‘chest and neck’ and ‘whole body’. We report the association between symptoms and RTP (% chance over 40 days) and compare the days to RTP and symptoms (number, type, duration and severity) in ARI(COV) versus ARI(OTH) subgroups. RESULTS: The symptom cluster associated with more prolonged RTP (lower chance over 40 days; %) (univariate analysis) was ‘excessive fatigue’ (75%; p<0.0001), ‘chills’ (65%; p=0.004), ‘fever’ (64%; p=0.004), ‘headache’ (56%; p=0.006), ‘altered/loss sense of smell’ (51%; p=0.009), ‘Chest pain/pressure’ (48%; p=0.033), ‘difficulty in breathing’ (48%; p=0.022) and ‘loss of appetite’ (47%; p=0.022). ‘Excessive fatigue’ remained associated with prolonged RTP (p=0.0002) in a multiple model. Compared with ARI(OTH), the ARI(COV) subgroup had more severe disease (greater number, more severe symptoms) and more days to RTP (p=0.0043). CONCLUSION: Symptom clusters may be used by sport and exercise physicians to assist decision making for RTP in athletes with ARI (including COVID-19).","Schwellnus, Martin; Sewry, Nicola; Snyders, Carolette; Kaulback, Kelly; Wood, Paola Silvia; Seocharan, Ishen; Derman, Wayne; Hull, James H; Valtonen, Maarit; Jordaan, Esme",Br J Sports Med,137,24

STUDY DESIGN: PeV-A reverse transcriptase-PCR was incorporated in routine evaluation of infants ≤60 days hospitalized at Nationwide Children’s Hospital for fever and/or suspected sepsis-like syndrome beginning in July 2013. We reviewed electronic medical records of infants who tested positive for PeV-A from July 2013 to September 2016. Genotyping was performed with specific type 3 RT-PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Of 1475 infants evaluated, 130 (9%) tested positive for PeV-A in one or more sites: 100 (77%) in blood, 84 (65%) in a non-sterile site, and 53 (41%) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Five (4%) infants had CSF only positive, 31 (24%) blood only, and 20 (15%) non-sterile site only positive. PeV-A3 was the most common type (85%) and the only type detected in CSF. Although the majority (79%) of infections were diagnosed between July and December, PeV-A was detected year-round. Median age was 29 days. Fever (96%), fussiness (75%) and lymphopenia (56%) were common. Among infants with PeV-A positive CSF, 77% had no CSF pleocytosis. Median duration of hospitalization was 41 hours. Four infants had bacterial coinfections diagnosed within 24 hours of admission; 40 infants had viral coinfections. CONCLUSIONS: While most frequent in summer and fall, PeV-A infections were encountered in every calendar month within the 3-year period of study. More than one-half of patients had PeV-A detected at more than one body site. Coinfections were common. PeV-A3 was the most common type identified, and the only type detected in the CSF.","Souverbielle, Cristina Tomatis; Wang, Huanyu; Feister, John; Campbell, Jason; Medoro, Alexandra; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio; Pietropaolo, Domenico; Salamon, Douglas; Leber, Amy; Erdem, Guliz",J Pediatr,137,1

However, experimental methods to find protein interactions are inadequate: large scale experiments are noisy, and small scale experiments are slow and expensive. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, we hypothesize that deep learning methods are well-positioned to aid and augment biological experiments, hoping to help identify more accurate virus-host protein interaction maps. Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins. We propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in predicting Virus–Human protein interactions for SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and Ebola. In addition, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict and interpret the interactions of mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences.

Despite recent advances in a range of omics analyses, multi-omic measurements of the same sample are still challenging and current methods have not been well evaluated in terms of reproducibility and broad applicability. Here we adapted a solvent-based method, widely applied for extracting lipids and metabolites, to add proteomics to mass spectrometry-based multi-omics measurements. The metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction (MPLEx) protocol proved to be robust and applicable to a diverse set of sample types, including cell cultures, microbial communities, and tissues. To illustrate the utility of this protocol, an integrative multi-omics analysis was performed using a lung epithelial cell line infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which showed the impact of this virus on the host glycolytic pathway and also suggested a role for lipids during infection. The MPLEx method is a simple, fast, and robust protocol that can be applied for integrative multi-omic measurements from diverse sample types (e.g., environmental, in vitro, and clinical). IMPORTANCE In systems biology studies, the integration of multiple omics measurements (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) has been shown to provide a more complete and informative view of biological pathways. Thus, the prospect of extracting different types of molecules (e.g., DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and metabolites) and performing multiple omics measurements on single samples is very attractive, but such studies are challenging due to the fact that the extraction conditions differ according to the molecule type. Here, we adapted an organic solvent-based extraction method that demonstrated broad applicability and robustness, which enabled comprehensive proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics analyses from the same sample.

We implement a discrete choice experiment survey in three major U.S. States—California, Georgia, and Illinois—to empirically quantify individuals’ willingness to stay (WTS) home, measured as the number of weeks of a potential new SAH order, to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease and explore factors leading to their heterogeneous WTS. Our results demonstrate broad support for statewide mask mandates. In addition, the estimate of WTS to lower new positive cases is quite large, approximately five and half weeks, even though staying home lowers utility. We also find that individuals recognize the trade-offs between case reduction and economic slowdown stemming from SAH orders when they decide to stay home or not. Finally, pandemic related factors such as age, ability to work from home, and unemployment status are the main drivers of the heterogeneity in individuals’ WTS.","Li, Liqing; Long, Dede; Rouhi Rad, Mani; Sloggy, Matthew R.",PLoS One,137,24

Apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites, a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases. However, enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry, so their role in enteritis is still unclear. The present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses, namely astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in Poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds. Two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between 2008 and 2011. Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of astrovirus, non-structural 1 gene of parvovirus, non-structural protein 4 gene of rotavirus, and 5′ untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus. Different statistical methods (i.e. the independence chi-square test, the correspondence analysis and the logistic regression model) were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data. RESULTS: Overall, 137 (66.2%, 95% CI: 59.3-72.6) of the 207 turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses. Among the 137 flocks, 74 (54%, 95% CI: 45.3-62.6) were positive for one virus, whereas 54 (39.4%, 9 5% CI: 31.2-48.1) and 9 (6.6%, 95% CI: 3.1-12.1) were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses, respectively. No flock was simultaneously infected with all four viruses studied. The prevalence of astrovirus infection was 44.9% (95% CI: 38.0-52.0), parvovirus 27.5% (95% CI: 21.6-34.2), rotavirus 18.8% (95% CI: 13.8-24.8), and coronavirus 9.7% (95% CI: 6.0-14.5). Young turkeys aged 1-4 weeks old had the highest (82.1%, 95% CI:71.7-89.8) prevalence of viral infection. Applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys. Furthermore, our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus infections in Polish turkey farms. These viruses were detected in both healthy and diseased birds. However, the presented results provide valuable feedback which could help to evaluate the role of some enteric viruses in the etiology of enteritis in turkey.","Domańska-Blicharz, K.; Bocian, Ł.; Lisowska, A.; Jacukowicz, A.; Pikuła, A.; Minta, Z.",BMC Vet Res,137,28

An increasing number of evidence indicate a relatively high prevalence of superinfections associated with COVID-19, including invasive aspergillosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be characterized. In the present study, to better understand the biological impact of superinfection we sought to determine and compare the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 versus Aspergillus superinfection, using a model of reconstituted humain airway epithelium. Our analyses reveal that both simple infection and superinfection induce a strong deregulation of core components of innate immune and inflammatory responses, with a stronger response to superinfection in the bronchial epithelial model compared to its nasal counterpart. Our results also highlight unique transcriptional footprints of SARS-CoV-2 Aspergillus superinfection, such as an imbalanced type I/type III IFN, and an induction of several monocyte- and neutrophil associated chemokines, that could be useful for the understanding of Aspergillus-associated COVID-19 and but also management of severe forms of aspergillosis in this specific context.","de Lamballerie, Claire Nicolas; Pizzorno, Andrés; Fouret, Julien; Szpiro, Lea; Padey, Blandine; Dubois, Julia; Julien, Thomas; Traversier, Aurélien; Dulière, Victoria; Brun, Pauline; Lina, Bruno; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Terrier, Olivier",bioRxiv,137,1

Methods: This retrospective study examined 61 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, as defined by the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19. All patients were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Union Hospital from Dec 28, 2019 to Feb 22, 2020 and classified into a GGO group or a non-GGO group based on CT results. The clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the two groups were compared. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis, and using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Forty-five patients were in the GGO group (73.8%, 21 females, 24 males, mean age 54.8±17.8 years) and 16 were in the non-GGO group (26.2%, 11 females, 5 males, mean age 53±14.9 years). The levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ were greater in the GGO group (all P<0.05). ROC analysis indicated that an elevated level of IL-2 was a good predictor of GGO (area under the curve: 0.716, optimal cutoff: 3.205 pg/mL, 53.8% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that IL-2 level was a significant and independent risk factor for lung GGO (OR: 8.167; 95% CI: 1.63, 40.8; P<0.05). Conclusions: There were correlations between GGO in the lungs of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and the levels of IL-2, IL-4, and INF-γ.

These findings provide a basis for studying the mechanism of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients.","Wu, Zubo; Liu, Xiaoping; Liu, Jie; Zhu, Feng; Liu, Yali; Liu, Yalan; Peng, Hua",Int J Med Sci,137,21

Thousands of emergency operations were carried out in the interim. However no one focused on the clinical symptom of emergency surgery patients (ESP) with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 164 ESP with or without COVID-19 pneumonia in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 20, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 5, 2020. The associated clinical, laboratory, epidemiological, demographic, radiological and outcome data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 164 ESP, the median age was 41 years old (interquartile range (IQR), 29-89) and 136 (82.9%) were women. Associated main clinical symptom including fever (93 [56.7%]), dry cough (56 [34.2%]), fatigue (86 [52.4%]), nausea (78 [47.6%]) and dizziness (77 [47%]). Of 54 ESP-infected COVID-19 patients, the median age was 46 (IQR: 25-89) and 45 (83.3%) were women. The pathological clinical symptoms including fever (54 [100%]), fatigue (48 [88.9%]), nausea (52 [96.3%]), dizziness (46 [85.2%]) and dry cough (44 [81.5%]) were investigated; the lymphopenia (0.37×10(9)/L [IQR: 0.23-0.65]) and increased C-reactive protein (24.7×10(9)/L [IQR: 13.57-38]) were observed. The preoperative fever and postoperative fever in ESP with or without COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this study. Of 54 ESP with COVID-19 patients, 15 (27.8%) patients showed preoperative fever, 54 (100%) had the postoperative fever; Of 110 non-COVID-19 of ESP, 5 (4.5%) patients had preoperative fever, 31 (28.2%) patients had the postoperative fever. The fever in ESP with COVID-19 lasted more than 7 days, markedly exceeded the non-COVID-19 patients (lasted about 3 days). Furthermore, 43 health care workers were infected from exposed to ESP with COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: In our study, the clinical symptoms of ESP-infected COVID-19 displayed marked differences from those reported common COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Additionally, the health care workers were confirmed to expose great risk in ESP with COVID-19 pneumonia. Management guidelines of ESP were described in our paper.","Li, Jinpeng; Gao, Rongfen; Wu, Gaosong; Wu, Xiaolin; Liu, Zeming; Wang, Hongjing; Huang, Yihui; Pan, Zhenyu; Chen, Jincao; Wu, Xiaohui",Surgery,137,24

We have identified 6MP and 6TG as reversible and slow-binding inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, which is the first report about small molecule reversible inhibitors of PLpro. The inhibition mechanism was investigated by kinetic measurements and computer docking. Both compounds are competitive, selective, and reversible inhibitors of the PLpro with K(is) values ∼10 to 20 μM. A structure–function relationship study has identified the thiocarbonyl moiety of 6MP or 6TG as the active pharmacophore essential for these inhibitions, which has not been reported before. The inhibition is selective because these compounds do not exert significant inhibitory effects against other cysteine proteases, including SARS-CoV 3CLpro and several cathepsins. Thus, our results present the first potential chemical leads against SARS-CoV PLpro, which might be used as lead compounds for further optimization to enhance their potency against SARS-CoV. Both 6MP and 6TG are still used extensively in clinics, especially for children with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia. In light of the possible inhibition against subset of cysteine proteases, our study has emphasized the importance to study in depth these drug actions in vivo.","Chou, Chi-Yuan; Chien, Chia-Hui; Han, Yu-San; Prebanda, Mojca Trstenjak; Hsieh, Hsing-Pang; Turk, Boris; Chang, Gu-Gang; Chen, Xin",Biochem Pharmacol,137,30

However, to date, the self-association of RNA molecules is still an open problem. Recent chemical probing reports provide, with high reliability, the secondary structure of diverse RNA ensembles, such as those of viral genomes. Here, we present a method for reconstructing the complete 3D structure of RNA genomes, which combines a coarse-grained model with a subdomain composition scheme to obtain the entire genome inside proteinaceus capsids based on secondary structures from experimental techniques. Despite the amount of sampling involved in the folded and also unfolded RNA molecules, advanced microscope techniques can provide points of anchoring, which enhance our model to include interactions between capsid pentamers and RNA subdomains. To test our method, we tackle the satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) genome, which has been widely studied by both experimental and computational communities. We provide not only a methodology to structurally analyze the tertiary conformations of the RNA genome inside capsids, but a flexible platform that allows the easy implementation of features/descriptors coming from both theoretical and experimental approaches.","Poblete, Simón; Guzman, Horacio V.",Viruses,137,17

Neonatal or pediatric patients receiving ECMO, and patients undergoing extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) represent low-flow applications of the technology, requiring lower blood flow than conventional ECMO. Centrifugal blood pumps as a core element of modern ECMO therapy present favorable operating characteristics in the high blood flow range (4 L/min–8 L/min). However, during low-flow applications in the range of 0.5 L/min–2 L/min, adverse events such as increased hemolysis, platelet activation and bleeding complications are reported frequently. METHODS: In this study, the hemolysis of the centrifugal pump DP3 is evaluated both in vitro and in silico, comparing the low-flow operation at 1 L/min to the high-flow operation at 4 L/min. RESULTS: Increased hemolysis occurs at low-flow, both in vitro and in silico. The in-vitro experiments present a sixfold higher relative increased hemolysis at low-flow. Compared to high-flow operation, a more than 3.5-fold increase in blood recirculation within the pump head can be observed in the low-flow range in silico. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the underappreciated hemolysis in centrifugal pumps within the low-flow range, i.e. during pediatric ECMO or ECCO(2)R treatment. The in-vitro results of hemolysis and the in-silico computational fluid dynamic simulations of flow paths within the pumps raise awareness about blood damage that occurs when using centrifugal pumps at low-flow operating points. These findings underline the urgent need for a specific pump optimized for low-flow treatment. Due to the inherent problems of available centrifugal pumps in the low-flow range, clinicians should use the current centrifugal pumps with caution, alternatively other pumping principles such as positive displacement pumps may be discussed in the future.

Individuals with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 display higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs compared to those without comorbidities, and conditions such as cell stress, elevated glucose levels and hypoxia may also increase the expression of ACE2. Here, we showed that patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and higher viral load upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed in two independent cohorts of 1,357 COVID-19 patients that previous use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with 2- to 3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drugs.

In this study, the biosynthetic pathway and possible biological activities of this protein were examined. The glycosylation of gp65 in virus-infected cells was inhibited by tunicamycin but not by monensin, suggesting that it contains an N-glycosidic linkage. Glycosylation is cotranslational and appears to be complete before the glycoprotein reaches the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase experiments showed that this protein decreased in size after 30 min of chase, suggesting that the carbohydrate chains of gp65 undergo trimming during its transport across the Golgi. This interpretation is supported by the endoglycosidase treatment of gp65, which showed that the peptide backbone of gp65 did not decrease in size after pulse-chase periods. This maturation pathway is distinct from that of the E1 or E2 glycoproteins. Partial endoglycosidase treatment indicated that gp65 contains 9 to 10 carbohydrate side chains; thus, almost all of the potential glycosylation sites of gp65 were glycosylated. In vitro translation studies coupled with protease digestion suggest that gp65 is an integral membrane protein. The presence of gp65 in the virion is correlated with the presence of an acetylesterase activity. No hemagglutinin activity was detected.","Yokomori, Kyoko; La Monica, Nicola; Makino, Shinji; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,137,7

RESULTS: On average, there was no significant group‐level change in anxiety, depression or quality of life. When assessing change in symptoms based on clinical cut‐off points on self‐report measures, results suggest only 17%‐22% showed a relapse of symptoms by the COVID‐19 pandemic.

The virus genome analysis during disease spread reveals about its evolution and transmission. We did whole genome sequencing of 225 clinical strains from the state of Odisha in eastern India using ARTIC protocol-based amplicon sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis identified the presence of all five reported clades 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B and 20C in the population. The analyses revealed two major routes for the introduction of the disease in India i.e. Europe and South-east Asia followed by local transmission. Interestingly, 19B clade was found to be much more prevalent in our sequenced genomes (17%) as compared to other genomes reported so far from India. The haplogroup analysis for clades showed evolution of 19A and 19B in parallel whereas the 20B and 20C appeared to evolve from 20A. Majority of the 19A and 19B clades were present in cases that migrated from Gujarat state in India suggesting it to be one of the major initial points of disease transmission in India during month of March and April. We found that with the time 20A and 20B clades evolved drastically that originated from central Europe. At the same time, it has been observed that 20A and 20B clades depicted selection of four common mutations i.e. 241 C>T (5’UTR), P323L in RdRP, F942F in NSP3 and D614G in the spike protein. We found an increase in the concordance of G614 mutation evolution with the viral load in clinical samples as evident from decreased Ct value of spike and Orf1ab gene in qPCR. Molecular modelling and docking analysis identified that D614G mutation enhanced interaction of spike with TMPRSS2 protease, which could impact the shedding of S1 domain and infectivity of the virus in host cells.","Raghav, Sunil; Ghosh, Arup; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Kumar, Sugandh; Jha, Atimukta; Madhulika, Swati; Priyadarshini, Manasi; Biswas, Viplov K.; Shyamli, P.

These include supplies to operating rooms. The aim of this review is to evaluate the available evidence to determine the relative priority for the provision of facemasks in operating rooms to prevent surgical site infection. METHODS: A systematic search of OVID Medline, Embase & Cochrane Central was completed. Candidate full-text articles were identified and analysed by two reviewers who also assessed risk of bias. FINDINGS: Six studies were identified that described infections with and without facemask usage. The pooled effect of not wearing facemasks was a risk ratio for infection of 0.77 (0.62–0.97) in favour of not wearing masks. Only one case-controlled study evaluated facemask usage in implant surgery and demonstrated an odds ratio for developing infection of 3.34 (95% CI 1.94–5.74) if facemasks were not worn by the operating surgeon. Four studies collected microbiological cultures during periods in surgery with or without facemasks. Two demonstrated an increase in colony forming units in surgery where the wound was directly below the surgeon. One study showed equivocal results when masks were worn, and one was terminated early limiting interpretation. CONCLUSION: The use of facemasks by scrubbed staff during implant surgery should be mandatory to prevent infection. We recommend the use of facemasks by all scrubbed staff during other forms of surgery to protect the patient and staff, but the supporting evidence is weak. There is insufficient evidence to show that non-scrubbed staff must wear masks during surgery.","Marson, Ben A.; Craxford, Simon; Valdes, Ana M.; Ollivere, Benjamin J.",Surgeon,137,33

How the epithelium coordinates these tasks remains a question of significant interest. We used imaging and an optical flow analysis pipeline to study the dynamicity of untransformed murine and human intestinal epithelia, cultured atop flexible hydrogel supports. Infection with the pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) within minutes elicited focal contractions with inward movements of up to ∼1,000 IECs. Genetics approaches and chimeric epithelial monolayers revealed contractions to be triggered by the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome, which sensed type-III secretion system and flagellar ligands upon bacterial invasion, converting the local tissue into a contraction epicenter. Execution of the response required swift sublytic Gasdermin D pore formation, ion fluxes, and the propagation of a myosin contraction pulse across the tissue. Importantly, focal contractions preceded, and could be uncoupled from, the death and expulsion of infected IECs. In both two-dimensional monolayers and three-dimensional enteroids, multiple infection-elicited contractions coalesced to produce shrinkage of the epithelium as a whole. Monolayers deficient for Caspase-1(-11) or Gasdermin D failed to elicit focal contractions but were still capable of infected IEC death and expulsion. Strikingly, these monolayers lost their integrity to a markedly higher extent than wild-type counterparts. We propose that prompt NAIP/NLRC4/Caspase-1/Gasdermin D/myosin–dependent contractions allow the epithelium to densify its cell packing in infected regions, thereby preventing tissue disintegration due to the subsequent IEC death and expulsion process.","Samperio Ventayol, Pilar; Geiser, Petra; Di Martino, Maria Letizia; Florbrant, Alexandra; Fattinger, Stefan A.; Walder, Naemi; Sima, Eduardo; Shao, Feng; Gekara, Nelson O.; Sundbom, Magnus; Hardt, Wolf-Dietrich; Webb, Dominic-Luc; Hellström, Per M.; Eriksson, Jens; Sellin, Mikael E.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,137,26

Up to 20%–30% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Xuebijing injection is a compound injection containing five traditional Chinese medicine ingredients, which can protect cells from SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death and improve cardiac function. However, the specific protective mechanism of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. METHODS: The therapeutic effect of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19 was validated by the TCM Anti COVID-19 (TCMATCOV) platform. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from GSE150392 was used to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Data from GSE151879 was used to verify the expression of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and central hub genes in both human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and adult human CMs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 97 proteins were identified as the therapeutic targets of Xuebijing injection for COVID-19. There were 22 DEGs in SARS-CoV-2 infected hiPSC-CMs overlapped with the 97 therapeutic targets, which might be the therapeutic targets of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction. Based on the bioinformatics analysis, 7 genes (CCL2, CXCL8, FOS, IFNB1, IL-1A, IL-1B, SERPINE1) were identified as central hub genes and enriched in pathways including cytokines, inflammation, cell senescence and oxidative stress. ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and the 7 central hub genes were differentially expressed in at least two kinds of SARS-CoV-2 infected CMs. Besides, FOS and quercetin exhibited the tightest binding by molecular docking analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated the underlying protective effect of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19, especially on COVID19-induced cardiac dysfunction, which provided the theoretical basis for exploring the potential protective mechanism of Xuebijing injection on COVID19-induced cardiac dysfunction.","He, Ding-Dong; Zhang, Xiao-Kang; Zhu, Xin-Yu; Huang, Fang-Fang; Wang, Zi; Tu, Jian-Cheng",Comput Biol Med,137,16

This cross-sectional study investigated mental distress among healthcare workers during the early phase of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in India. Method: 140 healthcare workers of a tertiary care hospital in India were assessed for perceived stress and insomnia. A factor analysis with principal component method reduced these questions to four components which were categorized as insomnia, stress-related anxiety, stress-related irritability, and stress-related hopelessness. Further statistical analyses were done on these factor scores to identify the predictors and investigate the differences between the different categories of healthcare workers. Result: Doctors had the highest level of anxiety among the healthcare workers. Both doctors and nurses perceived a greater level of irritability than the other HCWs. Compared to doctors and nurses, other HCWs were more likely to experience insomnia. Lower age, higher education, female gender, and urban habitat were associated with greater perception of anxiety. Older age, being quarantined, and single marital status were the significant predictors of irritability. Female gender, single marital-status, and higher number of medical ailments contributed to perceived hopelessness. Quarantine significantly predicted insomnia. Conclusion: Different categories of healthcare workers are experiencing varied mental health problems owing to their heterogeneous socio-demographic backgrounds. Tailored and personalized care, as well as policies, might help in alleviating their problems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiographies (CTPAs) from 43 consecutive patients with a confirmed COVID-19 infection were retrospectively reviewed, taking into consideration the revised Geneva score and the D-dimer value for each patient. Filling defects within the pulmonary arteries were recorded along with pleural and parenchymal findings such as ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy paving, linear consolidation, and pleural effusion. All these variables were compared between patients with and without PAFD. The predictive performance of statistically different parameters was investigated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 15/43 patients (35%), whereas CTPA and parenchymal changes related to pulmonary COVID-19 disease were evident in 39/43 patients (91%). The revised Geneva score and the mean D-dimer value obtained using two consecutive measurements were significantly higher in patients with PAFD. The ROC analysis demonstrated that a mean D-dimer value is the parameter with the higher predictivity (AUC 0.831) that is a cut‐off value > 1800 μg/l which predicts the probability of PAFD with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This single centre retrospective report shows a high prevalence of pulmonary artery filling defects revealed using CTPA in COVID-19 patients and demonstrates that the mean value of multiple D-dimer measurements may represent a predicting factor of this complication.","Scardapane, Arnaldo; Villani, Laura; Bavaro, Davide Fiore; Passerini, Francesca; Ianora, Amato Antonio Stabile; Lucarelli, Nicola Maria; Angarano, Gioacchino; Portincasa, Piero; Palmieri, Vincenzo Ostilio; Saracino, Annalisa",Biomed Res Int,137,12

Humans are highly susceptible to the infection mediated by influenza A viruses (IAV). The entry of the virus is mediated by the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein that binds to the cellular sialic acid receptors and facilitates the fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane. During IAV infection, virus-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by host intracellular specific sensors including toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) either on the cell surface or intracellularly in endosomes.

A spatial econometric model is used to determine the effects of regional characteristics on HPAI dispersion using data from 162 counties in Korea. Results indicate the existence of spatial dependence, suggesting that the occurrence of HPAI in a county is significantly influenced by neighboring counties. We found that larger size poultry, including laying hens, breeders, and ducks are significantly associated with a greater incidence of HPAI. Among poultry, we found ducks as the greatest source of the spread of HPAI. Our findings suggest that those regions that are spatially dependent with respect to the spread of HPAI, such as counties that intensively breed ducks, should be the focus of surveillance to prevent future epidemics of HPAI.","An, Meilan; Vitale, Jeffrey; Han, Kwideok; Ng’ombe, John N.; Ji, Inbae",Int J Environ Res Public Health,137,33

The aim of this observational study was to analyze and compare the characteristics of patients who visited two private Endodontics offices from March-16 to May-31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. METHODS: Demographic, diagnostic, and procedural data of 1520 (693 in 2020; 827 in 2019) patient visits were collected. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on patient-related variables. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that the number of patient visits decreased in April and May 2020 (P<.0001). In 2020, patients’ self-reported pain level was higher, they were more frequently diagnosed with pulp necrosis, and acute apical abscess, and they received more incisions for drainage (P<.05). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that COVID-19 outbreak was associated with less visits for patients older in age (> 49.5 years) (odds ratio [OR], 0.720; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.573-0.906), more patients with kidney diseases (OR, 2.690; 95% CI, 1.143-6.331), higher levels of pain on percussion (OR, 2.277; 95% CI, 1.718-3.016), less cases with previously initiated treatment (OR, 0.242; 95% CI, 0.080-0.731), less periapical diagnosis of asymptomatic apical periodontitis (OR, 0.510; 95% CI, 0.306-0.849), higher number of non-surgical root canal treatments (OR, 2.073; 95% CI, 1.397-3.074) and apicoectomies (OR, 2.799; 95% CI, 1.367-5.729).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathologic changes of organ systems and the clinicopathologic basis for severe and fatal outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective autopsy study. SETTING: Single pathology department. PARTICIPANTS: 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 (10 of whom were selected at random for autopsy). MEASUREMENTS: Systematic macroscopic, histopathologic, and viral analysis (SARS-CoV-2 on real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), with correlation of pathologic and clinical features, including comorbidities, comedication, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 80.5 years; 8 men, 3 women). Ten of the 11 patients received prophylactic anticoagulant therapy; venous thromboembolism was not clinically suspected antemortem in any of the patients. Both lungs showed various stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts. Thrombosis of small and mid-sized pulmonary arteries was found in various degrees in all 11 patients and was associated with infarction in 8 patients and bronchopneumonia in 6 patients. Kupffer cell proliferation was seen in all patients, and chronic hepatic congestion in 8 patients. Other changes in the liver included hepatic steatosis, portal fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates and ductular proliferation, lobular cholestasis, and acute liver cell necrosis, together with central vein thrombosis. Additional frequent findings included renal proximal tubular injury, focal pancreatitis, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and lymphocyte depletion of spleen and lymph nodes. Viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal, bronchial, and colonic mucosa but not bile. LIMITATION: The sample was small. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency. Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory, and imaging studies and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.

In most healthy children, respiratory viruses are associated with self-limited upper respiratory tract infections and are not accompanied by significant morbidity. In immunocompromised hosts, including hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and oncology patients, respiratory viruses can be associated with significant clinical manifestations, including prolonged viral shedding, lower respiratory tract disease, the need for supplemental oxygen, late airflow obstruction, and even death. This chapter reviews the major respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Other viruses can manifest as pulmonary infection; however, these viruses are discussed elsewhere (see Chapter 17 for discussion of cytomegalovirus and Chapter 22 for discussion of adenoviruses).","Waghmare, Alpana; Englund, Janet A.",Pediatric Transplant and Oncology Infectious Diseases,137,18

Therefore, disease control measures include slowing down or averting the transfer of this viral infection from person to person. Continuous efforts are carried out to avoid the transmission of this disease to frontline healthcare personnel using single-use personal protective equipment (PPE). However, a critical shortage in this equipment around the world is becoming an alarming concern. Therefore, it is vital to present a possible alternative to overcome the acute shortage of protective gear such as face masks against this infectious disease which can have universal accessibility and is easily available. Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is a possible solution to overcome the shortage of protective gear and can play a vital role in supporting their conventional production supplies during this global pandemic situation. In this context, this paper provides a brief background study of COVID-19, its conventional preventive measure, and a detailed overview regarding the latest AM efforts including designers’ providers and makers in the 3D printing community. Moreover, numerous inquiries and questions such as technical factors, testing recommendations and characterization methods and biological concerns such as biocompatibility and sterilization for the AM manufactured medical devices are addressed in this paper.

Blue space had the greatest effect, followed by green space and sports grounds, while grey space had the least. (2) Time of stay had a very significant impact on psychological restoration. Longer time of exposure is not necessarily correlated with a better recovery experience. (3) In the different campus environments, extent is easier to be perceived followed by fascination and compatibility, and the weakest is being away. At the time of stay level, no significant difference was found in the perception of compatibility. Time of stay was negatively correlated with fascination and compatibility.

While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim. AIM: To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19. DESIGN & SETTING: A rapid review of the literature was conducted. METHOD: Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google. In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo studies needed to include a comparator group. RESULTS: Three studies were identified, two in vitro and one in vivo, which were suitable for inclusion. All three were published as pre-prints. The in vitro studies revealed conflicting results, with one finding anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for azithromycin alone, while the other found activity against SARS-CoV-2 only when azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine. A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection. There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established.

This study examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on high school students shortly after closure of public schools in spring 2020, and whether this impact varies by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and grade level. METHODS: A cross‐sectional, one‐time online survey was completed by racial/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse students in 9th through 12th grade at 2 semi‐rural Georgia public high schools (N = 761). RESULTS: Overall, almost one‐fourth of high school students were extremely or very worried about the pandemic, with higher rates of worry among students who are racial/ethnic minorities, lower SES, female and in older grades. Results indicated a concerning impact on the stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness that students are feeling, particularly among girls and those in older grades. Students of color and low SES, who are already disproportionately impacted by COVID‐19, are also more likely to experience mental health challenges.

We characterized the clinical implications of the major genetic risk factor for COVID-19 severity, and its age-dependent effect, using individual-level data in a large international multi-centre consortium. METHOD: The major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor is a chromosome 3 locus, tagged by the marker rs10490770. We combined individual level data for 13,424 COVID-19 positive patients (N=6,689 hospitalized) from 17 cohorts in nine countries to assess the association of this genetic marker with mortality, COVID-19-related complications and laboratory values. We next examined if the magnitude of these associations varied by age and were independent from known clinical COVID-19 risk factors. FINDINGS: We found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1·4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1·2–1·6) and COVID-19 related mortality (HR 1·5, 95%CI 1·3–1·8). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (odds ratio [OR] 2·0, 95%CI 1·6-2·6), venous thromboembolism (OR 1·7, 95%CI 1·2-2·4), and hepatic injury (OR 1·6, 95%CI 1·2-2·0). Risk allele carriers ≤ 60 years had higher odds of death or severe respiratory failure (OR 2·6, 95%CI 1·8-3·9) compared to those > 60 years OR 1·5 (95%CI 1·3-1·9, interaction p-value=0·04). Amongst individuals ≤ 60 years who died or experienced severe respiratory COVID-19 outcome, we found that 31·8% (95%CI 27·6-36·2) were risk variant carriers, compared to 13·9% (95%CI 12·6-15·2%) of those not experiencing these outcomes. Prediction of death or severe respiratory failure among those ≤ 60 years improved when including the risk allele (AUC 0·82 vs 0·84, p=0·016) and the prediction ability of rs10490770 risk allele was similar to, or better than, most established clinical risk factors. INTERPRETATION: The major common COVID-19 risk locus on chromosome 3 is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality—and these are more pronounced amongst individuals ≤ 60 years. The effect on COVID-19 severity was similar to, or larger than most established risk factors, suggesting potential implications for clinical risk management.

The decedent was initially hospitalized for surgical management of underlying coronary artery disease. He developed post-operative complications and was evaluated with chest imaging studies. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive. His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment. The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies. Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages. The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance. Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury. Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified. Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients’ with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology. The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease. The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.","Reichard, R.

Furthermore, we found that the strength of the S-RBD antibody response measured by the agglutination assay correlated with the efficiency of the plasma in blocking RBD binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in a surrogate neutralization assay, suggesting that the agglutination assay might be used to identify individuals with virus-neutralizing antibodies. Intriguingly, we found that >92% of patients had detectable antibodies on the day of a positive viral RNA test, suggesting that the agglutination antibody test might complement RNA testing for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Esmail, Sally; Knauer, Michael J.; Abdoh, Husam; Voss, Courtney; Chin-Yee, Benjamin; Stogios, Peter; Seitova, Almagul; Hutchinson, Ashley; Yusifov, Farhad; Skarina, Tatiana; Evdokimova, Elena; Ackloo, Suzanne; Lowes, Lori; Hedley, Benjamin D.; Bhayana, Vipin; Chin-Yee, Ian; Li, Shawn S.-C.",Cell reports methods,137,21

We speculate that COVID-19-induced systemic or local cytokine release could serve as a second hit in the presence of APOL1 risk alleles and mediate a podocytopathy manifesting as nephrotic syndrome. The presented case with minimal change like disease, occurring in the context of the donor high-risk APOL1 genotype, extends the spectrum of clinical manifestations in COVID-19-associated nephropathy.","Yamada, Masaaki; Rastogi, Prerna; Ince, Dilek; Thayyil, Abdullah; Adela Mansilla, M.; Smith, Richard J.H.; Kuppachi, Sarat; Thomas, Christie P.",Transplant Proc,137,19

Coronaviruses are being associated increasingly with severe diseases in the lower respiratory tract. Alveolar epithelial cells are an important target for coronavirus infection in the lung, and infected cells can initiate innate immune responses to viral infection. In this overview, we describe in vitro models of highly differentiated alveolar epithelial cells that are currently being used to study the innate immune response to coronavirus infection. We have shown that rat coronavirus infection of rat alveolar type I epithelial cells in vitro induces expression of CXC chemokines, which may recruit and activate neutrophils. Although neutrophils are recruited early in infection in several coronavirus models including rat coronavirus. However, their role in viral clearance and/or immune-mediated tissue damage is not understood. Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells will be useful for identifying the interactions between coronaviruses and alveolar epithelial cells that influence the innate immune responses to infection in the lung. Understanding the molecular details of these interactions will be critical for the design of effective strategies to prevent and treat coronavirus infections in the lung.","Miura, Tanya A.; Holmes, Kathryn V.",Journal of Leukocyte Biology,137,28

Women are at less risk than men when it comes to developing most infectious diseases. However, understanding these observations requires a gender approach that takes into account an analysis of both biological and social factors. The host’s response to infection differs in males and females because sex differences have an impact on hormonal and chromosomal control of immunity. Estradiol appears to confer protective immunity, while progesterone and testosterone suppress anti-infectious responses. In addition, genetic factors, including those associated with sex chromosomes, also affect susceptibility to infections. Finally, differences in occupational activities, lifestyle, and comorbidities play major roles in exposure to pathogens and management of diseases. Hence, considering sexual dimorphism as a critical variable for infectious diseases should be one of the steps taken toward developing personalized therapeutic approaches.","Gay, Laetitia; Melenotte, Cléa; Lakbar, Ines; Mezouar, Soraya; Devaux, Christian; Raoult, Didier; Bendiane, Marc-Karim; Leone, Marc; Mège, Jean-Louis",Front Immunol,137,3

The majority of infected individuals have mild to moderate symptoms, but a significant proportion develops respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Thrombosis is another frequent manifestation of Covid-19 that contributes to poor outcomes. Vitamin K plays a crucial role in the activation of both pro- and anticlotting factors in the liver and the activation of extrahepatically synthesised protein S which seems to be important in local thrombosis prevention. However, the role of vitamin K extends beyond coagulation. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of soft tissue calcification and elastic fibre degradation. Severe extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency was recently demonstrated in Covid-19 patients, with high inactive MGP levels correlating with elastic fibre degradation rates. This suggests that insufficient vitamin K-dependent MGP activation leaves elastic fibres unprotected against SARS-CoV-2-induced proteolysis. In contrast to MGP, Covid-19 patients have normal levels of activated factor II, in line with previous observations that vitamin K is preferentially transported to the liver for activation of procoagulant factors. We therefore expect that vitamin K-dependent endothelial protein S activation is also compromised, which would be compatible with enhanced thrombogenicity. Taking these data together, we propose a mechanism of pneumonia-induced vitamin K depletion, leading to a decrease in activated MGP and protein S, aggravating pulmonary damage and coagulopathy, respectively. Intervention trials should be conducted to assess whether vitamin K administration plays a role in the prevention and treatment of severe Covid-19.","Janssen, Rob; Visser, Margot P.

Cancer tissues produce large amounts of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which promotes the generation of Foxp3(+) Tregs from naïve CD4(+) T cells in the local tumor microenvironment. TGF-β activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/p300 and SMAD signaling, which increases the number of acetylated histones at the Foxp3 locus and induces Foxp3 gene expression. TGF-β also helps stabilize Foxp3 expression. The curcumin analog and antitumor agent, GO-Y030, prevented the TGF-β-induced generation of Tregs by preventing p300 from accelerating NF-κB-induced Foxp3 expression. Moreover, the addition of GO-Y030 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of acetylated histones at the Foxp3 promoter and at the conserved noncoding sequence 1 regions that are generated in response to TGF-β. In vivo tumor models demonstrated that GO-Y030-treatment prevented tumor growth and reduced the Foxp3(+) Tregs population in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

Given the delay between risk exposure and disease onset, SCD individuals are increasingly considered a good target population for cost‐effective lifestyle‐based Alzheimer's disease prevention trials. METHODS: The PENSA study is a randomized, double‐blind, controlled clinical trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy of a personalized multimodal intervention in lifestyle (diet counseling, physical activity, cognitive training, and social engagement) combined with the use of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) over 12 months, in slowing down cognitive decline and improving brain connectivity. The study population includes 200 individuals meeting SCD criteria and carrying the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele, who will be randomized into four treatment arms (multimodal intervention + EGCG/placebo, or lifestyle recommendations + EGCG/placebo). The primary efficacy outcome is change in the composite score for cognitive performance measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS‐PACC‐like) adding to the original version the Interference score from the Stroop Color and Word Test and the Five Digit Test. Secondary efficacy outcomes are (1) change in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural neuronal connectivity (structural MRI) and (2) the safety assessment of the EGCG compound. This study is framed within the WW‐FINGERS consortium. DISCUSSION: The use of new technologies (i.e., mobile ecological momentary assessments [EMAs], activity tracker) in the PENSA study allows the collection of continuous data on lifestyle behaviors (diet and physical activity) and mood, enabling a personalized design as well as an intensive follow‐up of participants. These data will be used to give feedback to participants about their own performance along the intervention, promoting their involvement and adherence.

We found significant trends in the daily number of observations in all three countries, indicating a surge in urban observation during lockdowns. We found an increase in the mean daily number of urban observations during the lockdown in Italy and Spain, compared to previous years. The mean daily number of non-urban observations decreased in Italy and Spain, while remained similar to previous years in the UK. We found a general decrease of new records during the lockdowns both in urban and non-urban areas in all countries.

Since sampling of blood requires medically trained personal and comprises some risks for the patient as well as for the health care personal, the sampling by non-invasive methods (e.g. saliva and/ or urine) might be a very valuable alternative for investigating a diseased patient. MAIN BODY: To analyse the usefulness of alternative non­invasive samples for the diagnosis of emerging infectious viral diseases, a literature search was performed on PubMed for alternative sampling for these viral infections. In total, 711 papers of potential relevance were found, of which we have included 128 in this review. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the experience using non-invasive sampling for the diagnostic of emerging viral diseases, it seems important to perform an investigation using alternative samples for routine diagnostics. Moreover, during an outbreak situation, evaluation of appropriate sampling and further processing for laboratory analysis on various diagnostic platforms are very crucial.

In this system, the expression of reporter gene luciferase2P (Luc2P)-EGFP is under the control of HIV-1 promoter 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), which contains multiple CpG sites. Once these sites are methylated, the expression of Luc2P-EGFP is turned off, which may be visualized under fluorescence microscopy, with quantification performed in luciferase activity assay. As a proof of principle, pLTR-Luc2P-EGFP was methylated in vitro, and transfected into 293T cells, where the reduction of Luc2P-EGFP expression was confirmed. Premixed reporter DNA samples with the methylation levels varying from 0 to 100% were used for quantitative measurements of DNA methylation. The resulting standard curves indicated the accuracy of luciferase activity exceeding that of the Western blotting against EGFP. The Bland–Altman analysis showed that data from luciferase activity assay were in good agreement with the actual DNA methylation levels. In summary, we have established a reporter system coupled with reliable detection technique capable of efficient quantifying the changes in methylation in mammalian cells. This system may be utilized as a high throughput screening tool for identifying molecules that modulate DNA methylation.","Wang, X. X.; Jia, H. J.; Lv, Y. R.; Sun, H. H.; Wei, X. L.; Tan, J.

The cause of pneumonia after introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has not been well studied in low-income and middle-income countries, and most data are from cross-sectional studies of children admitted to hospital. We aimed to longitudinally investigate the incidence and causes of childhood pneumonia in a South African birth cohort. METHODS: We did a nested case-control study of children in the Drakenstein Child Health Study who developed pneumonia from May 29, 2012, to Dec 1, 2014. Children received immunisations including acellular pertussis vaccine and PCV13. A nested subgroup had nasopharyngeal swabs collected every 2 weeks throughout infancy. We identified pneumonia episodes and collected blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, and induced sputum specimens. We used multiplex real-time PCR to detect pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs and induced sputum of pneumonia cases and in nasopharyngeal swabs of age-matched and site-matched controls. To show associations between organisms and pneumonia we used conditional logistic regression; results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. FINDINGS: 314 pneumonia cases occurred (incidence of 0·27 episodes per child-year, 95% CI 0·24–0·31; median age 5 months [IQR 3–9]) in 967 children during 1145 child-years of follow-up. 60 (21%) cases of pneumonia were severe (incidence 0·05 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0·04–0·07]) with a case fatality ratio of 1% (three deaths). A median of five organisms (IQR 4–6) were detected in cases and controls with nasopharyngeal swabs, and a median of six organisms (4–7) recorded in induced sputum (p=0·48 compared with nasopharyngeal swabs). Bordetella pertussis (OR 11·08, 95% CI 1·33–92·54), respiratory syncytial virus (8·05, 4·21–15·38), or influenza virus (4·13, 2·06–8·26) were most strongly associated with pneumonia; bocavirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, Haemophilus influenzae, and cytomegalovirus were also associated with pneumonia. In cases, testing of induced sputum in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs provided incremental yield for detection of B pertussis and several viruses. INTERPRETATION: Pneumonia remains common in this highly vaccinated population. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most frequently detected pathogen associated with pneumonia; influenza virus and B pertussis were also strongly associated with pneumonia. Testing of induced sputum increases the yield for detection of several organisms. New vaccines and strategies are needed to address the burden of childhood pneumonia.

This paper considers the hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This potential is suggested on the basis of the emergence of an RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) sequence in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. RGD is a motif commonly used by viruses to bind cell-surface integrins. Numerous signaling pathways are mediated by integrins and virion binding could lead to dysregulation of these pathways, with consequent tissue damage. Integrins on the surfaces of pneumocytes, endothelial cells and platelets may be vulnerable to CoV-2 virion binding. For instance, binding of intact virions to integrins on alveolar cells could enhance viral entry. Binding of virions to integrins on endothelial cells could activate angiogenic cell signaling pathways; dysregulate integrin-mediated signaling pathways controlling developmental processes; and precipitate endothelial activation to initiate blood clotting. Such a procoagulant state, perhaps together with enhancement of platelet aggregation through virions binding to integrins on platelets, could amplify the production of microthrombi that pose the threat of pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, strokes and other thrombotic consequences. The susceptibility of different tissues to virion–integrin interactions may be modulated by a host of factors, including the conformation of relevant integrins and the impact of the tissue microenvironment on spike protein conformation. Patient-specific differences in these factors may contribute to the high variability of clinical presentation. There is danger that the emergence of receptor-binding domain mutations that increase infectivity may also enhance access of the RGD motif for integrin binding, resulting in viral strains with ACE2 independent routes of cell entry and novel integrin-mediated biological and clinical impacts. The highly infectious variant, B.1.1.7 (or VUI 202012/01), includes a receptor-binding domain amino acid replacement, N501Y, that could potentially provide the RGD motif with enhanced access to cell-surface integrins, with consequent clinical impacts.","Makowski, Lee; Olson-Sidford, William; W.

The vitamin B6–dependent epilepsies are caused by mutations in at least five different genes involved in B6 metabolism. A literature review revealed that only 30 patients with vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy caused by PLPBP mutation have been reported worldwide. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of baby boy born to first-cousin Pakistani parents who presented with generalized as well as focal seizures starting a few hours after birth and responsive to PLP. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant NM_007198.4:c.46_47insCA, NP_009129.1:p.Leu17Hisfs, causing a CA duplication resulting in a frameshift in the PLPBP gene. DISCUSSION: Vitamin B6-Dependent Epilepsy due to PLPBP defect is a rare disorder. The developmental outcomes are variable even with early therapy. Few patients are reported to achieve optimal developmental milestones with therapy. PLP has been advocated as the treatment of choice for PLPBP defect, but oral PN has also demonstrated good seizure control in some patients, including ours. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy due to PLPBP defect is an important differential diagnosis to consider in patients with biochemical features suggestive of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate Oxidase (PNPO) defect and gene testing can facilitate in reaching the correct diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment led to excellent seizure control in most patients.","Ahmed, Sibtain; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.; Ni, Min; Afroze, Bushra",Ann Med Surg (Lond),137,1

In this study, the development trend analysis of the cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative deaths, and cumulative cured cases was conducted based on data from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China from January 23, 2020 to April 6, 2020 using an Elman neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and support vector machine (SVM). A SVM with fuzzy granulation was used to predict the growth range of confirmed new cases, new deaths, and new cured cases. The experimental results showed that the Elman neural network and SVM used in this study can predict the development trend of cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and cured cases, whereas LSTM is more suitable for the prediction of the cumulative confirmed cases. The SVM with fuzzy granulation can successfully predict the growth range of confirmed new cases and new cured cases, although the average predicted values are slightly large.

However, to date, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of HIAT on academic performance or absenteeism or examined the cost-effectiveness of HIAT relative to other treatments in women with primary dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying aerobic exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea remain unclear. The objectives of this study are to: (1) evaluate the effects of HIAT on absenteeism and academic performance among university students, (2) identify the underlying mechanisms associated with aerobic exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea, and (3) determine the cost-effectiveness of HIAT compared with a wait-list control (WLC) group receiving usual care. METHODS: A sequential, embedded, mixed-methods study design, including a crossover, randomised controlled trial (RCT) and semi-structured focus groups, will be conducted alongside an economic evaluation. A total of 130 women aged 18–24 years will be randomised into either HIAT (n = 65) or wait-list control (n = 65) groups. Primary outcomes will include average pain intensity, absenteeism from university, and academic performance. Primary mediators will include salivary progesterone and prostaglandin F2α levels. Outcome and meditator variables will be assessed at baseline and post-treatment, at 12 and 28 weeks. An economic analysis will be conducted from the societal and healthcare perspective of Hong Kong. Semi-structured focus groups will be conducted at 32 weeks. Of the 130 participants included in the RCT, 70 will be included in the focus groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: All statistical analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis, using SPSS (version 24). Preliminary analysis using an independent samples t-test and a two-sided, unpaired Student’s t-test will be performed to exclude carryover effects and identify within-participant differences in outcome variables between the study periods, respectively. Treatment effects will be evaluated using analysis of variance via a mixed-effects model with fixed effects for intervention, period, and sequence. In all models, random effects will include the participants nested within the sequence as a sampling cluster. The mediation effects will be assessed using the Sobel test. The EQ-5D responses will be converted into utility scores to estimate the gain or loss of quality-adjusted life-years. Seemingly unrelated regression analyses will be used to estimate the total cost differences and effect differences.

METHODS: We distributed a questionnaire regarding work, sleep, and excessive fatigue symptoms to 5410 truck drivers, as the riskiest occupation for overwork-related CCVDs, and collected 1992 total samples (response rate: 36.8%). The research team collected 1564 investigation reports required for compensation for Karoshi. Of them, 190 reports listed the prodromes of Karoshi, which were used to develop the new excessive fatigue symptoms inventory. RESULTS: One-way analyses of variance showed that the excessive fatigue symptoms differed significantly by monthly overtime hours (p < 0.001), daily working time (p < 0.001), work schedule (p = 0.025), waiting time on-site (p = 0.049), number of night shifts (p = 0.011), and sleep duration on workdays (p < 0.001). Multivariate mixed-model regression analyses revealed shorter sleep duration as the most effective parameter for predicting excessive fatigue symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that the occurrences of CCVDs were significantly higher in the middle [adjusted ORs = 3.56 (1.28–9.94)] and high-score groups [3.55 (1.24–10.21)] than in the low-score group. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that shorter sleep duration was associated more closely with a marked increase in fatigue, as compared with the other work and sleep factors.

However, the use of face masks among children, especially those aged younger than 3 years, is debated, and the US Centers for Disease Control and American Academy of Physicians recommend the use of face mask only among individuals aged 3 years or older. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of surgical facial masks among children is associated with episodes of oxygen desaturation or respiratory distress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted from May through June 2020 in a secondary-level hospital pediatric unit in Italy. Included participants were 47 healthy children divided by age (ie, group A, aged ≤24 months, and group B, aged >24 months to ≤144 months). Data were analyzed from May through June 2020. INTERVENTIONS: All participants were monitored every 15 minutes for changes in respiratory parameters for the first 30 minutes while not wearing a surgical face mask and for the next 30 minutes while wearing a face mask. Children aged 24 months and older then participated in a walking test for 12 minutes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in respiratory parameters during the use of surgical masks were evaluated.

In this paper, we applied RS methods for the prediction of the antiviral activity class (active/inactive) for compounds extracted from ChEMBL. Two main RS approaches were applied: collaborative filtering (Surprise implementation) and content-based filtering (sparse-group inductive matrix completion (SGIMC) method). The effectiveness of RS approaches was investigated for prediction of antiviral activity classes (“interactions”) for compounds and viruses, for which some of their interactions with other viruses or compounds are known, and for prediction of interaction profiles for new compounds. Both approaches achieved relatively good prediction quality for binary classification of individual interactions and compound profiles, as quantified by cross-validation and external validation receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score >0.9. Thus, even simple recommender systems may serve as an effective tool in antiviral drug discovery.","Sosnina, Ekaterina A.; Sosnin, Sergey; Nikitina, Anastasia A.; Nazarov, Ivan; Osolodkin, Dmitry I.; Fedorov, Maxim V.",ACS Omega,137,16

Recent papers on the field claim that binding processes of working memory (WM) are assisted by attention and executive functions. On the same page, vascular pathology is gaining more ground as the main underlying cause for many brain pathologies. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise and smoking are the most common risk factors that people of all ages suffer from and constitute the main vascular risk factors responsible for a possible decline in executive functions and attention. Thus, this research is an attempt to examine the relation between the binding functions of WM and the existence of vascular risk factors via a computerized test focusing on feature binding. The study comprised adults (n = 229) with and without vascular risk factors. The main tools used were a biomarker questionnaire and a feature binding test (FBT). The results showed that participants who report suffering from one or more vascular risk factors had significantly lower performance on specific subtasks of the FBT in comparison to the participants who were healthy. This allows us to assume that there might be a positive association between feature binding and a vascular risk profile in adults, and such a test could be a useful diagnostic tool for early cognitive impairment due to incipient vascular pathology.","Bika, Eirini; Moraitou, Despina; Masoura, Elvira; Kolios, George; Papantoniou, Georgia; Sofologi, Maria; Papaliagkas, Vasileios; Ntritsos, Georgios",Brain Sci,137,1

Activities include performing effective chest compressions, assessing and restoring a perfusing cardiac rhythm, stabilizing the airway, and treating the underlying cause of the arrest. While the existing critical care literature has appropriately focused on the patient, there has been a dearth of information discussing the various stresses to the healthcare team. This review summarizes the available literature regarding occupational risks to medical emergency teams, characterizes these risks, offers preventive strategies to healthcare workers, and highlights further research needs. METHODS: We performed a literature search of PubMed for English articles of all types (randomized controlled trials, case-control and cohort studies, case reports and series, editorials and commentaries) through September 22, 2016, discussing potential occupational hazards during resuscitation scenarios. Of the 6266 articles reviewed, 73 relevant articles were included. RESULTS: The literature search identified six potential occupational risk categories to members of the resuscitation team—infectious, electrical, musculoskeletal, chemical, irradiative, and psychological. Retrieved articles were reviewed in detail by the authors. CONCLUSION: Overall, we found there is limited evidence detailing the risks to healthcare workers performing resuscitation. We identify these risks and offer potential solutions. There are clearly numerous opportunities for further study in this field.","Vindigni, Stephen M.; Lessing, Juan N.; Carlbom, David J.",J Intensive Care,137,20

Adaptations and improvements over that time frame have led to the development of multiplex assays. However, limitations in terms of available fluorophores has meant the number of assays which can be combined has remained in single figures. This latter limitation has led to the focus tending to be on individual pathogens and their detection. This chapter describes the development of TaqMan® Array Cards (TACs), technology which allows the detection of multiple pathogens (up to 48 targets) from a single nucleic acid extract, utilising small volumes and real-time PCR. This in turn lends itself to a syndromic approach to infectious disease diagnosis. Using the examples of TACs we have developed in our own laboratory, as well as others, we explain the design, optimisation and use of TACs for respiratory, gastrointestinal and liver infections. Refinement of individual assays is discussed as well as the incorporation of appropriate internal and process controls onto the array cards. Finally, specific examples are given of instances where the assays have had a direct, positive impact on patient care.","Heaney, Jude; Rolfe, Kathryn; Gleadall, Nicholas S.; Greatorex, Jane S.; Curran, Martin D.",Methods in Microbiology,137,20

However, reasons for elevated risk in substance users are not well understood. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether alcohol or other drug use is associated with adherence to CDC guidelines for COVID-19 mitigation. Pre-registered analyses tested the hypothesis that greater use of alcohol and other drugs would be associated with lower CDC guideline adherence. A secondary objective was to determine whether substance use was associated with the likelihood of COVID-19 testing or outcome. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was administered to a convenience sample recruited through the MTurk platform from June 18-July 19, 2020. Individuals 18 years or older and residing in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or Rhode Island were eligible to participate. The exposure of interest was past-7-day use of alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cannabis, stimulants, and non-medical opioids. The primary outcome was CDC guideline adherence measured using a scale developed from behaviors advised to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were likelihood of COVID-19 testing and a positive COVID-19 test result. All analyses accounted for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS The sample included 1,084 individuals (mean age = 40.9  13.4; gender: 48.8% men, 50.1% women, 1.1% other gender identity; race: 68.5% White individuals, 24.6% Black individuals; ethnicity: 25.5% Hispanic individuals). Daily opioid users reported lower CDC guideline adherence than non-daily users (B = -0.24, 95% CI [-.44, -0.05]) and non-users (B = -0.57, 95% CI [-0.76, -0.38]). Daily alcohol drinkers reported lower adherence than non-daily drinkers (B = -0.16, 95% CI [-0.30, -0.02]). Non-daily alcohol drinkers reported higher adherence than non-drinkers (B = 0.10, 95% CI [0.02, 0.17]). Daily opioid use related to greater odds of COVID-19 testing, and daily stimulant use related to greater odds of a positive test. CONCLUSIONS In a regionally specific, racially and ethnically diverse convenience sample, adults who engaged in daily alcohol or opioid use also reported lower CDC guideline adherence. Any opioid use was associated with greater odds of COVID-19 testing, and daily stimulant use was associated with greater odds of COVID-19 infection. Cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cannabis, or stimulant use were not statistically associated with CDC guideline adherence, after accounting for sociodemographic covariates and other substance use variables. Findings support further investigation into whether COVID-19 testing and vaccination should be expanded among individuals with substance-related risk factors.

Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa as well as in the Arabian Peninsula, zoonotic disease appears confined to the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoVs from Africa have hitherto been poorly studied. We genetically and phenotypically characterized MERS-CoV from dromedaries sampled in Morocco, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Viruses from Africa (clade C) are phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses from the Arabian Peninsula (clades A and B) but remain antigenically similar in microneutralization tests. Viruses from West (Nigeria, Burkina Faso) and North (Morocco) Africa form a subclade, C1, that shares clade-defining genetic signatures including deletions in the accessory gene ORF4b. Compared with human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso (BF785) and Nigeria (Nig1657) had lower virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. BF785 replicated to lower titer in lungs of human DPP4-transduced mice. A reverse genetics-derived recombinant MERS-CoV (EMC) lacking ORF4b elicited higher type I and III IFN responses than the isogenic EMC virus in Calu-3 cells. However, ORF4b deletions may not be the major determinant of the reduced replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Genetic and phenotypic differences in West African viruses may be relevant to zoonotic potential. There is an urgent need for studies of MERS-CoV at the animal–human interface.","Chu, Daniel K.

DESIGN: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 943 healthcare staff sent from Guangzhou to Wuhan to care for patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 received infection precaution training before their mission and were equipped with Level 2/3 personal protective equipment (PPE), in accordance with guidelines from the National Health Commission of China. We conducted a serological survey on the cumulative attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among the healthcare workers sent to Wuhan and compared the seropositive rate to that in local healthcare workers from Wuhan and Jingzhou. RESULTS: Serial tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and tests for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G after the 6-8 week mission revealed a zero cumulative attack rate.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on hospital visits in Yinzhou District, Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis from 1 January 2017 to 6 September 2020 based on the Yinzhou Health Information System in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. The beginning of the intervention was on 23 January 2020, and thus, there were 160 weeks before the intervention and 32 weeks after the implementation of the intervention. Level changes between expected and observed hospital visits in the post-intervention period were estimated using quasi-Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Compared with the expected level, there was an estimated decrease of −22.60% (95% confidence interval (CI): −27.53%, −17.36%) in the observed total hospital visits following the intervention. Observed hospital visits for diseases of the respiratory system were found to be decreased dramatically (−62.25%; 95% CI: −65.62%, −58.60%). However, observed hospital visits for certain diseases were estimated to be increased, including diseases of the nervous system (+11.17%; 95% CI: +3.21%, +19.74%); diseases of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (+27.01%; 95% CI: +17.89%, +36.85%); certain conditions originating in the perinatal period (+45.05%; 95% CI: +30.24%, +61.56%); and congenital malformation deformations and chromosomal abnormalities (+35.50%; 95% CI: +21.24%, +51.45%).

Questions from the seriousness and breadth of the problem to the effectiveness of proposed mitigation measures have been raised. We assert that the decision sciences have a crucial role to play here, as the questions requiring answers involve complex decision making under both uncertainty and ambiguity. The collection, processing, and analysis of data is critical in providing a useful response—especially as information of fundamental importance to such decision making (base rates and transmission rates) is lacking. We propose that scarce testing resources should be diverted away from confirmatory analysis of symptomatic people, as laboratory diagnosis appears to have little decision value in treatment choice over clinical diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms. In contrast, the exploratory use of testing resources to reduce ambiguity in estimates of the base rate of infection appears to have significant value and great practical import for public policy purposes. As these stances may be at odds with triage practices among medical practitioners, they highlight the important role the decision analyst can play in responding to the challenges of the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Rode, David C.; Fischbeck, Paul S.",Risk Anal,137,20

Value should be measured by outcomes achieved, relevant for patients. Patient-centeredness is one domain for quality improvement determined by the Institute of Medicine, aiming to deliver care responsive to the patient. The development and implementation of patient reported outcome- and experience measures can be used for this goal. Recently, we developed the Patient Reported Measure (PRM)-acute care, based on five relevant domains to evaluate and improve the quality of care in the Emergency Department (ED). OBJECTIVE: To validate the PRM-acute care, in order to evaluate and improve patient-centered care in the ED. METHODS: We performed a prospective questionnaire-based study. Patients ≥18 years presenting for internal medicine in the ED were eligible. The validity of the PRM-acute care was evaluated according to the COSMIN-criteria. We performed hypotheses testing to evaluate construct validity. The perceived quality of care was evaluated by statistical analysis. RESULTS: Face- and content validity was evaluated based on previously performed research and deemed good. Construct validity was supported by demonstrated differences between subgroups; patients with severe symptoms had a higher perceived quality of care. The correlation between overall satisfaction and the total mean score of the PRM-acute care (r = 0,447, p = 0.01) was significant. Overall, patients reported a mean perceived quality of care of 4.67/6.0. CONCLUSION: The PRM-acute care is a valid instrument to measure the perceived quality of care in an acute setting for internal medicine patients. Additionally, patients reported a good perceived quality of care in the ED with scores ranging from moderate to well for each of the relevant domains. Therefore, we believe that the PRM-acute care can be implemented in daily practice to evaluate the perceived quality of care and to improve the quality of acute care.","Kremers, Marjolein N.

Air pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM(2.5))-induced cellular dysfunction impairs tissue homeostasis and causes vascular and cardiopulmonary damage. To test a hypothesis that elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels play a pivotal role in air pollutant-induced cardiopulmonary pathologies, we examined the efficacy of a drug-like novel inhibitor of PAI-1, TM5614, in treating PM(2.5)-induced vascular and cardiopulmonary pathologies. Results from biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical studies revealed that PM(2.5) increases the circulating levels of PAI-1 and thrombin and that TM5614 treatment completely abrogates these effects in plasma. PM(2.5) significantly augments the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and this also can be reversed by TM5614, indicating its efficacy in amelioration of PM(2.5)-induced increases in inflammatory and pro-thrombotic factors. TM5614 reduces PM(2.5)-induced increased levels of inflammatory markers cluster of differentiation 107 b (Mac3) and phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (pSTAT3), adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), and apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3. Longer exposure to PM(2.5) induces pulmonary and cardiac thrombosis, but TM5614 significantly ameliorates PM(2.5)-induced vascular thrombosis. TM5614 also reduces PM(2.5)-induced increased blood pressure and heart weight. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that PM(2.5) induces the levels of PAI-1, type I collagen, fibronectin (Millipore), and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and 2 (SREBP-1 and SREBP-2), transcription factors that mediate profibrogenic signaling, in cardiac fibroblasts. TM5614 abrogated that stimulation, indicating that it may block PM(2.5)-induced PAI-1 and profibrogenic signaling through suppression of SREBP-1 and 2. Furthermore, TM5614 blocked PM(2.5)-mediated suppression of nuclear factor erythroid related factor 2 (Nrf2), a major antioxidant regulator, in cardiac fibroblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 with TM5614 is a promising therapeutic approach to control air pollutant PM(2.5)-induced cardiopulmonary and vascular pathologies.","Ghosh, Asish K.; Soberanes, Saul; Lux, Elizabeth; Shang, Meng; Aillon, Raul Piseaux; Eren, Mesut; Budinger, G.R.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 823 COVID-19 patients with at least two evaluations of renal function during hospitalization from four hospitals in Wuhan, China between February 2020 and April 2020. Clinical and laboratory parameters at the time of admission and follow-up data were recorded. Systemic renal tubular dysfunction was evaluated via 24-h urine collections in a subgroup of 55 patients. RESULTS: In total, 823 patients were enrolled (50.5% male) with a mean age of 60.9 ± 14.9 years. AKI occurred in 38 (40.9%) ICU cases but only 6 (0.8%) non-ICU cases. Using forward stepwise Cox regression analysis, we found eight independent risk factors for AKI including decreased platelet level, lower albumin level, lower phosphorus level, higher level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), urea, and prothrombin time (PT) on admission. For every 0.1 mmol/L decreases in serum phosphorus level, patients had a 1.34-fold (95% CI 1.14–1.58) increased risk of AKI. Patients with hypophosphatemia were likely to be older and with lower lymphocyte count, lower serum albumin level, lower uric acid, higher LDH, and higher CRP. Furthermore, serum phosphorus level was positively correlated with phosphate tubular maximum per volume of filtrate (TmP/GFR) (Pearson r = 0.66, p < .001) in subgroup analysis, indicating renal phosphate loss via proximal renal tubular dysfunction. CONCLUSION: The AKI incidence was very low in non-ICU patients as compared to ICU patients. Hypophosphatemia is an independent risk factor for AKI in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Zijin; Gao, Chenni; Yu, Haijin; Lu, Lin; Liu, Jialin; Chen, Wei; Xiang, Xiaogang; Hussain, Hafiz Muhammad Jafar; Lee, Benjamin J.; Li, Chuanlei; Wei, Wenjie; Huang, Yuhan; Li, Xiang; Fang, Zhengying; Yu, Shuwen; Weng, Qinjie; Ouyang, Yan; Hu, Xiaofan; Tong, Jun; Liu, Jian; Lin, Li; Liu, Mingyu; Xu, Xiaoman; Liu, Dan; Song, Yuan; Lv, Xifeng; Zha, Yixin; Ye, Zhiyin; Jiang, Tingting; Jia, Jieshuang; Chen, Xiaonong; Bi, Yufang; Xue, Jun; Chen, Nan; Hu, Weiguo; He, Cijiang John; Wang, Huiming; Liu, Jun; Xie, Jingyuan",Ren Fail,137,1

Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were systematically reviewed, with a focus on the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth). Results As of April 16, 2020, in total, 21 peer-reviewed articles on the ophthalmological aspects of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 12 (57.1%) were from Asia, 6 (28.6%) from the United States of America, and 3 (14.3%) from Europe. There were 5 (23.8%) original studies, 10 (47.6%) letters, 3 (14.2%) case reports, and 3 (14.2%) reviews. These articles could be classified into the topics “Modes and prevention of (ocular) transmission”, “Ophthalmological manifestations of COVID-19”, “Clinical guidance concerning ophthalmological practice during the COVID-19 pandemic”, and “Practical recommendations for clinical infrastructure”. Practical recommendations could be extracted from official statements of the AAO and the RCOphth. Conclusion Within a short period, a growing body of articles has started to elucidate the ophthalmological implications of COVID-19. As the eye can represent a route of infection (actively via tears and passively via the nasoacrimal duct), ophthalmological care has to undergo substantial modifications during this pandemic. In the eye, COVID-19 can manifest as keratoconjunctivitis.","Siedlecki, Jakob; Brantl, Victor; Schworm, Benedikt; Mayer, Wolfgang Johann; Gerhardt, Maximilian; Michalakis, Stylianos; Kreutzer, Thomas; Priglinger, Siegfried",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,137,1

The structural integrity of proteins is dynamic and depends on interacting nearby neighboring moieties that influence their properties and induce folding and structural changes. The conformational changes induced by these nearby neighbors in the micro-environmental milieu at that moment are guided by chemical or electrical bonding attractions. There are few literature references that describe the potential for environmental milieu changes to disfavor SARS-CoV-2 attachment to a receptor for survival outside of a host. There are many studies on the effects of pH (acid and base balance) supporting its importance for protein structure and function, but few focus on pH role in extracellular or intracellular protein or actionable requirements of Covera-19. ‘Fold ‘em or Hold ‘em’ is seen by the various functions and effects of furin as it seeks an acidic milieu for action or compatible amino acid sequences which is currently aided by its histidine component and the structural changes of proteins as they enter or exit the host. Questions throughout the text are posed to focus on current thoughts as reviewing applicable COVID-19 translational research science in order to understand the complexities of Covid-19. The pH needs of COVID-19 players and its journey through the human host and environment as well as some efficacious readily available repurposed drugs and out-of-the box and easily available treatments are reviewed.","Griffin, Gerald Dieter",Transl Med Commun,137,20

Aedes-borne diseases, in particular, including dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, are increasing at an alarming rate due to urbanisation, population movement, weak vector control programmes, and climate change. The World Health Organization calls for strengthening of vector control programmes in line with the Global Vector Control Response (GVCR) strategy, and many vector control programmes are transitioning to this new approach. The Singapore dengue control programme, situated within the country’s larger vision of a clean, green, and sustainable environment for the health and well-being of its citizens, provides an excellent example of the GVCR approach in action. Since establishing vector control operations in the 1960s, the Singapore dengue control programme succeeded in reducing the dengue force of infection 10-fold by the 1990s and has maintained it at low levels ever since. Key to this success is consideration of dengue as an environmental disease, with a strong focus on source reduction and other environmental management methods as the dominant vector control strategy. The programme collaborates closely with other government ministries, as well as town councils, communities, the private sector, and academic and research institutions. Community engagement programmes encourage source reduction, and house-to-house inspections accompanied by a strong legislative framework with monetary penalties help to support compliance. Strong vector and epidemiological surveillance means that routine control activities can be heightened to specifically target dengue clusters. Despite its success, the programme continues to innovate to tackle challenges such as climate change, low herd immunity, and manpower constraints. Initiatives include development of novel vector controls such as Wolbachia-infected males and spatiotemporal models for dengue risk assessment. Lessons learnt from the Singapore programme can be applied to other settings, even those less well-resourced than Singapore, for more effective vector control.","Sim, Shuzhen; Ng, Lee Ching; Lindsay, Steve W.; Wilson, Anne L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,137,9

The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.","Kramer, Axel; Schwebke, Ingeborg; Kampf, Günter",BMC Infect Dis,137,26

Thus, organic photovoltaics (OPVs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), photocatalysts, and photodetectors have evolved as scientific and commercial enterprises. However, the complex photochemical reactions and multicomponent materials involved in these systems have hampered rapid progress in their fundamental understanding and material design. This review showcases the evaluation-oriented exploration of photo energy conversion materials by using electrodeless time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) and materials informatics (MI). TRMC with its unique options (excitation sources, environmental control, frequency modulation, etc.) provides not only accelerated experimental screening of OPV and PSC materials but also a versatile route toward shedding light on their charge carrier dynamics. Furthermore, MI powered by machine learning is shown to allow extremely high-throughput exploration in the large molecular space, which is compatible with experimental screening and combinatorial synthesis.","Saeki, Akinori",Polym J,137,1
