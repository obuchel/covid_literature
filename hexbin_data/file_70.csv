105,105,105,Influenza pandemic intervention planning using InfluSim: pharmaceutical and non- pharmaceutical interventions,13.975723,8.951523,2007-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Influenza pandemic preparedness plans are currently developed and refined on national and international levels. Much attention has been given to the administration of antiviral drugs, but contact reduction can also be an effective part of mitigation strategies and has the advantage to be not limited per se. The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses, based on mathematical models. METHODS: We use the freely available planning tool InfluSim to investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic. In particular, we examine how intervention schedules, restricted stockpiles and contact reduction (social distancing measures and isolation of cases) determine the course of a pandemic wave and the success of interventions. RESULTS: A timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required to substantially protract the peak of the epidemic and reduce its height. Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment (e.g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively. The protraction of the pandemic wave is essential to win time while waiting for vaccine development and production. However, it is the height of the peak of an epidemic which can easily overtax general practitioners, hospitals or even whole public health systems, causing bottlenecks in basic and emergency medical care.","Duerr, Hans P; Brockmann, Stefan O; Piechotowski, Isolde; Schwehm, Markus; Eichner, Martin",BMC Infect Dis,70,3
405,405,405,Using Complementary and Alternative Medicines to Target the Host Response during Severe Influenza,14.064542,9.243055,2009-09-24,"It is now accepted that an overwhelming inflammatory response is the cause of human deaths from avian H5N1 influenza infection. With this in mind we sought to examine the literature for examples of complementary and alternative medicines that reduce inflammation, and to place the results of this search in the context of our own work in a mouse model of influenza disease, using a pharmaceutical agent with anti-inflammatory properties. Two Chinese herbs, Angelica sinensis (Dang Gui) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), have been recently shown to protect mice during lethal experimental sepsis via inhibition of the novel inflammatory cytokine High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1). Biochanin A, a ligand of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma and the active isoflavone in Trifolium pratense (red clover), has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus could be used as an influenza treatment. This is of great interest since we have recently shown that gemfibrozil, a drug used to treat hyperlipidemia in humans and a synthetic ligand of PPAR alpha, significantly reduces the mortality associated with influenza infections in mice. The inflammation-modulating abilities of these natural agents should be considered in light of what is now known about the mechanisms of fatal influenza, and tested as potential candidates for influenza treatments in their own right, or as adjunct treatments to antivirals.","Alleva, Lisa M.; Cai, Charles; Clark, Ian A.",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,70,22
462,462,462,Severe novel influenza A (H1N1) infection in cancer patients,13.82726,8.86519,2010-05-28,"Background: The natural history and consequences of severe H1N1 influenza infection among cancer patients are not yet fully characterized. We describe eight cases of H1N1 infection in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a referral cancer center. Patients and methods: Clinical data from all patients admitted with acute respiratory failure due to novel viral H1N1 infection were reviewed. Lung tissue was submitted for viral and bacteriological analyses by real-time RT-PCR, and autopsy was conducted on all patients who died. Results: Eight patients were admitted, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years old. There were five patients with solid organ tumors (62.5%) and three with hematological malignancies (37.5%). Five patients required mechanical ventilation and all died. Four patients had bacterial bronchopneumonia. All deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure. A milder form of lung disease was present in the three cases who survived. Lung tissue analysis was performed in all patients and showed diffuse alveolar damage in most patients. Other lung findings were necrotizing bronchiolitis or extensive hemorrhage. Conclusions: H1N1 viral infection in patients with cancer can cause severe illness, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. More data are needed to identify predictors of unfavorable evolution in these patients.","Hajjar, L. A.; Mauad, T.; Galas, F. R. B. G.; Kumar, A.; da Silva, L. F.

679,679,679,Survival of Influenza A(H1N1) on Materials Found in Households: Implications for Infection Control,14.013586,9.219774,2011-11-22,"BACKGROUND: The majority of influenza transmission occurs in homes, schools and workplaces, where many frequently touched communal items are situated. However the importance of transmission via fomites is unclear since few data exist on the survival of virus on commonly touched surfaces. We therefore measured the viability over time of two H1N1 influenza strains applied to a variety of materials commonly found in households and workplaces. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 (PR8) or A/Cambridge/AHO4/2009 (pandemic H1N1) viruses were inoculated onto a wide range of surfaces used in home and work environments, then sampled at set times following incubation at stabilised temperature and humidity. Virus genome was measured by RT-PCR; plaque assay (for PR8) or fluorescent focus formation (for pandemic H1N1) was used to assess the survival of viable virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome of either virus could be detected on most surfaces 24 h after application with relatively little drop in copy number, with the exception of unsealed wood surfaces. In contrast, virus viability dropped much more rapidly. Live virus was recovered from most surfaces tested four hours after application and from some non-porous materials after nine hours, but had fallen below the level of detection from all surfaces at 24 h. We conclude that influenza A transmission via fomites is possible but unlikely to occur for long periods after surface contamination (unless re-inoculation occurs). In situations involving a high probability of influenza transmission, our data suggest a hierarchy of priorities for surface decontamination in the multi-surface environments of home and hospitals.","Greatorex, Jane S.; Digard, Paul; Curran, Martin D.; Moynihan, Robert; Wensley, Harrison; Wreghitt, Tim; Varsani, Harsha; Garcia, Fayna; Enstone, Joanne; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S.",PLoS One,70,1

High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the most effective therapy for KD to reduce the prevalence of coronary artery lesion (CAL) formation. Recently, the α2, 6 sialylated IgG was reported to interact with a lectin receptor, specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin homolog-related 1 (SIGN-R1) in mice and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) in human, and to trigger an anti-inflammatory cascade. This study was conducted to investigate whether the polymorphism of DC-SIGN (CD209) promoter −336 A/G (rs4804803) is responsible for susceptibility and CAL formation in KD patients using Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. A total of 521 subjects (278 KD patients and 243 controls) were investigated to identify an SNP of rs4804803, and they were studied and showed a significant association between the genotypes and allele frequency of rs4804803 in control subjects and KD patients (P = 0.004 under the dominant model). However, the promoter variant of DC-SIGN gene was not associated with the occurrence of IVIG resistance, CAL formation in KD.

1179,1179,1179,MEK/ERK Dependent Activation of STAT1 Mediates Dasatinib-Induced Differentiation of Acute Myeloid Leukemia,14.203027,9.197534,2013-06-25,"Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a FDA-approved multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR/ABL and Src kinases. It is now used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapies, including imatinib. Here we report a novel effect of dasatinib on inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through MEK/ERK-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). We found that dasatinib could induce the differentiation of AML cells as demonstrated by the expression of differentiation marker CD11b, G0/G1 phase arrest and decreased ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. Of note, dasatinib induced robust phosphorylation of STAT1 both at Tyr701 and Ser727 as well as the redistribution of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus leading to the transcription of STAT1-targeted genes. Knocking down STAT1 expression by shRNA significantly attenuated dasatinib-induced differentiation, indicating an important role of STAT1 in myeloid maturation. We further found that dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1 was regulated by the MEK/ERK kinases. The phosporylation of MEK and ERK occurred rapidly upon dasatinib treatment and increased progressively as differentiation was induced. MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0216 not only inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1, but also abrogated dasatinib-induced myeloid differentiation, suggesting that MEK/ERK dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 might be indispensable for the differentiating effect of dasatinib in AML cells. Taken together, our study suggests that STAT1 is an important mediator in dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells, whose activation requires the activation of MEK/ERK cascades.","Fang, Yanfen; Zhong, Like; Lin, Meihua; Zhou, Xinglu; Jing, Hui; Ying, Meidan; Luo, Peihua; Yang, Bo; He, Qiaojun",PLoS One,70,1
1347,1347,1347,Activity of sputum p38 MAPK is correlated with airway inflammation and reduced FEV(1) in COPD patients,13.989626,9.385059,2013-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants of the progression and severity of COPD. The present study explored the correlation between sputum p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function in the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MATERIAL/METHODS: Sputum samples were collected from 48 COPD patients and 12 healthy persons. Sputum p38 MAPK activity was measured by Western blotting and sputum levels of CXCL8 and neutrophil, and lung function was measured. The correlation between p38MAPK activity and airway inflammation and reduction of lung function was analyzed. RESULT: Our results showed the significantly increased expression of phospho-p38 MAPK and CXCL8 in the sputum samples of the COPD patients. The p38 MAPK activity was remarkably correlated with the CXCL8 level and neutrophils infiltration in the airway, and the decline of lung function in the COPD patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the pivotal role of p38 MAPK in the airway inflammation of COPD patients. We propose p38 MAPK as a potential target for the treatment of COPD.","Huang, Cuiping; Xie, Moying; He, Xinhua; Gao, Hui",Med Sci Monit,70,5

Recently we have shown that IgGs from the sera of MS patients are active in the hydrolysis of DNA. Here we have shown, for the first time, that average concentration of total proteins (132-fold), total IgGs (194-fold) and anti-DNA antibodies (200-fold) in the sera is significantly higher than that in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of fifteen MS patients. The relative activities of total protein from sera and CSFs varied remarkably from patient to patient. It was surprising that the specific DNase activity of the total protein of CSF reparations were 198-fold higher than the serum ones. Electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were obtained by sequential affinity chromatography of the CSF proteins on protein G-Sepharose and FPLC gel filtration. We present first evidence showing that IgGs from CSF not only bind but efficiently hydrolyze DNA and that average specific DNase activity of homogeneous antibodies from CSF is unpredictably ∼49-fold higher than that from the sera of the same MS patients. Some possible reasons of these findings are discussed. We suggest that DNase IgGs of CSF may promote important neuropathologic mechanisms in this chronic inflammatory disorder and MS pathogenesis development.","Parkhomenko, Taisiya A.; Doronin, Vasilii B.; Castellazzi, Massimiliano; Padroni, Marina; Pastore, Michela; Buneva, Valentina N.; Granieri, Enrico; Nevinsky, Georgy A.",PLoS One,70,1

Increasing evidence suggests that premature birth promotes aberrant lung development likely due to the neonatal oxygen transition occurring before pulmonary development has matured. Given that preterm infants are born at a point of time where their immune system is also still developing, early life oxygen exposure may also be disrupting proper development of innate immunity. Here, we review current literature in hopes of stimulating research that enhances understanding of how the oxygen environment at birth influences lung development and host defense. This knowledge may help identify those children at risk for disease and ideally culminate in the development of novel therapies that improve their health.","Domm, William; Misra, Ravi S.; O’Reilly, Michael A.",Front Med (Lausanne),70,22
2482,2482,2482,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease in association with increasing amyloid-β and tau pathology,14.07172,9.273045,2016-11-25,"BACKGROUND: Hyperactivity of the classical axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), mediated by angiotensin II (Ang II) activation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades Ang II to angiotensin 1–7 (Ang ﻿﻿(1-7)) and counter-regulates the classical axis of RAS. We have investigated the expression and distribution of ACE-2 in post-mortem human brain tissue in relation to AD pathology and classical RAS axis activity. METHODS: We measured ACE-2 activity by fluorogenic peptide substrate assay in mid-frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) in a cohort of AD (n = 90) and age-matched non-demented controls (n = 59) for which we have previous data on ACE-1 activity, amyloid β (Aβ) level and tau pathology, as well as known ACE1 (rs1799752) indel polymorphism, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy severity scores. RESULTS: ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced in AD compared with age-matched controls (P < 0.0001) and correlated inversely with levels of Aβ (r = −0.267, P < 0.001) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology (r = −0.327, P < 0.01). ACE-2 was reduced in individuals possessing an APOE ε4 allele (P < 0.05) and was associated with ACE1 indel polymorphism (P < 0.05), with lower ACE-2 activity in individuals homozygous for the ACE1 insertion AD risk allele. ACE-2 activity correlated inversely with ACE-1 activity (r = −0.453, P < 0.0001), and the ratio of ACE-1 to ACE-2 was significantly elevated in AD (P < 0.0001). Finally, we show that the ratio of Ang II to Ang (1–7) (a proxy measure of ACE-2 activity indicating conversion of Ang II to Ang (1–7)) is reduced in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings indicate that ACE-2 activity is reduced in AD and is an important regulator of the central classical ACE-1/Ang II/AT1R axis of RAS, and also that dysregulation of this pathway likely plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD.

At present, no extensive surveillance program is running for RVC in India, and its prevalence is largely unknown except cases of local outbreaks. Here, we intended to detect the presence of RVC in diarrheic children visiting or admitted to hospitals in Haldwani (state of Uttarakhand, India), a city located in the foothills of the Himalayas. During 2010–2013, we screened 119 samples for RVC by an RVC VP6 gene-specific RT-PCR. Of these, 38 (31.93%) were found positive, which is higher than the incidence rates reported so far from India. The phylogenetic analysis of the derived nucleotide sequences from one of the human RVC (HuRVC) isolates, designated as HuRVC/H28/2013/India, showed that the study isolate belongs to genotype I2, P2 and E2 for RVC structural genes 6 and 4 (VP6, and VP4) and non-structural gene 4 (NSP4), respectively. Furthermore, the VP6 gene of HuRVC/H28/2013/India shows the highest similarity to a recently-reported human-like porcine RVC (PoRVC/ASM140/2013/India, KT932963) from India suggesting zoonotic transmission. We also report a full-length NSP4 gene sequence of human RVC from India.

METHODS: We collected the AHSCT and follow-up data of three patients with refractory JDM who received autologous peripheral blood CD34+ cell transplantation in our hospital between June 2004 and July 2015. Those data include: hight, weight, routine blood and urine tests, ESR, CK, ALT, AST, LDH, renal functional tests, lymphocyte subpopulations, HRCT and muscle MRI. The last follow-up was done in June 2017. RESULTS: All three patients had complete remission and could stop prednisone after 3–12 months. None of them relapsed at 144, 113 and 23 months follow-up. Twelve months after their AHSCT, all of their monitoring indexes have returned to normal and they have stopped all medications. Until the date of this article, none of them relapsed or need medicine. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that AHSCT is safe and effective in treating refractory JDM, and it can provides long term drug-free survival.

Our objective was to identify urinary proteins to distinguish UTI from UTC in CIC-dependent children that have potential to serve as objective markers of UTI. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 10 CIC-dependent children were included in the mass spectrometry analysis (UTI = 5, UTC = 5). Quantitative profiling of urine proteins with isobaric protein labeling was performed using tandem mass spectrometry. Candidate markers were normalized using a collective mixture of proteins from all samples. Relative quantitative abundance of proteins across all samples were compared. Proteins with >50% change in the average abundance were identified as proteins of interest, which were then measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in an additional 40 samples (no growth = 10, UTC = 15, UTI = 15). RESULTS: Mass spectrometry revealed 8 differentially expressed proteins. Of these, apolipoprotein D, alpha-amylase 2B, non-secretory ribonuclease, CD44 antigen, and prosaposin were measurable by ELISA. Concentrations of both CD44 and prosaposin were significantly higher in UTI, with area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.72 and 0.78, respectively. CONCLUSION: Urinary CD44 and prosaposin are candidate markers that may assist with the diagnosis of UTI in CIC-dependent children.","Forster, Catherine S; Haffey, Wendy D; Bennett, Michael; Greis, Kenneth D; Devarajan, Prasad",Biomark Insights,70,1
4533,4533,4533,"Therapeutic strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China",13.988794,8.954146,2020-02-07,"In ecological systems, heterogeneous interactions between pathogens take place simultaneously. This occurs, for instance, when two pathogens cooperate, while at the same time, multiple strains of these pathogens co-circulate and compete. Notable examples include the cooperation of human immunodeficiency virus with antibiotic-resistant and susceptible strains of tuberculosis or some respiratory infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. Models focusing on competition or cooperation separately fail to describe how these concurrent interactions shape the epidemiology of such diseases. We studied this problem considering two cooperating pathogens, where one pathogen is further structured in two strains. The spreading follows a susceptible-infected-susceptible process and the strains differ in transmissibility and extent of cooperation with the other pathogen. We combined a mean-field stability analysis with stochastic simulations on networks considering both well-mixed and structured populations. We observed the emergence of a complex phase diagram, where the conditions for the less transmissible, but more cooperative strain to dominate are non-trivial, e.g. non-monotonic boundaries and bistability. Coupled with community structure, the presence of the cooperative pathogen enables the coexistence between strains by breaking the spatial symmetry and dynamically creating different ecological niches. These results shed light on ecological mechanisms that may impact the epidemiology of diseases of public health concern.","Pinotti, Francesco; Ghanbarnejad, Fakhteh; Hövel, Philipp; Poletto, Chiara",R Soc Open Sci,70,33

Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of >50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below <30 nmol/L (or 12 ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important.

Periodic resurgences in invasive group A streptococcal infections in industrialized countries have been reported from the 1980s onwards, with current estimates of incidence in these countries of approximately 3–4 per 100000 population. Infants, pregnant women and the elderly are at increased risk of invasive group A streptococcal infection. The group A streptococcus has an array of virulence factors that underpin its invasive capacity and, in approximately 10% of cases, super-antigen toxins produced by the bacteria stimulate a large proportion of T cells, leading to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Given the rapid clinical progression, effective management of invasive group A streptococcal infections hinges on early recognition of the disease and prompt initiation of supportive care (often intensive care) together with antibacterial therapy. In cases of toxic shock syndrome, it is often difficult to distinguish between streptococcal and staphylococcal infection before cultures become available and so antibacterial choice must include coverage of both of these organisms. In addition, clindamycin is an important adjunctive antibacterial because of its anti-toxin effects and excellent tissue penetration. Early institution of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy should be considered in cases of toxic shock syndrome and severe invasive infection, including necrotizing fasciitis. Early surgical debridement of necrotic tissue is also an important part of management in cases of necrotizing fasciitis.","Steer, Andrew C.; Lamagni, Theresa; Curtis, Nigel; Carapetis, Jonathan R.",Drugs,70,22

Only by the combined efforts of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) has has been possible to standardize the formerly different European and Northern American nomenclature of interstitial lung diseases (alveolitis versus interstitial pneumonia) in adults and to clearly and unambiguously define the diagnostic criteria. The ATS/ERS classification of 2002 comprises seven entities: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), lymphocyte interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). Using the ATS/ERS classification of interstitial pulmonary diseases in premature infants, infants and children is problematic, since UIP, RB-ILD and AIP do not occur at this age. Although infants with severe respiratory insufficiency may sometimes show morphological features similar to DIP or NSIP, this entity should rather be classified as chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI) because of differences in etiology, pathogenesis and prognostic outcome.","Brasch, F.",Pathologe,70,1

Deregulated expression of activin-A has been observed in several human diseases characterized by an immuno-inflammatory and/or tissue remodeling component in their pathophysiology. Various cell types have been recognized as sources of activin-A, and plentiful, occasionally contradicting, functions have been described mainly by in vitro studies. Not surprisingly, both harmful and protective roles have been postulated for activin-A in the context of several disorders. Recent findings have further expanded the functional repertoire of this molecule demonstrating that its ectopic overexpression in mouse airways can cause pathology that simulates faithfully human acute respiratory distress syndrome, a disorder characterized by strong involvement of neutrophils. This finding when considered together with the recent discovery that neutrophils constitute an important source of activin-A in vivo and earlier observations of upregulated activin-A expression in diseases characterized by strong activation of neutrophils may collectively imply a more intimate link between activin-A expression and neutrophil reactivity. In this review, we provide an outline of the functional repertoire of activin-A and suggest that this growth factor functions as a guardian of homeostasis, a modulator of immunity and an orchestrator of tissue repair activities. In this context, a relationship between activin-A and neutrophils may be anything but coincidental.","Sideras, Paschalis; Apostolou, Eirini; Stavropoulos, Athanasios; Sountoulidis, Alexandros; Gavriil, Arianna; Apostolidou, Anastasia; Andreakos, Evangelos",Semin Immunopathol,70,8

This study aims to understand the influence of the rs1940475 SNP on downstream chemokine and cytokine response in human endotoxemia. Rs1940475 was genotyped in 44 healthy Caucasian males, who were challenged with an intravenous bolus of 2 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α were measured at baseline and 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after LPS infusion with high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassays. Peak TNF levels at 2 h after LPS infusion were significantly higher in subjects with AA genotype compared to subjects with AG or GG genotypes (185 pg/mL [IQR, 154–234] vs. 94 pg/mL [IQR, 65–125] vs. 107 pg/mL [IQR, 80–241], respectively; p = 0.03 between groups). Peak IL-6 levels were trend-wise higher in subjects with AA genotype compared to those with AG or GG genotypes (566 pg/mL [IQR, 294–644] vs. 278 pg/mL [IQR, 184–539] and 329 pg/mL [IQR, 240–492], respectively; p = 0.15 between groups).

AA genotype carriers had highest peak TNF and IL-6 levels after LPS challenge, whereas peak MIP-1α levels were highest in GG carriers. This indicates that the rs1940475 SNP modifies the host response to inflammatory stimuli, which may in part explain previously shown associations with clinical outcomes.","Rella, Judith M.; Jilma, Bernd; Fabry, Astrid; Kaynar, A.

We performed a casecontrol study including 86 infants with BPD and 156 matched controls. Genotyping was performed by sequence specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and haplotypes were reconstructed by the fastPHASE software. The results showed that significant differences were detected in the genotype distribution of C/A-18 and intron 4 polymorphisms of SP-B gene between cases and controls. No significant differences were detected in the genotype distribution of C/T1580 or A/G9306 between the two groups. Haplotype analysis revealed that the frequency of A-del-C-A haplotype was higher in case group (0.12 to 0.05, P=0.003), whereas the frequency of C-inv-C-A haplotype was higher in control group (0.19 to 0.05, P=0.000). In addition, a significant difference was observed in the frequency of C-inv-T-A haplotype between the two groups. It was concluded that the polymorphisms of SP-B intron 4 and C/A-18 could be associated with BPD in Chinese Han infants, and the del allele of intron 4 and A allele of C/A-18 might be used as markers of susceptibility in the disease. Haplotype analysis indicated that the gene-gene interactions would play an important part in determining susceptibility to BPD.","Cai, Bao-huan; Chang, Li-wen; Li, Wen-bin; Liu, Wei; Wang, Xi-juan; Mo, Lu-xia; Zhao, Ling-xia; Xu, Hong-tao; Yang, Hui",J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,70,8

Specifically, the application of molecular techniques for genotyping fungal pathogens has resulted in the recognition of cryptic species within several genera, including Blastomyces, and Paracoccidioides; the reclassification of Penicillium marneffei, the agent of penicilliosis, to the genus Talaromyces; and the global emergence of dimorphic fungi of the genus Emmonsia, cause disease in immunocompromised persons.

Some such studies have been conducted among Western travelers; however, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on Japanese travelers. METHODS: Malaria cases that were diagnosed between April 1999 and December 2005 and were reported to the national infectious disease surveillance body were used as the numerators after grouped into countries of disease acquisition. The denominators, the numbers of Japanese travelers visiting individual countries were derived from the recipient countries and obtained through a Japanese organization. RESULTS: In addition to the well-documented high risks in sub-Saharan countries, our study showed that travelers to Papua New Guinea were exposed to a significantly high risk of malaria. In Asia, Myanmar had the highest risk. Generally, malaria incidence rates among Japanese travelers were lower than those previously reported on Western travelers. However, the rates were rather comparable to the data obtained recently. CONCLUSIONS: These malaria incidence data in travelers should be taken into consideration for pre-travel risk assessment. They need to be constantly updated, and at the same time, limitations in data interpretation that are inherent in various study methodologies should also be clarified.","Tada, Yuki; Okabe, Nobuhiko; Kimura, Mikio",Travel Med Infect Dis,70,1

We provide rationales and a step-by-step protocol for probe design and imaging of protein targeting along with two different applications of this technique. One application involves organelle-specific activation of small GTPases, while the other application involves membrane tethering of two different organelles. In the former case, we activate Rac1 and Ras at distinct intracellular locations in order to study compartmentalization of their signaling pathways, and in the latter example, we induce membrane tethering of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in order to study organelle–organelle communication.

The objective of this study was to search for likely microbial agents in diseased tissues using immunocytochemical techniques. Methods Intestines and mesenteric lymph node specimens of 21 patients from two French families with a high frequency of Crohn's disease and from Connecticut were studied. The microbial agents searched for included Bacteroides vulgatus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Escherichia coil, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, influenza A virus, measles virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Results Seventy-five percent of the patients with Crohn's disease (12 of 16) were positively labeled with the antibody to Listeria. Macrophages and giant cells immunolabeled for this antigen were distributed underneath ulcers, along fissures, around abscesses, within the lamina propria, in granulomas, and in the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes. In addition, 57% (12 of 21) of the cases contained the E. coli antigen, and 44% (7 of 16) contained the streptococcal antigen. The immunolabeling for the latter two agents also occurred within macrophages and giant cells, distributed in a pattern similar to that of Listeria antigen. Conclusions The results suggest that Listeria spp., E. coli, and streptococci, but not measles virus, play a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.","Liu, Ying; Van Kruiningen, Herbert J.; West, A.Brian; Cartun, Richard W.; Cortot, Antoine; Colombel, Jean-Frédéric",Gastroenterology,70,22

J., 1989. Isozymes and the status of Taraxacum (Asteraceae) agamospecies. Genetic identities I and Similarity Indices SI are calculated between 12 samples of Taraxacum, on the basis of 40 isozymes at 15 loci for 10 enzyme systems. Samples included three polyploid agamospermous populations from northern England (group 1), three sexual diploid populations from south‐central France (group 2), and six accessions of ‘primitive’ diploid self‐compatible sexual taxa from southern Europe and Australia. Samples could be assigned to eight species, classified in seven sections of the genus. Two clusters of high relationship were evident. All the group 1 and group 2 species were very closely related, with pairwise comparisons for I in excess of 0.93. The three group 3 accessions identified as T. bessarabicum showed pairwise comparisons for SI in excess of 0.71. Comparisons for SI between the other group 3 species, and between all the group 3 species and the group 1 and 2 species were all very low, not exceeding 0.45. It is concluded that dissimilarity between samples as assessed by isozymes is probably related to the time of evolutionary divergence of those samples. Although allopolyploid, and morphologically very diverse, the group 1 agamospecies may have very recently diverged asexually from a common stock. The group 2 diploids may have resulted from rediploidization and regained sexuality from the same originally agamospermous stock. In areas of Europe in which such ‘modern’ sexuality is common, it is probable that all ‘modern’ Taraxaca, including at least five sections of the genus, should be included within a single taxon. In contrast, ‘primitive’ self‐compatible sexual species in group 3 appear to have diverged from each other several million years ago, and with the exception of the disjunct accessions of T. bessarabicum, are genetically highly distinct. Such species should be maintained in the taxonomies of all areas. It is probable that an agamospecies classification of ‘modern’Taraxacum will continue to convey much useful information in areas, such as northern Europe, in which sexuality is absent.","HUGHES, JANE; RICHARDS, A.

Both methods revealed limited amounts of polymorphism. Since the SSCP analysis concerned an expressed DRB gene it can be concluded that the level of functional MHC class II polymorphism, at least at the DRB locus, is low in Swedish moose. DNA fingerprinting was used to determine if the unusual pattern of low MHC variability could be explained by a low degree of genome‐wide genetic diversity. Hybridizations with two minisatellite probes gave similarity indices somewhat higher than the average for other natural population, but the data suggest that the low MHC variability cannot be explained by a recent population bottleneck. However, since minisatellite sequences evolve more rapidly than MHC sequences, the low levels of MHC diversity may be attributed to a bottleneck of more ancient origin. The selection pressure for MHC variability in moose may also be reduced and we discuss the possibility that its solitary life style may reduce lateral transmission of pathogens in the population.","ELLEGREN, H.; MIKK, S.; WALLIN, K.; ANDERSSON, L.",Mol Ecol,70,12

OBJECTIVES: In a cohort of patients with traumatic spine injury (TSI) in Tanzania who did not undergo surgery, we sought to: (1) describe this nonoperative population, (2) compare outcomes to operative patients, and (3) determine predictors of nonoperative treatment. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. METHODS: All patients admitted for TSI over a 33-month period were reviewed. Variables included demographics, fracture morphology, neurologic exam, indication for surgery, length of hospitalization, and mortality. Regression analyses were used to report outcomes and predictors of nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: 270 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 145 were managed nonoperatively. Demographics between groups were similar. The nonoperative group was young (mean = 35.5 years) and primarily male (n = 125, 86%). Nonoperative patients had 7.39 times the odds of death (p = 0.003). Patients with AO type A0/1/2/3 fractures (p < 0.001), ASIA E exams (p = 0.016), cervical spine injuries (p = 0.005), and central cord syndrome (p = 0.016) were more commonly managed nonoperatively. One hundred and twenty-four patients (86%) had indications for but did not undergo surgery. After multivariate analysis, the only predictor of nonoperative management was sustaining a cervical injury (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Eighty-six percent of nonoperative TSI patients had an indication for surgery. Nonoperative management was associated with an increased risk of mortality. Cervical injury was the single independent risk factor for not undergoing surgery. The principle reason for nonoperative management was cost of implants. While a causal relationship between nonoperative management and inferior outcomes cannot be made, efforts should be made to provide surgery when indicated, regardless of a patient’s ability to pay.","Lessing, Noah L.; Lazaro, Albert; Zuckerman, Scott L.; Leidinger, Andreas; Rutabasibwa, Nicephorus; Shabani, Hamisi K.; Härtl, Roger",Spinal Cord,70,1

Current methods for in vivo quantification of mutagenesis are limited because they rely on transgenic rodent systems that are low-throughput, expensive, prolonged, and do not fully represent other species such as humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a conceptually attractive alternative for detecting mutations in the DNA of any organism; however, the limit of resolution for standard NGS is poor. Technical error rates (∼1 × 10(−3)) of NGS obscure the true abundance of somatic mutations, which can exist at per-nucleotide frequencies ≤1 × 10(−7). Using duplex sequencing, an extremely accurate error-corrected NGS (ecNGS) technology, we were able to detect mutations induced by three carcinogens in five tissues of two strains of mice within 31 d following exposure. We observed a strong correlation between mutation induction measured by duplex sequencing and the gold-standard transgenic rodent mutation assay. We identified exposure-specific mutation spectra of each compound through trinucleotide patterns of base substitution. We observed variation in mutation susceptibility by genomic region, as well as by DNA strand. We also identified a primordial marker of carcinogenesis in a cancer-predisposed strain of mice, as evidenced by clonal expansions of cells carrying an activated oncogene, less than a month after carcinogen exposure. These findings demonstrate that ecNGS is a powerful method for sensitively detecting and characterizing mutagenesis and the early clonal evolutionary hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Duplex sequencing can be broadly applied to basic mutational research, regulatory safety testing, and emerging clinical applications.","Valentine, Charles C.; Young, Robert R.; Fielden, Mark R.; Kulkarni, Rohan; Williams, Lindsey N.; Li, Tan; Minocherhomji, Sheroy; Salk, Jesse J.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,70,1

An effective psychosocial risk management can be carried out on the basis of an integrated multidisciplinary model founded on the risk management paradigm. Over years, the occupational medicine has played an important role at national level in this area, contributing to the creation of an integrated and participatory approach. OBJECTIVES: This study explores the developmental process of psychosocial risk management over time in Europe and Italy, to offer an update on the state of the art at a national level and insights on future perspectives. METHODS: Through a reflection on research developments, in Europe and in Italy, we outline how the knowledge obtained has been translated into policies, which have encouraged the implementation at international and national level of consolidated practices for the management of psychosocial risks. RESULTS: An overview of some key steps of the inclusion of psychosocial aspects in OSH is presented, highlighting the positive impact of the multidisciplinary approach. Moreover, the driving role played by policies for implementation in organizational practice is also highlighted, with particular reference to the Italian example. DISCUSSION: Starting from the existing knowledge, it is necessary to tackle emerging risks by continuing to translate the knowledge obtained from research into policies that have a driving role in the identification and implementation of actions and practical tools.","Iavicoli, Sergio; Di Tecco, Cristina",Med Lav,70,1

We recently introduced the ALFA-tag together with two ALFA-specific single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), NbALFA and NbALFA(PE), featuring high or intermediate affinity, respectively. Together, the ALFA system can be employed for a broad range of applications in microscopy, cell biology and biochemistry requiring either extraordinarily stable binding or mild competitive elution at room temperature. In order to further enhance the versatility of the ALFA system, we, here, aimed at developing an sdAb optimized for efficient elution at low temperatures. To achieve this, we followed a stringent selection scheme tailored to the specific application. We found candidates combining a fast capture of ALFA-tagged proteins with an efficient competitive elution at 4 °C in physiological buffer. Importantly, by employing a structure-guided semisynthetic library based on well-characterized NbALFA variants, the high specificity and consistent binding of proteins harboring ALFA-tags at either terminus could be maintained. ALFA Selector(CE), a resin presenting the cold-elutable NbALFA(CE), is an ideal tool for the one-step purification of sensitive protein complexes or temperature-labile enzymes. We believe that the general approach followed during the selection and screening can be transferred to other challenging sdAb discovery projects.","Kilisch, Markus; Götzke, Hansjörg; Gere-Becker, Maja; Crauel, Alexander; Opazo, Felipe; Frey, Steffen",Biomolecules,70,1

We investigate this hypothesis using three ribosomal (nuITS, nuLSU, mtSSU) regions from and morphological examination of 70 specimens collected primarily in Europe and North America. The results of our analyses support separation of the traditional Sarea difformis s.lat. and Sarea resinae s.lat. into two distinct genera, Sarea and Zythia. Sarea as circumscribed is shown to conservatively comprise three phylospecies, with one corresponding to Sarea difformis s.str. and two, morphologically indistinguishable, corresponding to the newly combined Sarea coeloplata. Zythia is provisionally maintained as monotypic, containing only a genetically and morphologically variable Z. resinae. The new genus Atrozythia is erected for the new species A. klamathica. Arthrographis lignicola is placed in this genus on molecular grounds, expanding the concept of Sareomycetes by inclusion of a previously unknown type of asexual morph. Dating analyses using additional marker regions indicate the emergence of the Sareomycetes was roughly concurrent with the diversification of the genus Pinus, suggesting that this group of fungi emerged to exploit the newly-available resinous ecological niche supplied by Pinus or another, extinct group of conifers. Our phylogeographic studies also permitted us to study the introductions of these fungi to areas where they are not native, including Antarctica, Cape Verde, and New Zealand and are consistent with historical hypotheses of introduction.

If hypnozoites survive, then the subsequent blood stage infections in early relapses (< 2 months) are suppressed by the slowly eliminated anti-malarial drugs used to treat the blood stage infection (chloroquine, artemisinin combination treatments), but they are not usually eliminated. The 8-aminoquinolines have significant blood stage activity which contributes to therapeutic responses. The latent interval from primary infection to early relapse depends on the number of activatable hypnozoites, the dose of anti-malarial, its pharmacokinetic properties, the level of resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration) and immunity. The dose–response relationship for radical curative efficacy of primaquine and tafenoquine is steep over the total dose range from 1.5 to 5 mg base/kg which may explain the poor efficacy of tafenoquine at the currently recommended dose.","White, Nicholas J.",Malar J,70,1

METHODS: Data were collected from outpatients (< 15 years) accessing the emergency rooms of Padua University-Hospital and Mestre Dell' Angelo-Hospital (Venice) between January 1st, 2016, and December 31st, 2018. WISCAs were developed by estimating the coverage of eight regimens using a Bayesian hierarchical model adjusted for age, sex, and previous antibiotic treatment or renal/urological comorbidities. RESULTS: 385 of 620 urine culture requests were included in the model analysis. The most frequently observed bacterium was E. coli (85% and 87%, Centre A and B). No centre effect on coverage estimates was found, and data were successfully pooled together. Coverage ranged from 77.8% (Co-trimoxazole) to 97.6% (Carbapenems). Complex cases and males had significantly lower odds of being covered by a regimen than non-complex cases and females (odds ratio (OR) 0.49 [95% HDI, 0.38–0.65], and OR: 0.73 [95% HDIs, 0.56–0.96] respectively). Children aged 3–5 years had lower odds of being covered by a regimen than other age groups, except for neonates.

This study unbiasedly characterized the secretory output of mouse placental endocrine cells and examined whether these data could identify placental hormones important for determining pregnancy outcome in humans. Secretome and cell peptidome analyses were performed on cultured primary trophoblast and fluorescence-activated sorted endocrine trophoblasts from mice and a placental secretome map was generated. Proteins secreted from the placenta were detectable in the circulation of mice and showed a higher relative abundance in pregnancy. Bioinformatic analyses showed that placental secretome proteins are involved in metabolic, immune and growth modulation, are largely expressed by human placenta and several are dysregulated in pregnancy complications. Moreover, proof-of-concept studies found that secreted placental proteins (sFLT1/MIF and ANGPT2/MIF ratios) were increased in women prior to diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Thus, placental secretome analysis could lead to the identification of new placental biomarkers of pregnancy complications.","Napso, Tina; Zhao, Xiaohui; Lligoña, Marta Ibañez; Sandovici, Ionel; Kay, Richard G.; George, Amy L.; Gribble, Fiona M.; Reimann, Frank; Meek, Claire L.; Hamilton, Russell S.; Sferruzzi-Perri, Amanda N.",Commun Biol,70,1

Substrate transport with varying stoichiometry and specificity is achieved through an exchange mechanism and/or through coupling of the uptake of anionic substrates to typically co-transported Na(+). Recently solved outward-facing structures of two SLC4 members (human anion exchanger 1 [hAE1] and human electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 [hNBCe1]) with different transport modes (Cl(−)/HCO(3)(−) exchange versus Na(+)-CO(3)(2−) symport) revealed highly conserved three-dimensional organization of their transmembrane domains. However, the exact location of the ion binding sites and their protein–ion coordination motifs are still unclear. In the present work, we combined site identification by ligand competitive saturation mapping and extensive molecular dynamics sampling with functional mutagenesis studies which led to the identification of two substrate binding sites (entry and central) in the outward-facing states of hAE1 and hNBCe1. Mutation of residues in the identified binding sites led to impaired transport in both proteins. We also showed that R730 in hAE1 is crucial for anion binding in both entry and central sites, whereas in hNBCe1, a Na(+) acts as an anchor for CO(3)(2−) binding to the central site. Additionally, protonation of the central acidic residues (E681 in hAE1 and D754 in hNBCe1) alters the ion dynamics in the permeation cavity and may contribute to the transport mode differences in SLC4 proteins. These results provide a basis for understanding the functional differences between hAE1 and hNBCe1 and may facilitate potential drug development for diseases such as proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis.","Zhekova, Hristina R.; Pushkin, Alexander; Kayık, Gülru; Kao, Liyo; Azimov, Rustam; Abuladze, Natalia; Kurtz, Debra; Damergi, Mirna; Noskov, Sergei Yu; Kurtz, Ira",J Biol Chem,70,8

However, to date, vaccination studies in the country have not explicitly focused on CE as an outcome in and of itself. Therefore, this study sought to examine the barriers and enablers of community engagement for vaccination in India. METHODS: Employing qualitative methods, twenty-five semi-structured elite interviews among vaccine decisionmakers’ were triangulated with twenty-four national-level vaccine policy documents and researcher field notes (December 2017 to February 2018). Data collected for this study included perceptions and examples of enablers of and barriers to CE for vaccination uptake. Concepts, such as the absence of formal procedures or data collection approaches related to CE, were confirmed during document review, and a final convening to review study results was conducted with study respondents in December 2018 and January 2019 to affirm the general set of findings from this study. The Social Ecological Model (SEM) was used to organize and interpret the study findings. RESULTS: Although decisionmakers and policy documents generally supported CE, there were more CE barriers than facilitators in the context of vaccination, which were identified at all social-ecological levels. Interviews with vaccine decisionmakers in India revealed complex systemic and structural factors which affect CE for vaccination and are present across each of the SEM levels, from individual to policy. Policy-level enablers included decisionmakers’ political will for CE and policy documents and interviews highlighted social mobilization, whereas barriers were lack of a CE strategy document and a broad understanding of CE by decisionmakers. At the community level, dissemination of Social-behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) materials from the national-level to the states was considered a CE facilitator, while class, and caste-based power relations in the community, lack of family-centric CE strategies, and paternalistic attitude of decisionmakers toward communities (the latter reported by some NGO heads) were considered CE barriers. At the organizational level, partnerships with local organizations were considered CE enablers, while lack of institutionalized support to formalize and incentivize these partnerships highlighted by several decisionmakers, were barriers. At the interpersonal level, SBCC training for healthcare workers, sensitive messaging to communities with low vaccine confidence, and social media messaging were considered CE facilitators. The lack of strategies to manage vaccine related rumors or replicate successful CE interventions during the during the introduction and rollout of new vaccines were perceived as CE barriers by several decisionmakers. CONCLUSION: Data obtained for this study highlighted national-level perceptions of the complexities and challenges of CE across the entire SEM, from individual to systemic levels. Future studies should attempt to associate these enablers and barriers with actual CE outcomes, such as participation or community support in vaccine policy-making, CE implementation for specific vaccines and situations (such as disease outbreaks), or frequency of sub-population-based incidents of community resistance and community facilitation to vaccination uptake. There would likely be value in developing a population-based operational definition of CE, with a step-by-step manual on ‘how to do CE.’ The data from this study also indicate the importance of including CE indicators in national datasets and developing a compendium documenting CE best-practices. Doing so would allow more rigorous analysis of the evidence-base for CE for vaccination in India and other countries with similar immunization programs.","Dutta, Tapati; Agley, Jon; Meyerson, Beth E.; Barnes, Priscilla A.; Sherwood-Laughlin, Catherine; Nicholson-Crotty, Jill",PLoS One,70,22

The chemical reaction of GTP hydrolysis to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) is catalyzed by GTPases, the enzymes, which are responsible for signal transduction in live cells. A small GTPase Arl3, catalyzing the GTP → GDP reaction in complex with the activating protein RP2, constitute an essential part of the human vision cycle. To simulate the reaction mechanism, a model system is constructed by motifs of the crystal structure of the Arl3-RP2 complexed with a substrate analog. After selection of reaction coordinates, energy profiles for elementary steps along the reaction pathway GTP + H(2)O → GDP + Pi are computed using the umbrella sampling and umbrella integration procedures. QM/MM MD calculations are carried out, interfacing the molecular dynamics program NAMD and the quantum chemistry program TeraChem. Ab initio type QM(DFT)/MM potentials are computed with atom-centered basis sets 6-31G** and two hybrid functionals (PBE0-D3 and ωB97x-D3) of the density functional theory, describing a large QM subsystem. Results of these simulations of the reaction mechanism are compared to those obtained with QM/MM calculations on the potential energy surface using a similar description of the QM part. We find that both approaches, QM/MM and QM/MM MD, support the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by GTPases, according to which the catalytic glutamine side chain (Gln71, in this system) actively participates in the reaction. Both approaches distinguish two parts of the reaction: the cleavage of the phosphorus-oxygen bond in GTP coupled with the formation of Pi, and the enzyme regeneration. Newly performed QM/MM MD simulations confirmed the profile predicted in the QM/MM minimum energy calculations, called here the pathway-I, and corrected its relief at the first elementary step from the enzyme–substrate complex. The QM/MM MD simulations also revealed another mechanism at the part of enzyme regeneration leading to pathway-II. Pathway-II is more consistent with the experimental kinetic data of the wild-type complex Arl3-RP2, whereas pathway-I explains the role of the mutation Glu138Gly in RP2 slowing down the hydrolysis rate.","Khrenova, Maria G.; Bulavko, Egor S.; Mulashkin, Fedor D.; Nemukhin, Alexander V.",Molecules,70,8

Results from the cross-sectional studies showed associations between self-employment and poor general mental health and stress, but were inconsistent regarding other mental outcomes. Most studies from South Korea found a higher prevalence of mental disorders among the self-employed compared to employees, whereas the results of cross-sectional studies from outside Asia were less consistent.

Despite implementation efforts, few anxious youth receive CBT. Direct-to-consumer marketing offers a different approach to address the unmet need for youth receiving effective treatments. Involving a local caregiver key opinion leader in direct-to-consumer initiatives may be an effective strategy to increase caregiver demand for CBT. Research indicates that key opinion leaders improve health promotion campaigns, but key opinion leaders have not been studied in the context of increasing caregiver demand for evidence-based treatments. METHOD: Project CHAT (Caregivers Hearing about Anxiety Treatments) will test the role of key opinion leader participation in conducting outreach presentations to increase caregiver desire to seek CBT for their youth’s anxiety. Caregiver attendees (N = 180) will be cluster randomized by school to receive one of two different approaches for presentations on CBT for youth anxiety. Both approaches will involve community outreach presentations providing information on recognizing youth anxiety, strategies caregivers can use to decrease youth anxiety, and how to seek CBT for youth anxiety. The researcher-only condition will be co-facilitated by two researchers. In the key opinion leader condition, a caregiver key opinion leader from each local community will be involved in tailoring the content of the presentation to the context of the community, co-facilitating the presentation with a researcher, and endorsing strategies in the presentation that they have found to be helpful. In line with the theory of planned behavior, caregiver attendees will complete measures assessing their knowledge of, attitudes towards, perceived subjective norms about, and intention to seek CBT pre- and post-presentation; they will indicate whether they sought CBT for their youth at 3-month follow-up. Results will be analyzed using a mixed method approach to assess the effectiveness of a key opinion leader to increase caregiver demand for CBT. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to examine the potential of key opinion leaders to increase caregiver demand for CBT.

It has been shown that making use of the energy-time uncertainty relation from quantum mechanics, one can devise an extension to HMC by allowing the mass matrix to be random with a probability distribution instead of a fixed mass. Furthermore, Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (MHMC) has been recently proposed as an extension to HMC and adds a magnetic field to HMC which results in non-canonical dynamics associated with the movement of a particle under a magnetic field. In this work, we utilise the non-canonical dynamics of MHMC while allowing the mass matrix to be random to create the Quantum-Inspired Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QIMHMC) algorithm, which is shown to converge to the correct steady state distribution.

Whether the chloroplast employs recoding is unknown. I-iota, a plastome mutant of Oenothera (evening primrose), carries a single adenine insertion in an oligoA stretch [11A] of the atpB coding region (encoding the β-subunit of the ATP synthase). The mutation is expected to cause synthesis of a truncated, nonfunctional protein. We report that a full-length AtpB protein is detectable in I-iota leaves, suggesting operation of a recoding mechanism. To characterize the phenomenon, we generated transplastomic tobacco lines in which the atpB reading frame was altered by insertions or deletions in the oligoA motif. We observed that insertion of two adenines was more efficiently corrected than insertion of a single adenine, or deletion of one or two adenines. We further show that homopolymeric composition of the oligoA stretch is essential for recoding, as an additional replacement of AAA lysine codon by AAG resulted in an albino phenotype. Our work provides evidence for the operation of translational recoding in chloroplasts. Recoding enables correction of frameshift mutations and can restore photoautotrophic growth in the presence of a mutation that otherwise would be lethal.","Malinova, Irina; Zupok, Arkadiusz; Massouh, Amid; Schöttler, Mark Aurel; Meyer, Etienne H; Yaneva-Roder, Liliya; Szymanski, Witold; Rößner, Margit; Ruf, Stephanie; Bock, Ralph; Greiner, Stephan",Plant Cell,70,27

Based on the number of isoprene units they have, they are classified as mono, di, tri, tetra, and sesquiterpenes. They are mostly found in plants and form the major constituent of essential oils from plants. Among the natural products that provide medical benefits for an organism, terpenes play a major and variety of roles. The common plant sources of terpenes are tea, thyme, cannabis, Spanish sage, and citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, orange, mandarin). Terpenes have a wide range of medicinal uses among which antiplasmodial activity is notable as its mechanism of action is similar to the popular antimalarial drug in use—chloroquine. Monoterpenes specifically are widely studied for their antiviral property. With growing incidents of cancer and diabetes in modern world, terpenes also have the potential to serve as anticancer and antidiabetic reagents. Along with these properties, terpenes also allow for flexibility in route of administration and suppression of side effects. Certain terpenes were widely used in natural folk medicine. One such terpene is curcumin which holds anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many other properties. Curcumin has also become a recent trend in healthy foods and open doors for several medical researches. This chapter summarizes the various terpenes, their sources, medicinal properties, mechanism of action, and the recent studies that are underway for designing terpenes as a lead molecule in the modern medicine.","Cox-Georgian, Destinney; Ramadoss, Niveditha; Dona, Chathu; Basu, Chhandak",Medicinal Plants,70,1

With the advent of r-DNA technology, it is possible to construct vector with immunologically active genes against specific pathogens. Nevertheless, site-specific delivery of constructed genetic material is an important contributory factor for eliciting specific cellular and humoral immune response. Nanotechnology has demonstrated immense potential for the site-specific delivery of biomolecules. Several polymeric and lipidic nanocarriers have been utilized for the delivery of genetic materials. These systems seem to have better compatibility, low toxicity, economical and capable to delivering biomolecules to intracellular site for the better expression of desired antigens. Further, surface engineering of nanocarriers and targeting approaches have an ability to offer better presentation of antigenic material to immunological cells.

First reports on RNAi emerged in 1998, and since then, it has become one of the most fascinating fields of molecular biology. RNAi has provided important insights about the diversity of RNA molecules and their implication in many biological processes such as the regulation of developmental genes in eukaryotic organisms. Furthermore, RNAi has rapidly developed into a powerful instrument with a great potential for functional genomics and therapeutic applications by silencing normal and disease-related gene functions. To date, the use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. Despite the many unanswered questions on how this technology can be efficiently applied to humans, the development of novel approaches, such as vaccines or novel delivery agents, is certainly one of the major goals in RNAi research.","Diallo, Mustapha; Schmitz, Katja; Schepers, Ute",The Oncogenomics Handbook,70,8

Discussing the challenges of rendering ethnographic data into epidemiological evidence within the context of epistemological entropy, it is argued that epidemiological reasoning developed on the basis of plague ethnographies entailed a two-way process: on the one hand, the ethnographic configuration of plague, as an infectious disease whose decipherment relied on the medical objectification of ethnographic data; and on the other hand, the representation of native societies in terms of being either cultural vectors of or culturally immune to the disease. It is hence argued that, in the case of the north-east Chinese-Russian frontier, this interpretive strategy condemned Mongol and Buryat societies to a static condition of functional unreason. Discussing how this form of ontological and epistemological enclosure continues to inform our postcolonial world, the Conclusion underscores the need for a critical and relational understanding of infectious disease.","Lynteris, Christos",Ethnographic Plague,70,1

Overwhelming sepsis and septic shock often manifest with concurrent derangements of cardiovascular function, intravascular volume status, respiratory function, immune regulation, renal function, coagulation, hepatic function, and metabolic function – sepsis literally affects every organ system to some degree. The degree to which any of these derangements are manifest in a given child is highly variable and influenced by multiple host and pathogen factors, including the child’s developmental stage, the presence or absence of co-morbidities, the host’s immune/inflammatory state, the host’s genetic background, and the specific pathogens involved. These factors combine, in turn, to profoundly influence the ultimate outcome.

These trends bring many benefits to the trading partners involved, but increasing international trade also facilitates the spread of pathogens and increases disease risks. The rapid growth of trade, transport, and travel across national borders has increased the frequency of introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive infectious pathogens (Jones et al. 2008). The development of new trade pathways and the growth in the number and volume of commodities traded increase the likelihood that novel infectious pathogens are introduced to importing or stop-over countries. The growth in trade volumes has increased the risk that introduced pathogens establish and spread, because it has increased the frequency with which infectious pathogens are introduced (Cassey et al. 2004; Dalmazzone 2000; Semmens et al. 2004). Other factors such as the bioclimatic similarities between trading partners, the vulnerability of ecosystems in the importing countries, and risk management policies adopted by both importing and exporting countries also influence the risks of invasive infectious pathogens (Wiens and Graham 2005).","Wang, Qiong; Fenichel, Eli P.; Perrings, Charles A.",Health and Animal Agriculture in Developing Countries,70,12

Contemporary synthetic biology is essentially composed of various “research tribes” with different methods, languages, metaphors and agendas willing to understand biological systems and—in particular—to engineer them for solving health, food, energy and environmental problems. Synthetic biology is not only an extension of traditional genetic engineering where Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are produced, but it is also endowed of various elements that allow the emergence of new artificial life forms. In this chapter, a brief history of synthetic biology is presented, followed by a description of its most prominent “tribes” and a proposition for categorising the various engineering approaches currently practiced in the field. An overview of existing and nascent GMOs is also given, including some of their applications as well as biosafety and biosecurity risks. Finally, some challenges, dilemmas and paradoxes in synthetic biology beyond the bench are very briefly examined, particularly with regard to global social justice, democratization of molecular biology, environmental concerns, policy regulation, the GMO debate, media hype, public acceptance, and the issue of resurrecting extinct life.","Acevedo-Rocha, Carlos G.",Ambivalences of Creating Life,70,1

Different types of SARS-CoV vaccines, including nonreplicative and vectored vaccines, have been developed. Administration of these vaccines to animal model systems has shown promise for the generation of efficacious and safe vaccines. Nevertheless, the identification of side effects, preferentially in the elderly animal models, indicates the need to develop novel vaccines that should be tested in improved animal model systems. Live attenuated viruses have generally proven to be the most effective vaccines against viral infections. A limited number of SARS-CoV attenuating modifications have been described, including mutations, and partial or complete gene deletions affecting the replicase, like the nonstructural proteins (nsp1 or nsp2), or the structural genes, and drastic changes in the sequences that regulate the expression of viral subgenomic mRNAs. A promising vaccine candidate developed in our laboratory was based on deletion of the envelope E gene alone, or in combination with the removal of six additional genes nonessential for virus replication. Viruses lacking E protein were attenuated, grew in the lung, and provided homologous and heterologous protection. Improvements of this vaccine candidate have been directed toward increasing virus titers using the power of viruses with mutator phenotypes, while maintaining the attenuated phenotype. The safety of the live SARS-CoV vaccines is being increased by the insertion of complementary modifications in genes nsp1, nsp2, and 3a, by gene scrambling to prevent the rescue of a virulent phenotype by recombination or remodeling of vaccine genomes based on codon deoptimization using synthetic biology. The newly generated vaccine candidates are very promising, but need to be evaluated in animal model systems that include young and aged animals.","Enjuanes, Luis; Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M.; DeDiego, Marta L.",Replicating Vaccines,70,1

The shortage of influenza vaccine for the 2004–2005 season brought with it the potential for an even higher rate of morbidity and mortality due to influenza. The Infection Control and Healthcare Epidemiology Consortium of a 12-hospital healthcare system located in St. Louis, Missouri, determined that a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan was needed. PROJECT: A team of four infection control practitioners (ICPs) was established from three of the system's hospitals, including a large, metropolitan teaching hospital, a comprehensive pediatric hospital, and a small community hospital, along with three system-level consultants, under the advisement of their medical directors. The team developed a resource packet containing a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan. The packet included a core policy, to be customized by each entity, a checklist of recommended materials to have on hand, and algorithms for influenza testing, patient placement, and healthcare worker immunization. The packet also included an admission screening tool, examples of local health department' line list reports, and educational posters to be used throughout the healthcare facilities to heighten influenza infection prevention awareness. Many of the tools have specific recommendations for different stages of the influenza season; for example, extensive use of rapid diagnostic tests is appropriate early on, but unnecessary during peak flu season when diagnosis can reliably be made based on symptoms. The packet was developed as a guide to assist ICPs in preparing for an influenza season. RESULTS: A resource packet with a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan was developed for all of the system's hospitals. The packet contains information addressing the action to be taken prior to and at the early onset of the influenza season, when there is an increased level of influenza activity, and during a pandemic event. LESSONS LEARNED: Annual influenza outbreaks are a serious threat to U.S. patients. To reduce that threat, it is necessary to carefully plan and prepare for each influenza season. A resource packet with a comprehensive multi-tiered influenza management plan is a useful tool in making the necessary plans and preparations.","Sykora, C.; Jones, M.; Gemeinhart, N.; Woeltje, K.",Am J Infect Control,70,1

The virions are enveloped and bacilliform in shape with rounded ends, where the envelope is studded with prominent peplomers projecting approximately 11 nm from the surface. The nucleocapsids are 20–30 nm in diameter and have a helical symmetry with coil periodicity of 5–7 nm. Long filamentous nucleocapsid precursors occur in the cytoplasm of infected cells and acquire envelopes by budding at endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The virions are sensitive to calcium hypochlorite and sodium dodecyl-sulfate, but sensitivity to other treatments is not known. The virions possess a lipid envelope derived from endoplasmic membranes of host cells. Compared to the genomes of vertebrate nidoviruses, the okavirus genome is unique in that the nucleoprotein gene (ORF2) is located upstream of the glycoprotein gene (ORF3), there is no discrete gene encoding a structural membrane (M) protein, and the virion envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 are generated by proteolysis of a pp3 precursor polyprotein encoded by the ORF3 gene.

The natural history of COPD is punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration in respiratory health termed exacerbations. Exacerbations are responsible for much of the morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with COPD, and also affect the rate of decline in lung function. Most exacerbations are caused by episodes of tracheobronchial infection. The clinical features comprise a worsening in symptoms beyond usual day-to-day variation. Examination may reveal tachypnea and signs of respiratory failure. Pathologically, exacerbations are associated with an increase in airway and systemic inflammation which, at least in more severe disease, is predominantly neutrophilic. Simple investigations are indicated to exclude differential diagnoses and assess exacerbation severity. Treatment aims to support respiratory function whilst drugs aimed at the underlying cause are able to act. The cornerstone of therapy is inhaled bronchodilators, with oral corticosteroids in all but the mildest exacerbations. Antibiotics are indicated if there has been a change in the character of the sputum. Some patients with respiratory failure will require supplemental oxygen or assisted ventilation. Strategies to prevent exacerbations include inhaled corticosteroids, long acting bronchodilators, and influenza vaccination.","Wedzicha, J.A.; Hurst, J.R.",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine,70,1

During replication of the RNA genome there is a high frequency of mutation and recombination, which has given rise to many strains of IBV and results in the potential for new and emerging strains. Currently the live-attenuated vaccine gives poor cross-strain immunity. Effective antiviral agents may therefore be advantageous in the treatment of IBV. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is a potent inhibitor of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus but not RNA viruses. The effect of LiCl on the replication of IBV was examined in cell culture using two model cell types; Vero cells, an African Green monkey kidney-derived epithelial cell line; and DF-1 cells, an immortalized chicken embryo fibroblast cell line. When treated with a range of LiCl concentrations, IBV RNA and protein levels and viral progeny production were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types, and the data indicated that inhibition was a cellular rather than a virucidal effect. Host cell protein synthesis still took place in LiCl-treated cells and the level of a standard cellular housekeeping protein remained unchanged, indicating that the effect of LiCl was specifically against IBV.","Harrison, Sally M.; Tarpey, Ian; Rothwell, Lisa; Kaiser, Pete; Hiscox, Julian A.",Avian Pathol,70,1

The aim of this study was to apply the above technology for the diagnosis of influenza infections and at the same time to differentiate between common flu species between hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital (Iran) between two flu seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018). Different respiratory specimens were collected from 540 patients from a period of December 2016 to May 2018 and were sent to the laboratory for molecular diagnosis. RNAs were extracted and subsequently, a multiplex real time PCR identifying flu A, flu B and typing flu A (H1N1) was carried out. The mean age of patients was 47.54±23.96. 216 (40%) and 321 (60%) of subjects were male and female, respectively. 219 out of 540 (40.5%) were positive for influenza infection including flu A (n=97, 44.3%), flu A (H1N1) (n=45, 20.7%) and flu B (n=77, 35%). Flu A was the dominant species on 2016-2017 and flu B was the major species on 2017-2018. Flu A (H1N1) was comparable in both time periods. Flu infections were most frequently diagnosed in age groups 21-40. Flu-positive patients suffered more from body pain and sore throat than flunegative patients with significant statistical difference (P values <0.001). The mean duration of hospitalization was shorter for flu-positive patients (P value = 0.016). Application of multiplex real time PCR could facilitate the influenza diagnosis in a short period of time, benefiting patients from exclusion of bacterial infections and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Influenza diagnosis was not achieved in up to 60% of flu-like respiratory infections, suggesting the potential benefit of adopting the same methodology for assessing the involvement of other viral or/and bacterial pathogens in those patients.","Azhar, Iman Rezaee; Mohraz, Minoo; Mardani, Masoud; Tavakoli, Mohammad Ali; Afshar, Amin Ehteshami; Zamani, Mohammad; Sadeghpoor, Simin; Safari, Saeid; Dadashpoor, Roozbeh; Rezaee, Mahsa; Shirvani, Fariba; Azimi, Shohreh; Heydarifard, Zahra; Ranjbar, Hamidreza Hagh; Lotfi, Amir Hossain; Mosadegh, Farhad; Hashemnejad, Farhad; Jazayeri, Seyed Mohammad",Infect Dis Rep,70,1

The first part learns the affine transformation and the second part learns the voxelwise nonrigid deformation between the target image and the atlas. We trained this network end-to-end and validated it against a ground truth on synthetic datasets designed to resemble the challenges present in 3D first trimester ultrasound. The method was tested on a dataset of human embryonic ultrasound volumes acquired at 9 weeks gestational age, which showed alignment of the brain in some cases and gave insight in open challenges for the proposed method. We conclude that our method is a promising approach towards fully automated spatial alignment and segmentation of embryonic brains in 3D ultrasound.","Bastiaansen, Wietske A.

In particular, the identification of similarities within and across time series has garnered significant attention and effort over the last few years. For this task, the class of matrix profile algorithms, which create a generic structure that encodes correlations among records and dimensions—the matrix profile—is a promising approach, as it allows simplified post-processing and analysis steps by examining the resulting matrix profile structure. However, it is expensive to create a matrix profile: it requires significant computational power to evaluate the distance among all subsequence pairs in a time series, especially for very long and multi-dimensional time series with a large dimensionality. Existing approaches are limited in their scalability, as they do not target High Performance Computing systems, and—for most realistic problems—are suited only for datasets with a small dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a novel MPI-based approach for the calculation of a matrix profile for multi-dimensional time series that pushes these limits. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using an analytical performance model combined with experimental data. Finally, we demonstrate our solution on a 128-dimensional time series dataset of 1 million records, solving 274 trillion sorts at a sustained 1.3 Petaflop/s performance on the SuperMUC-NG system.","Raoofy, Amir; Karlstetter, Roman; Yang, Dai; Trinitis, Carsten; Schulz, Martin",High Performance Computing,70,8

Within computational neuroscience there is growing interest in the inverse problem of inferring NPM parameters from recordings such as the EEG (Electroencephalogram). Uncertainty quantification is essential in this application area in order to infer the mechanistic effect of interventions such as anaesthesia. This paper presents [Image: see text] software for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in the parameters of NPMs from approximately stationary data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Modern MCMC methods require first order (and in some cases higher order) derivatives of the posterior density. The software presented offers two distinct methods of evaluating derivatives: finite differences and exact derivatives obtained through Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). For AD, two different implementations are used: the open source Stan Math Library and the commercially licenced [Image: see text] tool distributed by NAG (Numerical Algorithms Group). The use of derivative information in MCMC sampling is demonstrated through a simple example, the noise-driven harmonic oscillator. And different methods for computing derivatives are compared. The software is written in a modular object-oriented way such that it can be extended to derivative based MCMC for other scientific domains.","Maybank, Philip; Peltzer, Patrick; Naumann, Uwe; Bojak, Ingo",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,70,17

Bayesian Matrix Factorization (BMF) algorithms would be attractive because of their ability to quantify uncertainty in their predictions and avoid over-fitting, combined with high prediction accuracy. However, they have not been widely used on large-scale data because of their prohibitive computational cost. In recent work, efforts have been made to reduce the cost, both by improving the scalability of the BMF algorithm as well as its implementation, but so far mainly separately. In this paper we show that the state-of-the-art of both approaches to scalability can be combined. We combine the recent highly-scalable Posterior Propagation algorithm for BMF, which parallelizes computation of blocks of the matrix, with a distributed BMF implementation that users asynchronous communication within each block. We show that the combination of the two methods gives substantial improvements in the scalability of BMF on web-scale datasets, when the goal is to reduce the wall-clock time.","Vander Aa, Tom; Qin, Xiangju; Blomstedt, Paul; Wuyts, Roel; Verachtert, Wilfried; Kaski, Samuel",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,70,1

Rarely, the disease takes a fulminant acute course due to the development of necrotizing amebic colitis. This complication is usually found in adult patients. However, on the contrary, this case was diagnosed in a 9-year-old patient. He was transferred to the Sirimavo Bandaranayake Specialized Children’s Hospital (SBSCH), Peradeniya from the District General Hospital, Kilinochchi. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this rare complication in a child in Sri Lanka. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of acute fulminant necrotizing amebic colitis in a 9-year-old boy. Surgical exploration revealed extensive ulceration and multiple perforations in the entire colon. PAS-Martius Yellow 40 stain highlighted amebae with erythrophagocytosis within the necrotic debris of the ulcers. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that was conducted to confirm the diagnosis was positive for Entameba histolytica. The post-operative course was marked with antimicrobial treatment for septicemia and the need for ventilator assistance. Antimicrobial treatment included intravenous metronidazole. The patient progressively recovered and was discharged on a normal diet. CONCLUSION: This case reports an acute fulminant necrotizing amebic colitis in a 9-year-old patient. After the treatments, the patient progressively recovered and was discharged on a normal diet. E. histolytica infections in northern Sri Lanka should be given attention as a public health concern. Furthermore, this case highlights that acute fulminant amebic colitis requires early surgical intervention, aggressive supportive and anti-amebic treatments. Clinicians should be cognizant of this potentially fatal complication of amebic colitis.","Kiriwaththuduwa, Samantha; Gnanapragasam, Romola; Amarasinghe, Anjalie; Adikari, Yugantha; Ranasinghe, Shanika; Morel, Rumala; Dharmaratne, Chanuka; Bandara, Lakmalee",Ann Pediatr Surg,70,1

In previous studies, the development of parkinsonian network dynamics modeling has made great progress. Modeling mainly focuses on the cortex-thalamus-basal ganglia (CTBG) circuit and its sub-circuits, which helps to explore the dynamic behavior of the parkinsonian network, such as synchronization. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective strategy for the treatment of PD. At present, many studies are based on the side effects of the DBS. However, the translation from modeling results to clinical disease mitigation therapy still faces huge challenges. Here, we introduce the progress of DBS improvement. Its specific purpose is to develop novel DBS treatment methods, optimize the treatment effect of DBS for each patient, and focus on the study in closed-loop DBS. Our goal is to review the inspiration and insights gained by combining the system theory with these computational models to analyze neurodynamics and optimize DBS treatment.","Yu, Ying; Wang, Xiaomin; Wang, Qishao; Wang, Qingyun",Appl Math Mech,70,33

METHODS: Respiratory inductance plethysmography values were used construct pressure–volume loops during the lung volume optimization maneuver. The maneuver outcome was evaluated by three independent investigators and labeled positive if there was an increase in respiratory inductance plethysmography values at the end of the incremental phase. Metrics for oxygenation (SpO(2), FiO(2)), proximal pressure amplitude, tidal volume and transcutaneous measured pCO(2) (p(tc)CO(2)) obtained during the incremental phase were compared between outcome maneuvers labeled positive and negative to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Ventilation efficacy was assessed during and after the maneuver by measuring arterial pH and PaCO(2). Hemodynamic responses during and after the maneuver were quantified by analyzing heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure and arterial lactate. RESULTS: 41/54 patients (75.9%) had a positive maneuver albeit that changes in respiratory inductance plethysmography values were very heterogeneous. During the incremental phase of the maneuver, metrics for oxygenation and tidal volume showed good sensitivity (> 80%) but poor sensitivity. The sensitivity of the SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased to 92.7% one hour after the maneuver. The proximal pressure amplitude showed poor sensitivity during the maneuver, whereas tidal volume showed good sensitivity but poor specificity. PaCO(2) decreased and pH increased in patients with a positive and negative maneuver outcome. No new barotrauma or hemodynamic instability (increase in age-adjusted heart rate, decrease in age-adjusted mean arterial blood pressure or lactate > 2.0 mmol/L) occurred as a result of the maneuver. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of improvements in oxygenation during a lung volume optimization maneuver did not indicate that there were no increases in lung volume quantified using respiratory inductance plethysmography. Increases in SpO(2)/FiO(2) one hour after the maneuver may suggest ongoing lung volume recruitment. Ventilation was not impaired and there was no new barotrauma or hemodynamic instability. The heterogeneous responses in lung volume changes underscore the need for monitoring tools during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.","de Jager, Pauline; Burgerhof, Johannes G.

This study aimed to investigate the anxiolytic-like effects of Urena lobata L. (MEUL) methanolic extract in different behavioral paradigms in Swiss albino mice. For this, after an oral acute toxicity study, adult male mice were treated with MEUL (250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) and/or diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.), and subjected to a number of behavioral studies. In the open-field test, the number of square field cross, grooming, and rearing, was counted, while in the light/dark and swing test, the time spent in the dark portion and number of swings was calculated, respectively. Additionally, the phytochemical analysis was also done. Results reveal that the MEUL possesses alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, terpenes (including triterpenes), gums, and reducing sugars. MEUL showed a significant (p < 0.05) anxiolytic-like effect in experimental animals, where it’s dose-dependently modulated the test parameters in an open-field test. The MEUL also increased the light residence time and the number of swings in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of 500 mg/kg of MEUL caused the highest calming effect when combined with the experimental animals’ diazepam group. Taken together, findings expand an understanding of the impact of U. lobata on the central nervous system and show that this plant may be useful for the treatment of disorders associated with anxiety.","Islam, Muhammad Torequl; Riaz, Thoufiqul Alam; Ayatollahi, Seyed Abdulmajid; Sharifi-Rad, Javad",Clin Phytosci,70,11

In the era of COVID-19, 3D food printing becomes an important turning point for non-face-to-face business and personalized business. 3D food printing is a technology that enables direct production of small quantities using 3D digital design and personalized nutrition data. However, the current development stage of 3D food printing technology is only at the level of making a product with a simple form or only one material, and separate material processing is required to reach an appropriate level of print quality due to the printing characteristics of various food groups [1]. In addition, there are not enough structured data available for learning, and no prior development and indicators have been developed for standard composite materials that can be applied to various foods to reach printability. In this paper, we use AI machine learning to obtain adequate print quality in 3D food printing. We study supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning of AI machine learning, and design algorithms. In AI machine learning unsupervised learning, conformity and non-conformity are determined, and the result of the derived standard composite material value is applied to papers to evaluate printing adequacy.

Student evaluations are important to university professors to improve their teaching quality and in many cases, secure their promotion and tenureship. Excellent teaching does not have a universal definition, and students often have different perspectives on effective and excellent teaching. In this study, we examined the factors contributing to excellent teaching as rated by students on the website ratemyprofessors.com, a popular website among students to rate their educators voluntarily. The information from this website can be valuable, despite all the critics it has received, given that students provide feedback on a volunteer basis to help their peers with selecting the best class. The website provides a forum for opinions that are not influenced by fear of possible consequences, such as a low grade or tension with faculty. Our study results show that the five top characteristics that are important to students include being caring, respectful, inspirational, as well as giving good feedback, and delivering “amazing” lectures. Further data analysis shows that subject content, in terms of manageable workload, reasonable content difficulty, and grading, can influence students' ratings. The findings indicate that students value interpersonal relationships and cherish individualized feedback and receiving personal support.","Saidi, Ladan Ghazi; Vu, Phu",SN Soc Sci,70,33

ECT using antitumor drugs such as bleomycin and cisplatin is a minimally invasive targeted therapy that can be used as an alternative for oncologic patients not eligible for surgery or other standard therapies. Even though ECT is mainly applied as palliative care for metastases, it may also be used for primary tumors that are unresectable due to size and location. Skin neoplasms are the main clinical indication of ECT, the procedure reporting good curative results and high efficiency across all tumor types, including melanoma. In daily practice, there are many cases in which the patient’s quality of life can be significantly improved by a safe procedure such as ECT. Its popularity must be increased because it has a safe profile and minor local adverse reactions. The method can be used by dermatologists, oncologists, and surgeons. The aim of this paper is to review recent literature concerning electrochemotherapy and other clinical applications of electroporation for the targeted therapy of metastatic melanoma.","Cucu, Corina Ioana; Giurcăneanu, Călin; Popa, Liliana Gabriela; Orzan, Olguța Anca; Beiu, Cristina; Holban, Alina Maria; Grumezescu, Alexandru Mihai; Matei, Bogdan Mircea; Popescu, Marius Nicolae; Căruntu, Constantin; Mihai, Mara Mădălina",Materials (Basel),70,1

Main funding source(s): St Barts NHS Trust INTRODUCTION: The advent of portable hand-held devices to record an electrocardiogram (ECG) in-clinic, has the potential to streamline patient assessment in many clinical environments. These ECG technologies are able to record one to six lead ECGs and enable rapid responses to clinical situations. These devices may also have a role in reducing interdepartmental movement of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, by facilitating a one-stop shop for clinical evaluation. However despite their benefit, they can be more prone to artefact than a 12-lead ECG. PURPOSE: To describe the currently available hand-held ECG technologies, their ease of use and diagnostic accuracy for rhythm assessment. METHOD: An online review was conducted to identify new ECG technologies. Clinical colleagues were also surveyed for recommendations with respect to specifications, availability of alternative products, and informed of the inclusion /exclusion criteria. The review included devices which had built-in abnormal rhythm notification or display, were cost-effective and easy to use. Devices were automatically excluded if cutaneous skin electrodes were required, no in-built ECG display or notification, additional data transfer required to access ECG data or a high unit cost. RESULTS: An initial search uncovered nine devices, with five meeting inclusion /exclusion criteria. These devices were tabulated and compared predefined criteria (See table 1: ECG Technology comparisons). The analysis revealed that all devices utilised two finger placement on their recording electrodes to produce immediate ECG results – no cutaneous ECG application required. The KardiaMobile 6L™ had the largest number of beneficial features, namely multi-channel device, QTc interpretation, rapid diagnosis time and low cost. The intended use of hand-held devices is to detect AF. Four of five devices produced a snapshot ECG for rhythm identification on their display. However, AfibAlert™ devices provided an instant light alert if atrial fibrillation (AF) was detected. Instant check™, Dimitek™ and AfibAlert™ benefit from being complete stand-alone devices. In contrast, KardioMobile devices have a built-in ECG display for instant review however, they require a smart phone or tablet to store and transfer the data. These devices support a reliable internal AF algorithm to obtain a high negative predicted value to safely rule out AF. Frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) are often difficult to distinguish from AF and can lead to high false-positive rate. Hand-held devices are prone to artefact, however accurate visual assessment able to significantly reduce the amount of ECGs deemed uninterpretable. CONCLUSIONS: Hand-held ECG technology has potential to become a useful, cost-effective tool during patient consultations, with rapid identification of clinically important arrhythmias. However, limitations exist across providers. A pilot trial of these devices is planned to assess further.","Collins, MC; Elliott, EE; Stain, NS; Malcolmson, JM; Monkhouse, CM",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,70,1

Whilst challenges for knowledge and clinical skills are being actively addressed, wider considerations such as the impact on professional identity development have been mostly neglected thus far. A robust professional identity is linked to professional behaviour and has been shown to reduce burnout and be an important factor for general practice career choice amongst medical students. The Communities of Practice Model is a sociocultural approach that conceptualises the formation of professional identity through student engagement within a community. We argue the current suspension of clinical placements holds the potential to negatively influence such identity acquisition. In this commentary we explore how the Communities of Practice Model may inform professional identity development of medical students within the COVID-19 environment, considering digital communities and volunteering roles within primary care. We further encourage educators and institutions to consider professional identity in future planning to address the challenges posed by the current situation, both in terms of placement loss but also changes in the way primary care is delivered. Such considerations will be essential if we are to avoid problems relating to poor medical student professional identity development in future.","Cullum, Rob J; Shaughnessy, Aaron; Mayat, Nabilah Y; Brown, Megan El","Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors",70,16

METHODS Between March and December 2013, the Apollo 1.5 cm detachable tip microcatheter was used in five patients after being approved by both the Food and Drug Administration and the institutional review board as a compassionate use device. Nine pedicles were embolized and the follow-up ranged from 1 to 3 months. RESULTS Five of the nine catheter tips detached. The length of reflux was not directly associated with the detachment of the distal tip. There were no cases of premature microcatheter detachment during navigation, manipulation with multiple microguidewire reintroduction and guidance. There was no leak of embolic agent at the detachment zone. Follow-up showed the detached tip to be stable without migration. CONCLUSIONS A detachable tip microcatheter offers an advance in the safety and effectiveness of nBCA embolization. Catheter retrieval becomes more controlled and less traumatic.

Excessive AMPAR activation leads to diseases such as epilepsy. AMPAR properties are modulated by auxiliary proteins and foremost by the Transmembrane AMPAR Regulatory Proteins (TARPs). These distribute in unique expression patterns across the brain, rendering AMPAR/TARP complexes promising targets for region-specific therapeutic intervention. TARP 𝛾8 is predominantly expressed in the forebrain and is enriched in the hippocampus, a region associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Recent high-throughput medicinal chemistry screens have identified multiple promising compounds that selectively target AMPARs associated with 𝛾8 and hold promise for epilepsy treatment. However, how these modulators target the receptor complex is currently unknown. Here, we use a combination of ligand docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and electrophysiology to address this question. We identify a conserved oxindole isostere, shared between three structurally diverse modulators (LY-3130481, JNJ-55511118 and JNJ-61432059) as the major module engaging 𝛾8 by an H-bond to N172 (𝛾8). The remaining variable region of each molecule likely targets the receptor complex in ligand-selective modes. Functional data reveal parallels in the underlying modulatory action of two prominent compounds. This work will aid development of refined AMPAR epilepsy therapeutics, and facilitate to uncover the mechanisms by which TARPs modulate the receptor.","Dohrke, Jan-Niklas; Watson, Jake F; Birchall, Kristian; Greger, Ingo H",The Journal of biological chemistry,70,7

However, the exact molecular mechanism of SFJDC remains unclear. The present study aims to determine the potential pharmacological mechanisms of SFJDC in the treatment of COVID-19 based on network pharmacology. METHODS The network pharmacology-based strategy includes collection and analysis of active compounds and target genes, network construction, identification of key compounds and hub target genes, KEGG and GO enrichment, recognition and analysis of main modules, as well as molecule docking. RESULTS A total of 214 active chemical compounds and 339 target genes of SFJDC were collected. Of note, 5 key compounds ( β -sitosterol, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin, and stigmasterol) and 10 hub target genes (TP53, AKT1, NCOA1, EGFR, PRKCA, ANXA1, CTNNB1, NCOA2, RELA and FOS) were identified based on network analysis. The hub target genes mainly enriched in pathways including MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and cAMP signaling pathway, which could be the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of SFJDC for treating COVID-19. Moreover, the key compounds had high binding activity with three typical target genes. CONCLUSIONS By network pharmacology analysis, SFJDC was found to effectively improve immune function and reduce inflammatory responses based on its key compounds, hub target genes, and the relevant pathways. These findings may provide valuable evidence for explaining how SFJDC exerting the therapeutic effects on COVID-19, providing a holistic view for further clinical application.","Zhuang, Zhenjie; Zhong, Xiaoying; Zhang, Huanhuan; Chen, Huiqi; Huang, Boxiang; Lin, Dongqun; Wen, Junmao",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,70,17

Additionally, ongoing multi-targeted therapies are limited only for few carcinogenesis pathways, due to continually emerging and evolving mutations of proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressive genes. CRISPR/Cas9, as a specific gene-editing tool, is used to correct causative mutations with minimal toxicity, but is also employed as an adjuvant to immunotherapy to achieve a more robust immunological response. Some of the most critical limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology include off-target mutations, resulting in nonspecific restrictions of DNA upstream of the Protospacer Adjacent Motifs (PAM), ethical agreements, and the lack of a scientific consensus aiming at risk evaluation. Currently, CRISPR/Cas9 is tested on animal models to enhance genome editing specificity and induce a stronger anti-tumor response.

There are no systematic methods by which to track adherence to quality measures for ERCP, the highest risk endoscopic procedure widely used in practice. Our aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of using NLP to measure adherence to ERCP quality indicators across individual providers. METHODS ERCPs performed by 6 providers at a single institution from 2006 to 2014 were identified. Quality measures were defined using society guidelines and from expert opinion, and then extracted using a combination of NLP and data mining (eg, ICD9-CM codes). Validation for each quality measure was performed by manual record review. Quality measures were grouped into preprocedure (5), intraprocedure (6), and postprocedure (2). NLP was evaluated using measures of precision and accuracy. RESULTS A total of 23,674 ERCPs were analyzed (average patient age, 52.9 ± 17.8 years, 14,113 were women [59.6%]). Among 13 quality measures, precision of NLP ranged from 84% to 100% with intraprocedure measures having lower precision (84% for precut sphincterotomy). Accuracy of NLP ranged from 90% to 100% with intraprocedure measures having lower accuracy (90% for pancreatic stent placement). CONCLUSIONS NLP in conjunction with data mining facilitates individualized tracking of ERCP providers for quality metrics without the need for manual medical record review. Incorporation of these tools across multiple centers may permit tracking of ERCP quality measures through national registries.","Imler, Timothy D; Sherman, Stuart; Imperiale, Thomas F; Xu, Huiping; Ouyang, Fangqian; Beesley, Christopher; Hilton, Charity; Coté, Gregory A",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,70,7

RECENT FINDINGS Migrants may import parasitic infections acquired in their countries of origin. Increasingly, clinicians in nonendemic regions are faced with patients with neglected diseases such as Chagas disease, malaria and strongyloidiasis. There are gaps in knowledge among physicians in nonendemic regions, which lead to missed opportunities for preventive strategies and early treatment. Both primary care and infectious disease physicians should have a broad knowledge of common parasitic infections to improve health outcomes and decrease healthcare disparities through early identification and treatment of disease encountered in migrants. SUMMARY Migrant health is still a young field in medicine; clinicians should be aware of diseases seen in migrants, and access both educational and clinical resources, including experts in tropical medicine, in order to reduce health disparities among migrants. Collaboration between primary care and infectious disease/tropical medicine experts should be strengthened.","Berto, Cesar G; Coyle, Christina M; Friedman, Lianna; Walker, Patricia F",Current opinion in infectious diseases,70,33

Here, we combine several instantiations of this (epidemic) model to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity-and the exchange of people between regions-and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.","Friston, Karl J; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Oliver J; Billig, Alexander J; Litvak, Vladimir; Price, Catherine J; Moran, Rosalyn J; Lambert, Christian",Wellcome open research,70,19

However, its 2012 survey found that the recurrence rate had increased to 4% for the transabdominal preperitoneal procedure and 5% for the totally extraperitoneal procedure. We held 14 hernia repair training courses from 2011 to 2016 with help from Covidien. This study aimed to determine the effect of this training on the recurrence rate. METHODS Training was composed of a theoretical revision of inguinal anatomy, dry laboratory suturing, a video lecture, and practice on an animal model. We made inquiries about the length of each surgeon's career, post-training changes in surgical methods, and recurrence rates before and after training. RESULTS We received responses from 159 of 300 trainees (53%). The mean career length was 12.7 ± 8.2 years. The annual number of transabdominal preperitoneal procedures performed increased from 20.9 ± 29.9 to 32.4 ± 56.1 after training (P < 0.001), and the number of totally extraperitoneal procedures increased from 9.5 ± 13.9 to 13.9 ± 16.9 (P = 0.0218). The annual number of procedures performed via the anterior approach decreased from 153.1 ± 28.4 to 28.4 ± 52.2 after training (P < 0.001). The pre-training transabdominal preperitoneal procedure recurrence rate was 0.9%, and this decreased to 0.4% after training. There was no pre-training recurrence rate for the totally extraperitoneal procedure, but this was 0.4% after training. CONCLUSION The high recurrence rate after inguinal hernia repair in Japan was mainly due to inadequate training in the laparoscopic method. Our laparoscopic hernia repair training course achieved low recurrence rates.","Matsumoto, Sumio; Hayakawa, Tetsushi; Kawarada, Yoh; Uchida, Kazunori; Eguchi, Tohru; Wada, Hidetoshi; Ueno, Nozomi; Idani, Hitoshi; Nakano, Kanyu; Oomomo, Yoshiyuki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,70,17

Alveolar haemorrhage, for example following primary blast lung injury (PBLI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), results in the escape of erythrocytes (RBCs) into alveolar spaces, where they subsequently lyse and release their intracellular contents. However, the inflammatory effects of RBCs in the airways are not fully understood. We hypothesized that RBCs in the airway induce an inflammatory response, associated with platelet activation. By instilling whole RBCs or lysed RBCs into the airways of mice, we have demonstrated that whole RBCs elicit macrophage accumulation in the lung. However, lysed RBCs induce significant inflammatory cell recruitment, particularly neutrophils and this was associated with a 50% increase in circulating platelet neutrophil complexes (PNCs). Platelet depletion prior to lysed RBC exposure in the lung resulted in reduced neutrophil recruitment, suggesting that the presence of intracellular RBC components in the airways can elicit inflammation that is platelet dependent. To identify specific platelet dependent signalling pathways involved in neutrophil recruitment, anti-P-selectin ligand and anti-PSGL1 blocking antibodies were tested, however neither affected neutrophil recruitment. These findings implicate an involvement for other, as yet unidentified platelet-dependent signalling and adhesion mechanisms. Further understanding of how platelets contribute to lung inflammation induced by the presence of RBCs could offer novel therapeutic approaches to attenuate inflammation that occurs in conditions associated with alveolar haemorrhage.","Arnold, Stephanie; Shah, Sajeel A; Cleary, Simon J; OʼShaughnessy, Blaze G; Amison, Richard T; Arkless, Kate; Page, Clive P; Pitchford, Simon C",Shock,70,1

The objective of this study was to evaluate both the concentration and depth of the penetration of cisplatin in human lung tissue after hyperthermic exposure under ex vivo conditions. METHODS This experimental study was approved by the local ethics committee. Twelve patients underwent pulmonary wedge resections after elective thoracic lobectomies were performed (resected lobe), and the lung tissue (approximately 1-2 cm(3)) was incubated (in vitro) with cisplatin (0.05 mg/ml; 60 min, 42°C). Subsequent tissue beds (depth, 0.5 mm; median weight, 70-92 mg) were prepared from the outside to the middle, and the amount of cisplatin per tissue weight was analysed using atomic absorption spectrometry. Afterwards, the penetration of cisplatin depth was calculated and related to the different concentrations per tissue. RESULTS Cisplatin penetrated into the human lung tissue after ex vivo hyperthermic exposure. The median amount of platinum [nmol cisplatin/g lung tissue] decreased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) depending on the penetration depth: 32 nmol/g (1 mm), 20 nmol/g (2 mm) and 6.8 nmol/g (4 mm). The calculated median concentrations of cisplatin (µg/ml) were 2.4 µg/ml (1 mm), 1.4 µg/ml (2 mm) and 0.5 µg/ml (4 mm), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Under ex vivo hyperthermic conditions, cisplatin diffused into human lung tissue. The median penetration depth of the cisplatin was approximately 3-4 mm. The penetration of cisplatin into lung tissue may affect the local therapy of residual tumour cells on the lung surface using hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy perfusion in patients with malignant pleural tumours.","Ried, Michael; Lehle, Karla; Neu, Reiner; Diez, Claudius; Bednarski, Patrick; Sziklavari, Zsolt; Hofmann, Hans-Stefan",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,70,7

We show how the momentous events set in motion by the COVID-19 virus, and the structural drivers of inequity and racism that its spread exposed, challenge mental health research on gun trauma to better account for broader terrains of race and place, as well as the tensions, politics, and assumptions that surround guns in the U.S. more broadly. Doing so will broaden mental-health interventions into epidemics of U.S. gun trauma, and challenge mental health research better recognize structural biases inherent in its own purview. We frame the agenda through the rubric of structural competency, an emerging framework that systematically trains health care professionals and others to recognize ways that institutions, neighborhood conditions, market forces, public policies, and health care delivery systems shape symptoms and diseases. Developing a structural framework around research into U.S. gun violence addresses the risks, traumas, meanings, and consequences that firearms represent for all communities-and highlights the importance of a renewed focus on mental health and safety for communities of color. Recognizing how gun violence reflects and encapsulates structures helps mental health experts address common sense gun policies within broader contexts-by fighting against structural racism or racially inflected gun policies for instance, or against economic policies that undermine access to mental health care more broadly.","Metzl, Jonathan M; McKay, Tara; Piemonte, Jennifer L",Social science & medicine,70,26

However, the incidence and clinical relevance of this relation remain unclear. OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the incidence, severity and clinical impact of acute pancreatitis in patients with COVID-19. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study of a prospective, observational cohort concerning all COVID-19 patients admitted to two Dutch university hospitals between 4 March 2020 and 26 May 2020. Primary outcome was acute pancreatitis potentially related to COVD-19 infection. Acute pancreatitis was defined according to the revised Atlanta Classification. Potential relation with COVID-19 was defined as the absence of a clear aetiology of acute pancreatitis. RESULTS Among 433 patients with COVID-19, five (1.2%) had potentially related acute pancreatitis according to the revised Atlanta Classification. These five patients suffered from severe COVID-19 infection; all had (multiple) organ failure and 60% died. None of the patients developed necrotizing pancreatitis. Moreover, development of acute pancreatitis did not lead to major treatment consequences. CONCLUSIONS In contrast with previous research, our study demonstrated that COVID-19 related acute pancreatitis is rare and of little clinical impact. It is therefore debatable if acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients requires specific screening. We hypothesize that acute pancreatitis occurs in patients with severe illness due to COVID-19 infection as a result of transient hypoperfusion and pancreatic ischemia, not as a direct result of the virus.","Bulthuis, Margo C; Boxhoorn, Lotte; Beudel, Martijn; Elbers, Paul W G; Kop, Marnix P M; van Wanrooij, Roy L J; Besselink, Marc G; Voermans, Rogier P",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,70,1

Currently, GL is used to treat hepatitis and allergic disease worldwide because of its anti-viral and anti-allergy effects. In addition to these prominent functions, GL likely regulates cellular functions such as tumor cell growth and cellular immunity. However, how GL affects the keratinocyte inflammation response remains poorly understood. The current paper investigates the effect of GL on psoriasis and explores the mechanisms involved. METHODS We used an in vitro cell model of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced keratinocyte inflammation and the topical application of imiquimod (IMQ) using an animal model (mouse skin) of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation (IPI) to investigate the effect of GL on skin inflammation. Cell viability was analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8). Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling was used to trace monocyte adherence to keratinocytes. A Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. A modified version of the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) was used to monitor disease severity. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to observe pathological changes. An immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was used to detect ICAM-1 expression in mouse skin. RESULTS GL treatment significantly reduced the levels of ICAM-1 in TNF-α-stimulated HaCaT cells, inhibited subsequent monocyte adhesion to keratinocytes, and suppressed the nuclear translation and phosphorylation of p65 following the degradation of inhibitor κB (IκB). GL treatment blocked the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/p38 MAPK. GL effectively delayed the onset of IPI in mice and ameliorated ongoing IPI, thereby reducing ICAM-1 expression in epidermal tissues. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that GL treatment ameliorates skin inflammation by inhibiting ICAM-1 expression via interference with the ERK/p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in keratinocytes. Therefore, GL can be used as an anti-psoriasis drug.","Xiong, Hui; Xu, Ying; Tan, Guozhen; Han, Yanfang; Tang, Zengqi; Xu, Wenying; Zeng, Fanqin; Guo, Qing","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",70,1

The purpose of this study is to report our initial experience of a double-lumen balloon catheter for the treatment of wide-necked aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen patients (mean age, 63 years; range, 45-80 years) with wide-necked, with or without a branch-incorporated aneurysms, (10 ruptured and 9 unruptured) were treated with balloon-assisted coil embolization using a double-lumen balloon catheter (Scepter C™ or Scepter XC™) for 7 months after being introduced to our country. Locations of the aneurysms were posterior communicating artery (n = 7), anterior communicating artery or A2 (n = 7), middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation (n = 3), basilar artery tip (n = 1) and anterior choroidal artery (n = 1). The initial clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS Coil embolization was successfully completed in all 19 aneurysms, resulting in complete occlusions (n = 18) or residual neck (n = 1). In one procedure, a thrombus formation was detected at the neck portion of the ruptured MCA bifurcation aneurysm near to the end of the procedure. It was completely resolved with an intra-arterial infusion of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Tirofiban, 1.0 mg) without any clinical sequela. There were no treatment-related events in the remaining 18 aneurysms. At discharge, functional neurological state improved in 11 patients (10 patients with ruptured aneurysm and 1 with unruptured aneurysm presenting with mass symptoms) and 6 patients with unruptured aneurysms had no newly developed symptoms. CONCLUSION In this preliminary case series, the newly developed double-lumen Scepter balloon appears to be a safe and convenient device for coil embolization of wide-necked aneurysms.","Rho, Myung Ho; Kim, Byung Moon; Suh, Sang Hyun; Kim, Dong Joon; Kim, Dong Ik",Korean journal of radiology,70,31

The epidemiology and determinant of NSSI have not been studied extensively in Iran. Thus, this longitudinal study sought to investigate the prevalence, incidence and contributing factors of NSSI among adolescents in Iran. This study was conducted at high school students aged 14-18 years old in the metropolitan city of Tabriz, located in north western Iran. Data were collected from 6229 10th-grade students at two time-points, with 12 months interval in October and November 2017 and 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic, NSSI and cigarette and hookah smoking from the study participants. The results showed that lifetime prevalence of NSSI among students was 6.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.7 to 6.9) at the first assessment. Scratching and hair pulling were the most and least common methods of self-injury, respectively. Over the one year, 206 students (3.6% CI 95%: 3.1-4.1) reported the onset of NSSI. Tobacco smoking and previous year average grade were related to the incidence of NSSI. Although gender was significantly associated with the prevalence of NSSI, the relationship between gender and incidence of NSSI was not significant. Although the prevalence of NSSI was low among adolescents, the incidence rate was considerable. Further studies are required to understand the risk factors of NSSI in Iran.","Marin, Soudabeh; Hajizadeh, Mohammad; Sahebihagh, Mohammad Hassan; Nemati, Hossein; Ataeiasl, Maryam; Anbarlouei, Masoumeh; Pashapour, Hadi; Mahmoodi, Mahbobeh; Mohammadpoorasl, Asghar",The Psychiatric quarterly,70,10

Methodology. Various causes were identified from the investigation report based on a proposed accident causation model (ACM) which provides a universal pathway for accident analysis from the individual level to the organizational level. Results. The driver's error in an emergency affected by the fatigue and speeding led to the crash directly. Accordingly, drivers in the coach should be monitored effectively and their unsafe acts must be corrected timely in case of the formation of unsafe habits. Based on individual flaws, weaknesses in the construction of organizational safety management system and safety culture were further deduced and discussed. Conclusion. The work and rest system, as well as the dynamic monitoring system for drivers should be perfected strictly according to the regulations. Additionally, external factors regarding deficiencies in the design and management of the expressway and the supervision for the transportation company also had great impacts on this crash.

Among several suggested mechanisms, the fragmentation of primary intermetallics by acoustic cavitation is regarded as very efficient. However, the physical process causing this fragmentation has received little attention and is not yet well understood. In this study, we evaluate the mechanical properties of primary Al3Zr intermetallics by nano-indentation experiments and correlate those with in-situ high-speed imaging (of up to 1 Mfps) of their fragmentation process by laser-induced cavitation (single bubble) and by acoustic cavitation (cloud of bubbles) in water. Intermetallic crystals were chemically extracted from an Al-3 wt% Zr alloy matrix. Mechanical properties such as hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness of the extracted intermetallics were determined using a geometrically fixed Berkovich nano-diamond and cube corner indenter, under ambient temperature conditions. The studied crystals were then exposed to the two cavitation conditions mentioned. Results demonstrated for the first time that the governing fragmentation mechanism of the studied intermetallics was due to the emitted shock waves from the collapsing bubbles. The fragmentation caused by a single bubble collapse was found to be almost instantaneous. On the other hand, sono-fragmentation studies revealed that the intermetallic crystal initially underwent low cycle fatigue loading, followed by catastrophic brittle failure due to propagating shock waves. The observed fragmentation mechanism was supported by fracture mechanics and pressure measurements using a calibrated fibre optic hydrophone. Results showed that the acoustic pressures produced from shock wave emissions in the case of a single bubble collapse, and responsible for instantaneous fragmentation of the intermetallics, were in the range of 20-40 MPa. Whereas, the shock pressure generated from the acoustic cavitation cloud collapses surged up to 1.6 MPa inducing fatigue stresses within the crystal leading to eventual fragmentation.","Priyadarshi, Abhinav; Khavari, Mohammad; Subroto, Tungky; Conte, Marcello; Prentice, Paul; Pericleous, Koulis; Eskin, Dmitry; Durodola, John; Tzanakis, Iakovos",Ultrasonics sonochemistry,70,1

The development of delirium often is associated with the loss of independence, poor functional recovery, and increased morbidity, as well as increases in length of hospital stay, discharges to nursing facilities, and healthcare costs. We hypothesize that xenon may reduce the burden of POD, (i) by avoiding the need to provide anesthesia with a drug that targets the γ-amino-butyric acid (GABA)A receptor and (ii) through beneficial anesthetic and organ-protective effects. METHODS AND DESIGN An international, multicenter, phase 2, prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel group and controlled trial to evaluate the incidence of POD, diagnosed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery under general anesthesia with xenon or sevoflurane, for a period of 4 days post surgery (primary outcome) is planned. Secondary objectives are to compare the incidence of POD between xenon and sevoflurane, to evaluate the incidence of POD from day 5 post surgery until discharge from hospital, to determine the time to first POD diagnosis, to evaluate the duration of POD, to evaluate the evolution of the physiological status of the patients in the postoperative period, to evaluate the recovery parameters, to collect preliminary data to evaluate the economical impact of POD in the postoperative period and to collect safety data. Patients are eligible if they are older aged (≥ 75 years) and assigned to a planned hip fracture surgery within 48 h after the hip fracture.

An effective quarantine requires a process that inspires trust in government, only punishes noncompliance, and promotes a culture of social responsibility. Accomplishing successful quarantine requires incentives and enabling factors, payments, job security, and a tiered enforcement plan. In this article, we examine the variation in state-level quarantine laws and assess the effectiveness of these laws and regulations. We find that most states allow for an individual to have a hearing (63%) and to have a voice in burial and cremation procedures (71%), yet are weak on all other individual rights measures. Only 20% of states have provisions to protect employment when an individual is under quarantine, and less than half have plans for safe and humane quarantines. Decision makers at the state and local levels must make a concerted effort to revise and update quarantine laws and regulations. Ideally, these laws and regulations should be harmonized so as to avoid confusion and disruption between states, and public health officials should work with populations to identify and address the factors that will support successful quarantines if they are ever required.","Katz, Rebecca; Vaught, Andrea; Formentos, Adrienne; Capizola, Jordan",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,70,16

The technique draws on several advantages of other approaches. The aim of this study was to present outcomes using this technique at a minimum follow-up of 18 months.Patients and methodsParticipants having undergone anterior approach white line advancement ptosis correction at a single institution were retrospectively recruited at a minimum of 18 months' follow-up. A total of 18 independent eyelid measurements were recorded at final review. Outcomes included long-term rate of surgical success, upper eyelid margin-reflex distance (MRD1) at both early and late post-operative follow-up, inter-eyelid asymmetry, complications, re-operation rate, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life improvement using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Pre- and post-operative MRD1, as well as inter-eyelid asymmetry, were compared using a two-tailed t-test.ResultsIn total, 82 eyelids of 47 participants were included with a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (range 1.5-3.7). Surgical success was achieved in 91.5%, with a final mean MRD1 of 3.5 mm (95% confidence 3.2-3.7). An increase of 2.4 mm (2.1-2.8) in eyelid height was observed between baseline and long-term follow-up (P<0.0001). No significant change was observed between early and late post-operative follow-up. Pre-operative asymmetry was reduced from 1.0 mm (0.7-1.3) to 0.4 mm (0.3-0.5; P<0.0001). Patient satisfaction was 95.7% with a mean GBI score of +21.8 (13.2-30.3).ConclusionsAnterior approach white line advancement presents an excellent option for patients undergoing ptosis correction with favourable long-term results.

Amongst different forms of bioenergy, lignocellulosic biomass can be utilized as an attractive substrate for the production of several high-value products owing to its renewability, easy availability, and abundance. Additionally, utilization of these waste biomasses reduces the environmental hazards associated with its disposal. Impedance of lignin and crystalline nature of cellulose pose major bottlenecks in biomass based energy. Though, several physio-chemicals processes are recommended as mitigation route but none of them seems to be promising for large scale application. In recent years, a right fusion of biological treatment combined with nanotechnology for efficient pretreatment and subsequent hydrolysis of biomass by ubiquitous enzymes seems to be promising alternative. In addition, to overcome these difficulties, nanotechnology-based methods have been recently adopted in catalytic valorization of lignocellulosic biomass. The present review has critically discussed the application of nano-biotechnology in lignocellulosic biomass valorization in terms of pretreatment and hydrolysis. A detailed discussion on the application of various nanoparticles in these processes, enzyme immobilization and end-production utilization is presented in this review. Finally, the review emphasizes the major challenges of this process along with different routes and recommendations to address the issues.","Roy, Sharmili; Dikshit, Pritam Kumar; Sherpa, Knawang Chhunji; Singh, Anshu; Jacob, Samuel; Chandra Rajak, Rajiv",Journal of environmental management,70,16

Five randomized trials of catheter-based interventional treatment of stroke with special stents were published in 2015. METHODS Recently published randomized trials of mechanical thrombectomy are selectively reviewed. RESULTS These trials documented the clinical efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in the treatment of occlusion of a major cerebral artery in the distribution of the internal carotid artery (evidence level 1a, recommendation grade A). Roughly 4-10% of all stroke patients could benefit from such an intervention. In the trials, 85% of the patients were first treated with IV-tPA. A recanalization of the occluded vessel was achieved by MT in 59-88% of patients. The percentage of patients with no deficit or only a mild deficit was 33-71% among those who received the intervention, compared to 19-40% in the control groups. The trial data indicate that MT is effective for elderly patients as well (age over 80). Thrombectomy did not increase the rate of secondary, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSION MT can only be used to treat the occlusion of major cerebral arteries. In appropriate patients, it expands the spectrum of treatment options for stroke.

The incidence of IRP in women is approximately three times that in men. IRP is mainly treated by surgery, which can be divided into two categories: Abdominal procedures and perineal procedures. This study offers a better procedure for the treatment of IRP. AIM To compare the clinical efficacy of laparoscopic integral pelvic floor/ligament repair (IPFLR) combined with a procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH) and the laparoscopic IPFLR alone in the treatment of IRP in women. METHODS This study collected the clinical data of 130 female patients with IRP who underwent surgery from January 2012 to October 2014. The patients were divided into groups A and B. Group A had 63 patients who underwent laparoscopic IPFLR alone, and group B had 67 patients who underwent the laparoscopic IPFLR combined with PPH. The degree of internal rectal prolapse (DIRP), Wexner constipation scale (WCS) score, Wexner incontinence scale (WIS) score, and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) score were compared between groups and within groups before surgery and 6 mo and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS All laparoscopic surgeries were successful. The general information, number of bowel movements before surgery, DIRP, GIQLI score, WIS score, and WCS score before surgery were not significantly different between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The WCS score, WIS score, GIQLI score, and DIRP in each group 6 mo, and 2 years after surgery were significantly better than before surgery (P < 0.001). In group A, the DIRP and WCS score gradually improved from 6 mo to 2 years after surgery (P < 0.001), and the GIQLI score progressively improved from 6 mo to 2 years after surgery (P < 0.05). In group B, the DIRP, WCS score and WIS score significantly improved from 6 mo to 2 years after surgery (P < 0.05), and the GIQLI score 2 years after surgery was significantly higher than that 6 mo after surgery (P < 0.05). The WCS score, WIS score, GIQLI score, and DIRP of group B were significantly better than those of group A 6 mo and 2 years after surgery (all P < 0.001, Bonferroni) except DIRP at 2 years after surgery. There was a significant difference in the recurrence rate of IRP between the two groups 6 mo after surgery (P = 0.011). There was no significant difference in postoperative grade I-III complications between the two groups (P = 0.822). CONCLUSION Integral theory-guided laparoscopic IPFLR combined with PPH has a higher cure rate and a better clinical efficacy than laparoscopic IPFLR alone.","Yang, Yang; Cao, Yong-Li; Zhang, Yuan-Yao; Shi, Shou-Sen; Yang, Wei-Wei; Zhao, Nan; Lyu, Bing-Bing; Zhang, Wen-Li; Wei, Dong",World journal of clinical cases,70,5

Despite advances in the clinical setting, the immune cellular network in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that mediates such therapy is not well understood. Interleukin 33 (IL33) is highly expressed in normal epithelial cells but downregulated in tumor cells in advanced carcinoma. Here, we showed that IL33 was induced in tumor cells after treatment with ICB such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). ST2 signaling in non-tumor cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, was critical for the antitumor efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. We demonstrated that tumor-derived IL33 was crucial for the antitumor efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. Mechanistically, IL33 increased the accumulation and effector function of tumor resident CD103+CD8+ T cells and CD103 expression on CD8+ T cells was required for the antitumor efficacy of IL33. In addition, IL33 also increased the numbers of CD103+ dendritic cells (DC) in the TME and CD103+ DC were required for the antitumor effect of IL33 and accumulation of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells. combination of IL33 with CTLA-4 and PD-1 ICB further prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice.

METHODS This is an analysis of data from 983 cases of type VII laparoscopic hysterectomy performed from September 1996 through August 2010. Demographic and surgical data were stratified by uterine weight (range 14-3,131 g) less than 250 g (n = 720) and 250 g or more (n = 263). Analyses were done by Pearson's χ(2), Wilcoxon rank-sum, and Kruskal-Wallis tests with significance set at 2-sided (p <.05). Outcomes examined include estimated blood loss, skin-to-skin operative time, complications (non-reoperative and reoperative), and duration of hospital stay. Estimated blood loss, skin-to-skin operative time, and length of hospital stay were further analyzed using backwards, stepwise, multivariable, linear regression to control for and identify independent predictors affecting these outcomes. Baseline demographic data were included in the multivariable model. Only covariates that were significant in both multivariable and univariable analyses are presented as statistically significant. DESIGN A case-controlled, retrospective study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2). RESULTS Median operating time varied by uterine weight, with a shorter duration of surgery in patients with uteri less than 250 g at 97 minutes (range 29-330), and patients with uteri greater than 250 g at 135 minutes (range 45-345) (p <.001). Median estimated blood loss was also less in patients with uteri less than 250 g at 50 mL, (range 0-1400), than in patients with uteri weighing 250 g or more, at 150 mL, (range 0-2100) (p <.001). There was no significant difference by uterine weight in median duration of hospital stay of 1 day (range 0-13), total complication rate (7.0%), reoperative complications (3.7%), or non-reoperative complications (3.4%). Duration of surgery, volume of blood lost, and length of hospital stay all decreased with the surgeon's increasing experience. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic hysterectomy is feasible and safe, resulting in a short hospital stay, minimal blood loss, minimal operating time, and few complications for patients regardless of uterine weight.","O'Hanlan, Katherine A; McCutcheon, Stacey Paris; McCutcheon, John G",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,70,1

Eight genogroups of porcine SaV have been identified, and genogroup III is the predominant type. Most of the eight genogroups of porcine SaV are circulating in the US. In the present study, we report detection of porcine SaVs in pigs at different ages with clinical diarrhea using next-generation sequencing and genetic characterization. All seven cases have porcine SaV GIII strains detected and one pooled case was found to have a porcine SaV GVI strain IA27912-B-2018. Sequence analysis showed that seven GIII isolates were genetically divergent and formed four different lineages on the trees of complete genome, RdRP, VP1, and VP2. In addition, these seven GIII isolates had three different deletion/insertion patterns in an identified variable region close to the 3' end of VP2. The GVI strain IA27912-B-2018 was closely related to strains previously detected in the US and Japan. A 3-nt deletion in VP1 region of GVI IA27912-B-2018 was identified. Our study showed that genetically divergent SaVs of different genogroups are co-circulating in pigs in the US. Future studies comparing the virulence of these different genogroups in pigs are needed to better understand this virus and to determine if surveillance and vaccine development are needed to monitor and control porcine SaVs.

METHODS A structured Delphi, involving an expert panel of the Large Vessel Vasculitis subgroup of the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Ultrasound Working Group was carried out. The reliability of the new definition was tested in a 2-round web-based exercise involving 23 experts and using 50 still images each from AA of long-standing and acute GCA patients, as well as 50 images from healthy individuals. RESULTS The final OMERACT ultrasound definition of chronic changes was based on measurement and appearance of the intima-media complex. The overall reliability of the new definition for chronic ultrasound changes in longstanding GCA of the AA was good to excellent with Light's kappa values of 0.79-0.80 for inter-reader reliability and mean Light's-kappa of 0.88 for intra-reader reliability. The mean inter-rater and intra-rater agreements were 86-87% and 92%, respectively.

Little is known about the associations between loneliness and symptom burden in oncology patients before and during the pandemic. Study purposes include determining the prevalence of loneliness in a sample of oncology patients; evaluating for differences in demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics between lonely and nonlonely patients; and determining which demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics were associated with membership in the lonely group. METHODS A convenience sample (n = 606) completed online surveys that evaluated the severity of loneliness, social isolation, and common symptoms (ie, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and pain) in oncology patients. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to evaluate for differences in scores between the lonely and nonlonely groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for membership in the loneliness group. RESULTS Of the 606 patients, 53.0% were categorized in the lonely group. The lonely group reported higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher symptom severity scores for all of the symptoms evaluated. In the multivariate model, being unmarried, having higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with membership in the lonely group.

While all governments have struggled to respond to the pandemic, it is now becoming clear that some political leaders have performed much better than others. Among the worst performing are those that have risen to power on populist agendas, such as in the United States, Brazil, Russia, India, and the United Kingdom. Populist leaders have tended to: blame ""others"" for the pandemic, such as immigrants and the Chinese government; deny evidence and show contempt for institutions that generate it; and portray themselves as the voice of the common people against an out-of-touch 'elite.' In our short commentary, focusing on those countries with the most cases, we find that populist leaders appear to be undermining an effective response to COVID-19. Perversely, they may also gain politically from doing so, as historically populist leaders benefit from suffering and ill health. Clearly more research is needed on the curious correlation of populism and public health.

METHODS We searched PubMed and Embase for studies assessing the incidence of sharps injuries. We combined the incidence rates of similar studies in a random effects meta-analysis and explored heterogeneity with meta-regression. RESULTS We located 45 studies of which 11 were randomized control trials, 15 were follow-up studies, and 19 were cross-sectional studies. We categorized injuries as self-reported, glove perforations, or administrative injuries. We calculated the population at risk as person-years and as person-operations (po). Meta-analysis of the incidence rate based on the best outcome measure resulted in 13.2 injuries per 100 time-units (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-37.1; I2 = 100%). Per 100 person-years, the injury rate was 88.2 (95% CI, 61.3-126.9; 21 studies) for self-reported injuries, 40.0 for perforations (95% CI, 19.2-83.5; 15 studies), and 5.8 for administrative injuries (95% CI, 2.7-12.2; 5 studies). Per 100 po, the respective figures were 2.1 (95% CI, 0.8-5.0; 4 studies), 11.1 (95% CI, 6.6-18.9, 15 studies), and 0.1 (95% CI, 0.05-0.21). I2 values were all above 90%. Meta-regression indicated lower incidence rates in studies that used perforations per po. CONCLUSIONS A surgeon will have a sharps injury in about 1 in 10 operations .

Three IGBs are FDA approved and are now commercially available in the USA (Orbera, ReShape Duo, and Obalon) with others likely soon to follow. They are generally indicated for patients whose BMI ranges from 30 to 40 mg/kg2 and who have failed to lose weight with diet and exercise. IGBs have been shown to be safe, effective, and relatively straightforward to place and remove. Accommodative symptoms commonly occur within the initial weeks post-placement; however, major complications are rare. Gastric ulceration can occur in up to 10% of patients, while balloon deflation with migration and bowel obstruction occurs in <1% of patients.

In this randomized trial, the effectiveness and safety of stapler hepatectomy were compared with those of parenchymal transection with the LigaSure™ vessel sealing system. METHOD Patients scheduled for elective liver resection at two tertiary-care centres were randomized during surgery to stapler hepatectomy or transection with the LigaSure™ device. Total intraoperative blood loss was the primary efficacy endpoint. Transection time, duration of operation, perioperative complications and length of hospital stay were recorded as secondary endpoints. RESULTS A total of 138 patients were analysed, 69 in the LigaSure™ and 69 in the stapler hepatectomy group. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups. Mean intraoperative blood loss was significantly higher in the LigaSure™ group than the stapler hepatectomy group: 1101 (95 per cent c.i. 915 to 1287) versus 961 (752 to 1170) ml (P = 0·028). The parenchymal transection time was significantly shorter in the stapler group (P = 0·005), as was the total duration of operation (P = 0·027). Surgical morbidity did not differ between the groups, nor did the grade of complications. CONCLUSION Stapler hepatectomy was associated with reduced blood loss and a shorter duration of operation than the LigaSure™ device for parenchymal transection in elective partial hepatectomy.

Resistance to triclabendazole, one of the principal veterinary medicines used to prevent losses, has been reported and is now considered widespread in fluke endemic regions of the UK. METHODS Thirteen farmers participated in a trial in 2013 and the triclabendazole resistance status was obtained for each farm. Based on these results, a knowledge exchange programme on fluke control was delivered to nearly 100 farmers in the region. In this follow-up study, 11 farmers involved in the original trial, participated in semistructured in-depth qualitative interviews in July 2017. RESULTS Overall, participants identified benefits from participating in the 2013 trial, gaining information about triclabendazole resistance on their farms and knowledge about fluke control. The information on their farm's resistance status was a driver for changing their liver fluke control programmes. Factors such as habitual and repetitive behaviours, grazing restrictions due to agri-environmental schemes, economic pressures and climate change were identified that could impede or prevent the adoption of new control strategies. CONCLUSIONS The study highlights the significance of resistance to triclabendazole and the impact of knowledge exchange programmes in changing liver fluke control practices.","Coyne, Lucy Alice; Bellet, Camille; Latham, Sophia M; Williams, Diana",The Veterinary record,70,1

Genetic risk factors, such as polymorphisms of the NAT2, CYP2E1 and GSTM1 genes, may increase the risk of experiencing such toxicity events. Many pharmacogenetic studies have investigated the association between genetic variants and anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity events, and several meta-analyses have synthesised data from these studies, although conclusions from these meta-analyses are conflicting. Many meta-analyses also have serious methodological limitations, such as applying restrictive inclusion criteria, or not assessing the quality of included studies. Most also only consider hepatotoxicity outcomes and specific genetic variants. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to give a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence base for associations between any genetic variant and anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity. METHODS We will search for studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Web of Science. We will also hand search reference lists from relevant studies and contact experts in the field. We will include cohort studies, case-control studies and randomised controlled trials that recruited patients with tuberculosis who were either already established on anti-tuberculosis treatment or were commencing treatment and who were genotyped to investigate the effect of genetic variants on any anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity outcome. One author will screen abstracts to identify potentially relevant studies and will then obtain the full text for each potentially relevant study in order to assess eligibility. At each of these stages, a second author will independently screen/assess 10% of studies. Two authors will independently extract data and assess the quality of studies using a pre-piloted data extraction form. If appropriate, we will pool estimates of effect for each genotype on each outcome using meta-analyses stratified by ethnicity. DISCUSSION Our review and meta-analysis will update and add to the existing research in this field. By not restricting the scope of the review to a specific drug, genetic variant, or toxicity outcome, we hope to synthesise data for associations between genetic variants and anti-tuberculosis drug-related toxicity outcomes that have previously not been summarised in systematic reviews, and consequently, add to the knowledge base of the pharmacogenetics of anti-tuberculosis drugs.

Dose of 400 mg 6 weekly (q6w) was approved based on simulation of dose/exposure relationships and predicted no difference in toxicity. We present real-world comparative toxicity data. Patients receiving pembrolizumab for any indication between March and December 2019 were included across 3 regional centers. Toxicity data were collected retrospectively using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v5.0. Clinically significant immune-related adverse events (CSirAE) were defined as immune-related events and grade ≥3 rash. Data were analyzed using incidence (Poisson distribution) and incidence ratio. Overall, 63 patients started on q6w and 110 patients received q3w. There were 3 (q6w) and 8 (q3w) grade 3-5 CSirAE and 13 (q6w) and 31 (q3w) grade 1-2 CSirAE. The incidence of grade 3-5 CSirAE was 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.16-2.24) per 100 patient-months in q6w and 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.29-1.34) per 100 patient-months in q3w (incidence ratio of 1.13; 95% confidence interval: 0.19-4.70). Low-grade toxicity was common (fatigue, pruritus, rash; q6w 46%, q3w 42%). Incidence of CSirAEs was low but low-grade toxicity was common. Despite a limited number of events, there is the suggestion that the q6w schedule has a similar toxicity profile to q3w and therefore consideration should be given to the reduced burden to patients and health services when deciding treatment.","Rowe, Michael; Eastlake, Leonie; Norris, Timothy; Farley, Timothy; Talbot, Toby",Journal of immunotherapy,70,19

Differences in outcomes based on anesthetic agent choice with MAC has received less attention. The authors sought to determine whether differences in outcomes and cost exist based on whether patients receive dexmedetomidine or propofol when undergoing TAVR with MAC. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING The Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS The study comprised 161 patients who underwent TAVR with MAC between May 2014 and March 2019. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A propofol-only (n = 58) group and dexmedetomidine-only (n = 103) group were identified. No differences in in-hospital mortality or complication rate were identified when evaluating for stroke, transfusion, new arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or bleeding and vascular complications (p > 0.05, all). Thirty-day outcomes were also equivalent, with no differences in mortality, stroke, vascular complication, new arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction (p > 0.05, all). The average amount of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine used intraoperatively was not significantly different. Overall median hospitalization costs were equivalent ($57,554.31 with dexmedetomidine v $58,538.08 with propofol, p = 0.97).

This article reviews the effectiveness of CHWs in expanding immunization coverage in developing countries and examines the potential contribution of CHWs toward strengthening immunization services in rural India. While the limited number and quality of available studies make it difficult to directly compare CHW interventions to other strategies for improving immunization coverage, it is clear that CHWs make diverse contributions toward strengthening immunization programs. Incorporation of evidence-based strategies for CHW selection, retention, and training is critical for success of India's immunization program.

With generational changes in learning and the advancement of technology, it is difficult to know if the current method of grand rounds remains relevant and is meeting its audience's needs. Furthermore, surgeons may have different educational needs for grand rounds than other fields of healthcare. This study evaluates the needs of attendees and their attitudes toward modern surgical grand rounds through focus groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS Independent focus groups were conducted in the department of surgery at a large academic institution. In total, 19 individuals (five professors, three associate professors, three assistant professors, seven senior residents, and one junior resident) participated in the focus groups. Thematic analysis was conducted through a process of independent coding and defining of themes followed by joint revision until consensus was reached. RESULTS Four major themes arose from the discussion: current design and format of grand rounds, audience attitudes and needs, perceived barriers to meaningful grand rounds, and suggestions and improvements to grand rounds. Further subthemes also emerged. These themes were present in both faculty and resident responses, with 115 individual data pieces coded in total. CONCLUSIONS Grand rounds is an opportunity for social interaction, networking, professional and personal identity formation, and learning meaningful and relevant content.

Purpose of this study was to evaluate outcome and overall survival of patients who underwent DP combined with multivisceral resection (MVR). METHODS Retrospective single-center case-matched analysis. Between January 1994 and June 2014, 494 consecutive patients were entered into a prospective database, and 126 patients undergoing DP + MVR (cases) were matched with 126 patients undergoing DP (controls) for gender, age, and underlying final diagnosis. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics. Rates of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (36 (28.6%) vs. 29 (23.0%); p = 0.388) and postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (7 (5.5%) vs. 5 (3.9%); p = 0.769) did not reveal any significant differences. Although operative time (237.8 ± 57.9 vs. 203.5 ± 34.5; p < 0.001) and the necessity for intraoperative transfusions (18 (14.3%) vs. 5 (4.0%); p < 0.001) was significantly higher, the number of patients with major complications (the Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3) was not increased (27 (19.8%) vs. 20 (15.9%); p = 0.332) in the DP + MVR group. Midterm survival analysis indicated no significant difference for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors for either group. CONCLUSION DP + MVR is a feasible and safe surgical procedure to achieve radical tumor removal and can offer beneficial survival outcomes. Although operative time and intraoperative transfusions are enhanced, POPF, PPH, or major complications (the Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3) are not significantly increased after DP + MVR. DP + MVR can therefore be recommended in selected patients for resection of extended tumors within the concept of interdisciplinary strategies.","Malinka, Thomas; Klein, Fritz; Andreou, Andreas; Pratschke, Johann; Bahra, Marcus",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,70,1

CE is an umbrella concept incorporating different meanings. Despite the unclear concept, CE is turned into defined action plans supported by specific indicators. To understand what indicators used in CE measure specifically, we propose a classification framework to categorise indicators according to reasoning on what (CE strategies) and how (measurement scope). Despite different types, CE strategies can be grouped according to their attempt to preserve functions, products, components, materials, or embodied energy; additionally, indicators can measure the linear economy as a reference scenario. The measurement scope shows how indicators account for technological cycles with or without a Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) approach; or their effects on environmental, social, or economic dimensions. To illustrate the classification framework, we selected quantitative micro scale indicators from literature and macro scale indicators from the European Union 'CE monitoring framework'. The framework illustration shows that most of the indicators focus on the preservation of materials, with strategies such as recycling. However, micro scale indicators can also focus on other CE strategies considering LCT approach, while the European indicators mostly account for materials often without taking LCT into account. Furthermore, none of the available indicators can assess the preservation of functions instead of products, with strategies such as sharing platforms, schemes for product redundancy, or multifunctionality. Finally, the framework illustration suggests that a set of indicators should be used to assess CE instead of a single indicator.","Moraga, Gustavo; Huysveld, Sophie; Mathieux, Fabrice; Blengini, Gian Andrea; Alaerts, Luc; Van Acker, Karel; de Meester, Steven; Dewulf, Jo","Resources, conservation, and recycling",70,25

Odds ratios, linear regression, and correlation analysis were performed to evaluate relationships of mean and cumulative reporting times, volume, and study month. RESULTS Mean reporting time for the trainee group peaked in July (287.2 ± 4.9 min). The largest month-to-month increase was from June to July (+46.3 min, P < .01) for the trainees, and July showed the largest deviation from annualized mean reporting time (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.47; P < .001). Mean reporting time improved linearly over the course of the academic year from July to June for trainees (R2 = 0.59, P = .002), but this effect was absent in the attending radiologist-only group (P = .52). CONCLUSIONS This study quantifies the effect of trainee education on reporting efficiency and models the operational ""learning curve"" of improved performance over the academic year. These data may inform staffing and workflow improvement efforts in academic radiology departments.","Caton, M Travis; Wiggins, Walter F; Pomerantz, Stuart R; Andriole, Katherine P",Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,70,1

STUDY DESIGN A prospective, controlled, experimental study. ANIMALS Purpose-bred, adult, female beagles (n = 10). METHODS Two 2 × 2 cm wounds were surgically created bilaterally on the trunk of each dog and each side randomized to treatment (CMHA-S) or control (CON) groups. Total and open wound areas were measured with digital image planimetry at 15 time points. From these data, percent contraction and percent epithelialization were calculated. Tissue biopsies were obtained at 6 time points and histologic features were scored. RESULTS Total wound area was significantly larger and percent contraction was significantly less in CMHA-S compared to CON wounds at all data points between days 9 and 18. At day 25, and for the remainder of the study, CMHA-S wounds were smaller and contracted more than CON wounds, reaching significance at day 32. Percent epithelialization was significantly less in CMHA-S compared to CON wounds at all data points after day 11. Histologically, fibroblastic cellular infiltration was significantly higher in CMHA-S wounds at day 21. CONCLUSIONS CMHA-S wounds healed more slowly than CON wounds. This HA-based gel is not indicated in acute, full-thickness skin wounds in dogs as administered in this study. However, treatment may be beneficial in the mid-to-late repair stage of healing, or if scar minimization is desired. Further studies to evaluate the effects of the CMHA-S gel on canine wounds are indicated.","Hadley, Heather S; Stanley, Bryden J; Fritz, Michele C; Hauptman, Joe G; Steficek, Barbara A",Veterinary surgery : VS,70,1

However, there have been limited reports on single instruments capable of sensing both forces (translational force and grasping force), with the exception of instruments with electronic sensors. METHODS In this study, a pneumatically driven surgical instrument capable of estimating both translational and grasping forces is developed. Our estimation method is based on the dynamics and pneumatic pressure changes of the instrument. For each force estimation, we applied a joint mechanism consisting of disks and a flexible backbone and constructed pneumatic driving systems, kinematic models, dynamic models, controller, and force estimator. RESULTS We confirmed experimentally that the mean absolute error between the measured forces and the estimated translational and grasping forces is 0.2 N or less for any condition. From these results, it is seen that the mechanical interference between the joint actuation mechanism and grasper actuation mechanism is negligibly small. CONCLUSIONS A method for estimating both forces was proposed, and experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the method.","Miyazaki, Ryoken; Kanno, Takahiro; Kawashima, Kenji",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,70,27

Problems of lack of equity in child and youth MH services (CYMHS)-including, but not limited to, problems in inaccessibility and quality of services-are widespread. Characterizing the nature of equity in CYMHS is an ongoing challenge because the field lacks a consistent approach to conceptualizing equity. We will conduct a scoping review of how equity in MH services for children and youth has been defined, operationalized, and measured. Our objectives are to discover: (1) What conceptual definitions of equity are used by observational studies of CYMHS?; (2) What service characteristics of CYMHS care do indices of equity cover?; (3) What population dimensions have been used to operationalize equity?; (4) What statistical constructs have been used in indices that measure CYMHS equity?; and (5) What were the numerical values of those indices? METHODS The following databases will be searched: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, CINAHL, EconLit, and Sociological Abstracts. Searches will be conducted from the date of inception to the end of the last full calendar year (December 2019). Studies will be included if they include an evaluation of a mental health service for children or youth (defined as those under 19 years of age) and which quantify variation in some aspect of child or youth mental health services (e.g., accessibility, volume, duration, or quality) as a function of socio-demographic and/or geographic variables. Study selection will occur over two stages. Stage one will select articles based on title and abstract using the liberal-accelerated method. Stage two will review the full texts of selected titles. Two reviewers will work independently on full-text reviewing, with each study screened twice using pre-specified eligibility criteria. One reviewer will chart study characteristics and indices to be verified by a second reviewer. Reviewers will resolve full-text screening and data extraction disagreements through discussion. Synthesis of the collected data will focus on compiling and mapping the types and characteristics of the indices used to evaluate MH services equity. DISCUSSION The planned, systematic scoping review will survey the literature regarding how equity in MH services for children and youth has been operationalized and help inform future studies of equity in CYMHS.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 604 consecutive patients who underwent IAT for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke in two tertiary centers (2008-2013/2010-2013). Sixty patients selected by MRI or CT perfusion presenting within <24 h of onset with modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grade 3 or 2c reperfusion were included. Significant infarct growth (SIG) was defined as infarct expansion >11.6 mL. RESULTS Mean age was 67.0±13.7 years, 56% were men. Mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 16.2±6.1, time from onset to puncture was 6.8±3.1 h, and procedure length was 1.3±0.6 h. MRI was used for baseline core analysis in 43% of patients. Mean baseline infarct volume was 17.1±19.1 mL, absolute infarct growth was 30.6±74.5 mL, and final infarct volume was 47.7±77.7 mL. Overall, 35% of patients had SIG. Three of 21 patients (14%) treated with stent-retrievers had SIG compared with 14 of 39 (36%) with first-generation devices. Eight of 21 patients (38%) with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) had infarct growth compared with 25/39 (64%) without. 23% of patients with SIG had a modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 3 months compared with 48% of those without SIG. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that race affected infarct growth. Use of IV t-PA (p=0.03) and stent-retrievers (p=0.03) were independently and inversely correlated with SIG. CONCLUSIONS Despite full reperfusion, infarct growth is relatively frequent and may explain poor clinical outcomes in this setting. Ethnicity was found to influence SIG.

Using a two-step dynamic system generalized method of moments (GMM), the empirical results broadly suggest that institutional quality can be explored to dampen the potential negative effects of tourism and economic growth on environmental performance. In addition, financial development and renewable energy are positively related to environmental performance. This suggests that financial stability and energy consumption transition to renewable energy are necessary requirements to improve environmental performance. The policy implication for this study is that strengthening of institutional quality, financial stability, and adjusting to alternative and clean energy systems are the surest ways to achieve a cleaner and sustainable environment in the EU region.","Musa, Muhammad Sani; Jelilov, Gylych; Iorember, Paul Terhemba; Usman, Ojonugwa",Environmental science and pollution research international,70,27

Uric acid is a major non-enzymatic antioxidant in the blood, and it exerts a protective action on vitamin C. There are a limited number of ICU studies related to uric acid, which is a valuable prognostic biomarker. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of uric acid as a biomarker in predicting the outcomes of critically ill patients. METHODS This prospective, multi-centered cohort study included 128 patients from two different intensive care units who met the study inclusion criteria between May 2017 and October 2017. Study inclusion criteria were first admission to the ICU, age > 18 years, and ICU stay > 24 hours. In each patient, baseline serum uric acid levels were measured after acute interventions, prior to the initiation of the treatment process. RESULTS When comparing the last uric acid levels of patients, the median last uric acid levels in the non-survival and survival groups were significantly different (p = 0.001). A last uric acid level > 4.5 mg/dL was associated with a 2.638 times higher risk (relative risk) for mortality. According to ROC analysis, a cutoff value of 1.5 for the ratio between the last two uric acid levels had a sensitivity of 0.21 and a specificity of 0.96 for predicting mortality. A 1.5-fold increase in the uric acid level yielded a positive predictive value of 92.6% and a negative predictive value of 65.2% for predicting mortality. The median uric level in the patient subset with ARDS, was significantly higher than those without ARDS (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Results of this study indicate that a time-dependent increase in uric acid levels can be used as an important biomarker for predicting mortality in critically ill patients; further, uric acid levels should possibly be included in the current mortality risk scoring systems. In addition, elevation of uric acid, a simple, inexpensive, and readily available biomarker, may provide guidance in the diagnostic stage and in predicting clinical outcomes of patients with sepsis or ARDS.","Pehlivanlar-Kucuk, Mehtap; Kucuk, Ahmet O; Ozturk, Cagatay E; Er, Mehmet C; Ulger, Fatma",Clinical laboratory,70,1

Survival is highly dependent on surgery. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is increasingly chosen over open thoracotomy (OT) because of the possible benefits of the minimally invasive approach. Consequently, our aim was to compare the 30-day morbidity and mortality for lung cancer patients operated by VATS lobectomy or lobectomy by OT. METHOD Data were obtained from prospective national and regional databases, including patients who underwent lobectomy for lung cancer in the eastern part of Denmark from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2011. All patients operated before 2009 were re-staged according to the latest International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer lung cancer classification. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, pathology and operative data were assessed using an independent samples t-test, Pearson's χ(2), Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test. Morbidity was assessed using multinomial logistic regression adjusted for gender, age, cancer stage, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), year of surgery and Charlson comorbidity score. RESULTS In total, 1379 patients underwent lobectomy, 785 patients via VATS and 594 patients via thoracotomy. The two groups were similar in gender and FEV1. The patients operated by VATS were older (P < 0.001), and had a lower Charlson comorbidity score (P = 0.034), higher frequency of adenocarcinomas (P < 0.001) and lower cancer stage (P < 0.001). Among the VATS patients, 285 (36.3%) and among the thoracotomy patients, 288 (48.5%) had minor complications (P < 0.001); and 157 (20.0%) VATS patients and 212 (35.7%) thoracotomy patients had major complications (P < 0.001). The 30-day mortality rate was 1% in the VATS group and 1.5% in the thoracotomy group (P = 0.47). Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that the prevalence of both minor [odds ratio (OR) = 1.51; 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.18-1.96] and major complications (OR = 1.91, 95% Cl = 1.44-2.53) was significantly higher for patients who underwent lobectomy via thoracotomy compared with VATS. CONCLUSION Patients undergoing lobectomy via VATS were less likely to have at least one minor complication within the first 30 postoperative days and less likely to have at least one major complication, compared with patients operated by thoracotomy. These findings remained after adjusting for gender, age, FEV1, cancer stage, year of surgery and Charlson comorbidity score.","Laursen, Lykke Østergaard; Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Jensen, Tina Kold; Ravn, Jesper; Konge, Lars",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,70,1

We study especially the UTCI uncertainties due to uncertainties in radiation fluxes, whose impacts on UTCI are evaluated via the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt). We assume ""normal conditions"", which means that usual meteorological information and data are available but no special additional measurements. First, the uncertainty arising only from the measurement uncertainties of the meteorological data is determined. Here, simulations show that uncertainties between 0.4 and 2 K due to the uncertainty of just one of the meteorological input parameters may be expected. We then analyse the determination accuracy when not all radiation data are available and modelling of the missing data is required. Since radiative transfer models require a lot of information that is usually not available, we concentrate only on the determination accuracy achievable with empirical models. The simulations show that uncertainties in the calculation of the diffuse irradiance may lead to Tmrt uncertainties of up to ±2.9 K. If long-wave radiation is missing, we may expect an uncertainty of ±2 K. If modelling of diffuse radiation and of longwave radiation is used for the calculation of Tmrt, we may then expect a determination uncertainty of ±3 K. If all radiative fluxes are modelled based on synoptic observation, the uncertainty in Tmrt is ±5.9 K. Because Tmrt is only one of the four input data required in the calculation of UTCI, the uncertainty in UTCI due to the uncertainty in radiation fluxes is less than ±2 K. The UTCI uncertainties due to uncertainties of the four meteorological input values are not larger than the 6 K reference intervals of the UTCI scale, which means that UTCI may only be wrong by one UTCI scale. This uncertainty may, however, be critical at the two temperature extremes, i.e. under extreme hot or extreme cold conditions.","Weihs, Philipp; Staiger, Henning; Tinz, Birger; Batchvarova, Ekaterina; Rieder, Harald; Vuilleumier, Laurent; Maturilli, Marion; Jendritzky, Gerd",International journal of biometeorology,70,12

The coronavirus 2019 pandemic has caused an immediate need for synchronous telemedicine in all specialties, including ophthalmology. While a plethora of mobile VA applications exist, there is no consensus as to what technology can accurately and reproducibly measure a patient's vision at home. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in April 2020 using PubMed, Embase and Medline, identifying English publications from 2010 to 2020 on remote VA tests: 4338 articles were identified and 14 were ultimately included in the review. RESULTS Of those 14, the highest quality studies, best reproducibility and correlation with in-clinic acuities measured were found using the Peek Acuity application. The studies included patients throughout the world aged 3-97, with and without correction, with known ocular pathology.The Peek Acuity studies measured distance vision on a Samsung Galaxy S3 with a mean difference of 0.055 Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) for home testing compared with the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). Test-retest variability was ±0.029 LogMAR for 95% confidence interval limits. DISCUSSION There can be one or more lines of variability in vision testing in a clinical setting using reference standard ETDRS and clinical standard Snellen charts. Test-retest reliability is not perfect even on standard clinical charts (variation up to 0.48 LogMAR). Of the technologies reviewed, Peek Acuity home testing had the greatest correlation with ETDRS clinical vision and high test-retest reliability.

Early detection of RSV infection can avoid unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic intervention and is required to prevent the nosocomial spread of RSV infection in pediatric hospitals. We developed a web tool to calculate the probability of RSV infection in children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) (RSVpredict). METHODS During winter seasons 2014/2015 to 2017/2018, 1545 children hospitalized with clinical symptoms of ARTI at the University Hospital Heidelberg/Germany were prospectively included. Medical information was reported on a standardized data sheet, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained for multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. We applied logistic regression to develop a prediction model and developed a web-based application to predict the individual probability of RSV infection. RESULTS Duration of clinical symptoms ≥2 days on admission, calendar month of admission, admission for lower respiratory tract infection, the presence of cough and rale and younger age were associated with RSV infection (P < 0.05). Those data were included in the prediction model (RSVpredict, https://web.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/rsv/). RSVpredict is a web-based application to calculate the risk of RSV infection in children hospitalized with ARTI. The prediction model is based on easily accessible clinical symptoms and predicts the individual probability of RSV infection risk immediately.

Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total serum cholesterol > 200 mg/dL or use of lipids lowering medication. RESULTS 44.6% of males and 61.9% of females had hypercholesterolemia (p < 0.001). Only, 63% of hypercholesterolemic participants were under special diet or pharmaceutical treatment. Hypercholisterolemic individuals had higher prevalence of obesity (43% vs. 25%), hypertension (76% vs. 57%) and diabetes (25% vs. 17%) compared with normal participants (p < 0.001). Furthermore, hypercholisterolemic participants showed higher depression levels (p = 0.002). After adjusting for various confounders, GDS score and BMI correlated with 13% (95%CI 0.98-1.30) and 14% (95%CI 0.99-1.31) higher likelihood of having hypercholesterolemia. CONCLUSION A considerable proportion of our elderly sample had hypercholesterolemia, while 1/3 of them were untreated. Furthermore, presence of hypercholesterolemia was correlated with depressive symptomatology and increased BMI.","Tyrovolas, Stefanos; Lionis, Christos; Zeimbekis, Akis; Bountziouka, Vassiliki; Micheli, Mary; Katsarou, Alexia; Papairakleous, Natassa; Metallinos, George; Makri, Kornilia; Polychronopoulos, Evangelos; Panagiotakos, Demosthenes B",Lipids in health and disease,70,4

With the appearance of multidrug-resistant TB and emerging infectious disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza viruses, engineering controls using 254 nm UV-C lamps within specialized luminaires, herein designated UVGI fixtures, are being installed in high-risk settings such as homeless shelters, hospitals, jails and prisons, and schools. Studies have established that a relatively uniform spatial distribution of UV-C in the upper room can effectively cleanse the air of aerosolized pathogens. However, for planning purposes, the placement of multiple UVGI fixtures in a space, to achieve uniformity of UV-C energy distribution using currently available lighting software, is not yet practical because no industry-wide standard method exists for radiometric measurement of commercial UVGI fixtures. In this article, standard methods for photometry and reporting of general fluorescent lighting luminaire photometric data are adopted to provide UVGI fixture spatial emission distribution data in an electronic file format. The ultimate expectation of the authors is that the results will lead to a software program for fixture placement, comparable to and as easy to use as the corresponding software used for general interior lighting applications. To accomplish this goal, a radiometry measurement system is developed to obtain the radiant intensity distributions of UVGI fixtures in a three-dimensional space. This system includes a moving-mirror Type C goniometer, a mirror, a radiometer, a desktop computer, the mechanical control hardware, and the data acquisition/presentation software. Repeated measurements were made on each of three exemplary UVGI fixtures, and measurement variation did not exceed ± 2.0%.","Zhang, John; Levin, Robert; Angelo, Robert; Vincent, Richard; Brickner, Philip; Ngai, Peter; Nardell, Edward A",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,70,1

Design A prospective, randomized, single center investigation study in a urological operation unit of a tertiary hospital. Subjects and Methods Forty adult patients undergoing elective urological surgery in general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation were randomly allocated into group 1 (channeled videolaryngoscopy, n = 20) and group 2 (non-channeled videolaryngoscopy, n = 20). We measured the times from laryngoscope insertion to recognize the glottis and to conclude tracheal intubation. The number of laryngoscopy/intubation attempts and the degree of visual glottis exposure on a visual analog scale from 0 (glottis not visible) to 10 (glottis fully visible) was assessed. The lowest SpO2 value during airway management was recorded. Results There was no statistically significant difference in biometric data between the 2 groups. The time from the laryngoscope insertion to glottis recognition with the non-channeled blades was 5 (4-8) s as compared to the channeled ones with 11 (7-14) s (median and range; p = 0.01). Intubation duration was shorter with the channeled blades 17 (12-27) s vs. 29 (25-51) s (median and range; p < 0.001).

Recently, various studies demonstrate that the increased activity of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) causes health benefits in energy regulation. Thus, great efforts have been made to develop AMPK activators as a metabolic syndrome treatment. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the AMPK activator C24 on dyslipidemia and the potential mechanisms. We showed that C24 (5-40 μM) dose-dependently increased the phosphorylation of AMPKα and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and inhibited lipogenesis in HepG2 cells. Using compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or hepatocytes isolated from liver tissue-specific AMPK knockout AMPKα1α2fl/fl;Alb-cre mice (AMPK LKO), we demonstrated that the lipogenesis inhibition of C24 was dependent on hepatic AMPK activation. In rabbits with high-fat and high-cholesterol diet-induced dyslipidemia, administration of C24 (20, 40, and 60 mg · kg-1· d-1, ig, for 4 weeks) dose-dependently decreased the content of TG, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in plasma and played a role in protecting against hepatic dysfunction by decreasing lipid accumulation. A lipid-lowering effect was also observed in high-fat and high-cholesterol diet-fed hamsters. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the small molecular AMPK activator C24 alleviates hyperlipidemia and represents a promising compound for the development of a lipid-lowering drug.","Sun, Shui-Mei; Xie, Zhi-Fu; Zhang, Yang-Ming; Zhang, Xin-Wen; Zhou, Chen-Dong; Yin, Jian-Peng; Yu, Yan-Yan; Cui, Shi-Chao; Jiang, Hao-Wen; Li, Teng-Teng; Li, Jia; Nan, Fa-Jun; Li, Jing-Ya",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,70,24

It is unknown whether ethanol-induced alterations in nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic projections to the BLA mediate anxiety-related behaviors through direct modulation of GABA and glutamate afferents. Following 10 days of CIE exposure and 24 hours of withdrawal, we recorded GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic responses in BLA pyramidal neurons with electrophysiology, assessed total protein expression of cholinergic markers, and quantified acetylcholine and choline concentrations using a colorimetric assay. We measured α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) dependent modulation of presynaptic function at distinct inputs in AIR- and CIE-exposed BLA coronal slices as a functional read-out of cholinergic neurotransmission. CIE/withdrawal upregulates the endogenous activity of α 7 nAChRs, facilitating release at both GABAergic' local' interneuron and glutamatergic synaptic responses to stria terminalis (ST) stimulation, with no effect at GABAergic lateral paracapsular cells. CIE caused a three-fold increase in BLA acetylcholine concentration, with no changes in α 7 nAChR or cholinergic marker expression. These data illustrate that α 7 nAChR-dependent changes in presynaptic function serve as a proxy for CIE-dependent alterations in synaptic acetylcholine levels.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of 96 adult patients who underwent lung transplantation at our institution between August 2008 and January 2016. Time-to-tracheostomy was defined based on timing of the procedure: ""early"" if less than 3 days or ""late"" if 3 or more days after lung transplantation. RESULTS Forty-nine patients (51%) underwent tracheostomy 3.2 ± 1.8 days after lung transplantation. Among these patients, 21 patients (42.9%) underwent early tracheostomy and 28 patients (57.1%) underwent late tracheostomy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that preoperative performance status was a significant predictor for tracheostomy (p = 0.006, odds ratio 2.72). Patients in the early tracheostomy group began walking (p = 0.003) and oral feeding (p = 0.0006) earlier and had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.04) and shorter length of intensive care unit (p = 0.01) and hospital stay (p = 0.04) than patients in the late tracheostomy group. No significant differences in postoperative walking (p = 0.06), oral feeding (p = 0.17), or length of hospital stay (p = 0.37) were observed between patients who underwent early tracheostomy and those who did not undergo tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS Early tracheostomy following lung transplantation decreased both intensive care and hospital stay, due to improved postoperative recovery, even in patients with poor preoperative conditions. Furthermore, length of hospital stay in patients with early tracheostomy was similar to that of patients without tracheostomy after lung transplantation.","Miyoshi, Ryo; Chen-Yoshikawa, Toyofumi F; Hamaji, Masatsugu; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Kayawake, Hidenao; Hijiya, Kyoko; Motoyama, Hideki; Aoyama, Akihiro; Date, Hiroshi",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,70,17

The objective of this report is to share the themes of this wellness check-ins with those engaged in pediatric emergency medicine education and mentorship. Additionally, we share our curricular approach as we plan to continue PEM Pals after the pandemic restrictions are lifted. METHODS ""PEM Pals"" is a twice-weekly video conference meeting made up of pediatric residents with an expressed interest in PEM and those residents currently on rotation in the pediatric emergency department. Following a flipped classroom model, participants complete a presession learning activity and then core PEM topics are covered through literature review, case discussions, and telesimulations. Each meeting begins with a wellness ""check-in."" Themes generated from these check-ins were member checked by our core learning contingent. RESULTS Nine residents make up our core learning contingent and we have had 11 ""PEM Pals"" sessions since March 2020. Three themes emerged from the wellness check-ins. The first was each postgraduate year's unique concern over professional transitions. The second was a pervasive sense of guilt. And the third was a grave concern about their ability to support and be supported from their personal communities.

If RSV-LRTI were causal, we would expect RSV-LRTI prevention to reduce the incidence of chronic wheezing illnesses in addition to reducing acute disease. We aimed to evaluate the strength of evidence for a causal effect of RSV-LRTI on subsequent chronic wheezing illness to inform public health expectations for RSV vaccines. METHODS We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the association between RSV-LRTI and subsequent wheezing illness (exposure studies) and studies evaluating the association between RSV immunoprophylaxis and subsequent wheezing illness (immunoprophylaxis studies). Exposure studies were included if the exposure group members had an LRTI with laboratory-confirmed RSV and if the exposure ascertainment period began before 2 years of age and ended before 5 years of age. We required a wash-out period of more than 30 days between the index RSV-LRTI and the outcome measurement to allow for resolution of the acute illness. Comparisons between RSV-LRTI and non-RSV-LRTI were not included. Immunoprophylaxis studies were included if they measured the association with subsequent wheezing illness relative to a control group, either in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) or an observational design. For the immunoprophylaxis drugs in question, we required evidence of efficacy in targeting RSV-LRTI from at least one RCT to ensure biological plausibility. All variations of wheezing illness were combined into a single outcome that refers broadly to asthma or any other respiratory illness with wheezing symptoms. Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from inception up to Aug 28, 2018. We evaluated whether data from exposure studies could provide evidence against the most viable non-causal theory that RSV-LRTI is a marker of respiratory illness susceptibility rather than a causal factor. Additionally, we tested whether RSV immunoprophylaxis reduces the odds of subsequent wheezing illnesses. We used a random-effects modelling framework and, to accommodate studies providing multiple correlated estimates, robust variance estimation meta-regressions. Meta-regression coefficients (b) quantify differences between exposure and comparator groups on the loge odds ratio (loge OR) scale. FINDINGS From 14 235 records we identified 57 eligible articles that described 42 studies and provided 153 effect estimates. 35 studies estimated the direct effect of RSV-LRTI on wheezing illnesses (exposure studies) and eight evaluated the effect of RSV immunoprophylaxis (immunoprophylaxis studies). Exposure studies that adjusted for genetic influences yielded a smaller mean adjusted OR estimate (aOR+ 2·45, 95% CI 1·23-4·88) compared with those that did not (4·17, 2·36-7·37), a significant difference (b 0·53, 95% CI 0·04-1·02). Infants who were not protected with RSV immunoprophylaxis tended to have higher odds of subsequent wheezing illness, as we would expect if RSV-LRTI were causal, but the effect was not significant (OR+ 1·21, 95% CI 0·73-1·99). There was generally a high threat of confounding bias in the observational studies. Additionally, in both the observational studies and immunoprophylaxis RCTs, there was high risk of bias due to missing outcome data. INTERPRETATION Our findings, limited to exposure and immunoprophylaxis studies, do not support basing policy decisions on an assumption that prevention of RSV-LRTI will reduce recurrent chronic wheezing illnesses.

In open gastrectomy, gastroduodenostomy or gastroenterostomy is often performed with the hand-sewn technique. Therefore, hand-sewn anastomosis was performed through a small incision in LDG. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of LDG with hand-sewn anastomosis. METHODS Between June 2009 and December 2015, we assessed 263 consecutive patients who underwent LDG in our institution. In all patients, the reconstruction procedures were performed extracorporeally with the hand-sewn technique. The clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and operation cost related to anastomosis were evaluated and compared with the other methods. RESULTS The average operation time was 157.5 minutes, and average blood loss was 38.8 mL. The types of reconstruction were Billroth I, 95 cases (36.1%); Billroth II, 165 cases (62.7%); and Roux-en-Y, 3 cases (1.1%). The overall incidence of postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification≧Grade II) was 8.0%. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 1 patient (0.4%) and anastomotic bleeding and anastomotic stenosis in 2 patients each (0.8%). There was no postoperative mortality. The cost of the absorbable threads used in anastomosis is less than the cost of a linear or circular stapler, which is often used in intracorporeal anastomosis. CONCLUSION This procedure is similar to conventional open surgery, and it is feasible, safe, and cost-effective. In addition, in an institution that plans to introduce LDG, the use of our method during the introductory phase of LDG has many advantages.","Takayama, Yuichi; Kaneoka, Yuji; Maeda, Atsuyuki; Fukami, Yasuyuki; Onoe, Shunsuke",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Serological tests can be employed for RT-PCR negative patients, contact tracing, determining the probability of protection against re-infection, and seroepidemiological studies. AREAS COVERED The main methodologies of serology-based tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) were reviewed and their diagnostic performances were compared. Herein, a literature review on the databases of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar between January 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020 based on the main serological methods for COVID-19 detection with the focus on comparative experiments was performed. The review was updated on 31th December 2020. EXPERT OPINION Serology testing could be considered as a part of diagnostic panel two weeks post symptom onset. Higher sensitivity for serology-based tests could be achieved by determining combined IgG/IgM titers. Furthermore, higher sensitive serological test detecting neutralization antibody could be developed by targeting spike (S) antigen. It was also demonstrated that the sensitivity of ELISA/CLIA-based methods are higher than LFIA devices.","Mohit, Elham; Rostami, Zahra; Vahidi, Hossein",Expert review of clinical immunology,70,24

This type of central nervous system trauma is known to predispose patients to several neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, chronic trauamatic encephalopathy, and age-related Dementia. Recently, several proteomic and lipidomic platforms have been applied on different TBI studies to investigate TBI-related mechanisms that have broadened our understanding of its distinct neuropathological complications. In this study, we provide an updated comprehensive overview of the current knowledge and novel perspectives of the spatially resolved microproteomics and microlipidomics approaches guided by mass spectrometry imaging used in TBI studies and its applications in the neurotrauma field. In this regard, we will discuss the use of the spatially resolved microproteomics and assess the different microproteomic sampling methods such as laser capture microdissection, parafilm assisted microdissection, and liquid microjunction extraction as accurate and precise techniques in the field of neuroproteomics. Additionally, we will highlight lipid profiling applications and their prospective potentials in characterizing molecular processes involved in the field of TBI. Specifically, we will discuss the phospholipid metabolism acting as a precursor for proinflammatory molecules such as eicosanoids. Finally, we will survey the current state of spatial neuroproteomics and microproteomics applications and present the various studies highlighting their findings in these fields.","Mallah, Khalil; Zibara, Kazem; Kerbaj, Coline; Eid, Ali; Khoshman, Nour; Ousseily, Zahraa; Kobeissy, Abir; Cardon, Tristan; Cizkova, Dasa; Kobeissy, Firas; Fournier, Isabelle; Salzet, Michel",Mass spectrometry reviews,70,30

METHODS A total of 329 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between 2013 and 2016 were prospectively enrolled in this study. These patients were divided into the preoperative urinary continence group and the preoperative urinary incontinence group according to the 1-h pad test. The time to achieve urinary continence, lower urinary tract function evaluated by uroflowmetry and post-voided residual urine volume, and quality of life evaluated by King's Health Questionnaire and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form were compared between these two groups. RESULTS There were 190 patients (58%) in the preoperative urinary continence group (1-h pad test ≤ 2 g) and 139 patients (42%) in the preoperative urinary incontinence group (1-h pad test > 2 g). In the preoperative urinary continence/incontinence groups, 83%/76% of patients achieved continence within 12 months, respectively, and urinary incontinence remained significantly longer in the preoperative incontinence group than in the preoperative continence group (P = 0.042). Although there were no significant differences in all quality of life items between the two groups before surgery, several items were significantly higher in the preoperative urinary continence group. CONCLUSION Achievement of urinary continence and improvement of urinary quality of life are delayed in patients with preoperative urinary incontinence assessed by the 1-h pad test. The preoperative 1-h pad test could be a useful predictor of prolonged urinary incontinence and poor quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.","Kurimura, Yoshimasa; Haga, Nobuhiro; Yanagida, Tomohiko; Tanji, Ryo; Onagi, Akifumi; Honda, Ruriko; Matsuoka, Kanako; Hoshi, Seiji; Hata, Junya; Onoda, Mitsutaka; Sato, Yuichi; Akaihata, Hidenori; Kataoka, Masao; Ogawa, Soichiro; Ishibashi, Kei; Matsubara, Akio; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",International urology and nephrology,70,16

To report potential intraoperative problems related to LPET use and suggest practical solutions. STUDY DESIGN Comparative analysis. SETTING Academic laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Physical characteristics of the Mallinckrodt Laser-Flex (MTL), Medtronic Laser-Shield II (ML-II), and Rusch LaserTubus (RL) were compared. The effect of bending LPETs on airflow resistance was estimated with a pressure transducer. The force required to pull each tube through the glottis and the pressure exerted during this maneuver were measured in a fresh cadaveric human larynx. RESULTS The design features and physical characteristics of LPETs differ, including varying balloon-tip lengths. Bending LPETs to acute angles caused significant pressure increase within the RL tube (Δ 3.42 cm H2O) and minimal change within the ML-II (Δ 0.12 cm H2O) and MTL (Δ 0.21 cm H2O) tubes. The average force required to pull the RL (48.12 g, P = .003) and MTL (282.4 g, P = .001) tubes through the glottis was 7.6× and 44.5× greater than that for the ML-II (6.39 g). When pulled through the vocal folds, the ML-II cuff exerted no detectable pressure, whereas higher pressures were measured for the RL (2.2 cm H2O) and MTL (6.5 cm H2O) tubes. CONCLUSION The ML-II tube had the most favorable characteristics, with minimal pressure during extubation and resistance to kinking. The RL tube kinks readily with a resultant increase in resistance to airflow. The MTL tube extends farther into the trachea due to a relatively elongated balloon-tip configuration. Future LPET designs should incorporate features that avoid intraoperative difficulties related to airway protection and ventilation.","Burns, James A; Adlard, Stephen D; Kobler, James B; Tynan, Monica A; Petrillo, Robert H; Tracy, Lauren F",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,70,1

A total of 685 bats of 8 species representing 4 families were collected from 10 sites, and were tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated protein A/G mixture and viral neutralization test. Rabies antibody response was only detected from three bat species (Rousettus leschenaulti, Rhinolophus blythi, and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). The overall rabies seroconversion rate was only 2.2% (15/685). Of the 15 positive sera, 13 (12 fruit bats and 1 insectivorous bat) were indirect fluorescent antibody test positive, and two insectivorous bats were virus neutralization positive when tested by the modified fluorescent antibody viral neutralization test, albeit extremely low. To our knowledge, this is the first published report describing rabies seroprevalences from Chinese bats. These results suggest that bats may play a role in the ecology of lyssaviruses in China, and further surveillance for the presence of lyssaviruses in bats should be undertaken throughout the country and extended to other species.","Jiang, Yu; Wang, Lili; Lu, Zongji; Xuan, Hua; Han, Xiaohu; Xia, Xianzhu; Zhao, Fuguang; Tu, Changchun",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,70,1

The impact of autologous fat grafting on oncologic safety and surveillance remains questionable, particularly following breast conservation therapy. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent delayed fat grafting following breast conservation therapy between 2006 and 2016. A control group of conservatively managed patients without grafting was matched for cancer stage, age, body mass index, and follow-up. Outcomes included locoregional recurrence and oncologic surveillance. RESULTS Seventy-two patients were identified per cohort. There were no differences in median age (50 years versus 51 years; p = 0.87), body mass index (28.2 kg/m versus 27.2 kg/m; p = 0.38), or length of follow-up (61.9 months versus 66.8 months; p = 0.144) between controls and grafted patients, respectively. Overall, four patients in each cohort experienced recurrence (5.6 percent; p = 1.00) with similar cumulative incidence estimates observed (log-rank test, p = 0.534). There were no significant differences in palpable mass (9.7 percent versus 19.4 percent; p = 0.1), fat necrosis (34.7 percent versus 33.3 percent; p = 0.86), calcifications (37.5 percent versus 34.7 percent; p = 0.73), or indication for breast biopsy (15.3 percent versus 22.2 percent; p = 0.23) between breast conservation and breast conservation therapy plus autologous fat grafting cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the authors found no difference in recurrence rates after breast conservation with or without delayed fat grafting. Furthermore, there were no differences in the rates of fat necrosis, palpable mass, and abnormal radiographic findings.

The molecular structure whether cyclic or linear and ionicity determines the stability of Gd-CA. Linear chelates are flexible open chains which do not offer a strong binding to Gd(3+). In contrast, the macrocyclic chelates offer a strong binding to Gd(3+) by the virtue of being preorganized rigid rings of almost optimal size to cage the gadolinium atom. Non-ionic preparations are also less stable in comparison to the ionic ones as the binding between Gd(3+) with the negatively charged carboxyl groups is stronger in comparison to that with amides or alcohol in the non-ionic preparations. According to stability constants and kinetic measurements, the most stable Gd-CM is the ionic-macrocyclic chelate Gd-DOTA and the least stable agents are the non-ionic linear chelates gadodiamide and gadoversetamide. In vivo data confirmed the low stability of non-ionic linear chelates but no significant difference was observed amongst the macrocyclic agents whether ionic (Gd-DOTA) or non-ionic such as Gd-HP-DO3A and Gd-BT-DO3A. The stability of Gd-CA seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the serious complication of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

To date, the effect of essential metals on the accumulation and transport of toxic metals by aquatic ferns has not been suitably established. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of floating leaves of Salvinia minima and Salvinia rotundifolia species to accumulate Cr from Cr(VI solutions containing very low (0.02 mg L-1) and low (5 mg L-1) Zn concentrations. After 7-day metal-exposure period, results showed that Zn increased Cr accumulation in S. minima leaves whereas in S. rotundifolia decreased significantly. Contrarily Zn accumulation did not show great differences between species. This fact may indicate that Zn interfere Cr(VI) uptake by S. rotundifolia. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) were affected differently by Zn in both Salvinia species. Membrane stability index (MSI) of both Salvinia species was decreased significantly by 5 mg L-1 Zn concentration. Zn ions also increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation in fronds of Salvinia species. Total thiols (TT), non-protein thiols (NPT) and protein-bound thiols (PBT) were differentially affected by Cr(VI) and Zn ions. This study provides evidences on the involvement of different mechanisms against Cr(VI)/Zn toxicity in S. minima and S rotundifolia species.","Prado, Carolina; Chocobar-Ponce, Silvana; Pagano, Eduardo; Prado, Fernando; Rosa, Mariana",International journal of phytoremediation,70,16

The more severe the symptoms, the more comprehensive and complex are the methods needed to treat patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the role of rehabilitation as one of the pillars in COVID-19 management, considering its advantages. It has been implemented in some countries' guidelines, but it is not stated in Indonesia's guideline. Thus, rehabilitation intervention is sometimes neglected or delayed. This case report aims to describe the possible benefit of optimizing the rehabilitation program during hospitalization. CASE REPORT We describe 2 patients with severe COVID-19: Patient A was a 53-year-old man without comorbidities and Patient B was a 68-year-old man with several comorbidities. Patient A was discharged from the hospital with respiratory sequelae (dyspnea, cough, and desaturation) and muscle weakness in both limbs after 2 months of hospitalization without rehabilitation intervention. Then, he returned to work 3 months after rehabilitation. Patient B was discharged without any significant sequelae after undergoing rehabilitation during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Early physical rehabilitation in severe cases of COVID-19 has several potential benefits, including improved muscle strength, physical function, and quality of life, as well as reduced health care costs and length of stay (LOS). We believe that an early rehabilitation program in severe cases of COVID-19 is needed, but the physician still has to consider the patients' condition and capacity into to decide what kind of exercise should be programmed by the team.","Waluyo, Yose; Artika, Sari Rajwani; Wahyuni, Insani Nanda; Valen, Septianto Dwi; Sam, Nuralam",The American journal of case reports,70,11

However, less cell homing to damaged sites limited its functions. In present study, we labeled EPCs with silica-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SiO4@SPIONs) and applied exterior magnetic field to guide SiO4@SPIONs-labeled EPCs (SiO4@SPIONs-EPCs) to the ischemic hemisphere of the brain. We optimized SiO4@SPIONs labeling dose, which did not affect proliferation, migration and tube formation of EPCs in vitro. SiO4@SPIONs-EPCs homing was greatly increased in ischemic hemisphere with magnetic field treatment in mice underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Injection of SiO4@SPIONs-EPCs and followed by magnetic field treatment showed improved neurobehavioral outcomes, reduced brain atrophic volume, increased microvessel density and VEGF expression in the ischemic perifocal region compared to groups without magnetic field treatment (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrated that exterior magnetic field could guide SiO4@SPIONs-EPCs to ischemic region and enhance therapeutic effect, suggesting that magnetic-guided SiO4@SPIONs-EPCs delivery is a promising approach in cerebral ischemic therapy.","Li, Qianyun; Tang, Guanghui; Xue, Sihan; He, Xiaosong; Miao, Peng; Li, Yaning; Wang, Jixian; Xiong, Liqin; Wang, Yongting; Zhang, Chunfu; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Biomaterials,70,20

This study evaluated the role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) cytology in the diagnosis of UGIT-MTs and impact of rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE). METHODS We retrospectively search our electronic database between January 2001 and August 2019 for cases that underwent EUS-FNA for a submucosal/or intramural upper GI tract mass forming lesions. Data pertinent to immunostain expression in UGIT-MTs was also collected. RESULTS We identified 139 cases, of which 72 cases had subsequent surgical resection. The cytologic diagnoses included nondiagnostic, negative, atypical, suspicious for neoplasm and positive for neoplasm (PFN) in 11, 7, 11, 10, and 100 cases, respectively. Diagnosis of PFN was rendered in 51 of 69 cases with ROSE (74%) and in 49 of 70 cases without ROSE (70%). However, the cases with ROSE had a higher percentage of cases being precisely classified than without ROSE (86% vs 61%, P < .05). On comparison of cytologic cases with cell block (CB) (n = 118) and without CB (n = 21), ROSE was performed in 67 (57%) and 2 (10%) cases, respectively (P < .01). All the cases with diagnosis of PFN were confirmed on subsequent surgical resection. CONCLUSION EUS-FNA has a diagnostic yield of 72% for UGIT-MTs. ROSE could improve diagnostic performance by further classifying MTs, probably via securing adequate lesional material for cell block for additional ancillary testing and precise diagnosis.","Gilani, Syed M; Muniraj, Thiruvengadam; Aslanian, Harry R; Cai, Guoping",Diagnostic cytopathology,70,33

The objectives are 1) to report the prevalence of antihistamine prescription for children less than 6 years old with acute upper respiratory infection and 2) to explore the associated factors for the prescription practice. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study. All consecutive cases of paediatric patients aged 6 or below who presented to the emergency department during a study period of one week from April 1 to July 4, 2009 with diagnosis of acute upper respiratory infection were included. Totally 162 patients were included. RESULTS Among the 162 cases, 141 (87%) patients were prescribed one antihistamine of any group. Sixty (37%) patients were prescribed two or more antihistamines. In multivariate logistic regression model, age was found to be significantly (P<0.001) associated with multiple antihistamine prescription (OR=1.042, 95%CI=1.02 to 1.06). Years of graduation of attending physician for more than 5 years was also a strong predictor of multiple antihistamine prescription (OR=4.654, 95%CI=2.20 to 9.84, P<0.001).

We hypothesized that altered systemic glucose metabolism as a consequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, contributes to TB pathogenesis, and when normalized with anti-glycemic drugs would improve clinical outcomes. To test this hypothesis, guinea pigs were treated daily with the anti-diabetic drug metformin starting 4 weeks prior or concurrent with aerosol exposure to the H37Rv strain of Mtb. In the chronic stages of infection, Mtb infected metformin-treated animals had restored systemic insulin sensitivity but remained glucose intolerant as determined by oral glucose tolerance testing. Despite persistent glucose intolerance, metformin-treated guinea pigs had a 2.8-fold reduction in lung lesion burden and a 0.7 log decrease in CFUs. An alternative hypothesis that metformin treatment improved clinical disease by having a direct effect on immune cell energy metabolism was tested using extracellular flux analysis and flow cytometry. The proinflammatory immune response to Mtb infection in untreated guinea pigs was associated with a marked increase in energy metabolism (glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which was normalized in metformin-treated guinea pigs. Moreover, both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from Mtb infected, metformin treated animals maintained a more normal mitochondrial membrane potential while those isolated from untreated animals had persistent mitochondrial hyperpolarization. These data suggest that metformin promotes natural host resistance to Mtb infection by maintaining immune cell metabolic homeostasis and function during the chronic stages of active TB disease.","Frenkel, Jessica D Haugen; Ackart, David F; Todd, Alexandra K; DiLisio, James E; Hoffman, Siana; Tanner, Samantha; Kiran, Dilara; Murray, Megan; Chicco, Adam; Obregón-Henao, Andrés; Podell, Brendan K; Basaraba, Randall J",Scientific reports,70,1

Mature females were divided into 4 groups, thus being maintained for 96 h in one of the following conditions: control at neutral pH (Ctr); Al at neutral pH (Al); acidic pH (Ac), and Al at acidic pH (Al-Ac). pH alone did not influence Al bioconcentration in the brain. The animals from the Al-Ac group bioconcentrated more Al in the ovaries than those from the Al group, while no differences were observed in the liver. Aluminum bioconcentration was higher in the brain than in the liver and ovaries in Al-exposed animals (Al and Al-Ac), and higher in the brain than in the ovaries in the Ctr and Ac groups. The liver bioconcentrates more Al than the ovaries in the females from the Ctr and Ac groups. Aluminum and/or acidic pH did not alter βfsh gene expression, while βlh gene expression decreased in females from the Al group. Aluminum acted as an endocrine disruptor, suggesting deleterious effects in reproduction that could result in ovulation failure. Aluminum can act directly and/or indirectly in the pituitary, affecting ovarian steroidogenesis and altering the reproductive endocrine axis of mature O. niloticus females in an acute period of exposure.","de Moraes Narcizo, Amanda; Correia, Tiago Gabriel; Bianchini, Adalto; Mayer, Mário Gustavo; Zampieri, Ricardo Andrade; Floeter-Winter, Lucile Maria; Moreira, Renata Guimarães",Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we specifically explored if aberrant histone methylation occurs in fetal endothelial cells in preeclampsia. Strikingly, we found that increased di-, and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) expression were associated with upregulation of methyltransferase G9a and downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and CuZn-SOD expression in preeclamptic HUVECs. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced hypermethylation of H3K9 and reduced CuZn-SOD expression mimicked what were seen in preeclamptic HUVECs and inhibition of G9a could attenuate these hypoxia-induced adverse events. Our study was the first to identify hypermethylation status in fetal endothelial cells in preeclampsia, which provides plausible evidence that increased oxidative stress in the intrauterine environment is likely a mechanism to induce aberrant histone modification in fetal endothelial cells which may have a significant impact on fetal programming in preeclampsia.","Sheng, Wenji; Gu, Yang; Chu, Xiaodan; Morgan, John A; Cooper, Danielle B; Lewis, David F; McCathran, Charles E; Wang, Yuping",Journal of cellular physiology,70,31

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of US national database. SETTING American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) from 2005 to 2017. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A recently published study that used the NSQIP database to compare outcomes after head and neck free tissue transfer between plastic surgeons and otolaryngologists was reproduced. Different approaches to case selection and statistical analysis were evaluated and their effects on statistical significance and study conclusions were compared. RESULTS When all cases of free tissue transfer, captured in NSQIP between 2005 and 2017, were compared between plastic surgery and otolaryngology, plastic surgery patients appeared to have lower rates of complications and length of stay. However, a more in-depth analysis demonstrated that these results were confounded by older and sicker otolaryngology patients. A second analysis of the same NSQIP data, limited to only head and neck oncologic reconstructions, demonstrated that otolaryngology patients had fewer complications on univariate and multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION We demonstrated how case selection and analysis can significantly affect results. It is incumbent upon researchers who use NSQIP and other publicly available data sets to fully detail their methodology to allow other researchers to reproduce and evaluate their work and for the journal editorial process to carefully evaluate the methodology and conclusions of their contributing authors.","Bur, Andrés M; Villwock, Mark R; Nallani, Rohit; Gomez, Ernest D; Varvares, Mark A; Villwock, Jennifer A; Cannady, Steven B; Wax, Mark K",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,70,31

Participation in the quality assurance study is voluntary. RESULTS Since 2005, 3,453 gastric banding procedures have been performed at 88 hospitals. The mean age of patients was 40.7 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 45.2 kg/m2. BMI and comorbidities are significantly higher in male patients. Regarding gender-specific aspects, there are no significant differences in the perioperative complication rates. The amelioration rate of comorbidities in male patients is lower than in female patients. CONCLUSION Gastric banding in Germany is generally performed in patients with a BMI below 45 kg/m2. The perioperative complication rate is low.

Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) typically provides wireless imaging of small bowel. Currently, a variety of quantitative measurements are implemented in commercially available hardware/software. The majority is proprietary and hence undisclosed algorithms. Measurement of amount of luminal contamination allows calculating scores from whole VCE studies. Other scores express the severity of small bowel lesions in Crohn׳s disease or the degree of villous atrophy in celiac disease. Image processing with numerous algorithms of textural and color feature extraction is further in the research focuses for automated image analysis. These tools aim to select single images with relevant lesions as blood, ulcers, polyps and tumors or to omit images showing only luminal contamination. Analysis of motility pattern, size measurement and determination of capsule localization are additional topics. Non-visual wireless capsules transmitting data acquired with specific sensors from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are available for clinical routine. This includes pH measurement in the esophagus for the diagnosis of acid gastro-esophageal reflux. A wireless motility capsule provides GI motility analysis on the basis of pH, pressure, and temperature measurement. Electromagnetically tracking of another motility capsule allows visualization of motility. However, measurement of substances by GI capsules is of great interest but still at an early stage of development.","Keuchel, M; Kurniawan, N; Baltes, P; Bandorski, D; Koulaouzidis, A",Computers in biology and medicine,70,17

PURPOSE To examine the effects of a plasma-sprayed titanium coated PEEK on the mechanical and histologic properties at the bone-implant interface. STUDY SETTING A preclinical laboratory study. METHODS Polyetheretherketone and plasma-sprayed titanium coated PEEK implants (Ti-bond; Spinal Elements, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were placed in a line-to-line manner in cortical bone and in a press-fit manner in cancellous bone of adult sheep using an established ovine model. Shear strength was assessed in the cortical sites at 4 and 12 weeks, whereas histology was performed in cortical and cancellous sites at both time points. RESULTS The titanium coating dramatically improved the shear strength at the bone-implant interface at 4 weeks and continued to improve with time compared with PEEK. Direct bone ongrowth in cancellous and cortical sites can be achieved using a plasma-sprayed titanium coating on PEEK. CONCLUSIONS Direct bone to implant bonding can be achieved on PEEK in spite of its hydrophobic nature using a plasma-sprayed titanium coating. The plasma-sprayed titanium coating improved mechanical properties in the cortical sites and the histology in cortical and cancellous sites.","Walsh, William R; Bertollo, Nicky; Christou, Chrisopher; Schaffner, Dominik; Mobbs, Ralph J",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,70,27

There are numerous reports of viral, parasitic, fungal, and bacterial transmission through transplantation. At the same time, immunosuppression increases the risk of infection in organ recipients, so attribution of infectious diseases to the transplanted organ is often difficult. METHOD Review of the English-language literature. RESULTS The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network states that all potential deceased organ donors must be assessed for conditions that may influence donor acceptance. The infections most often transmitted knowingly to organ recipients are cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus. There was a 43% increase in the number of potential donor-derived transmission events between 2012 and 2013, but this affected only 3% of transplants; and the patterns of unexpected infection transmissions have remained fairly constant. The 2013 recognition of a case of raccoon rabies in a kidney recipient brought the risk of untested pathogens back into the general discussion of disease transmission. Also, unexpected transmissions of parasitic infection have resulted in highly visible recipient deaths. CONCLUSIONS Organ transplantation has been an enormous advance in the treatment of chronic diseases, but the risk of unanticipated disease transmission has been gaining attention. The task for the organ donation community is to assess risk of transmission of clinically relevant diseases accurately without substantially diminishing organ availability.","Kirchner, Varvara A; Pruett, Timothy L",Surgical infections,70,17
87763,87763,87763,Respiratory viruses in bronchoalveolar lavage: a hospital-based cohort study in adults.,14.111668,9.041397,2009,"BACKGROUND Globally, mobile learning (mLearning) tools have attracted considerable attention as a means of continuous training for healthcare workers. Rwanda like other low-resource settings with scarce in-service training opportunities requires innovative approaches that adapt technology to context to improve healthcare workers' knowledge and skills. One such innovation is the safe delivery application (SDA), a smartphone mLearning application for Basic Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (BEmONC) content. This study assessed the effect of the SDA intervention on nurses' and midwives' knowledge and skills for the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and neonatal resuscitation (NR). METHODS The study used a pre-post test design to compare knowledge and skills of nurses and midwives in the management of PPH and NR at two measurement points: immediately prior to SDA intervention and after 6 months of SDA intervention. The intervention took place in two district hospitals in Rwanda and included 54 participants. A paired-sample t-test was used to measure the pre-post intervention, mean knowledge and skills scores differences. Confidence intervals (CIs) and effect size were calculated. A t-test and a one-way Anova were used to test for potential confounders. RESULTS The analysis included 54 participants. Knowledge scores and skills scores on PPH management and NR increased significantly from baseline to endline measurements. The mean difference for PPH knowledge is 17.1 out of 100; 95% CI 14.69 to 19.49 and 2.6% for PPH skills; 95% CI 1.01 to 4.25. The mean difference for NR knowledge is 19.1 out of 100; 95% CI 16.31 to 21.76 and 5.5% for NR skills; 95% CI 3.66 to 7.41. Increases were unaffected by participants' attendance to in-service training 6 months prior and during SDA intervention and previous smartphone use. However, pre- and post-intervention skills scores were significantly different by years of experience in obstetric care. CONCLUSION The SDA intervention improved the knowledge and skills of nurses and midwives on the management of PPH and NR as long as 6 months after SDA introduction. The results are highly relevant in low-income countries like Rwanda, where quality of delivery care is challenged by a lack of in-service continuous training for healthcare providers.","Nishimwe, Aurore; Ibisomi, Latifat; Nyssen, Marc; Conco, Daphney Nozizwe",Human resources for health,70,26

We aimed to summarize the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the pandemic and explore the risk factors of disease progression. METHODS We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, searching three databases for studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. We used random-effects models to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of pooled estimated prevalence and the odds ratio between the severe and nonsevere cases. RESULTS Ninety studies involving 16,526 COVID-19 patients were included. Hypertension (19.1%) and diabetes (9.5%) were the most common comorbidities. The most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (78.4%), cough (58.5%), and fatigue (26.4%). Increased serum ferritin (74.2%), high C-reactive protein (73.3%), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (72.2%) were the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities. Most patients had bilateral lung involvement (82.2%) and showed peripheral (66.9%) and subpleural (62.1%) distribution, with multifocal involvement (73.1%). And the most common CT features were vascular enlargement (64.3%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (60.7%), and thickened interlobular septa (55.1%). Respiratory failure was the most common complication (30.7%) and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 4.2%. Moreover, male, history of smoking, and comorbidities might influence the prognosis. Most clinical symptoms such as fever, high fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, and abdominal pain were linked to the severity of disease. Some specific laboratory indicators implied the deterioration of disease, such as leucocytosis, lymphopenia, platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and D-dimer. Besides, the risk of bilateral pneumonia, consolidation, pleural effusion, and enlarged mediastinal nodes was higher in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS Most COVID-19 patients have fever and cough with lymphopenia and increased inflammatory indices, and the main CT feature is GGO involved bilateral lung. Patients with comorbidities and worse clinical symptoms, laboratory characteristics, and CT findings tend to have poor disease progression.","Xie, Jingyuan; Wang, Qin; Xu, Yangyang; Zhang, Tianli; Chen, Lu; Zuo, Xueying; Liu, Jiaxin; Huang, Litang; Zhan, Ping; Lv, Tangfeng; Song, Yong",Annals of palliative medicine,70,28

The popular and scholarly narratives regarding sport specialization challenge the adaptive nature of this practice. However, the lack of synthesis of youth sport specialization research makes existing practical recommendations potentially tenuous. This scoping review utilized a multidisciplinary lens to survey and integrate the full spectrum of youth sport specialization research by summarizing empirical findings and examining the characteristics of empirical research (e.g., field of publication, participant role, study design). Multiple databases were utilized to span the various disciplines in which sport specialization has been studied. The systematic review protocol yielded 906 publications for screening. After analysis of these records through inclusion/exclusion criteria, 40 empirical research publications examining youth sport specialization were included in this review. Analysis of these empirical findings indicated two higher-order emerging themes of this research: 1) Sport specialization participation behaviours; 2) Sport specialization outcomes. Descriptive results of the research characteristics are also explored. This review examined key findings that underlie recommendations for structuring youth sport participation, and highlighted future research avenues vital towards a more holistic understanding of this phenomenon.","DiSanti, Justin S; Erickson, Karl",Journal of sports sciences,70,7

DESIGN This is a cross-sectional study of completed rehabilitation clinical trials investigating the number and percentage of women, older adults, and racial and/or ethnic minorities enrolled in rehabilitation clinical trials between January 1, 2011 and January 1, 2020. Secondary outcome measures were inclusion by diagnostic group, as well as International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health category, and intervention by diagnostic group. RESULTS Of the 108 studies meeting inclusion criteria, a majority (69%) were based in the United States (US). Stroke was the most frequent diagnostic group, followed by musculoskeletal conditions. 96% of US based trials included at least one female participant in their study, but among specific diagnostic groups, this ranged from 5-73%. Age information was reported inconsistently; however, of the trials reporting age, 100% of cardiac trials included older adults while no spinal cord injury trials included them. Among trials based in the US reporting race, 70% of participants were White, followed by 20% Black or African American and 1% Asian. Among trials based in the US reporting ethnicity, Hispanic or Latino participants were underrepresented overall and among each diagnostic group. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we found that among participants of rehabilitation clinical trials women, older individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities were generally underrepresented. In contrast, Black or African American participants were overrepresented with the exception of cardiac trials. An important finding was that many trials did not report age and/or race/ethnicity. Investigators should aim to include underrepresented populations and improve reporting.","Silver, Julie K; Flores, Laura E; González, Antonio Mondriguez; Frontera, Walter R",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,70,19

Specifically, we consider a distributed population with logistic growth at each location, subject to ""seascape"" noise, wherein the population's fitness randomly varies with location and time. Despite its simplicity, the model actually incorporates variants of directed percolation, and directed polymers in random media, within a mean-field perspective. Probability distributions of the population can be computed self-consistently, and the extinction transition is shown to exhibit novel critical behavior with exponents dependent on the ratio of the strengths of migration and noise amplitudes. The results are compared and contrasted with the more conventional choice of demographic noise due to stochastic changes in reproduction.","Ottino-Löffler, Bertrand; Kardar, Mehran",Physical review.

Patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after cardiac arrest may represent a sizeable subgroup of deceased organ donors, as they often progress to brain death or have life-sustaining therapy withdrawn. We aimed to quantify deceased organ donation after CPR in Switzerland for the first time by analysing the characteristics of potential and utilised organ donors after CPR. METHODS Data on deceased adult and paediatric patients who were reported to and approved by Swisstransplant for organ donation were analysed, including both donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after controlled cardiocirculatory death (cDCD) from 2016 to 2018. We analysed baseline characteristics of potential donors who underwent CPR in the context of their hospitalisation, as compared with donors without prior CPR. Considering the varying characteristics between these two donor groups, we assessed the effect of CPR on different allocation outcomes (donor and organ utilisation, organ yield per utilised donor) using multivariable regression. Additionally, we present selected CPR circumstances and compared different subgroups of CPR donors according to duration of CPR and duration of no-flow time. RESULTS Of the 461 deceased potential organ donors included in the analysis, 173 (37.5%) underwent CPR. CPR donors were, on average, younger (median age 53 vs 62, p <0.001), had different causes of death (p <0.001), and were more often of the cDCD type (30.1% vs 18.4%, p = 0.004) as compared with non-CPR donors. Of the 173 CPR donors, 152 (87.9%) could be utilised (minimum one organ transplanted), and in the multivariable analysis, utilisation rate was higher in the CPR donor group than in the non-CPR donor group (odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1–11.5; p = 0.046). Organ specific utilisation of heart, liver, and kidney, and total organ yield per donor, did not differ significantly between CPR and non-CPR donors. CONCLUSION Our study reveals that a substantial proprotion of deceased organ donors in Switzerland underwent CPR in context of their hospitalisation. CPR donors are different from non-CPR donors with respect to age, cause of death and donation type. However, when carefully selected according to their haemodynamic condition, CPR donors are comparable to non-CPR donors in terms of donor and organ utilisation, as well as the average organ yield. Thus, all patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest but who subsequently progress to death should be evaluated for organ donation. How CPR donors compare with non-CPR donors regarding transplant outcomes should be studied further.","Gottschalk, Mirjam; Elmer, Andreas; Benden, Christian; Beyeler, Franziska; Immer, Franz",Swiss medical weekly,70,5

In addition, the level of satisfaction of patients and patient's family after PEG remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the current status of PEG and the level of satisfaction of patients and patients' families after PEG in Japan. METHODS We reviewed the existing data of all patients who underwent PEG tube insertion at Yuri Kumiai General Hospital (Akita, Japan) between February 2000 and December 2010. We examined the following points: underlying diseases requiring PEG, levels of consciousness, and performance status. We also sent a questionnaire to the patients and patient's families to ask about their satisfaction with and thoughts about PEG. RESULTS The data of 545 patients who underwent PEG were reviewed. There were 295 men and 250 women, with a mean age of 77.2 ± 11.4 years. PEG was indicated most frequently for cerebrovascular disorders (48.2%, 239/545). There were 515 (94.4%, 515/545) patients showing consciousness disturbance and 444 (81.5%, 444/545) bedridden patients. The questionnaire was answered by one patient himself and 316 patients' families. When asked, ""Was performing PEG a good decision?"", 57.5% (182/316) of the patients' families answered yes. Meanwhile, when patients' family members were asked if they would wish to undergo PEG if they were in the same condition as the patient, 28.4% (90/316) answered yes, whereas 55.3% (175/316) answered no. CONCLUSIONS Few patients were able to make their own decision about PEG tube placement because of consciousness disturbance. As a result, many family members of the patients did not want to experience PEG for themselves. Future studies should be performed to clarify the quality of life and ethical aspects associated with PEG.","Kusano, Chika; Yamada, Nobuo; Kikuchi, Kenji; Hashimoto, Masaji; Gotoda, Takuji",Journal of rural medicine : JRM,70,31

We have examined the impact of CG168 on referral practice for patients with bleeding varicose veins from primary to secondary care in a local NHS service. METHODS Referrals to a local vascular service in the 6 years before (Group 1) and 6 years after (Group 2) publication of CG168 were analysed to assess patients' management following a bleed, with particular reference to a patient's initial presentation and delays in referral to the vascular service. This was done by retrospective electronic database and case-note interrogation of patients presenting with bleeding varicose veins. Relevant data was collected onto an Excel spread sheet in relation to demographic information, comorbidities, clinical presentation and treatment pathway. RESULTS 73 patients presented with bleeding varicose veins during the period studied. Their mean age was 66 and 56% were men. Their mean BMI was 28. Of note Thirty-three patients (45%) initially self-treated, before going to see their General Practitioner (GP), another 18 (25%) went to the Emergency department (ED). In 51 patients (70%) the underlying superficial pathology involved the great saphenous vein (GSV) and most patients (73%) were treated with foam sclerotherapy with or without truncal thermal ablation. 45 patients (Group 1) were treated in the 6 years before CG168 and 28 patients, allowing 6 months for dissemination, were treated in the 6 years after CG168 (Group 2). Mean time from index bleed to referral to the vascular service was faster after CG168 (84 days pre and 20 days post CG168). P=0.00842. Publication of CG168 was also associated with reduced mean bleed to intervention times (194 vs 60 days P=0.00097). CONCLUSIONS Publication of UK NICE guidelines CG 168 has been associated with a significant reduction in the delay to referral of patients presenting with bleeding varicose veins however the goal of immediate referral to a vascular service is not being met. CG168 is likely to have been a significant component of the factors that have led to the improvements seen thus far.","Cragg, James; Nyamekye, Isaac",Journal of vascular surgery.

Previous studies reveal that a molecular analysis of PLpro indicates the catalytic activity of viral PLpro and its interactions with ubiquitin. METHODS By using sequence comparisons, molecular models and protein-protein interaction maps, PLpro was compared in the three recorded fatal CoV epidemics, which involved SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. RESULTS The pairwise sequence comparison of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro indicated similarity percentages of 82.59% and 30.06% with SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro , respectively. In comparison with SARS-CoV PLpro , in SARS-CoV-2, the PLpro had a conserved catalytic triad of C111, H278 and D293, with a slightly lower number of polar interface residues and of hydrogen bonds, a higher number of buried interface sizes and a lower number of residues that interact with ubiquitin and PLpro . These features might contribute to a similar or slightly lower level of deubiquitinating activity in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro . It was, however, a much higher level compared to MERS-CoV, which contained amino acid mutations and a low number of polar interfaces. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro showed almost the same catalytic site profiles, interface area compositions and polarities, suggesting a general similarity in deubiquitination activity. Compared with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 had a higher potential for binding interactions with ubiquitin. These estimated parameters contribute to the knowledge gap in understanding how the new virus interacts with the immune system. This article is protected by copyright.

This review examined data from 87 peer-reviewed and non-academic documents to determine the characteristics that support the transition process and to identify opportunities for system and program improvement. Data were extracted and synthesized using a descriptive analytic framework. A major finding of this review is a significant lack of measurable indicators in the academic and gray literature. This review did identify 26 core components organized within the framework of the six core elements of healthcare transitions. Policy makers, practitioners, and administrators can use the core components to guide decisions about transition program and intervention content. Confirmation of the impact of these core program components on youth outcomes awaits the conduct of rigorous randomized trials.

Setting The First Hospital of Changsha, First People's Hospital of Huaihua, and the Central Hospital of Loudi, Hunan province, China. Methods This was a retrospective multi-center case-series analysis. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized at the study centers from January 17 to February 10, 2020, were included. The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments. Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men. The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days. Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group. Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count. The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%). Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon α2b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription. The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-α2b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously. Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter. We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-α2b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.","Huang, Qiong; Deng, Xuanyu; Li, Yongzhong; Sun, Xuexiong; Chen, Qiong; Xie, Mingxuan; Liu, Shao; Qu, Hui; Liu, Shouxian; Wang, Ling; He, Gefei; Gong, Zhicheng",International journal of clinical pharmacy,70,19

METHODS Prospective cohort study of blinded rScO2 measurements within a randomized controlled trial of management of hypotension (HIP trial) in extremely preterm infants. rScO2, mean arterial blood pressure, duration of cerebral hypoxia, and transfer function (TF) gain inversely proportional to CAR, were compared between hypotensive infants randomized to receive dopamine or placebo and between hypotensive and non-hypotensive infants, and related to early intraventricular hemorrhage or death. RESULTS In 89 potentially eligible HIP trial patients with rScO2 measurements, the duration of cerebral hypoxia was significantly higher in 36 hypotensive compared to 53 non-hypotensive infants. In 29/36 hypotensive infants (mean GA 25 weeks, 69% males) receiving the study drug, no significant difference in rScO2 was observed after dopamine (n = 13) compared to placebo (n = 16). Duration of cerebral hypoxia was associated with early intraventricular hemorrhage or death. Calculated TF gain (n = 49/89) was significantly higher reflecting decreased CAR in 16 hypotensive compared to 33 non-hypotensive infants. CONCLUSIONS Dopamine had no effect on rScO2 compared to placebo in hypotensive infants. Hypotension and cerebral hypoxia are associated with early intraventricular hemorrhage or death. IMPACT Treatment of hypotension with dopamine in extremely preterm infants increases mean arterial blood pressure, but does not improve cerebral oxygenation. Hypotensive extremely preterm infants have increased duration of cerebral hypoxia and reduced cerebral autoregulatory capacity compared to non-hypotensive infants. Duration of cerebral hypoxia and hypotension are associated with early intraventricular hemorrhage or death in extremely preterm infants. Since systematic treatment of hypotension may not be associated with better outcomes, the diagnosis of cerebral hypoxia in hypotensive extremely preterm infants might guide treatment.","Thewissen, Liesbeth; Naulaers, Gunnar; Hendrikx, Dries; Caicedo, Alexander; Barrington, Keith; Boylan, Geraldine; Cheung, Po-Yin; Corcoran, David; El-Khuffash, Afif; Garvey, Aisling; Macko, Jozef; Marlow, Neil; Miletin, Jan; O'Donnell, Colm P F; O'Toole, John M; Straňák, Zbyněk; Van Laere, David; Wiedermannova, Hana; Dempsey, Eugene",Pediatric research,70,1

The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for detection of COVID-19 are heavy models that may not be easy to deploy in commonly utilized mobile platforms in point-of-care testing. In this work, we develop a light weight mobile friendly efficient deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 using lung ultrasound images. Three different classes including COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy were included in this task. The developed network, named as Mini-COVIDNet, was bench-marked with other light weight neural network models along with state-of-the-art heavy model. It was shown that the proposed network can achieve the highest accuracy of 83.2% and requires training time of only 24 minutes. The proposed Mini-COVIDNet has 4.39 times less number of parameters in the network compared to its next best performing network and requires a memory of only 51.29 MB, making the point-of-care detection of COVID-19 using lung ultrasound imaging plausible on a mobile platform. Deployment of these light weight networks on embedded platforms shows that the proposed Mini-COVIDNet is highly versatile and provides optimal performance in terms of being accurate as well as having latency in the same order as other light weight networks.

Objective: To identify and synthesize potential mechanisms of intergenerational trauma transmission in forcibly displaced families where parents have experienced direct war-related trauma exposure, but children have no history of direct trauma exposure. Methods: PRISMA systematic review guidelines were adhered to. Searches were conducted across seven major databases and included quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods literature from 1945 to 2019. The search resulted in 752 citations and 8 studies (n = 1,684) met review inclusion criteria. Results: Findings suggest that parental trauma exposure and trauma sequelae indirectly affect child well-being via potential mechanisms of insecure attachment; maladaptive parenting styles; diminished parental emotional availability; decreased family functioning; accumulation of family stressors; dysfunctional intra-family communication styles and severity of parental symptomology. Conclusion: Further research is needed to assess independent intergenerational effects and mechanisms of trauma transmission in this population.","Flanagan, Natalie; Travers, Aine; Vallières, Frederique; Hansen, Maj; Halpin, Rory; Sheaf, Greg; Rottmann, Nina; Johnsen, Anna Thit",European journal of psychotraumatology,70,19

Total cfDNA is constituted by both cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) originated mainly from the placenta, and maternal cfDNA derived from maternal leukocytes. Methods A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed and Medline. Literature reporting levels of total cfDNA in the development of PE was included. Studies that only reported cffDNA, but no cfDNA concentrations were not included in this review. Results Eight studies were included. Seven reported values of cfDNA in PE patients, regardless of early or late onset PE, six of which demonstrated a significant increase of cfDNA in patients who subsequently developed PE. Seven studies evaluated cfDNA levels in the first trimester, six of which showed significant increase of cfDNA concentrations in women who later developed PE. Five studies investigated cfDNA levels in the second trimester, all presenting increased total cfDNA levels in the PE group compared with normal controls. Conclusion Total cfDNA may play a role as a biochemical marker of PE, compared with fetal cfDNA. Large prospective studies with homogeneous populations and standardized methodology are needed to further confirm its predictive value.","Wu, Yi; Werlang, Ana; Cheng, Weiwei; Lanes, Andrea; Wen, Shi Wu; Walker, Mark",AJP reports,70,7

However, there are many aspects of dementia care that GPs find challenging. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) affect the majority of people with dementia and is an aspect of dementia care that GPs find particularly difficult to manage. The aim of this mixed methods systematic review is to undertake a synthesis of qualitative and quantitative studies on GPs' knowledge, attitudes and experiences of managing BPSD. METHODS Seven electronic bibliographic databases will be searched from inception to present. All qualitative or quantitative studies that explore the knowledge, attitude or experiences of GPs towards the management of BPSD in community and/or residential settings will be eligible for inclusion. A meta-ethnography will be conducted to synthesise included studies. Primary outcome measures will include GPs' experiences of managing BPSD, GPs' knowledge of BPSD and their attitude to different approaches to the management of BPSD, in particular their attitude to non-pharmacological approaches. All included papers will be independently assessed for methodological validity by two reviewers using the following tools: the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for qualitative research, the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool for intervention studies and the National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational and analytical cross-sectional studies. As there is no agreed quality assessment tool for descriptive cross-sectional studies, an original tool will be developed. Two independent reviewers will apply the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) tool to the review findings. The results will be reported in line with the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement. DISCUSSION This study will be the first systematic review that synthesises the existing literature of GPs' knowledge, attitudes and experiences of managing BPSD in community and residential care. This review will improve our understanding of GPs' perspectives on the management of BPSD, and the results will be used to inform the development of an intervention to improve the management of BPSD in general practice.

Triangle laparoscopy is considered a noncarcinologic option due to the risk of tumoral spreading through the lateral ports into the abdominal wall muscles. Open surgery is therefore often needed to characterize PC. A minimally invasive approach would be progress. METHODS We aimed to compare access rates to elective sites of PC using natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) with those using single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS). Sixteen acute experiments were performed in a live porcine model. Back-to-back NOTES and SPLS standardized peritoneoscopy were conducted in a cross-over design. Access rates to 11 elective sites of PC were considered as end points based on operators' consensus and necropsy verification. RESULTS Access to the targets was successful in 89 % with NOTES and 80 % with SPLS (p = 0.27). NOTES and SPLS achieved a 100 % access rate to the diaphragmatic domes and paracolic gutters, to the splenic area, to the pelvic floor, and to the trigonal bladder (p > 0.99). Access rates of NOTES versus SPLS to other elective sites of PC were the following: mesentery root (94 % vs. 0 %, p < 0.001), inferior mesenteric vein origin (88 % vs. 0 %, p < 0.001), inferior vena cava (88 % vs. 75 %, p = 0.85), and hepatic pedicle (8 % vs. 100 %, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Both transgastric NOTES and SPLS provided quick and easy access to most elective sites of PC, except for the mesenteric vessel root (better achieved by NOTES) and the hepatic pedicle (better achieved by SPLS). Both techniques could be improved or combined to overcome their specific drawbacks.","Ladjici, Yamina; Pocard, Marc; Marteau, Philippe; Valleur, Patrice; Dray, Xavier",Surgical endoscopy,70,16

Most are viral and self-limited, yet these infections are commonly treated with antibiotics thus contributing to the increase in resistance. Historically, infectious disease diagnostics have focused on identification of the microbial culprit at the site of infection but the specificity of host response as measured by the host transcriptome, now enables us to classify the etiology of infection agnostic to pathogen class. The ability to rapidly determine whether a similar set of symptoms is due to a virus, bacteria, or other agent from a common specimen (blood) will have far-reaching public health benefits, and further research is warranted to transfer this technology into the clinical setting.","Hudson, Lori L; Woods, Christopher W; Ginsburg, Geoffrey S",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,70,16

METHODS Between June 2015 and August 2016, a marker clip was placed at a clinically positive ALN under ultrasonography (US) guidance before initiation of NAC in 20 patients. Preoperative localization of marker-clipped LNs was performed, and the localized LNs were removed by SLNB. We compared the postoperative results of the marker-clipped LNs, SLNs and ALNs. RESULTS Image-guided marker-clip placements and localization of marker-clipped LNs were performed successfully in 20 patients. A total of 24 marker clips were inserted, and 23 marker-clipped LNs were successfully retrieved during surgery (identification rate, 23/24, 95.8%). In the 11 patients with pathologically confirmed metastatic marker-clipped LNs, four became negative after NAC, and seven maintained metastatic residues on the marker-clipped LNs. Three of the seven patients had metastatic residues on the ALNs, and two of the three patients also had negative SLNs. Marker-clipped nodes accurately predicted the axillary nodal status in these two patients compared with SLNs alone. CONCLUSION Image-guided marker-clip placement on positive ALNs before NAC and removal with SLNB is technically feasible. This technique can improve the accuracy of the residual disease evaluation on the axilla, especially in patients with negative SLNB results, and can identify candidates for limited axillary surgery after NAC.","Kim, Eun Young; Byon, Woo Seok; Lee, Kwan Ho; Yun, Ji-Sup; Park, Yong Lai; Park, Chan Heun; Youn, In Young; Choi, Seon Hyeong; Choi, Yoon Jung; Kook, Shin Ho; Do, Sung-Im",World journal of surgery,70,31

These inhibitors are narrow-spectrum agents that can cause resistance development. Viruses are dependent on host cellular proteins, including kinases, for progression of their life-cycle. Thus, targeting kinases is an important therapeutic approach to discovering broad-spectrum antiviral agents. As there are a large number of FDA approved kinase inhibitors for various indications, their repurposing for viral infections is an attractive and time-sparing strategy. Many kinase inhibitors, including baricitinib, ruxolitinib, imatinib, tofacitinib, pacritinib, zanubrutinib, and ibrutinib, are under clinical investigation for COVID-19.

AIM To explore bereaved relatives' experiences of quality of care and family support provided during the last days of life; to identify the impact of factors associated with perceived support. DESIGN A national, observational, open online survey was developed and disseminated via social media, public fora and professional networks (June-September 2020). Validated instruments and purposively designed questions assessed experiences. Analysis used descriptive statistics, logistic regression and thematic analysis of free-text responses. PARTICIPANTS Individuals (⩾18 years) who had experienced the death of a relative/friend (all care settings) within the United Kingdome during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Respondents (n = 278, mean 53.4 years) tended to be female (n = 216, 78%); over half were 'son/daughter' (174, 62.6%) to the deceased. Deceased individuals (mean 81.6 years) most frequently died in their 'usual place of care' (n = 192, 69.3%). Analysis established five conceptual themes affecting individualised care: (1) public health restrictions compounding the distress of 'not knowing'; (2) disparate views about support from doctors and nurses; (3) challenges in communication and level of preparedness for the death; (4) delivery of compassionate care; (5) emotional needs and potential impact on grief. Male respondents (OR 2.9, p = 0.03) and those able to visit (OR 2.2, p = 0.04) were independently associated with good perceptions of family support. CONCLUSION Despite public health restrictions, individualised care can be enabled by proactive, informative communication; recognising dying in a timely manner and facilitating the ability to be present before death.","Mayland, Catriona R; Hughes, Rosemary; Lane, Steven; McGlinchey, Tamsin; Donnellan, Warren; Bennett, Kate; Hanna, Jeffrey; Rapa, Elizabeth; Dalton, Louise; Mason, Stephen R",Palliative medicine,70,29

Here, given the interaction of viruses with macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), a CQ-sensitive anti-viral safeguard pathway, we would like to discuss the pros, but also the cons concerning the current therapeutic options targeting this process.","Brest, Patrick; Benzaquen, Jonathan; Klionsky, Daniel J; Hofman, Paul; Mograbi, Baharia",Autophagy,70,16

Patients who received topical anaesthesia via the atomiser, compared with boluses via the fibreoptic scope, reported a better median (IQR [range]) level of comfort: 1 (1-3 [1-10]) vs. 4 (2-6 [1-10]), p < 0.0001; experienced a reduced total number of coughs: 6 (3-10 [0-34]) vs. 11 (6-13 [0-25]), p = 0.0055; and fewer distinct coughing episodes: 7% vs. 27% respectively, p = 0.0133. The atomiser technique was quicker: 5 (3-6 [2-12]) min vs. 6 (5-7 [2-15]) min, p = 0.0009; and required less topical lidocaine: 100 mg (100-100 [80-160]) vs. 200 mg (200-200 [200-200]), p < 0.0001. Four weeks after nasal intubation, the incidence of nasal pain was less in the atomiser group compared with the control group (8% vs. 50%, p = 0.0015). We conclude that the atomiser was superior to bolus application for awake fibreoptic tracheal intubation.","Pirlich, N; Lohse, J A; Schmidtmann, I; Didion, N; Piepho, T; Noppens, R R",Anaesthesia,70,19

The treatment continued for 3 months in both groups. The SNOT-22 (Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22) score, polyp grade, and right ventricular and pulmonary arterial functions were recorded in both groups before and after 3 months of the intervention. RESULTS Both groups had significant improvement in SNOT-22 scores after 3 months of intervention. Both groups showed improvement in cardiac functions, but statistical significance was found only in subjects who underwent surgery. CONCLUSION Nasal polyp affects cardiac functions, and this needs further evaluation and research through studies on large samples.","Dhiman, Sapna; Dhiman, Abhishek; Azad, Ramesh K; Negi, Prakash C; Lal, Bhushan; Thakur, Jagdeep S","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",70,24

As the rate of neonatal morbidity has remained stable, parents and health care professionals involved in the care of these infants often raise questions regarding the prevalence of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Existing data in the literature is heterogeneous and the reported prevalence of disability varies more than survival rates do. One of the key issues toward a better clinical management of ELBW infants is the knowledge of the nature of mortality and disability in this population of infants. Studies from individual centers report outcomes of ELBW infants and demonstrate several limitations as to the ways babies were treated. Advice to parents and decisions to be made regarding the care of these infants should be based on reliable, unbiased, and representative data drawn from geographically defined populations. Such data have recently become available.

The excess of cardiac deaths may be explained by the indirect consequences of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include a dramatic reduction of hospital admissions during the pandemic, particularly for acute coronary syndromes; an increase of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests; a reduction of outpatient clinic activities and cardiac procedures; long-term cardiovascular effects of COVID-19; and unfavorable cardiac effects of the lockdown imposed by the spread of COVID-19 infection.

Maintaining a clear field of vision is paramount in such procedures not only for safety by preventing inadvertent injury, but also to improve precision and reduce operative time. Laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF) is a major impediment to a clear visual field during laparoscopy and is caused by condensation as well as particulate debris, blood, and smoke accumulation on the scope lens. Despite many available techniques to improve vision during laparoscopy, available data on etiology and methods to improve vision have only sporadically been considered in the literature. The objective of this review was to summarize current literature on the etiology of LLF and other causes of poor vision during laparoscopy and also review the current approaches for minimizing or reducing such events. In summary, although the etiology of LLF is well understood, that is, temperature and humidity differences, the methods to reduce its occurrence lack significant data. Of those methods that are often espoused, most are not supported in the literature, such as warmed and humidified insufflation gas, or simply lack data, such as antifogging solutions.","Lawrentschuk, Nathan; Fleshner, Neil E; Bolton, Damien M",Journal of endourology,70,30

The molecular mechanisms driving checkpoint blockade resistance, whether pre-existing or evolved, remain unclear. To address this critical knowledge gap, we treated B16 melanoma with the combination of CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 blockade and a Flt3 ligand vaccine (≥75% curative), isolated tumors resistant to therapy, and serially passaged them in vivo with the same treatment regimen until they developed complete resistance. Using gene expression analysis and immunogenomics, we determined the adaptations associated with this resistance phenotype. Checkpoint resistance coincided with acquisition of a ""hypermetabolic"" phenotype characterized by coordinated upregulation of the glycolytic, oxidoreductase, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These resistant tumors flourished under hypoxic conditions whereas metabolically starved T cells lost glycolytic potential, effector function, and the ability to expand in response to immunotherapy. Further, we found that checkpoint resistant versus sensitive tumors could be separated by non-invasive MRI imaging based solely on their metabolic state. In a cohort of melanoma patients resistant to both CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade, we observed upregulation of pathways indicative of a similar hypermetabolic state. Together these data indicated that melanoma can evade T cell checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by adapting a hypermetabolic phenotype.","Jaiswal, Ashvin R; Liu, Arthur J; Pudakalakatti, Shivanand; Dutta, Prasanta; Jayaprakash, Priyamvada; Bartkowiak, Todd; Ager, Casey R; Wang, Zhi-Qiang; Reuben, Alexandre; Cooper, Zachary A; Ivan, Cristina; Ju, Zhenlin; Nwajei, Felix; Wang, Jing; Davies, Michael A; Davis, R Eric; Wargo, Jennifer A; Bhattacharya, Pratip K; Hong, David S; Curran, Michael A",Cancer immunology research,70,1

However, in up to 20% of the cases, mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers results in poor angiographic outcomes, with Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scores ≤2a. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether thrombus attenuation on the initial CT scan can predict the angiographic outcome of the recanalization procedure in MCA occlusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data of 70 patients with acute MCA occlusions who underwent endovascular treatment with stent retrievers in our department were included. We analyzed thrombus attenuations, angiographic outcome, and periprocedural thrombus fragmentation. RESULTS The mean thrombus attenuation was 49.8 ± 7.8 HU and the mean difference from the attenuation of the contralateral MCA was 9.9 ± 8.0 HU. There were no significant differences in the thrombus attenuations of occlusions that were successfully recanalized (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b) and those that were not. Neither were there significant correlations of thrombus attenuations and periprocedural thrombus fragmentations that occurred in 64.3%. We found a nonsignificantly higher rate of recanalizations with modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b when the difference from the attenuation of the contralateral MCA was between 1-20 HU. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to results of other revascularization procedures as published in a recent study, the angiographic result of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers is not predicted by thrombus attenuation.","Yilmaz, U; Roth, C; Reith, W; Papanagiotou, P",AJNR.

ARDS outcome depends on the lung injury severity within the first 24 hours of ARDS onset. We investigated whether two widely accepted cutoff values of PaO2/FIO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) would identify subsets of patients with ARDS for predicting outcome and guiding therapy. DESIGN A 16-month (September 2008 to January 2010) prospective, multicenter, observational study. SETTING Seventeen multidisciplinary ICUs in Spain. PATIENTS We studied 300 consecutive, mechanically ventilated patients meeting American-European Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 200 mm Hg) on PEEP greater than or equal to 5 cm H2O, and followed up until hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Based on threshold values for PaO2/FIO2 (150 mm Hg) and PEEP (10 cm H2O) at ARDS onset and at 24 hours, we assigned patients to four categories: group I (PaO2/FIO2 ≥ 150 on PEEP < 10), group II (PaO2/FIO2 ≥ 150 on PEEP ≥ 10), group III (PaO2/FIO2 < 150 on PEEP < 10), and group IV (PaO2/FIO2 < 150 on PEEP ≥ 10). The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Overall hospital mortality was 46.3%. Although at study entry, patients with PaO2/FIO2 less than 150 had a higher mortality than patients with a PaO2/FIO2 greater than or equal to 150 (p = 0.044), there was minimal variability in mortality among the four groups (p = 0.186). However, classification of patients in each group changed markedly after 24 hours of usual care. Group categorization at 24 hours provided a strong association with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.00001): group I had the lowest mortality (23.1%), whereas group IV had the highest mortality (60.3%). CONCLUSIONS The degree of lung dysfunction established by a PaO2/FIO2 of 150 mm Hg and a PEEP of 10 cm H2O demonstrated that ARDS is not a homogeneous disorder. Rather, it is a series of four subsets that should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials and for guiding therapy. A major contribution of our study is the distinction between survival after 24 hours of care versus survival at the time of ARDS onset.","Villar, Jesús; Fernández, Rosa L; Ambrós, Alfonso; Parra, Laura; Blanco, Jesús; Domínguez-Berrot, Ana M; Gutiérrez, José M; Blanch, Lluís; Añón, José M; Martín, Carmen; Prieto, Francisca; Collado, Javier; Pérez-Méndez, Lina; Kacmarek, Robert M",Critical care medicine,70,12

We compared these two methods for determining MT. METHODS Left motor cortex MTs were found in 20 healthy subjects. Employing the commonly-used relative frequency procedure and beginning from a clearly suprathreshold intensity, two raters used motor evoked potentials and finger movements respectively to determine EMG-MT and OM-MT. RESULTS OM-MT was 11.3% higher than EMG-MT (p<0.001), ranging from 0% to 27.8%. In eight subjects, OM-MT was more than 10% higher than EMG-MT, with two greater than 25%. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest using OM yields significantly higher MTs than EMG, and may lead to unsafe TMS in some individuals. In more than half of the subjects in the present study, use of their OM-MT for typical rTMS treatment of depression would have resulted in stimulation beyond safety limits.

The degradation was faster at higher absorbed dose and acidic conditions (pH = 3.5). The inorganic anions, including SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-, had negative influence on the degradation of CEP-C, the corresponding rate constant decreased from 4.603 to 3.667, 1.677 and 2.509 kGy-1 respectively in the presence of SO42-, NO3-, and HCO3-. The analysis of intermediate products indicated that CEP-C was oxidized to generate about 10 intermediate products. Besides, it was inferred that the thioether sulfur oxidation, β-lactam ring opening, acetyl dissociation from dihydrothiazine ring and D-α-aminohexylamide group abscission were the major reaction mechanisms of CEP-C degradation by gamma radiation. Importantly, the antibacterial activity of CEP-C could be completely vanished by gamma radiation alone, while more toxic intermediate products might be formed. Addition of hydrogen peroxide and peroxymonosulfate could significantly improve the CEP-C degradation, and reduce the toxicity of intermediates of CEP-C degradation. Similar degradation behavior was observed in the groundwater and wastewater, implying that ionizing radiation can be used for degradation of Cephalosporin in water and wastewater.","Chen, Xiaoying; Wang, Jianlong",The Science of the total environment,70,25

DESIGN We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study of deliveries. SETTING Deliveries were performed over 15 years at a single tertiary hospital. PATIENT(S) We included all parturients who had a live born infant or an intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). INTERVENTION(S) We compared pregnancies resulting from IVF cycles to non-IVF pregnancies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The primary outcomes were preterm and term IPD (preeclampsia, placental abruption, small-for-gestational age infant [SGA], or an intrauterine fetal demise [IUFD] due to placental insufficiency). RESULT(S) Of the 69,084 deliveries during the study period, 3,763 (5.4%) were conceived with IVF. The incidence of preterm delivery was 32.6% in IVF pregnancies and 10.8% in non-IVF pregnancies. Multiple gestations were more common in IVF pregnancies. Compared to non-IVF pregnancies, IVF pregnancies were more likely to develop both preterm and term IPD, even after adjustment for maternal age and parity.

Using the International Retrospective Study of Pipeline Embolization Device (IntrePED) registry, we studied demographic, aneurysm, and procedural characteristics associated with postoperative acute ischemic stroke following Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified patients in the IntrePED registry with post-PED-treatment acute ischemic stroke. The rate of postoperative acute ischemic stroke was determined by demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, and procedure characteristics (including anticoagulation use, platelet testing, number of devices used, sheaths, and so forth). Categoric variables were compared with χ(2) testing, and continuous variables were compared with the Student t test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained by using univariate logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with postoperative stroke. RESULTS Of 793 patients with 906 aneurysms, 36 (4.5%) patients had acute ischemic stroke. Twenty-six (72.2%) strokes occurred within 30 days of treatment (median, 3.5 days; range, 0-397 days). Ten patients died, and the remaining 26 had major neurologic morbidity. Variables associated with higher odds of acute ischemic stroke on univariate analysis included male sex, hypertension, treatment of MCA aneurysms, treatment of fusiform aneurysms, treatment of giant aneurysms, and use of multiple PEDs. However, on multivariate analysis, the only one of these variables independently associated with stroke was treatment of fusiform aneurysms (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.11-6.75; P = .03). Fusiform aneurysms that were associated with stroke were significantly larger than those not associated with stroke (mean, 24.5 ± 12.5 mm versus 13.6 ± 6.8 mm; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Ischemic stroke following PED treatment is an uncommon-but-devastating complication. Fusiform aneurysms were the only variable independently associated with postoperative stroke.","Brinjikji, W; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J; Siddiqui, A H; Boccardi, E; Cekirge, S; Fiorella, D; Hanel, R; Jabbour, P; Levy, E; Lopes, D; Lylyk, P; Szikora, I; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the presence of ten EHEC, EPEC, and/or STEC O serotypes (O5, O26, O80, O103, O111, O118, O121, O145, O157, and O165) in calves sampled via recto-anal mucosal swabs (RAMS) at three dairy farms in Belgium. A total of 233 RAMS were collected on three consecutive occasions from healthy <6-month-old Holstein-Friesian calves and submitted to a PCR targeting the eae, stx1, and stx2 genes after non-selective overnight enrichment growth. The 148 RAMS testing positive were streaked on four (semi-)selective agar media; of the 2146 colonies tested, 294 from 69 RAMS were PCR-confirmed as EHEC, EPEC, or STEC. The most frequent virulotype was eae+ EPEC and the second one was stx1+ stx2+ STEC, while the eae+ stx1+ and eae+ stx1+ stx2+ virulotypes were the most frequent among EHEC. The majority of EHEC (73%) tested positive for one of the five O serotypes detected (O26, O103, O111, O145, or O157) vs. 23% of EPEC and 45% of STEC. Similarly, more RAMS (73%) harbored EHEC isolates positive for those five serotypes compared to EPEC (53%) or STEC (52%). This survey confirms that (i) healthy young dairy calves are asymptomatic carriers of EHEC and EPEC in Belgium; (ii) the carrier state rates, the virulotypes, and the identified O serotypes differ between farms and in time; and (iii) a majority of EPEC belong to so far unidentified O serotypes.","Habets, Audrey; Engelen, Frederik; Duprez, Jean-Noël; Devleesschauwer, Brecht; Heyndrickx, Marc; De Zutter, Lieven; Thiry, Damien; Cox, Eric; Mainil, Jacques",Veterinary sciences,70,7

However, there has not yet been a review of the status of medical cannabis curriculum for medical and allied healthcare trainees worldwide, even though future healthcare workers will be placed on the forefront of patient care and must be prepared to counsel patients. This study was designed to address this gap in knowledge. DESIGN A search syntax was generated and databases PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles. A gray literature search of Google Scholar, MedEd, Medline, and the Proquest Dissertations and Theses section was also performed. All titles and abstracts were screened. Selected articles were subsequently screened using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS Allied healthcare trainees lacked sufficient knowledge about medical cannabis and did not feel prepared to counsel patients on this subject. Additionally, they expressed a growing interest in medical cannabis and would like more standardized education on the topic. Finally, faculty and deans in various institutions agreed on the need to educate students on the subject, and aimed to implement courses on medical cannabis or expand their existing curricula. CONCLUSIONS While the medical cannabis landscape is developing, medical and allied health students are not properly educated and knowledgeable on this emerging field of clinical care. The findings suggest that the implementation of competencies-based curricula on medical cannabis is essential for medical and allied healthcare trainees to have the appropriate level of knowledge to counsel and educate their patients.","Zolotov, Yuval; Metri, Samer; Calabria, Emily; Kogan, Mikhail",Complementary therapies in medicine,70,1

Numerous antiarrhythmic agents, antimicrobial drugs, psychotropic medications, and methadone, as well as a growing list of drugs from other therapeutic classes (neurological drugs, anticancer agents, and many others), can prolong the QT interval and provoke torsades de pointes. Perhaps less familiar to clinicians is the fact that drugs can also trigger other arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. Some drug-induced arrhythmias (bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia) are significant predominantly because of their symptoms; others (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome, torsades de pointes) may result in serious consequences, including sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms of arrhythmias are well known for some medications but, in other instances, remain poorly understood. For some drug-induced arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes, risk factors are well defined. Modification of risk factors, when possible, is important for prevention and risk reduction. In patients with nonmodifiable risk factors who require a potentially arrhythmia-inducing drug, enhanced electrocardiographic and other monitoring strategies may be beneficial for early detection and treatment. Management of drug-induced arrhythmias includes discontinuation of the offending medication and following treatment guidelines for the specific arrhythmia. In overdose situations, targeted detoxification strategies may be needed. Awareness of drugs that may cause arrhythmias and knowledge of distinct arrhythmias that may be drug-induced are essential for clinicians. Consideration of the possibility that a patient's arrythmia could be drug-induced is important.","Tisdale, James E; Chung, Mina K; Campbell, Kristen B; Hammadah, Muhammad; Joglar, Jose A; Leclerc, Jacinthe; Rajagopalan, Bharath",Circulation,70,4

This case was reported because of the long-time retention and noninvasive removal by endoscopy without sedation or complication. PATIENT CONCERNS A 30-year-old male patient with intermittent upper abdominal pain. DIAGNOSES During upper-gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, a long-strip foreign body (Fb) was seen in the descending part of the duodenum. An upper-GI barium examination was performed, which revealed a linear Fb in the duodenum cavity. The Fb was >10-cm long. Combined with his history (the patient admitted swallowing a chopstick 10 years ago in a bet), the diagnosis of Fb in the duodenum was confirmed. INTERVENTIONS The Fb was removed from the duodenum cavity by upper-GI endoscopy successfully. OUTCOMES The patient was discharged after the removal of the Fb. CONCLUSION Endoscopic removal and nonoperative management might be feasible in carefully selected patients with a long and old Fb in the duodenum without the need for anesthesia or surgery as well as no occurrence of complications and laceration.","Guo, Ya-Nan; Li, Fang; Huang, Fu; Yu, Tao",Medicine,70,11

However, the hyperspectral (HS) imaging system is a rising innovation that can be utilized to build a highly sensitive, non-invasive, and tissue hemoglobin immersion map. OBJECTIVE As a result of the urgent need to design and implement early detection devices and applications for the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose building a non-invasive custom optical imaging system to assist with phlebotomy and vascular approach to survey the reliability of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels recovered from spectral images. MATERIALS AND METHODS HS images were gathered from 15 healthy subjects without previous medical history complications and with an average age range of 20 to 38 years, who were undergoing phlebotomy. The forearm was vigorously illuminated utilizing an HS camera with polychromatic source light of spectrum range (400∼980 nm). Spectroscopic reflectance images were caught by a focal plane exhibit for the region of interest (ROI). Then the custom algorithm comprising normalization and moving average filtering for noise removal was applied, followed by K-mean clustering for image segmentation to visualize and highlight the arteries and the veins in the investigated forearm. RESULTS The investigations show that after normalization of the recorded signal from the HS camera of the participating subjects it was noticed that at wavelength of 460 nm the oxygenated arteries had a stronger signal than the de-oxygenated veins, and at a wavelength of 750 nm the de-oxygenated veins had a stronger signal than the oxygenated arteries. Thus, the ideal wavelength to reveal the oxygenated arteries was 460 nm, and the ideal wavelength to reveal the de-oxygenated veins was 750 nm. CONCLUSIONS HSI is a prospective technique to assist with phlebotomy and non-contact oxygen saturation approach. Additionally, it may permit future surgical or pharmacological intercessions that titrate or limit ischemic injury continuously.","Fouad Aref, Mohamed Hisham; Sharawi, Amr A R; El-Sharkawy, Yasser H",Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,70,31

To cross the outer membrane of the complex Gram-negative cell envelope, antibiotics permeate through porins, trimeric channel proteins that enable the exchange of small polar molecules. Mutations in porins contribute to the development of drug-resistant phenotypes. In this work, we show that a single point mutation in the porin PorB from Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of bacterial meningitis, can strongly affect the binding and permeation of beta-lactam antibiotics. Using X-ray crystallography, high-resolution electrophysiology, atomistic biomolecular simulation, and liposome swelling experiments, we demonstrate differences in drug binding affinity, ion selectivity and drug permeability of PorB. Our work further reveals distinct interactions between the transversal electric field in the porin eyelet and the zwitterionic drugs, which manifest themselves under applied electric fields in electrophysiology and are altered by the mutation. These observations may apply more broadly to drug-porin interactions in other channels. Our results improve the molecular understanding of porin-based drug-resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.","Bartsch, A; Ives, C M; Kattner, C; Pein, F; Diehn, M; Tanabe, M; Munk, A; Zachariae, U; Steinem, C; Llabrés, S",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

However, it is not known what level of air leak is acceptable during neonatal volume-targeted ventilation when leak compensation is activated concurrently. METHODS Four ICU ventilators (Servo-i, PB980, V500, and Avea) were compared in available invasive volume-targeted ventilation modes (pressure control continuous spontaneous ventilation [PC-CSV] and pressure control continuous mandatory ventilation [PC-CMV]). The Servo-i and PB980 were tested with (+) and without (-) their proximal flow sensor. The V500 and Avea were tested with their proximal flow sensor as indicated by their manufacturers. An ASL 5000 lung model was used to simulate 4 neonatal scenarios (body weight 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kg). The ASL 5000 was ventilated via an endotracheal tube with 3 different leaks. Two minutes of data were collected after each change in leak level, and the asynchrony index was calculated. Tidal volume (VT) before and after the change in leak was assessed. RESULTS The differences in delivered VT between before and after the change in leak were within ±5% in all scenarios with the PB980 (-/+) and V500. With the Servo-i (-/+), baseline VT was ≥10% greater than set VT during PC-CSV, and delivered VT markedly changed with leak. The Avea demonstrated persistent high VT in all leak scenarios. Across all ventilators, the median asynchrony index was 1% (interquartile range 0-27%) in PC-CSV and 1.8% (0-45%) in PC-CMV. The median asynchrony index was significantly higher in the Servo-i (-/+) than in the PB980 (-/+) and V500 in 1 and 2 kg scenarios during PC-CSV and PC-CMV. CONCLUSIONS The PB980 and V500 were the only ventilators to acclimate to all leak scenarios and achieve targeted VT. Further clinical investigation is needed to validate the use of leak compensation during neonatal volume-targeted ventilation.","Itagaki, Taiga; Bennett, Desmond J; Chenelle, Christopher T; Fisher, Daniel F; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,70,1

Increase public awareness of stroke warning signs may help to activate emergency medical services and reduce prehospital delay. Our objectives were to survey the recognition of stroke warning signs among residents of Yuzhong District in Chongqing, China, and determine the proportion of these residents who would make an emergency call (120, in China) if suddenly faced with unexpected stroke warning signs and analyze the relationship between recognition of stroke warning signs and the response of calling for emergency assistance. METHODS In 2011, a population-based face-to-face interview survey using a multistage sampling method was conducted in Yuzhong District, Chongqing. We assessed residents' recognition of stroke warning signs and the proportion of those who would call the emergency number, 120, if suddenly encountering unexpected stroke warning signs. The association between the knowledge of stroke warning signs and activation of 120 was examined. RESULTS A total of 1101 participants completed the questionnaire. Only 15.6% of respondents knew all 5 stroke warning signs; 17.6% reported that they would call 120 for all 5 stroke warning signs. Recognition of stroke warning signs was associated with the response of calling 120 (odds ratios, 1.92-3.34).

Dialysis is an essential way to maintain the life of ESRD patients. Based on previous research, there isn't an uncontested result whether cognition was improved or worsened during dialysis. METHODS To explore the impact of dialysis treatment on cognitive performance, we recruited healthy controls (HCs), predialysis ESRD patients (predialysis group), and maintenance hemodialysis ESRD patients (HD group). All ESRD patients performed six blood biochemistry tests (hemoglobin, urea, cystatin C, Na+, K+, and parathyroid hormone). Neuropsychological tests were used to measure cognitive function. By using diffusion tensor imaging and graph-theory approaches, the topological organization of the whole-brain structural network was investigated. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were performed to investigate blood biochemistry predictors of the neuropsychological tests and the results of graph analyses in the HD group and predialysis group. RESULTS Neuropsychological analysis showed the HD group exhibited better cognitive function than the predialysis group, but both were worse than HCs. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that increased global efficiency and normalized shortest path length remained in the predialysis group and HD group than the HCs. Besides, a lower normalized clustering coefficient was found in the predialysis group relative to the HCs and HD group. For the GLM analysis, only the Cystatin C level was significantly associated with the average fiber length of rich club connections in the predialysis group. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed that dialysis had a limited effect on cognitive improvement.","Ma, Shaohui; Zhang, Ming; Liu, Yang; Ding, Dun; Li, Peng; Ma, Xueying; Liu, Hongjuan; Mu, Junya",BMC nephrology,70,30

Odor identification (OI) tests are culturally dependent and widely used in clinical and epidemiological evaluations of olfaction. We aimed to develop a Chinese odor identification test (COIT) based on the Sniffin' Sticks identification test. Methods Patients (n=60) with olfactory disorders and healthy controls (n=404) were recruited in the Smell and Taste Center of a tertiary-care university hospital. Unfamiliar odors in the Sniffin' Sticks identification test were replaced to create a 16-item COIT, which was validated with a simplified Chinese version of the Cross-culture Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT) and Sniffin' Sticks. A test-retest reliability of COIT was also conducted. Results Six odors with a correct recognition rate <75% were replaced with familiar odors for Chinese. The COIT score significantly correlated with both Sniffin' Sticks (r=0.755 P<0.0001) and CC-SIT score (r=0.7462 P<0.0001). Based on the testing results of an additional 120 subjects, we concluded that scores of 12-16, 7-11, and 0-6 corresponded to normosmia, hyposmia, and anosmia, respectively.

During the pandemic, there was an increase in the proportion of injuries occurring at home (57.8% vs. 32.5%, P<0.001) or on bicycles (18.3% vs. 8.2%, P<0.001), but a decrease in those related to sports (7.2% vs. 26.0%, P<0.001) or playgrounds (5.2% vs. 9.0%, P<0.001). There was no increase in time-to-presentation. Patients with distal radius torus fractures were more likely to receive a velcro splint during the pandemic (44.2% vs. 25.9%, P=0.010). CONCLUSIONS Pediatric fracture volume has decreased 2.5-fold during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially because of cessation of organized sports and decreased playground use. In endemic regions, lower trauma volume may allow redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons and staff to other clinical arenas. Given the rising proportion of bicycling injuries, an emphasis on basic safety precautions could improve public health. An observed increase in the prescription of velcro splints for distal radius fractures highlights an opportunity for simplified patient care during the pandemic.

While thermodynamic models have been used to predict the effect of constant-temperature surroundings on virus inactivation rate, the relationship between virus lifetime and DTR has not been explained using first principles. Here, we model the inactivation of viruses based on temperature-dependent chemical kinetics with a time-varying temperature profile to account for the daily mean temperature and DTR simultaneously. The exponential Arrhenius relationship governing the rate of virus inactivation causes fluctuations above the daily mean temperature during daytime to increase the instantaneous rate of inactivation by a much greater magnitude than the corresponding decrease in inactivation rate during nighttime. This asymmetric behavior results in shorter predicted virus lifetimes when considering DTR and consequently reveals a potential physical mechanism for the inverse correlation observed between the number of cases and DTR reported in statistical epidemiological studies. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a case study on the effect of daily mean temperature and DTR on the lifetime of SARS-CoV-2 was performed for the five most populous cities in the United States. In Los Angeles, where mean monthly temperature fluctuations are low (DTR ≈ 7 °C), accounting for DTR decreases predicted SARS-CoV-2 lifetimes by only 10%; conversely, accounting for DTR for a similar mean temperature but larger mean monthly temperature fluctuations in Phoenix (DTR ≈ 15 °C) decreases predicted lifetimes by 50%. The modeling framework presented here provides insight into the independent effects of mean temperature and DTR on virus lifetime, and a significant impact on transmission rate is expected, especially for viruses that pose a high risk of fomite-mediated transmission.","Yap, Te Faye; Decker, Colter J; Preston, Daniel J",The Science of the total environment,70,29

Although many stakeholders saturate Twitter with COVID-19-related information, it remains unknown who disseminates information most efficaciously. COVID-19-related tweets were obtained from Twitter accounts of health agencies, governmental authorities, universities, scientific journals, medical associations, and celebrities. Posts' impact was measured with the nominal and relative (%followers) number of likes and retweets. A sentiment analysis was conducted.We have identified 17,331 COVID-19-related tweets posted by 338 accounts in >4 months since the virus began to spread. The largest number of likes was received by tweets of celebrities (median nominal, relative likes; 14,918, 0.036 percent), politicians (259, 0.174 percent), and health agencies (231, 0.007 percent). Most retweeted messages were also posted by celebrities (2,366, 0.005 percent), health agencies (130, 0.004 percent), and politicians (55, 0.041 percent). Retweets and likes peaked in March 2020, and the overall sentiment of the tweets was growing steadily. Whereas celebrities and politicians posted positive messages, the scientific and health authorities often employed a negative vocabulary. The posts with positive sentiment gained more likes and relative likes than nonpositive. During the pandemic, the tweets of celebrities and politicians related to COVID-19 outperform those coming from health and scientific institutions.

However, given the significant impact of COVID-19 on society, the healthcare system, and individuals and their families, it is important to understand how the pandemic has affected cancer information needs in a crisis context and, in turn, how public health agencies have responded to meeting the information needs of various audiences. Using data from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS) - a long-standing, multi-channel resource for trusted cancer information in English and Spanish - this descriptive analysis explored differences in cancer information-seeking among cancer survivors, caregivers, tobacco users, and members of the general public during the onset and continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic (February - September 2020), specifically comparing interactions that involved a discussion of COVID-19 to those that did not. During the study period, COVID-19 discussions were more likely to involve survivors or caregivers compared to tobacco users and the general public. Specific patterns emerged across the four user types and their respective discussions of COVID-19 related to language of service, point of CIS access, stage on the cancer continuum, subject of interaction, cancer site discussed, and referrals provided by the CIS. These results provide insights that may help public health agencies deliver, prioritize, and tailor their messaging and response to specific audiences based on heightened health information needs during a crisis.","Vanderpool, Robin C; Huang, Grace C; Mollica, Michelle; Gutierrez, Adrianna I; Maynard, Candace Deaton",Health communication,70,16

METHOD This was a retrospective analysis of the aortic arch morphology and aortic length of dissection, traumatic injury, and aneurysmal patients. Computed tomography imaging was evaluated of 210 patients (49 dissection, 99 traumatic injury, 62 aneurysm) enrolled in three trials that received the conformable GORE TAG thoracic endoprosthesis. The mean age of trauma patients was 43 ± 19.6 years, 57 ± 11.7 years for dissection and 72 ± 9.6 years for aneurysm patients. A standardized protocol was used to measure aortic arch diameter, length, and take-off angle and clockface orientation of branch vessels. Differences in arch anatomy and length were assessed using ANOVA and independent t tests. RESULTS Of the 210 arches evaluated, 22% had arch vessel common trunk configurations. The aortic diameter and the distance from the left main coronary (LMC) to the left common carotid (LCC) were greater in dissection patients than in trauma or aneurysm patients (p < .001). Aortic diameter in aneurysm patients was greater compared with trauma patients (p < .05). The distances from the branch vessels to the celiac artery (CA) were greater in dissection and aneurysm patients than in trauma patients (p < .001). The take-off angle of the innominate (I), LCCA, and left subclavian (LS) were greater, between 19% and 36%, in trauma patients than in dissection and aneurysm patients (p < .001). Clockface orientation of the arch vessels varies between pathologies. CONCLUSIONS Arch anatomy has significant morphologic differences when comparing aortic pathologies. Describing these differences in a large sample of patients is beneficial for device designs and patient selection.","Alberta, H B; Takayama, T; Smits, T C; Wendorff, B B; Cambria, R P; Farber, M A; Jordan, W D; Patel, V; Azizzadeh, A; Rovin, J D; Matsumura, J S",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,70,16

We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately. METHODS We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model. RESULTS We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85-1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive services use. DISCUSSION We found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared with those who did not or compared with PPI or hydroxychloroquine users.","Shoaibi, Azza; Fortin, Stephen Patrick; Weinstein, Rachel; Berlin, Jesse A; Ryan, Patrick",The American journal of gastroenterology,70,1

The ability of the strains to inhibit trachea epithelium ciliary activity, to induce immune response, to replicate and to cause histopathological lesions in designated organs was followed by repeated samplings during a period of 42 days post infection. Clear differences in pathogenicity and in organ distribution of the three serotypes were found. Strain 793/B had the least capacity to invade the investigated organs, while it produced a good humoral response as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The QX-like strains generally replicated to higher titres, although differences were found among the five strains in their pathogenicity and affinity for different organs. The Chinese isolate of QX-like virus caused the most severe lesions and induced the highest antibody titres. Severe kidney damage and dilatation of the oviduct were the prominent lesions that could be related to the QX-like IBV strains, although neither marked virus replication nor histopathological lesions were detected in the oviduct.","Benyeda, Zsófia; Mató, Tamás; Süveges, Tibor; Szabó, Eva; Kardi, Veronika; Abonyi-Tóth, Zsolt; Rusvai, Miklós; Palya, Vilmos",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,70,17

Knowing what could be in store, the Thai Ministry of Public Health called for the creation of an explicit protocol to determine how these resources are to be rationed in the situation of demand exceeding supply. This paper shares the experience of developing triage criteria and a mechanism for prioritizing intensive care unit resources in a middle-income country with the potential to be applied to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) faced with a similar (if not more of a) challenge when responding to the global pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this locally developed guideline would be among the first of its kind from an LMIC setting. In summary, the experience from the Thai protocol development highlights three important lessons. First, stakeholder consultation and public engagement are crucial steps to ensure the protocol reflects the priorities of society and to maintain public trust in the health system. Second, all bodies and actions proposed in the protocol must not conflict with existing laws to ensure smooth implementation and adherence by professionals. Last, all components of the protocol must be compatible with the local context including medical culture, physician-patient relationship, and religious and societal norms.","Archer, Rachel A; Marshall, Aniqa I; Sirison, Kanchanok; Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan; Sriakkpokin, Pisit; Chotchoungchatchai, Somtanuek; Srisookwatana, Orapan; Teerawattananon, Yot; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj",International journal of technology assessment in health care,70,12

Methods PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for empirical research with a primary focus on the concepts ""health"" and ""migrants"" published between 2001 and 2019. Findings were analysed using the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health Conceptual Framework for Migration and Health. Results In total, 399 studies were included, with almost half (41.1%; 164/399) published in the last five years of the study period between 2015 and 2019 and a third (34.1%; 136/399) conducted in London. Studies included asylum seekers (14.8%; 59/399), refugees (12.3%; 49/399), and undocumented migrants or migrants with insecure status (3.5%; 14/399), but most articles (74.9%; 299/399) did not specify a migrant sub-group.

Conclusions There has been a growing interest in migration health. Ensuring a diverse geographic distribution of research conducted in the UK and disaggregation by migrant sub-group is required for a nuanced and region-specific understanding of specific health needs, interventions and appropriate service delivery for different migrant populations.

Antibiotics and antiviral medicines are essential medicines for the therapy of infectious diseases. This study aims to evaluate their availability, cost and affordability of AaAMs against infectious diseases in 41 public hospitals from 2013 to 2019 in Nanjing, China. METHODS Data on the availability and price of 17 antibiotics and 6 antiviral medicines in 41 public hospitals were obtained from the Jiangsu Institute of Medicine Information. We adopted the WHO/Health Action International method to measure the availability, cost and affordability of these medicines. RESULTS The availability of selected medicines against infectious diseases was relatively low; the median availability of originator brands was near-zero and that of lowest-priced generics during the survey period less than 50%. The total availability of medicines was poor in primary hospitals as compared to secondary and tertiary hospitals. The median daily defined dose cost of originator brands was expensive (range from 66.11 RMB to 107.83 RMB), whereas that of lowest price generics was fairly acceptable at <8 RMB. The affordability of most surveyed medicines was reasonable, which showed significant improvement over time, but the daily cost of a few medicines for originator brands exceeded the average daily wage. CONCLUSIONS In general, the affordability of medicines surveyed was acceptable, while the availability was too low. There should be a great concern for improving the reserve system of anti-infective medicines in health-care institutions. Policy should focus on improving the availability of generic drugs in hospitals and encouraging preferentially prescribed.","Zhu, Yulei; Xu, Xinglu; Fang, Wenqing; Wang, Ying; Dai, Huizhen; Li, Xin",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,70,16

Both cohorts were treated with laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). Follow-up time and rate was 37 months and 95%. One hundred LVHR's were completed as there was one conversion in the Tx/IS group. No late infections or mesh removals occurred. Recurrence rates were 9.7% vs. 4.2% (P = 0.37) and the overall complication rates were 19% vs. 27% (P = 0.80).

However, little is known about the influence of different CVC positions (i.e. ipsi- vs. contra-lateral to the arterial catheter) on the accuracy of the TPTD measurement results. In this prospective observational study surgical intensive care unit patients who had been inserted with CVCs either into the superior (CVCVCS) or the inferior vena cava (CVCinf) in addition to an arterial PiCCO(®)-catheter, were enrolled. Patients were then divided into two groups: Group I was provided with a CVC in the contralateral (CVCcontra) and Group II in the ipsilateral (CVCipsi) inferior vena cava. Thermodilution via injection of ice-cold saline was then performed via CVCsup and CVCinf. Bland-Altman analysis for cardiac index (CI), extra-vascular lung water index (EVLWI) and global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) were employed.

We estimated genetic ancestry (quantified as proportion of African ancestry or pAFR) by ADMIXTURE and correlated APOL1 genotypes and pAFR with outcomes.

AIM We investigated in patients with OSA whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has a long-term effect on sexual function, including ED, in the presence of other risk factors for ED. METHODS Within a long-term observational design, we reassessed 401 male patients who had been referred for polysomnography, with respect to erectile and overall sexual function. Mean ± standard deviation follow-up time was 36.5 ± 3.7 months. Patients with moderate to severe ED were stratified according to the regular use of CPAP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Changes of sexual function were assessed by the 15-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) questionnaire, including the domains erectile function (EF), intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), and overall satisfaction (OS). RESULTS Of the 401 patients, 91 returned a valid IIEF-15 questionnaire at follow-up. Their baseline characteristics were not different from those of the total study group. OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >5/hour) had been diagnosed in 91.2% of patients. In patients with moderate to severe ED (EF domain <17), CPAP users (N = 21) experienced an improvement in overall sexual function (IIEF-15 summary score; P = 0.014) compared with CPAP non-users (N = 18), as well as in the subdomains OF (P = 0.012), SD (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.033). Similar results were obtained in patients with poor overall sexual dysfunction (IIEF-15 summary score <44).

OBJECTIVE To investigate the influence of a KT application directed at the ankle joint on measures of corticospinal excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation. DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. SETTING Research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Twelve healthy young women (age = 23.1 ± 1.9 years; range, 19-26 years). INTERVENTION(S) Participants were tested under no-tape and KT conditions according to a random sequence order. The KT was applied to the skin overlying the dorsiflexor and plantar-flexor muscles of the ankle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) We assessed changes in the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials elicited at rest and during movement and changes in the silent period and background muscle activity during movement. RESULTS Taping conditions had no effect on motor-evoked potential amplitude at rest or during movement or on the silent-period duration and background muscle activity. CONCLUSIONS Our results concur with other recent reports, showing KT applications have little influence at the neuromuscular level. Alterations in sensory feedback ascribed to elastic taping are likely insufficient to modulate corticospinal excitability in a functionally meaningful manner.","Tremblay, Francois; Karam, Siobhan",Journal of athletic training,70,1

There are a large number of studies that reveal the morphological and functional characteristics of these cells. Satellite glial cells have been studied both in intact ganglions and in tissue cultures, using light and transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemical and other methods. Satellite glial cells have polygonal form; they are mononuclear and have developed synthetic organelles, numerous receptors, adhesion molecules and ion channels, which enable them to interact with adjacent neurons, as well as transmit signals in the ganglions of the peripheral nervous system. Based on the literature data, satellite glial cells thanks to their characteristics can receive signals from other cells and react to changes in their surroundings. Previous studies have investigated the potential role of satellite glial cells in the formation of the blood-nervous tissue barrier of the peripheral nervous system, as well as in the neuropathic pain genesis. Some recent discoveries support the fact that satellite glial cells can participate in controlling of local viral infections and protecting pseudounipolar neurons from mentioned infections.","Milosavljević, A; Jančić, J; Mirčić, A; Dožić, A; Boljanović, J; Milisavljević, M; Ćetković, M",Folia morphologica,70,5

In patients critically ill with COVID-19, the clinicopathologic characteristics of AKI have not been described in detail. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of 81 patients critically ill with COVID-19 in an intensive care unit. The incidence, etiologies, and outcomes of AKI were analyzed. Pathologic studies were performed in kidney tissues from ten deceased patients with AKI. RESULTS A total of 41 (50.6%) patients experienced AKI in this study. The median time from illness to AKI was 21.0 (IQR, 9.5-26.0) days. The proportion of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 AKI were 26.8%, 31.7%, and 41.5%, respectively. The leading causes of AKI included septic shock (25 of 41, 61.0%), volume insufficiency (eight of 41, 19.5%), and adverse drug effects (five of 41, 12.2%). The risk factors for AKI included age (per 10 years) (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.69; P=0.002) and serum IL-6 level (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.73; P=0.003). KDIGO stage 3 AKI predicted death. Other potential risk factors for death included male sex, elevated D-dimer, serum IL-6 level, and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. The predominant pathologic finding was acute tubular injury. Nucleic acid tests and immunohistochemistry failed to detect the virus in kidney tissues. CONCLUSIONS AKI was a common and multifactorial complication in patients critically ill with COVID-19 at the late stage of the disease course. The predominant pathologic finding was acute tubular injury. Older age and higher serum IL-6 level were risk factors of AKI, and KDIGO stage 3 AKI independently predicted death.","Xia, Peng; Wen, Yubing; Duan, Yaqi; Su, Hua; Cao, Wei; Xiao, Meng; Ma, Jie; Zhou, Yangzhong; Chen, Gang; Jiang, Wei; Wu, Huanwen; Hu, Yan; Xu, Sanpeng; Cai, Hanghang; Liu, Zhengyin; Zhou, Xiang; Du, Bin; Wang, Jinglan; Li, Taisheng; Yan, Xiaowei; Chen, Limeng; Liang, Zhiyong; Zhang, Shuyang; Zhang, Chun; Qin, Yan; Wang, Guoping; Li, Xuemei",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,70,16

The purpose of this article is to assess whether midface lifting based on purely vertical repositioning constitutes an effective procedure for its correction. METHODS A retrospective study was carried out on 199 patients (311 eyelids) operated on between January of 2004 and January of 2014. The various causes of eyelid retraction in this population included cosmetic blepharoplasty (56.8 percent), involutional ectropion (23.1 percent), tumor resection (9.5 percent), facial nerve paralysis (8.5 percent), and trauma and related surgery (2 percent). The study was restricted exclusively to cases of moderate and severe lower eyelid retraction addressed by means of midface lifting. The mean follow-up time was 16.8 months. All of the patients were subjected to midface lifting with strengthening of the lateral canthus. A spacer graft was also used in 37.7 percent of the cases. RESULTS One hundred ninety-five patients (97.9 percent) displayed objective improvement of the eyelid retraction and a marked degree of improvement both in aesthetic terms and as regards the functional disorders reported. Only four patients (2 percent) presented complications such as needing another operation. CONCLUSION Midface lifting based on purely vertical repositioning makes it possible to recruit a considerable amount of ""new"" skin at the lower eyelid, thus ensuring a decrease in vertical distraction and correct recovery of the height of the external lamellar plane.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26, DPP4) inhibitors are the most widely used incretin-based therapy for the treatment of T2DM globally. DPP4 inhibitors are modestly effective in reducing HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) (≈0.5%) and while these agents were synthesized with the understanding of the role that DPP4 plays in prolonging the half-life of incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide, it is now recognized that incretins are only one of many targets of DPP4. The widespread expression of DPP4 on blood vessels, myocardium, and myeloid cells and the nonenzymatic function of CD26 as a signaling and binding protein, across a wide range of species, suggest a teleological role in cardiovascular regulation and inflammation. Indeed, DPP4 is upregulated in proinflammatory states including obesity, T2DM, and atherosclerosis. Consistent with this maladaptive role, the effects of DPP4 inhibition seem to exert a protective role in cardiovascular disease at least in preclinical animal models. Although 2 large clinical trials suggest a neutral effect on cardiovascular end points, current limitations of performing trials in T2DM over a limited time horizon on top of maximal medical therapy must be acknowledged before rendering judgment on the cardiovascular efficacy of these agents. This review will critically review the science of DPP4 and the effects of DPP4 inhibitors on the cardiovascular system.","Zhong, Jixin; Maiseyeu, Andrei; Davis, Stephen N; Rajagopalan, Sanjay",Circulation research,70,17

We sought to understand whether Google Glass (GG), a lightweight wearable device that provides simultaneous visual-auditory cues, might improve FOG in parkinsonism. METHODS Patients with parkinsonism and FOG utilized GG custom-made auditory-visual cue applications: ""Walk With Me"" and ""Unfreeze Me"" in a single session intervention. We recorded ambulation time with and without GG under multiple conditions including 25 feet straight walk, dual task of performing serial 7's while straight walking, 180 degree turn after walking 25 feet, and walking through a doorway. FOG and patient experience questionnaires were administered. RESULTS Using the GG ""Walk With Me"" program, improvements were noted in the following: average 25 feet straight walk by 0.32 s (SD 2.12); average dual task of serial 7's and 25 feet straight walk by 1.79 s (SD 2.91); and average walk through doorway by 0.59 s (SD 0.81). Average 180 degree turn after 25 feet walk worsened by 1.89 s (SD 10.66). Using the ""Unfreeze Me"" program, only the average dual task of serial 7's and 25 feet straight walk improved (better by 0.82 s (SD 3.08 sec). All other tasks had worse performance in terms of speed of completion. CONCLUSION This feasibility study provides preliminary data suggesting that some walking tasks may improve with GG, which uses various musical dance programs to provide visual and auditory cueing for patients with FOG. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Freezing of gait in parkinsonian syndromes is a disabling motor block described by patients as having their feet stuck to the floor leading to difficulty in initiation of gait and increased risk for falls. Wearable assistive devices such as Google Glass™ use visual and auditory cueing that may improve gait pattern in patients with freezing of gait. Augmented reality programs using wearable assistive devices are a home-based therapy, with the potential for reinforcing physical therapy techniques; this is especially meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic when access to both medical and rehabilitative care has been curtailed.","Lee, Andrea; Hellmers, Natalie; Vo, Mary; Wang, Fei; Popa, Paul; Barkan, Samantha; Patel, Dylon; Campbell, Carter; Henchcliffe, Claire; Sarva, Harini",Disability and rehabilitation.

The current studies used a modified associative recognition paradigm that allowed disentangling item impairment from associative impairment in DF. Participants studied scene-object pairings, followed by DF cues (item-method), and at test were presented with a previously studied scene along with three objects, one of which was studied with that scene (target), whereas the remaining two objects were studied with different scenes (lures). Experiment 1 used an associative encoding orienting task, and DF impairment was observed only when the forget targets were paired with forget lures within the test display; however, DF was eliminated when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, possibly due to a recall-to-reject strategy. Experiment 2 used an object-focused orienting task that downplayed the encoding of associative information. The results revealed the opposite of Experiment 1, with significant DF when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, and no DF when the lures and the target came from the same memory instruction. Experiment 3 used the same orienting task as Experiment 1, but testing used a sequential procedure, where item recognition was assessed first, followed by associative recognition test. Conditionalizing associative recognition on item recognition outcomes confirmed that DF impairment of associative memory can be obtained despite retained memory for forget-cued objects. Overall, the results provide strong support for the impairment of associative memory by DF.

Methods: Twenty-seven U-19 elite male soccer players participated in the study. The investigation was conducted over two consecutive and similar seasons (e.g., the same staff, players, weekly training schedule), the first being the control and the second the experimental season. The strength program was carried out 2 times per week, for 10 weeks, during part of the preseason and in-season. Injury incidence and absence days were compared between both seasons, according to the injury rate ratio (IRR), with 95% CI and the Z test. Results: A lower number of total and hamstring injuries were recorded during the experimental (9 and 2, respectively) compared to the control (15 and 7, respectively) period. During the 10 weeks intervention period, the injury rate ratio (IRR) was lower in the experimental season than in the control season (IRR = 8.12; 95% CI: 1.00-66.03; effect size (ES) = 3.30, large). In addition, there was a decline in absence days per injury and in the number of absence days/1000 h (IRR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.90-3.14; ES = 1.12) during the experimental season. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that this simple strength-training program could reduce the muscle injury incidence during its application period in young soccer players.","Raya-González, Javier; Suarez-Arrones, Luis; Sanchez-Sanchez, Javier; Ramirez-Campillo, Rodrigo; Nakamura, Fabio Y; Sáez De Villarreal, Eduardo",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,70,1

There is still no consensus on how to treat local relapse in patients after first-line treatments. Radiotherapy may be considered in this situation; however, data supporting its effectiveness are rare. The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate outcomes of patients re-irradiated for thoracic tumours in terms of overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS), toxicity and dose-volume parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-two patients with locally recurrent previously irradiated lung cancer were analysed retrospectively (NSCLC n = 52, SCLC n = 10). Target volumes both in lung and mediastinum were re-irradiated with conventional three-dimensional or intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques. Median overall dose of re-irradiation was 38.5 Gy (range 20-60 Gy) with a median single dose per fraction of 2 Gy (1.8-3.0 Gy). Clinical documents and treatment plans were evaluated. RESULTS Median follow-up was 8.2 months (range 0-27 months). OS following re-irradiation was 9.3 months (range: 0-27 months) and LPFS was 6.5 months (range: 0-24 months). OS and LPFS were not affected by histology, total dose or patient age and gender. OS was improved in patients whose re-irradiation volumes included less than two mediastinal lymph node stations (p = 0.016). Twelve patients suffered from pneumonitis ≥grade II (19%) and two from pneumonitis grade III. One patient presumably died from pneumonitis grade V. A slight decline in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was detected in post-re-irradiation lung function testing. CONCLUSIONS Re-irradiation is an option for patients with tumour recurrence to control local progression and lower the symptom burden. Oncological outcome appears to be affected by size, location of mediastinal target volumes and lung function. Prospective clinical trials are warranted to substantiate the role of re-irradiation in recurrent lung cancer.","Schlampp, Ingmar; Rieber, Juliane; Adeberg, Sebastian; Bozorgmehr, Farastuk; Heußel, Claus Peter; Steins, Martin; Kappes, Jutta; Hoffmann, Hans; Welzel, Thomas; Debus, Jürgen; Rieken, Stefan",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

METHODS We searched for reviews in July 2017 in: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL and LILACS. We assessed whether reviews were systematic according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and assessed the methodological quality using ROBIS. OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes: all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, prevention of delirium and management of delirium. SECONDARY OUTCOMES quality of life; non-serious adverse events and cognitive function. RESULTS We included 378 reviews: 369 narrative reviews, eight semisystematic reviews which failed on a maximum of two arbitrary PRISMA criteria and one systematic review fulfilling all 27 PRISMA criteria. For the prevention of delirium, we identified the one systematic review and eight semisystematic reviews all assessing the effects of alpha-2-agonists. None found evidence of a reduction of mortality (systematic review RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24). The systematic review and three semisystematic reviews found no evidence of an effect for the prevention of delirium (systematic review RR 0.85, 0.63 to 1.14). Conversely, four semisystematic reviews found a beneficial effect. Serious adverse events, quality of life, non-serious adverse events and cognitive function were not assessed. We did not identify any systematic or semisystematic reviews addressing other pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium. For the management of manifest delirium, we did not identify any systematic or semisystematic review assessing any pharmacological agents. CONCLUSION Based on systematic reviews, the evidence for the use of pharmacological interventions for prevention or management of delirium is poor or sparse. A systematic review with low risk of bias assessing the effects of pharmacological prevention of delirium and management of manifest delirium in ICU patients is urgently needed.

For many, patellofemoral replacement is not a desirable option. Current surgical techniques for patellectomy disrupt the extensor lever arm causing weakness. We describe a new technique that maintains the extensor mechanism tension and a case series showing good results for patella-only arthritis at a mean follow-up of 11 years. METHODS Eight patellectomies were performed using a new surgical technique in patients with a mean age of 38 years, and an average follow-up of 11 years (range 8-16 years). Patients were followed up using a pain visual analogue scale, Lysholm knee score and patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS All patients experienced pain relief following surgery. Those with patella-only arthritis had better outcomes than patients who had patella and trochlea disease. All patients had either full or near full extension. Lysholm scores were better in patients who had disease confined to the patella.

Haemophilus species are a common cause of community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia. The antibiotic resistance of these Gram-negative bacteria can be prevented through the reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, the correct use of antibiotics, and good hygiene and infection control. This article examines, retrospectively, antibiotic resistance in patients with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by Haemophilus species.

These patients had a mean age of 63.8 ± 15.5 (60 [73.2%, 95% CI 63.6%-82.8%] males and 22 [26.8%, 95% CI 17.2%-36.4%] females). Haemophilus species had a high resistance rate to erythromycin (38.3%), ampicillin (24.4%), piperacillin (20.8%), cefuroxime (8.5%), ampicillin-sulbactam (7.3%), piperacillin-sulbactam (4.3%), piperacillin-tazobactam (2.5%), cefotaxime (2.5%), and levofloxacin (1.6%). In contrast, they were not resistant to ciprofloxacin in patients with pneumonia (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION Haemophilus species were resistant to many of the typically used antibiotics. Resistance toward ciprofloxacin was not detected in patients with pneumonia caused by Haemophilus species.","Yayan, Josef; Ghebremedhin, Beniam; Rasche, Kurt",BMC infectious diseases,70,1

In this case the treatment for esophageal cancer may have triggered relapsing polychondritis. CASE PRESENTATION A 70-year-old man complained of dysphagia and weight loss. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed type 2 advanced esophageal cancer. A subtotal esophagectomy and three-region lymph node dissection were performed after chemotherapy. One month later, the patient developed respiratory distress accompanied by wheezing, dizziness, and hearing loss. The symptoms improved within a few days. The frequency of respiratory distress increased and the patient visited our department. Pharyngeal endoscopy revealed narrowing of the glottic space and a subglottic tumor. No malignant findings were found histopathologically on the biopsy specimens, but infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed. We diagnosed relapsing polychondritis based on the histopathological findings of the pharyngeal cartilage, in addition to the osteolytic changes of the cricoid cartilage on CT. The symptoms were relieved after the administration of oral steroids. Despite tapering of the steroids, no recurrence of relapsing polychondritis occurred. There was no evidence of esophageal cancer recurrence. CONCLUSION Early diagnosis and treatment for relapsing polychondritis are necessary because this condition is often associated with airway lesions. Esophageal cancer treatment may trigger relapsing polychondritis.","Mase, Junichi; Tanaka, Yoshihiro; Sato, Yuta; Imai, Takeharu; Okumura, Naoki; Matsuhashi, Nobuhisa; Takahashi, Takao; Yoshida, Kazuhiro",Clinical journal of gastroenterology,70,1

Reducing these risks is important for the individual patient but also for health-care planners and managers. Insufficient tissue perfusion and cellular oxygenation due to hypovolemia, heart dysfunction or both is one of the leading causes of perioperative complications. Adequate perioperative management guided by effective and timely hemodynamic monitoring can help reduce the risk of complications and thus potentially improve outcomes. In this review, we describe the various available hemodynamic monitoring systems and how they can best be used to guide cardiovascular and fluid management in the perioperative period in high-risk surgical patients.","Vincent, Jean-Louis; Pelosi, Paolo; Pearse, Rupert; Payen, Didier; Perel, Azriel; Hoeft, Andreas; Romagnoli, Stefano; Ranieri, V Marco; Ichai, Carole; Forget, Patrice; Della Rocca, Giorgio; Rhodes, Andrew",Critical care,70,28

METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted over a 3-year period. The recurrence rate; pain scores at 24 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks; hospital stay; days to resumption of normal activities; seroma formation; and urinary retention rates were noted. RESULTS Of 937 patients, 52 underwent recurrent and 885 underwent primary hernia repair. The follow-up period was 12 to 40 months (median, 25 months). The mean operating time was longer in the recurrent group (32.7 +/- 6.3 min) than in the primary group (30.1 +/- 6.1 min; p = 0.015). The mean pain scores at 24 h were similar in the two groups (2.28 +/- 0.5 for the recurrent group vs. 2.20 +/- 0.4 for the primary group; nonsignificant difference). However the pain scores at 1 week were significantly higher in the recurrent group (1.35 +/- 0.5) than in the primary group (1.20 +/- 0.4; p = 0.017). The hospital stay (1.19 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.07 +/- 0.3 days; p = 0.002) and the time to resumption of normal activities (8.62 +/- 2.6 vs. 7.67 +/- 1.4 days; p < 0.0001) were significantly longer in the recurrent group than in the primary group. The urinary retention (9.6% vs. 5.4%; nonsignificant difference) and seroma formation (3.8% vs. 3.5%; p = 0.5) were similar in the recurrent and the primary groups, respectively. There were two recurrences and two conversions to open procedure in the primary group and none in the recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TEP repair of recurrent inguinal hernia is safe and effective, with recurrence and conversion rates similar to those for primary hernia repair. However, the operative time, pain at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively, hospital stay, and time to resumption of normal activities with recurrent repair were significantly greater than with laparoscopic primary hernia repair.","Garg, Pankaj; Menon, Geetha R; Rajagopal, Mahesh; Ismail, Mohamed",Surgical endoscopy,70,1

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of HP colonization on postoperative outcomes of LSG. SETTING The setting of this study is in University Hospital. METHODS This study was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively maintained database of all patients who underwent LSG at Jordan University Hospital from 2008 to 2015. RESULTS Five hundred patients were included (362 females and 138 males). The mean preoperative weight was 124.5 ± 23.8 kg. The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 45.5 ± 6.9 kg/m2. Two hundred sixteen (43.2%) patients were found to be HP positive. The differences between the HP positive and negative groups in respect of sex, baseline weight, and BMI were not statistically significant. However, patients who were HP positive were significantly older. All patients were followed for at least 3 months. We had an overall complication rate of 2.6%. Differences in the complication rate between the two groups were not statistically significant. Follow-up was 61% at 1 year. The mean percent total weight loss (%TWL) was 32.9 ± 7.9, and the mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) was 76.9 ± 21.1. The decrease in BMI was 15.2 ± 5.2.

Lipids, particularly ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, together form lamellar membranes in the extracellular spaces of the SC that limit the loss of water and electrolytes. In addition to preventing water and electrolyte loss, the SC as a permeability barrier prevents the entry of harmful irritants, allergens, and microorganisms into the skin. Disruption of the epidermal barrier leads to skin that is irritated, more reactive, and more sensitive than normal skin. SC thickness, lipid profile, and barrier function vary with different ethnic groups, which is also reflected the differences in prevalence and manifestation of diverse skin conditions related to the skin barrier function such as atopic dermatitis and sensitive skin. In addition to these compromised skin barrier related conditions, we are just now starting to understand the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on the skin and how current preventative measures are contributing to skin barrier disorders. Our understanding of various approaches for restoration of skin barrier, especially the role of topically applied mixtures of cholesterol, ceramides, and essential/nonessential free fatty acids (FFAs) allows for the strengthening of the compromised skin barrier and alleviation of symptoms and discomfort associated with skin barrier disorders. Ceramide containing products on the market are commonly available and offer protection and reparative benefits to the skin barrier.

This 2020 survey aimed to determine views of UK neonatal staff about thresholds for treatment of EPIs given a recently revised national Framework for Practice from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine. METHODS The online survey requested participants indicate the lowest gestation at which they would be willing to offer active treatment and the highest gestation at which they would withhold active treatment of an EPI at parental request (their lower and upper thresholds). Relative risks were used to compare respondents' views based on profession and neonatal unit designation. Further questions explored respondents' conceptual understanding of viability. RESULTS 336 respondents included 167 consultants, 127 registrars/fellows and 42 advanced neonatal nurse practitioners (ANNPs). Respondents reported a median grey zone for neonatal resuscitation between 22+1 and 24+0 weeks' gestation. Registrars/fellows were more likely to select a lower threshold at 22+0 weeks compared with consultants (Relative Risk (RR)=1.37 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.74)) and ANNPs (RR=2.68 (95% CI 1.42 to 5.06)). Those working in neonatal intensive care units compared with other units were also more likely to offer active treatment at 22+0 weeks (RR=1.86 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.94)). Most participants understood a fetus/newborn to be 'viable' if it was possible to survive, regardless of disability, with medical interventions accessible to the treating team. CONCLUSION Compared with previous studies, we found a shift in the reported lower threshold for resuscitation in the UK, with greater acceptance of active treatment for infants <23 weeks' gestation.","Di Stefano, Lydia Mietta; Wood, Katherine; Mactier, Helen; Bates, Sarah Elizabeth; Wilkinson, Dominic",Archives of disease in childhood.

Lithium chloride, a widely prescribed drug for bipolar mood disorder, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Using an intragastric infection model, the effects of LiCl on K. pneumoniae infections were examined. Providing mice with drinking water containing LiCl immediately after infection protected them from K. pneumoniae-induced death and liver injuries, such as necrosis of liver tissues, as well as increasing blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, in a dose-dependent manner. LiCl administered as late as 24 h postinfection still provided protection. Monitoring of the LiCl concentrations in the sera of K. pneumoniae-infected mice showed that approximately 0.33 mM LiCl was the most effective dose for protecting mice against infections, which is lower than the clinically toxic dose of LiCl. Surveys of bacterial counts and cytokine expression levels in LiCl-treated mice revealed that both were effectively inhibited in blood and liver tissues. Using in vitro assays, we found that LiCl (5 μM to 1 mM) did not directly interfere with the growth of K. pneumoniae but made K. pneumoniae cells lose the mucoid phenotype and become more susceptible to macrophage killing. Furthermore, low doses of LiCl also partially enhanced the bactericidal activity of macrophages. Taken together, these data suggest that LiCl is an alternative therapeutic agent for K. pneumoniae-induced liver infections.","Tsao, Nina; Kuo, Chih-Feng; Chiu, Ching-Chen; Lin, Wei-Chen; Huang, Wan-Hui; Chen, Li-Yang",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,70,4

Data on the SARS-CoV-2-exposure/infection rate of gastrointestinal endoscopy staff is scarce. This study aimed to assess the SARS-CoV-2-exposure/infection rate among gastrointestinal endoscopists/nurses performing gastrointestinal endoscopies before and after the adoption of specific prevention measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cross-sectional study in a teaching hospital (Rome, Central Italy) on retrospective data (9 March-15 April 2020) of consecutive gastrointestinal endoscopies, characteristics of procedures, patients and endoscopy staff, SARS-CoV-2-exposure/positivity of patients and staff before and after adoption of prevention measures. Exposed staff tested for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs(RNA-PCR) and serology. RESULTS A total of 130 gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed in 130 patients (age 66 ± 14 years, 51% women, 51% inpatients, 56.9% lower). A total of 12 (9.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2-positive and 14(10.8%) had a high risk of potential infection. Of the endoscopy staff (n = 16, 5 endoscopists, 8 nurses and 3 residents), 14 (87.5%) were exposed to SARS-CoV-2-infected and 16 (100%) to potentially infected patients. 3/5 and 5/5 endoscopists were exposed to actual and potential, 1/3 and 3/3 residents to actual and potential and 8/8 nurses to actual and potential infection, respectively. None of the staff was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. None experienced fever or any other suspicious symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019.

Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be a successful treatment modality; however, its use somewhat limited due to the risk of hemorrhage and potential for distal embolization in the setting of large mobile thrombi. In patients where either thrombolysis is contraindicated or unsuccessful, and conventional therapies prove inadequate, surgical thrombectomy may be considered. We present a case of percutaneous endovascular extraction of a large mobile mass extending from the inferior vena cava into the right atrium using the Angiovac device, a venovenous bypass system designed for high-volume aspiration of undesired endovascular material. Standard endovascular methods for removal of cancer-associated thrombus, such as catheter-directed lysis, maceration, and exclusion, may prove inadequate in the setting of underlying tumor thrombus. Where conventional endovascular methods either fail or are unsuitable, endovascular thrombectomy with the Angiovac device may be a useful and safe minimally invasive alternative to open resection.","Nickel, Barbara; McClure, Timothy; Moriarty, John",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,70,16

Cuprizone-induced demyelination remains incompletely characterized. We found that mice lacking the type 2 CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR2) were relatively resistant to cuprizone-induced demyelination and that circulating CXCR2-positive neutrophils were important for cuprizone-induced demyelination. Our findings support a two-hit process of cuprizone-induced demyelination, supporting the idea that multiple sclerosis pathogenesis features extensive oligodendrocyte cell loss.

However, it is not known whether paricalcitol prevents neuronal injury after global cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study is to investigate the neuroprotective effect of paricalcitol in a rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia. METHODS This is a prospective, randomized experimental study. Male Sprague-Dawley rats that survived 10 min of four-vessel occlusion were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: one group was treated with paricalcitol 1 μg/kg IP, and the other was given an equivalent volume of normal saline IP. Drugs were administered at 5 min, 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days after ischemia. Neurologic function was assessed at 2 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and 4 days after ischemia. We tested motor function 3 days after ischemia using the rotarod test. Also, we tested memory function 4 days after ischemia using the passive avoidance test. We assessed neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus of surviving rats 4 days after ischemia. RESULTS Eight rats were allocated to each group. No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of survival rate, motor coordination, or memory function. The neurological function score 2-h post-ischemia was significantly higher in the paricalcitol group (p = 0.04). Neuronal degeneration was significantly less in the paricalcitol group compared with the control group (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Paricalcitol significantly attenuated neuronal injury in the hippocampus. Although motor coordination, memory function, and survival rate were not significantly improved by paricalcitol treatment in this study, paricalcitol remains a potential neuroprotective drug after global cerebral ischemia.","Kim, Sung Wook; Oh, Joo Suk; Park, Jungtaek; Jeong, Hyun Ho; Oh, Young Min; Choi, Semin; Choi, Kyoung Ho",International journal of emergency medicine,70,19

The use of conscious sedation with local anesthesia and percutaneous femoral access has further decreased the morbidity of the procedure. Current devices can more effectively manage increasingly ""hostile"" aneurysm necks, while chimney grafts or dedicated fenestrated stent-grafts can be used for juxta-renal disease with favorable results. However, endovascular repair does present a new set of challenges, and endoleaks remain an area of concern. While there is general consensus that type I and type III endoleaks require treatment, type II endoleaks are the topic of ongoing research and debate. Development of devices and techniques to prevent and treat endoleak continues to progress. Advances in contrast-enhanced ultrasound are reducing reliance on computed tomography for post-operative monitoring. This is an important step in this population at high risk for the development of kidney failure.

It is hypothesised that determinants of acute asthma would differ across geographic regions. The objective of the present study was to detail seasonality, trends and spatiotemporal patterns of asthma ED presentations across Queensland (QLD), Australia, a state covering 1.8 million square kilometres, spanning multiple climates. METHODS Six years of routinely collected data (2012 to 2017) from 28 major QLD public hospitals were extracted from Queensland Health's Emergency Data Collection. The dataset contained individual, episode-level asthma-like diagnoses of ED presentations. Seasonality and trends of acute asthma were assessed through multiplicative time-series analysis. RESULTS The study consisted of 2192 days with a total of 65 012 asthma ED presentations in QLD. The 6-year average daily incidence rate was 270 asthma ED presentations per 100 000 population. The highest morbidity of asthma ED presentations occurred during the southern hemisphere winter months. Children showed a higher incidence rate compared to adults with males experiencing a higher incidence compared to females up until the age of 13, after which an inversion was observed persisting through adulthood. Seasonality of asthma ED presentations differed with latitude across QLD. CONCLUSION Asthma-related ED presentations exhibit spatiotemporal variation across QLD, which appears to be related to climate.

However, pain management is challenging because the pathophysiology of pain is complex and not completely understood. Widely used analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been associated with adverse events. Adverse event rates are of concern, especially in long-term treatment or at high doses. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are available by prescription, over the counter, and in combination preparations. Patients may be unaware of the risk associated with high dosages or long-term use of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Clinicians should encourage patients to disclose all medications they take in a ""do ask, do tell"" approach that includes patient education about the risks and benefits of common pain relievers. The ideal pain reliever would have few risks and enhanced analgesic efficacy. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with two or more agents may offer additive or synergistic benefits to treat the multiple mechanisms of pain. Therefore, pain may be effectively treated while toxicity is reduced due to lower doses. One recent fixed-dose combination analgesic product combines tramadol, a centrally acting weak opioid analgesic, with low-dose paracetamol. Evidence-based guidelines recognize the potential value of combination analgesics in specific situations. The current guideline-based paradigm for pain treatment recommends NSAIDs for ongoing use with analgesics such as opioids to manage flares. However, the treatment model should evolve how to use low-dose combination products to manage pain with occasional use of NSAIDs for flares to avoid long-term and high-dose treatment with these analgesics. A next step in pain management guidelines should be targeted therapy when possible, or low-dose combination therapy or both, to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity.","Pergolizzi, Joseph V; van de Laar, Mart; Langford, Richard; Mellinghoff, Hans-Ulrich; Merchante, Ignacio Morón; Nalamachu, Srinivas; O'Brien, Joanne; Perrot, Serge; Raffa, Robert B",Journal of pain research,70,1

METHODS Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2013, 2015, and 2017 was accessed and adults (>20 years) with known status of cancer diagnosis were reviewed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then used to examine factors associated with the likelihood of influenza and pneumonia as well as the likelihood of hospitalization secondary to acute RTIs. RESULTS A total of 75665 participants were included (including 6397 cancer survivors and 68733 participants without a cancer history). Within the cohort of cancer survivors, upper RTIs were recorded in 10.6% and influenza and pneumonia were recorded in 7.8%. Within the cohort of cancer survivors, individuals with influenza and pneumonia have a higher total healthcare expenditure (mean: 19387.59 $ versus 12714.57 $; P<0.001) and total out-of-pocket expenditure (mean: 1494.61 $ versus 1159.27 $; P<0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that a history of cancer was associated with a higher likelihood of influenza and pneumonia (OR: 1.119; 95% CI: 1.005-1.247; P= 0.041) as well as hospitalization following acute RTIs (1.586; 95% CI: 1.197-2.103; P=0.001).

With the discovery of six new respiratory viruses since 2000, laboratories are faced with the challenge of detecting up to 19 different viruses that cause acute respiratory disease of both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The application of nucleic acid amplification technology, particularly multiplex PCR coupled with fluidic or fixed microarrays, provides an important new approach for the detection of multiple respiratory viruses in a single test. These multiplex amplification tests provide a sensitive and comprehensive approach for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in individual hospitalized patients and the identification of the etiological agent in outbreaks of respiratory tract infection in the community. This review describes the molecular methods used to detect respiratory viruses and discusses the contribution that molecular testing, especially multiplex PCR, has made to our ability to detect respiratory viruses and to increase our understanding of the roles of various viral agents in acute respiratory disease.","Mahony, James B",Clinical microbiology reviews,70,0

We assessed dose optimization of (111) Indium-DTPA-cetuximab ((111) In-cetuximab) for EGFR imaging in a head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma xenograft model. (111) In-cetuximab slowly internalized into FaDu cells in vitro, amounting to 1.0 × 10(4) molecules cetuximab per cell after 24 hr (15.8% of added activity). In nude mice with subcutaneous FaDu xenograft tumors, a protein dose escalation study with (111) In-cetuximab showed highest specific accumulation in tumors at protein doses between 1 and 30 μg per mouse (mean tumor uptake 33.1 ± 3.1%ID/g, 3 days postinjection (p.i.)). The biodistribution of (111) In-cetuximab and (125) I-cetuximab was determined at 1, 3 and 7 days p.i. at optimal protein dose. Tumor uptake was favorable for (111) In-cetuximab compared to (125) I-cetuximab. With pixel-by-pixel analysis, good correlations were found between intratumoral distribution of (111) In-cetuximab as determined by autoradiography and EGFR expression in the same tumor sections as determined immunohistochemically (mean r = 0.74 ± 0.14; all correlations p < 0.0001).

In the present study, the full-length open reading frames of the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) genes of the virus were sequenced and analyzed. S1 gene phylogenetic analysis revealed that the KrD1515 virus clustered with viruses with the TC07-2 genotype, whereas N gene phylogenetic analysis revealed that the KrD1515 virus clustered with Korean IBVs, but not with Chinese TC07-2 IBV. When 7-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were inoculated with the KrD1515 virus, they developed severe respiratory symptoms and tracheal lesions. However, there were no other clinical symptoms or pathologic lesions in other tissues. The virus was shed from the trachea for at least a week and from the cloaca for only a day. Our findings suggest that the KrD1515 virus is a recombinant virus between a Chinese TC07-2 IBV and a non-TC07-2 Korean IBV and engages in respiratory tropism in chickens.","Jang, Il; Lee, Hyun-Jeong; Bae, You-Chan; Park, Seok-Chan; Lee, Hee-Soo; Choi, Kang-Seuk",Avian diseases,70,1

There are reports using extraperitoneal placement of mesh, patches, and local flaps for repairing the LH. In this report we present a case of repair of a large recurrent congenital LH with free composite anterolateral thigh flap, tensor fascia lata flap and vastus lateralis flap (ALT-TFL-VL flap) and meshes. The patient underwent multiple cutaneous neurofibroma excisions before the treatment of LH. Recurrent neurofibroma and congenital aplasia of lumbar muscles at right flank may contribute to the patient's diffuse congenital LH development. Considering a large fascia defect (12 cm × 15 cm) with absence of lumbar muscles at the herniation site, using mesh alone is not strong enough to stop the herniation of bowel. Transposition of right pedicled ALT-TFL-VL flap (35 cm × 12 cm) with mesh was first attempted but proven to be futile, since the right lumbar wall bulged out from the distal border of previous reconstructed fascia. Thus, another free composite ALT-TFL-VL flap (35 cm × 15 cm) from left thigh was transferred on top of the previous pedicled flap, followed by delayed free flap advancement and surgical mesh addition. Post-operative course was smooth without complications. Twenty-one months after the surgery, computed tomography showed no recurrence of LH. Such case with large recurrent diffuse LH may be treated by a combination of conventional method with meshes and serial reconstruction with pedicled and free flaps for dynamic reconstruction of abdominal wall.","Yu, Anna E; Weng, Hui-Ching; Chen, Hung-Chi",Microsurgery,70,1

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence of lactate as a physiological effector within the normal cerebral microcirculation in reports ranging from in vitro experiments to in vivo studies in animals and humans. Following pre-registration of a review protocol, we systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for literature covering themes of 'lactate', 'the brain', and 'microcirculation'. Abstracts were screened, and data extracted independently by two individuals. We excluded studies evaluating lactate in disease models. Twenty-eight papers were identified, 18 of which were in vivo animal experiments (65%), four on human studies (14%), and six on in vitro or ex vivo experiments (21%). Approximately half of the papers identified lactate as an augmenter of the hyperemic response to functional activation by a visual stimulus or as an instigator of hyperemia in a dose-dependent manner, without external stimulation. The mechanisms are likely to be coupled to NAD+ /NADH redox state influencing the production of nitric oxide. Unfortunately, only 38% of these studies demonstrated any control for bias, which makes reliable generalizations of the conclusions insecure. This systematic review identifies that lactate may act as a dose-dependent regulator of cerebral microcirculation by augmenting the hyperemic response to functional activation below 5 mmol/kg, and by initiating a hyperemic response above 5 mmol/kg.

AIM The Randomized, double-blind, Evaluation in secondary Stroke Prevention comparing the EfficaCy and safety of the oral Thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate vs. acetylsalicylic acid in patients with Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source (RE-SPECT ESUS) is designed to determine whether the oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, taken within three-months after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of recurrent stroke and to characterize the safety of dabigatran in this setting. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial in approximately 6000 patients and 550 centers with embolic stroke of undetermined source. Subjects are randomized to dabigatran or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for an expected minimum of six-months and up to approximately three-years. It is an event-driven trial aiming for 353 adjudicated primary outcome events. STUDY OUTCOMES The primary efficacy outcome is time to first recurrent stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or unspecified). Key secondary outcomes are time to first ischemic stroke and time to first occurrence in the composite outcome of nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. The primary safety outcome is major hemorrhage, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. DISCUSSION Acetylsalicylic acid is the most common antithrombotic given to patients with embolic strokes of undetermined source to reduce recurrence risk. This trial will determine whether anticoagulation with dabigatran is more effective than acetylsalicylic acid, and acceptably safe.","Diener, Hans-Christoph; Easton, J Donald; Granger, Christopher B; Cronin, Lisa; Duffy, Christine; Cotton, Daniel; Brueckmann, Martina; Sacco, Ralph L",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,70,1

METHOD The files of 43 patients (ages 0-18) diagnosed with PE were retrospectively reviewed. The study included 25 patients from our pediatric neurology outpatient clinic, who were thought to have PE, and 18 patients, who were referred from the external centers to our hospital with a pre-diagnosis of PE. RESULTS Of the 43 patients, 28 had PE, 8 had pseudopapilledema (PPE), and 7 had optic nerve pathologies (ONP). For patients who applied directly to our pediatric neurology unit, a margin of error of 8% was detected based on only a simple ophthalmologic examination and an evaluation of clinical findings. For the patients who were forwarded to our pediatric neurology unit from the external centers without examining any clinical findings and with no details, the margin of error was 72%. CONCLUSION For patients with suspected PE, advanced ophthalmologic opinion is a necessary requirement before invasive radiological examinations are used. When the ophthalmologic evaluation is properly elaborated, the distinction can be made more clearly by using noninvasive methods. In order to determine the gold standard in terms of the methods used in the evaluation of patients who are not clinically diagnosed, new prospective studies with more patients should be planned.","Türay, Sevim; Kabakuş, Nimet; Hancı, Fatma; Ulaş, Fatih; Dilek, Mustafa; Cihan, Büşra",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,70,1

This study used rapid sampling online microdialysis to evaluate the biochemical changes occurring in a segment of human bowel during and after resection, and assessed for the feasibility and reproducibility of this technique in monitoring intestinal ischemia. METHODS A custom made, rapid sampling online microdialysis analyzer was used to monitor the changes in the bowel wall of specimens being resected intraoperatively. Two patients were recruited for the pilot study to optimize the analyzer and seven patients undergoing colonic resections were recruited for the data collection and analysis. RESULTS The concentration of glucose in the extracellular bowel wall fluid decreased transiently after division of individual feeding arteries followed by a rebound increase in the concentration back to baseline concentrations. After completion of resection, glucose concentrations continued to decrease while lactate concentrations increased constantly. CONCLUSION Rapid sampling microdialysis was feasible in the clinical environment. These results suggest that tissue responds to ischemic insult by mobilizing glucose stores which later decrease again, whereas lactate concentrations constantly increased.","Deeba, S; Corcoles, E P; Hanna, G B; Pareskevas, P; Aziz, O; Boutelle, M G; Darzi, A",Diseases of the colon and rectum,70,24

Mechanical, anatomical, or technical challenges can result in a partially deployed PED with failed expansion. OBJECTIVE To present a new alternative method of PED deployment using the Navien distal intracranial catheter (DIC) as a salvage maneuver for cases where PED opening fails with standard techniques. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a prospective, single-center aneurysm database to identify all patients who underwent endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms using the PED with the Navien distal intracranial catheter access platform. Cases requiring PED deployment within the Navien catheter were reviewed. Data was collected for patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and technical details of the interventional procedure. RESULTS Eleven PED neurointerventions requiring intra-Navien PED deployment to fully open the PED were identified. Mean patient age was 55.5±9.9 years (range 37-76 years). Mean aneurysm size was 12.5 mm±4.9 mm (range 2-42 mm). All aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (anterior cerebral artery, n=1; supraclinoid, n=1; ophthalmic/paraophthalmic, n=6; cavernous, n=3; petrocervical, n=1). Mean fluoroscopy time was 67.1±20.5 min. The intra-Navien technique was used to open the proximal PED (n=7) and the mid-portion (n=4). Post-processing of the PED with a balloon was used in six cases. CONCLUSIONS When a partially deployed PED remains constrained despite exhaustion of standard maneuvers to facilitate opening, the technique of intra-Navien PED deployment is a valuable rescue strategy. This new alternative method of PED deployment can be used to open a stretched device with successful completion of the PED implantation.","Lin, Li-Mei; Colby, Geoffrey P; Jiang, Bowen; Nundkumar, Neelesh; Huang, Judy; Tamargo, Rafael J; Coon, Alexander L",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,70,1

The aim of this study was to compare the cost of operative implements used for elective cholecystectomy performed as conventional laparoscopic 4-port cholecystectomy or as single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS Two consecutive series of patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy were assessed: (1) single-incision cholecystectomy using a commercially available multichannel port (n=80) and (2) a modified single-incision cholecystectomy using 2 regular trocars inserted through the umbilicus (n=20) with transabdominal sutures for gallbladder mobilization (puppeteering technique). Patients who underwent conventional 4-port cholecystectomy during the same time period (n=100) were selected as controls. RESULTS The instrumental cost of the single-incision cholecystectomy using a commercial port was significantly higher (median, $1123) than the cost for conventional 4-port (median $441, P < .0005) and modified single-incision cholecystectomy (median $342, P < .0005). The cost of the modified single-incision procedure was significantly lower than that for the 4-port cholecystectomy (P < .0005). CONCLUSION The modified single-incision procedure using 2 regular ports inserted through the umbilicus can be performed at lower cost than conventional 4-port cholecystectomy.","Henriksen, Nadia A; Al-Tayar, Haytham; Rosenberg, Jacob; Jorgensen, Lars Nannestad",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,70,26

Computed tomography (CT) can provide important information in COVID-19, especially for patients with moderate to severe disease as well as those with worsening cardiopulmonary status. As an automatic tool, deep learning methods can be utilized to perform semantic segmentation of affected lung regions, which is important to establish disease severity and prognosis prediction. Both the extent and type of pulmonary opacities help assess disease severity. However, manually pixel-level multi-class labelling is time-consuming, subjective, and non-quantitative. In this work, we proposed a hybrid weak label-based deep learning method that utilize both the manually annotated pulmonary opacities from COVID-19 pneumonia and the patient-level disease-type information available from the clinical report. A UNet was firstly trained with semantic labels to segment the total infected region. It was used to initialize another UNet, which was trained to segment the consolidations with patient-level information using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, multi-institutional CT datasets from Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the United States were utilized. Results show that our proposed method can predict the infected regions as well as the consolidation regions with a good correlation to human annotation.","Wu, Dufan; Gong, Kuang; Arru, Chiara; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Bizzo, Bernardo; Buch, Varun; Ren, Hui; Kim, Kyungsang; Neumark, Nir; Tak, Won Young; Kang, Min Kyu; Carriero, Alessandro; Saba, Luca; Dayan, Ittai; Masjedi, Mahsa; Babaei, Rosa; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Li, Quanzheng",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,70,26

Objective: To assess the predictors for effective telepharmacy services on increasing access of patients to care and reducing dispensing errors in community pharmacies. Method: This is a prospective study carried out for 4 months in 52 community pharmacies across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using disguised direct observation. Multivariable logistic regression was used as a tool to predict factors associated with effective telepharmacy services in improving dispensing safety and increasing access of patients to pharmaceutical care. Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 26. Results: Pharmacist recommendations related to COVID-19 at pharmacies with telepharmacy (n = 63,714) versus those without remote services (n = 15,539) were significantly more likely to be (1) contact the nearest testing center (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.93), (2) maintain home quarantine (AOR = 5.64), and (3) take paracetamol for fever (AOR = 3.53), all were significant results (p < 0.05). Rates of medication dispensing errors (MDEs) and its subcategories, prescription-related errors, and pharmacist counseling errors across pharmacies with telepharmacy versus those without remote services were (15.81% vs. 19.43%, p < 0.05), (5.38% vs. 10.08%, p < 0.05), and (10.42% vs. 9.35%, p > 0.05), respectively. However, pharmacies with telepharmacy were more likely to include wrong patient errors (AOR = 5.38, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Telepharmacy can be used as a tool to reduce the burden on the health care system and improve drug dispensing safety in community pharmacies.","Mohamed Ibrahim, Osama; Ibrahim, Rana M; Abdel-Qader, Derar H; Al Meslamani, Ahmad Z; Al Mazrouei, Nadia",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,70,33

Despite the extensive studies on RLRs in humans and mice, there is a lack of systemic investigation of livestock animal RLRs. In this study, we characterized the porcine RLR members RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. Compared with their human counterparts, porcine RIG-I and MDA5 exhibited similar signaling activity to distinct dsRNA and viruses, via similar and cooperative recognitions. Porcine LGP2, without signaling activity, was found to positively regulate porcine RIG-I and MDA5 in transfected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), gene knockout PAMs and PK-15 cells. Mechanistically, LGP2 interacts with RIG-I and MDA5 upon cell activation, and promotes the binding of dsRNA ligand by MDA5 as well as RIG-I. Accordingly, porcine LGP2 exerted broad antiviral functions. Intriguingly, we found that porcine LGP2 mutants with defects in ATPase and/or dsRNA binding present constitutive activity which are likely through RIG-I and MDA5.

Reporting radiographers provide a cost-effective and safe solution for managing CXR backlogs, but not all Trusts support this service development. This study aimed to establish the service enablers and challenges associated with training and employing radiographers to report CXR images in acute hospital sites in England, UK. METHODS Approval for this electronic survey was granted in 84 of 146 (58%) Trusts approached. The survey was open for 10 weeks during August to October 2020, comprising of qualitative and quantitative questions. Data was exported in to an Excel spreadsheet where manual thematic analysis was performed. Descriptive statistics were also generated. RESULTS Sample size was 75 (89% response rate). Thirty-three departments (44%) had at least one trainee. Most departments (n = 53, 71%) employ at least one CXR reporting radiographer. A total of 121/160 (76%) radiographers report CXRs. Number of reporting sessions shows progression. Factors enabling training and employment arise from service improvements, financial pressures, and developing the workforce. The main challenges relate to staffing issues with a number of associated sub-themes. A small faction indicated lack of radiographer interest to report CXRs due to litigation worries; possibly uncovering a new and emerging issue. CONCLUSION Enablers and challenges associated with radiographers reporting CXRs are similar to previous studies. The growth of CXR reporting radiographers and reporting sessions indicates a continuing reliance on radiographers to contributing to managing CXR backlogs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE It is recommended that potential trainees are explicitly informed of the legal protection that will be provided, to prevent accountability concerns impacting on the continuing progression in this area of advanced practice.","Stevens, B J; Skermer, L; Davies, J",Radiography,70,16

Although Sivelestat reduces inflammatory mediators and Rolipram inhibits PMN and MO activation, any kinetic effects to improve CPB recovery in vivo are unknown. We hypothesized that intraoperative co-administration of these compounds would reduce CPB-induced lung inflammation through downregulation of PMN and MO recruitment. A 2-h CPB was surgically established in cynomolgus monkeys (n = 13), and BM leukocyte release and lung recruitment were monitored postoperatively by flow cytometry with 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and cytokine ELISA. Either Sivelestat, Sivelestat plus Rolipram, or saline (control) was administered intraoperatively and both peripheral and perfusion sampling courses revealed BrdU-labeled cells representative of activated leukocyte infiltration. Levels of cytokines CD11b and CD18 were leukocytic activation markers. Sivelestat plus Rolipram attenuated increases in CPB-associated circulating band cells, prolonged BM-transit time (PMN: 121.0 ± 3.7 to 96.2 ± 4.3 h [control], p = 0.012; MO: 84.4 ± 4.1 to 61.4 ± 3.0 h [control], p = 0.003), and reduced their alveolar appearance. CD11b-mediated PMN and MO changes during CPB and the post-surgical increases of Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were suppressed. Sivelestat alone increased PMN transit time to 115.8 ± 6.6 h, but monocytes were unaffected. Therefore, Rolipram has additive inhibitory effects with Sivelestat on the CPB-induced activation and release of BM-derived PMNs and MO and their recruitment to the lungs. Co-administration of these compounds could, therefore, hold value for preventing CPB-induced lung injury.","Goto, Yukinobu; Hiramatsu, Yuji; Ageyama, Naohide; Sato, Shoko; Mathis, Bryan J; Kitazawa, Shinsuke; Matsubara, Muneaki; Sakamoto, Hiroaki; Sato, Yukio",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,70,8

It has a great impact on postoperative morbidity and mortality. This animal model, in which we have studied postoperative metabolic and inflammatory changes, is designed to imitate an anastomotic leakage. Materials and Methods 12 pigs were randomized into two groups. In the experimental group an iatrogenic rectal perforation was performed, the control group having a sham operation. The two groups were followed for 10 hours after operation with regard to vital parameters, arterial lactate, and cytokines IL1, IL6 and IL10 in the blood and intraperitoneally. Intraperitoneal microdialysis analyses of glucose, lactate, glycerol and pyruvate were performed and the lactate/pyruvate ratio was calculated. Results Glucose levels were lower in the experimental group after 4 hours. After 7 hours lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratios were higher in the experimental group. At the same time intraperitoneal cytokines IL6 and IL10 were higher in the experimental group.Blood samples showed higher IL6 after 7 hours in the experimental group. Conclusion In this study several significant differences between the groups in metabolic and inflammatory values were detected. Further clinical studies are recommended to evaluate the importance of intraperitoneal metabolic and inflammatory analyses as a diagnostic tool for early identification of an anastomotic leakage.","Oikonomakis, Ioannis; Horer, Tal Martin; Skoog, Per; Nilsson, Kristofer; Jansson, Kjell Sigvard",Annals of coloproctology,70,12

This Amsterdam Colorectal Liver Met Registry (AmCORE) based study included 520 patients, 774 procedures, and 2101 tumors undergoing local treatment (resection and/or thermal ablation) from 2000 to 2021. Outcomes following local treatment were analyzed for primary tumor sidedness of CRC, RAS, and BRAF mutations and MSI status. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS), local control (LC), distant progression-free survival (DPFS), and overall survival (OS). Uni- and multivariable analyses were performed based on Cox proportional hazards model. The chi-square test was used to analyze complications. Complications (p = 0.485), OS (p = 0.252), LTPFS (p = 0.939), and LC (p = 0.423) was not associated with tumor-sidedness. Compared to right-sided colon cancer (CC) (reference HR 1.000), DPFS was superior for left-sided CC and rectal cancer (p = 0.018) with an HR for left-sided CC of 0.742 (95% CI, 0.596-0.923) and for RC of 0.760 (95% CI, 0.597-0.966). Regarding RAS mutations, no significant difference was found in OS (p = 0.116). DPFS (p = 0.001), LTPFS (p = 0.039), and LC (p = 0.025) were significantly lower in the RAS mutation group. Though no difference in LTPFS was found between RAS wildtype and RAS mutated CRLM following resection (p = 0.532), LTPFS was worse for RAS mutated tumors compared to RAS wildtype following thermal ablation (p = 0.037). OS was significantly lower in the BRAF mutation group (p < 0.001) and in the MSI group (p < 0.001) following local treatment, while both did not affect DPFS, LTPFS, and LC. This AmCORE based study suggests the necessity of wider margins to reduce LTP rates in patients with RAS mutated CRLM, especially for thermal ablation. Upfront knowledge regarding molecular biomarkers may contribute to improved oncological outcomes.","Dijkstra, Madelon; Nieuwenhuizen, Sanne; Puijk, Robbert S; Timmer, Florentine E F; Geboers, Bart; Schouten, Evelien A C; Opperman, Jip; Scheffer, Hester J; de Vries, Jan J J; Versteeg, Kathelijn S; Lissenberg-Witte, Birgit I; van den Tol, M Petrousjka; Meijerink, Martijn R",Biomedicines,70,31

CRF, MF, and S-AF were assessed through the ALPHA-fitness test battery. Cognition was evaluated through the NeuroCognitive Performance Test, which involved eight tests related to four main domains: cognitive flexibility (CF), working memory (WM), inhibitory control (IC), and intelligence (IN). Both global (multivariate) and individual (univariate) analyses were performed to determine the differences in cognitive functioning according to low, middle, and high fitness level. The global analyses showed a significant main effect for CRF (F(16, 940) =3.08, p≤0.001) and MF groups (F(16, 953) =2.30, p=0.002), but not for S-AF (F(16, 948) =1.37, p=0.105). CRF shows a significant main effect in seven of eight tests, involving CF, WM, IC, and IN domains; whereas MF shows a significant main effect in five of eight tests without association with IN. SA-F shows a significant main effect only with IC. Statistical differences were found between the low- and middle/high-fitness groups but not between the middle- and high-fitness groups. At a global level, both CRF and MF seems to be associated with a higher cognitive profile in scholars; however, at an individual level, all fitness components show a favourable relationship to some cognitive domine.

In the current study, the majority of the intrinsic anti-HIV-1 activity of human seminal plasma (SP) was determined to reside in the cationic polypeptide fraction. Antiviral assays utilizing luciferase reporter cells and lymphocytic cells revealed the ability of whole SP to prevent HIV-1 infection, even when SP was diluted 3200-fold. Subsequent fractionation by continuous flow acid-urea (AU)-PAGE and antiviral testing revealed that cationic polypeptides within SP were responsible for the majority of anti-HIV-1 activity. A proteomic approach was utilized to resolve and identify 52 individual cationic polypeptides that contribute to the aggregate anti-HIV-1 activity of SP. One peptide fragment of semenogelin I, termed SG-1, was purified from SP by a multistep chromatographic approach, protein sequenced, and determined to exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity against HIV-1. Anti-HIV-1 activity was transient, as whole SP incubated for prolonged time intervals exhibited a proportional decrease in anti-HIV-1 activity that was directly attributed to the degradation of semenogelin I peptides. Collectively, these results indicate that the cationic polypeptide fraction of SP is active against HIV-1, and that semenogelin-derived peptides contribute to the intrinsic anti-HIV-1 activity of SP.","Martellini, Julie A; Cole, Amy L; Venkataraman, Nitya; Quinn, Gerry A; Svoboda, Pavel; Gangrade, Bhushan K; Pohl, Jan; Sørensen, Ole E; Cole, Alexander M",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,70,1

Along with these tasks, we collected data from either an IQ test or a math computation test. Subjects in the lexical decision and item recognition tasks were relatively well-behaved, with only a few giving a significant number of responses with response times (RTs) under 300 ms at chance accuracy, i.e., fast guesses, and a few with unstable RTs across a session. But in the numerosity discrimination tasks, almost half of the subjects gave a significant number of fast guesses and/or unstable RTs across the session. Diffusion model parameters were largely consistent with the earlier studies as were correlations across tasks and correlations with IQ and age. One surprising result was that eliminating fast outliers from subjects with highly variable RTs (those eliminated from the main analyses) produced diffusion model analyses that showed patterns of correlations similar to the subjects with stable performance. Methods for displaying data to examine stability, eliminating subjects, and implementing RT data collection on AMT including checks on timing are also discussed.","Ratcliff, Roger; Hendrickson, Andrew T",Behavior research methods,70,28

We compared one such assay, the PLx Multi-Code Respiratory Virus Panel (PLx-RVP), manufactured by Eragen Biosciences, Inc. (Madison, WI), with conventional virologic testing, consisting of fluorescent-antibody staining plus testing with the R-mix system and fibroblast tube cultures. The test set consisted of 410 archived respiratory specimens, mostly nasopharyngeal swabs, including 210 that had been positive by conventional testing for a balanced selection of common respiratory viruses. Specimens yielding discrepant results were evaluated using a panel of respiratory virus PCR assays developed, characterized, and validated with clinical specimens. PLx-RVP increased the total rate of detection of viruses by 35.8%, and there was a 25.7% increase in the rate of detection of positive specimens. Reference PCR assay results corroborated the PLx-RVP result for 54 (82%) of 66 discrepancies with conventional testing. Of the 12 specimens with discrepancies between PLx-RVp and the reference PCRs, 6 were positive for rhinovirus by PLx-RVP and the presence of rhinovirus was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The remaining six specimens included five in which the PLx-RVP failed to detect parainfluenza virus and one in which the detection of influenza A virus by PLx-RVP could not be confirmed by the reference PCR. Taking the results of the reference PCR assay results into account, the sensitivities of the PLx-RVP for individual viruses ranged from 94 to 100% and the specificities ranged from 99 to 100%. We conclude that PLx-RVP is a highly accurate system for the detection of respiratory viruses and significantly improves the rate of detection of these viruses compared to that by conventional virologic testing.","Arens, Max Q; Buller, Richard S; Rankin, Anne; Mason, Sheila; Whetsell, Amy; Agapov, Eugene; Lee, Wai-Ming; Storch, Gregory A",Journal of clinical microbiology,70,1

This would serve as the foundation of competency assurance in Hong Kong hospitals. DESIGN A cross-sectional survey design was used. SETTING All public and private hospitals in Hong Kong. SUBJECTS All infection control nurses in hospitals of Hong Kong. METHODS The 83-item proposed core competency list established in an earlier study was transformed into a questionnaire and sent to 112 infection control nurses in 48 hospitals in Hong Kong. They were asked to rate the importance of each infection prevention and control item using Likert-style response categories. Data were analyzed using the Rasch model. RESULTS The response rate of 81.25% was achieved. Seven items were removed from the proposed core competency list, leaving a scale of 76 items that fit the measurement requirements of the unidimensional Rasch model. CONCLUSIONS Essential core competency items of advanced practice for infection control nurses in Hong Kong were identified based on the measurement criteria of the Rasch model. Several items of the scale that reflect local Hong Kong contextual characteristics are distinguished from the overseas standards.

METHODS Analysis of validated self-administered questionnaires, radiological characteristics, and treatment strategies of PA was performed. RESULTS Of the 221 sent questionnaires, 146 could be used for statistical analysis, 50% of which were completed by women. Among responders, 58.9% had pain: 30.1% migraine, 15.7% pain with NC, and 13.1% other types of pain. Migraine was more common in patients with PA than in the general population (30.1% vs 21.3%, p=0.010) and attacks received appropriate treatment for less than 20% of these patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of chronic migraine was much higher than in the general population (6.8% vs 2.2%, p=0.003). Neuropathic pain was also more frequent in PA patients than in the general population (15.8% vs 6.9%, p<0.001). Neuropathic pain was most often located in the extremities and was frequently described as an ""electric shock"", ""numbness"", or ""pins-and-needles"". Multivariate analyses linked migraine to younger age, anxiety, pain with NC, and a visible tumor on MRI, regardless of its invasiveness or secretory nature. CONCLUSIONS Migraine headaches and neuropathic pain are more frequent and disabling in PA patients than in the general population. Both types of pain are comorbid in PA patients and are poorly treated. Migraine is associated with the presence of a tumor. Thus, biological mechanisms of this relationship need to be characterized to design optimal treatments for these individuals.","Dallel, Sarah; Devoize, Laurent; Tauveron, Igor; Pereira, Bruno; Clavelou, Pierre; Maqdasy, Salwan; Moisset, Xavier; Dallel, Radhouane",European journal of pain,70,31

This is particularly the case for individuals reporting high trait anxious personality. The present study examined the role of anxiety in both attention and memory-related interactions with threat. We employed a hybrid working memory/visual search task, with participants preselected for low and high anxious personality traits. They selected and memorized an emotional face (angry or happy) appearing together with a neutral face in encode displays. Following a delay period, they matched the identity of the memorized face to a probe display item. Event-related markers of attentional selection (N2pc components) and memory maintenance during the delay period (i.e., CDA) were measured. Selection biases toward angry faces were observed within both encode and probe displays, evidenced by earlier and larger N2pcs. A similar threat-related bias was also found during working memory maintenance, with larger CDA components when angry faces were stored. High anxious individuals showed large selection biases for angry faces at encoding. For low anxious individuals, this bias was smaller but still significant. In contrast, only high anxious individuals showed larger CDA components for angry faces. These results suggest that threat biases in attentional selection are modulated by trait anxiety, and that threat biases within working memory may only be present for high anxious individuals. These findings highlight the key role of individual differences in trait anxiety on threat-related biases in visual processing, especially at the level of working memory maintenance.","Berggren, Nick; Eimer, Martin",Psychophysiology,70,19

METHODS A retrospective review of all patients who underwent lower eyelid retraction repair with porcine dermal matrix implantation between June 2007 and July 2013 at a tertiary care center was conducted. Patient demographics, procedure(s) performed, preoperative and postoperative marginal reflex distance, inferior scleral show, and complications were reviewed. Patients with a prior history of lower eyelid surgery were excluded. The study is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant, institutional review board approved, and adherent to the Declaration of Helsinki. RESULTS One hundred patients (160 eyelids) received porcine dermal collagen implants. Fifty-six patients had thyroid eye disease, 23 had midface descent, 10 had seventh nerve palsies, and 11 had other etiologies of retraction. The average preoperative marginal reflex distance was 7.64 mm in the OD and 7.17 mm in the OS, compared with 6.40 mm in the OD and 6.22 mm in the OS postoperatively. The average preoperative inferior scleral show was 2.04 in the OD and 1.70 in the OS compared with 0.81 mm in the OD and 0.65 mm in the OS postoperatively. Follow up ranged from 1.46 to 66.04 months, with an average of 14.06 months and median of 8.84 months. Nineteen eyelids had implant-related complications: 7 with cyst formation, 7 with exposure/rejection, 2 with long-term pain, 2 with transient inflammation, and 3 with irregular implant contour. CONCLUSIONS Porcine dermal matrix implants provide reliable support, integration, and function in lower eyelid retraction repair without significant resorption or complications in the majority of patients.","Dailey, Roger A; Marx, Douglas P; Ahn, Eric S",Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,70,1

The Neuroform EZ (Boston Scientific, Fremont, CA, U.S.A.) stent delivery system offers deployment of a Neuroform stent with fewer steps and improved operator control. Initial experience, technical considerations, and treatment outcomes using the Neuroform EZ stent delivery system in combination with coil embolization are reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen consecutive patients harboring 21 wide-necked saccular cerebral aneurysms were treated with stent reconstruction. Twenty aneurysms were unruptured; one was treated within 24 hours of diagnosis of rupture. Twenty aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation; one was in the posterior circulation. Immediate and six-month post-treatment angiography and clinical assessment were performed. RESULTS In all cases, the stents were delivered and positioned without difficulty in deployment. Technical complications occurred in 4 patients, but none were directly related to the stent delivery system. On immediate post-treatment angiography, 5 of 21 aneurysms showed complete occlusion, 5 of 21 showed residual neck, and 11 of 21 showed residual contrast filling of the aneurysm sac. At six month follow-up, all 17 patients were clinically stable. Angiography of 18 of the aneurysms showed total occlusion in 12, residual neck in 3, and residual aneurysm filling in 3. Retreatment was performed in the three with residual aneurysm. CONCLUSION The Neuroform EZ stent system offers improved anchoring and support in stent delivery, which is particularly useful when multiple stents are overlapped to further protect the parent vessel and increase flow diversion away from the aneurysm sac. The only significant problem encountered was coil prolapse, which could be treated with a second stent when necessary. The ease of deployment improves upon the already clinically successful Neuroform design.","Mangubat, Erwin Zeta; Johnson, Andrew Kelly; Keigher, Kiffon M; Lopes, Demetrius Klee",Neurointervention,70,1

A number of studies suggest that assessment of C. burnetii-specific T-cell IFNγ responses may be a more sensitive tool to assess past exposure. In this study, we assessed the performance of a whole blood C. burnetii IFNγ release assay in comparison to serological detection in an area of high Q fever incidence in 2014, up to seven years after initial exposure during the Dutch Q fever outbreak 2007-2010. In a cohort of >1500 individuals from the Dutch outbreak village of Herpen, approximately 60% had mounted IFNγ responses to C. burnetii. This proportion was independent of the Coxiella strain used for stimulation and much higher than the proportion of individuals scored sero-positive using the serological gold standard immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, C. burnetii-specific IFNγ responses were found to be more durable than antibody responses in two sub-groups of individuals known to have sero-converted as of 2007 or previously reported to the municipality as notified Q fever cases. A novel ready-to-use version of the IFNγ release assay assessed in a subgroup of pre-exposed individuals in 2021 (10-14 years post exposure) proved again to be more sensitive than serology in detecting past exposure. These data demonstrate that C. burnetii-induced IFNγ release is indeed a more sensitive and durable marker of exposure to C. burnetii than are serological responses. In combination with a simplified assay version suitable for implementation in routine diagnostic settings, this makes the assessment of IFNγ responses a valuable tool for exposure screening to obtain epidemiological data, and to identify previously exposed individuals in pre-vaccination screens.","Scholzen, Anja; de Vries, Margot; Duerr, Hans-Peter; Roest, Hendrik-Jan; Sluder, Ann E; Poznansky, Mark C; Kouwijzer, Milou L C E; Garritsen, Anja",Frontiers in immunology,70,17

Consequently, programmes of research focus on the elucidation of novel therapeutics for alleviation of mucositis symptoms, and these frequently use animal models. However, although these models are assumed to be painful and distressing to the animal, endpoints are difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a change in burrowing behaviour could provide an indication of disease onset and potentially be applied as a humane endpoint. Baseline burrowing behaviour was measured in healthy animals on three occasions by determining the weight of gravel displaced from a hollow tube. Mucositis was then induced in the same animals by intraperitoneal injection of 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg) and burrowing behaviour recorded over three consecutive days. Standard measures of disease progression, including body weight loss and clinical score, were also made. The presence of mucositis was confirmed at necropsy by findings of decreased duodenal and colon lengths, and reduced liver, spleen and thymus weights in comparison with non-treated control animals. Histological score of the jejunum and ileum was also significantly increased. Mucositis onset coincided with a decrease in mean burrowing behaviour which was progressive, however this result did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.66).We conclude that burrowing may be a useful indicator of inflammation in the mucositis model, although this requires further characterization. Pre-selection of animals into treatment groups based on their prior burrowing performance should be pursued in further studies.","Whittaker, A L; Lymn, K A; Nicholson, A; Howarth, G S",Laboratory animals,70,1

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze outcomes after Y-stent placement in wide-neck aneurysms. DATA SOURCES We performed a systematic search of 3 data bases for studies published from 2000 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies reporting Y-stent-assisted coiling of wide-neck aneurysms. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following: aneurysm occlusion rate, complications, and factors influencing the studied outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 27 studies and 750 aneurysms treated with Y-stent placement. The immediate complete/near-complete occlusion rate was 82.2% (352/468; 95% CI, 71.4%-93%; I2 = 92%), whereas the long-term complete/near-complete occlusion rate was 95.4% (564/598; 95% CI, 93.7%-97%; I2 = 0%) (mean radiologic follow-up of 14 months). The aneurysm recanalization rate was 3% (20/496; 95% CI, 1.5%-4.5%; I2 = 0%), and half of the recanalized aneurysms required retreatment. The treatment-related complication rate was 8.9% (63/614; 95% CI, 5.8%-12.1%; I2 = 44%). Morbidity and mortality after treatment were 2.4% (18/540; 95% CI, 1.2%-3.7%; I2 = 0%) and 1.1% (5/668; 95% CI, 0.3%-1.9%; I2 = 0%), respectively. Crossing Y-stent placement was associated with a slightly lower complication rate compared with the kissing configuration (56/572 = 8.4%; 95% CI, 5%-11%; I2 = 46% versus 4/30 = 12.7%; 95% CI, 3%-24%; I2 = 0%). Occlusion rates were quite comparable among Enterprise, Neuroform, and LVIS stents, whereas the Enterprise stent was associated with lower rates of complications (8/89 = 6.5%; 95% CI, 1.6%-11%; I2 = 0%) compared with the others (20/131 = 14%; 95% CI, 5%-26%; I2 = 69% and 9/64 = 11%; 95% CI, 3%-20%; I2 = 18%). LIMITATIONS This was a small, retrospective series. CONCLUSIONS Y-stent-assisted coiling yields high rates of long-term angiographic occlusion, with a relatively low rate of treatment-related complications. Y-stent placement with a crossing configuration appears to be associated with better outcomes. Although Y-configuration can be obtained using many types of stents with comparable occlusion rates, the Enterprise stent is associated with lower complication rates.","Cagnazzo, F; Limbucci, N; Nappini, S; Renieri, L; Rosi, A; Laiso, A; Tiziano di Carlo, D; Perrini, P; Mangiafico, S",AJNR.

However, the effectiveness of these screening methods in identifying individuals with Lynch syndrome across the population has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) methylation, and microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis among patients with endometrial cancer. METHODS A complete systematic search of online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library) for 1990-2018 was performed. A DerSimonian-Laird random effects model meta-analysis was used to estimate the weighted prevalence of Lynch syndrome diagnoses. RESULTS The comprehensive search produced 4400 publications. Twenty-nine peer-reviewed studies met the inclusion criteria. Patients with endometrial cancer (n = 6649) were identified, and 206 (3%) were confirmed to have Lynch syndrome through germline genetic testing after positive universal tumor molecular screening. Among 5917 patients who underwent tumor IHC, 28% had abnormal staining. Among 3140 patients who underwent MSI analysis, 31% had MSI. Among patients with endometrial cancer, the weighted prevalence of Lynch syndrome germline mutations was 15% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11%-18%) with deficient IHC staining and 19% (95% CI, 13%-26%) with a positive MSI analysis. Among 1159 patients who exhibited a loss of MLH1 staining, 143 (13.7%) were found to be MLH1 methylation-negative among those who underwent methylation testing, and 32 demonstrated a germline MLH1 mutation (2.8% of all absent MLH1 staining cases and 22.4% of all MLH1 methylation-negative cases). Forty-three percent of patients with endometrial cancer who were diagnosed with Lynch syndrome via tumor typing would have been missed by family history-based screening alone. CONCLUSIONS Despite the widespread implementation of universal tumor testing in endometrial cancer, data regarding testing results remain limited. This study provides predictive values that will help practitioners to evaluate abnormal results in the context of Lynch syndrome and aid them in patient counseling.","Kahn, Ryan M; Gordhandas, Sushmita; Maddy, Brandon Paul; Baltich Nelson, Becky; Askin, Gulce; Christos, Paul J; Caputo, Thomas A; Chapman-Davis, Eloise; Holcomb, Kevin; Frey, Melissa K",Cancer,70,27

Treatment of neoplasia at an early stage is desirable. Combined endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative to surgery for patients with BE-related neoplasia. METHODS We examined prospective data from the UK registry of patients undergoing RFA/EMR for BE-related neoplasia from 2008 to 2013. Before RFA, visible lesions were removed by EMR. Thereafter, patients had RFA 3-monthly until all BE was ablated or cancer developed (endpoints). End of treatment biopsies were recommended at around 12 months from first RFA treatment or when endpoints were reached. Outcomes for clearance of dysplasia (CR-D) and BE (CR-IM) at end of treatment were assessed over two time periods (2008-2010 and 2011-2013). Durability of successful treatment and progression to OAC were also evaluated. RESULTS 508 patients have completed treatment. CR-D and CR-IM improved significantly between the former and later time periods, from 77% and 56% to 92% and 83%, respectively (p<0.0001). EMR for visible lesions prior to RFA increased from 48% to 60% (p=0.013). Rescue EMR after RFA decreased from 13% to 2% (p<0.0001). Progression to OAC at 12 months is not significantly different (3.6% vs 2.1%, p=0.51). CONCLUSIONS Clinical outcomes for BE neoplasia have improved significantly over the past 6 years with improved lesion recognition and aggressive resection of visible lesions before RFA.

Previous research has indicated that loss of employment is associated with mental illness and increased alcohol consumption. However, no studies have explored this relationship in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.Objective: The purpose was twofold: (1) Evaluate the association between pandemic-related employment status and alcohol consumption and (2) assess the interacting effect of depression and employment change on alcohol consumption. We hypothesized that (1) employment change would be associated with increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic and (2) the combined effects of depressive symptoms with pandemic-related-employment-change would strengthen the association with alcohol consumption.Methods: A self-report, web-based survey collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19-related employment impact (e.g., decreased pay, laid off), change in alcohol consumption since the pandemic, reasons for consumption change, and depressive symptoms. Multinomial regression modeling explored the associations between variables.Results: One-third (33%) of participants (n = 2,441; 67% female) reported consuming more alcohol compared to pre-pandemic and 11% reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their employment. Participants reported drinking more alcohol due to having more time (28%) or boredom (22%). The adjusted odds of increased alcohol consumption were 47% greater among those who reported negative employment impact compared to those who reported no employment impact (AOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11); depression did not moderate this relationship.Conclusion: Given the pandemic's far-reaching impact, the potential for alcohol harm is demonstrably great. Mitigating consumption should be considered when addressing loss of employment in this context.","Weerakoon, Sitara M; Jetelina, Katelyn K; Knell, Gregory; Messiah, Sarah E",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,70,1

Lysis is mediated by the small membrane bound toxin ΦX174-E, which is composed of a transmembrane domain and a soluble domain. The toxin requires activation by the bacterial chaperone SlyD and inhibits the cell wall precursor forming enzyme MraY. Bacterial cell wall biosynthesis is an important target for antibiotics, therefore knowledge of molecular details in the ΦX174-E lysis pathway could help to identify new mechanisms and sites of action. In this study, cell-free expression and nanoparticle technology were combined to avoid toxic effects upon ΦX174-E synthesis, resulting in the efficient production of a functional full-length toxin and engineered derivatives. Pre-assembled nanodiscs were used to study ΦX174-E function in defined lipid environments and to analyze its membrane insertion mechanisms. The conformation of the soluble domain of ΦX174-E was identified as a central trigger for membrane insertion, as well as for the oligomeric assembly of the toxin. Stable complex formation of the soluble domain with SlyD is essential to keep nascent ΦX174-E in a conformation competent for membrane insertion. Once inserted into the membrane, ΦX174-E assembles into high-order complexes via its transmembrane domain and oligomerization depends on the presence of an essential proline residue at position 21. The data presented here support a model where an initial contact of the nascent ΦX174-E transmembrane domain with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain of SlyD is essential to allow a subsequent stable interaction of SlyD with the ΦX174-E soluble domain for the generation of a membrane insertion competent toxin.","Mezhyrova, Julija; Martin, Janosch; Peetz, Oliver; Dötsch, Volker; Morgner, Nina; Ma, Yi; Bernhard, Frank",The FEBS journal,70,27

We systematically identified and reviewed evidence of the association between determinants of physical health self-management behaviours in adults with SMI. Data about American Association of Diabetes Educator's Self-Care Behaviours (AADE-7) were mapped against the novel Mechanisms of Action (MoA) framework. Twenty-eight studies were included in the review, reporting evidence on 104 determinant-behaviour links. Beliefs about capabilities and beliefs about consequences were the most important determinants of behaviour, especially for being physically active and healthy eating. There was some evidence that emotion and environmental context and resources played a role in determining reducing risks, being active, and taking medications.

We performed a pooled analysis of the effect of procedural time on clinical outcomes using data from three prospective endovascular treatment trials. OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between endovascular procedural time and clinical outcomes of patients with AIS following endovascular treatment. METHODS We analyzed data from SWIFT, STAR, and SWIFT PRIME studies, including baseline characteristics: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission, intracranial hemorrhage rates, and modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months. The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale was used to grade postprocedure recanalization. We recorded two procedural time intervals: (1) symptom onset to groin puncture and (2) groin puncture to angiographic recanalization. A multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model to analyze predictors of unfavorable outcome. RESULTS We analyzed 301 patients who had undergone endovascular treatment and had near-complete or complete recanalization (TICI 2b or 3). At 3 months, 122 patients (40.5%) had unfavorable outcomes. The rate of favorable outcomes was significantly higher when the procedural time was <60 min compared with ≥60 min (62% vs 45%, p=0.020). Predictors of unfavorable outcome at 3 months were age (unit 10 years, OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82, p<0.001), onset to groin puncture time (unit hour, OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77, p<0.001), groin puncture to recanalization (unit 10 min, OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99, p=0.032), baseline NIHSS score (20-28 vs 8-10, OR=0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.62, p=0.018), and collaterals (OR=1.48, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.10, p=0.029). CONCLUSION Procedural time in patients with stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy may be an important determinant of favorable outcomes in those with recanalization.","Hassan, Ameer E; Shariff, Umar; Saver, Jeffrey L; Goyal, Mayank; Liebeskind, David; Jahan, Reza; Qureshi, Adnan I",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,70,19

The vast majority of the existing work on spreading dynamics, in response to a large-scale network, is built on the condition of the infinite initial state, i.e., the extremely small seed size. The impact of an increasing seed size on the persistent diffusion has been less investigated. Based on classical epidemic models, this paper offers a framework for studying such impact through observing a crossover phenomenon in a two-diffusion-process dynamical system. The two diffusion processes are triggered by nodes with a high and low centrality, respectively. Specifically, given a finite initial state in networks with scale-free degree distributions, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that the diffusion process triggered by low centrality nodes pervades faster than that triggered by high centrality nodes from a certain point. The presence of the crossover phenomenon reveals that the dynamical process under the finite initial state is far more than the vertical scaling of the spreading curve under an infinite initial state. Further discussion emphasizes the persistent infection of individuals in epidemic dynamics as the essential reason rooted in the crossover, while the finite initial state is the catalyst directly leading to the emergence of this phenomenon. Our results provide valuable implications for studying the diversity of hidden dynamics on heterogeneous networks.","Su, Zhen; Gao, Chao; Liu, Jiming; Jia, Tao; Wang, Zhen; Kurths, Jürgen",Physical review.

However, it remains unclear how urethane affects neuronal activity in the hippocampus. In this study, we obtained in vivo patch-clamp recordings from dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons in mice and found a reduction in the fluctuation of subthreshold membrane potentials during urethane anesthesia, implying reduced synaptic activity in the hippocampus. We then performed spike unit recordings from dorsal hippocampal CA1 neuronal ensembles in rats and found prominent reductions in the spike rates of the majority of hippocampal units, especially spatially selective units, during urethane anesthesia, whereas a subset of nonspatial units exhibited increased spike rates. The overall reductions in neuronal spike rates induced by urethane led to prominent decreases in spike synchronization across neuronal units. Consistently, the magnitude of hippocampal sharp wave ripples was also reduced by urethane. The suppression of hippocampal neuronal synchronization by urethane may lead to the disruption of offline memory reactivation mechanisms.","Yagishita, Haruya; Nishimura, Yuya; Noguchi, Asako; Shikano, Yu; Ikegaya, Yuji; Sasaki, Takuya",Brain research,70,1

Nevertheless, continuity of care for patients suffering from other diseases represents a crucial challenge, and clinical research is no exception in this respect. This study aims to assess the impact of the strict Covid-19 lockdown on non-Covid-19 clinical research in the French University Hospital of Strasbourg. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical research activity (non-Covid-19) from the point of view of pharmacy department was estimated and compared to the pre-lockdown period. The impact of lockdown was assessed through five indicators: site initiation visits, the initiation of experimental therapies in non-Covid-19 patients, the delivery of non-Covid-19 investigational medical products, the number of drug shipments to patients' homes, and the number of monitoring or closure visits. RESULTS During the study period, the number of site initiation visits decreased by 90%, total inclusions by 72%, and delivery of investigational medical products by 30%. During the lockdown period, 15 treatments were sent to patients' homes. Monitoring activity decreased by 98%. CONCLUSIONS Although the COVID-19 outbreak has created an incredible momentum in the field of clinical research, research not focused on SaRS-CoV-2 has suffered greatly from this situation. The impact on patients is difficult to estimate but should be further investigated.","Becker, G; Martin, T; Sabo, A N; Bertrand, F; Hutt, A; Ayme-Dietrich, E; Michel, B; Monassier, L; Gourieux, B",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,70,31

Although morphologically CoCC mimics intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), CoCC exhibits a unique intermediate biologic behavior between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ICC. Curative resection is required for prolonged survival in patients with CoCC. However, effective therapy for postoperative hepatic recurrence has not yet been standardized. CASE PRESENTATION A 40-year-old man had an asymptomatic liver mass found during a regular medical examination. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-enhanced mass, 15 cm in diameter, in the right liver. He underwent right hemihepatectomy at a local hospital under the preoperative diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathologic examination confirmed a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, leading to a diagnosis of ordinary ICC. Twelve months after surgery, he was referred to our hospital due to three hepatic recurrences in the left medial segment. He underwent partial hepatectomy for the recurrence, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine alone. After the second hepatectomy, hepatic recurrences developed an additional seven times. The numbers and sizes of the recurrent tumors were very limited at each recurrence, satisfying the standard criteria for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of HCC. All lesions were treated by percutaneous RFA, although this was an exceptional approach for ICC. He is now alive without evidence of disease 9.2 years after the first hepatectomy. Because his clinical outcome was satisfactory and not compatible with the typical negative outcomes of ordinary ICC, we re-reviewed the histological findings of his tumor. The tumor was composed of small gland-forming cells proliferating in an anastomosing pattern; the cell membrane was strongly immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen. These findings were in accordance with the typical features of CoCC, revising his final diagnosis from ICC to CoCC. CONCLUSIONS This case report demonstrates a satisfactory outcome using repeated local treatments, such as hepatectomy and RFA, for hepatic recurrences of CoCC, suggesting that a localized treatment approach can be considered to be a therapeutic option. We should be careful in making a definitive diagnosis of ICC and ruling out CoCC because the diagnosis potentially dictates the treatment strategy for recurrences.","Shinohara, Kentaro; Ebata, Tomoki; Yokoyama, Yukihiro; Igami, Tsuyoshi; Sugawara, Gen; Mizuno, Takashi; Yamaguchi, Junpei; Shimoyama, Yoshie; Shiina, Shuichiro; Tateishi, Ryosuke; Arano, Toru; Nagino, Masato",Surgical case reports,70,6

While many factors contribute to lack of access, the most common one is time (both for practices and patients). From a practice perspective, the inability to access a cardiologist for weeks if not months is usually due to an often overwhelmed clinic schedule. Leaving work, caring for a family member, transportation, parking, and other expenses are clear factors from the patient's perspective. Now, the COVID-19 crisis has brought telemedicine to the forefront of care delivery, giving patients and physicians first-hand exposure to the technology. The broader access and simplification of technology interface has provided a nontraditional mode to care delivery in which online, ""face-to-face"" video, phone visits, or even two-way text communication is easily applied. Furthermore, simple everyday technology tools can provide easy and fast access to curbside consultations, quick urgent-care questions and management, up-titrating medications, and the more important but often under-delivered continuous counseling for preventive medicine.

FIV has the ability to infect and produce infectious virus in a number of different cell types. FIV provirus can also be maintained in a replication-competent but transcriptionally quiescent state, facilitating viral persistence over time. Immediately after the initial infection, FIV infection quickly disseminates to many anatomical compartments within the host including lymphoid organs, gastrointestinal tract and brain. Collectively, the anatomic and cellular compartments that harbour FIV provirus constitute the viral reservoir and contain foci of both ongoing viral replication and transcriptionally restricted virus that may persist over time. The relative importance of the different phenotypes observed for infected cells, anatomic compartment, replication status and size of the reservoir represent crucial areas of investigation for developing effective viral suppression and eradication therapies. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about FIV reservoirs, and emphasize the utility of the FIV-infected cat as a model for the HIV-infected human.","Eckstrand, Chrissy D; Sparger, Ellen E; Murphy, Brian G",The Journal of general virology,70,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS By using administrative data from all outpatient hospital encounters in California (2005-2011) and Florida (2005-2014), all patients in the outpatient setting with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata were identified. Patients were categorized as undergoing hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization (UAE), or no intervention. Hospital stay durations and costs were recorded for each encounter. RESULTS A total of 227,489 patients with uterine leiomyomata were included, among whom 39.9% (n = 90,800) underwent an intervention, including hysterectomy (73%), myomectomy (19%), or UAE (8%). The proportion of patients undergoing hysterectomy increased over time (2005, hysterectomy, 53.2%; myomectomy, 26.9%; UAE, 18.0%; vs 2013, hysterectomy, 80.1%; myomectomy, 14.4%; UAE, 4.0%). Hysterectomy was eventually performed in 3.5% of patients who underwent UAE and 4.1% who underwent myomectomy. Mean length of stay following hysterectomy was significantly longer (0.5 d) vs myomectomy (0.2 d) and UAE (0.3 d; P < .001 for both). The mean encounter cost for UAE ($3,772) was significantly less than those for hysterectomy ($5,409; P < .001) and myomectomy ($6,318; P < .001). Of the 7,189 patients who underwent UAE during the study period, 3.5% underwent subsequent hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of women treated with hysterectomy in the outpatient setting has increased since 2005. As a lower-cost alternative with a low rate of conversion to hysterectomy, UAE may be an underutilized treatment option for patients with uterine leiomyomata.","Wang, Courtney; Kuban, Joshua D; Lee, Stephen R; Yevich, Steven; Metwalli, Zeyad; McCarthy, Colin J; Sheth, Sunil A; Sheth, Rahul A",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,70,1

MSFP has been estimated from inspiratory hold-induced changes in RAP and blood flow. We studied the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and blood volume on venous return and MSFP in pigs. MSFP was measured by balloon occlusion of the right atrium (MSFPRAO), and the MSFP obtained via extrapolation of pressure-flow relationships with airway occlusion (MSFPinsp_hold) was extrapolated from RAP/pulmonary artery flow (QPA) relationships during inspiratory holds at PEEP 5 and 10 cmH2O, after bleeding, and in hypervolemia. MSFPRAO increased with PEEP [PEEP 5, 12.9 (SD 2.5) mmHg; PEEP 10, 14.0 (SD 2.6) mmHg, P = 0.002] without change in QPA [2.75 (SD 0.43) vs. 2.56 (SD 0.45) l/min, P = 0.094]. MSFPRAO decreased after bleeding and increased in hypervolemia [10.8 (SD 2.2) and 16.4 (SD 3.0) mmHg, respectively, P < 0.001], with parallel changes in QPA Neither PEEP nor volume state altered RVR (P = 0.489). MSFPinsp_hold overestimated MSFPRAO [16.5 (SD 5.8) vs. 13.6 (SD 3.2) mmHg, P = 0.001; mean difference 3.0 (SD 5.1) mmHg]. Inspiratory holds shifted the RAP/QPA relationship rightward in euvolemia because inferior vena cava flow (QIVC) recovered early after an inspiratory hold nadir. The QIVC nadir was lowest after bleeding [36% (SD 24%) of preinspiratory hold at 15 cmH2O inspiratory pressure], and the QIVC recovery was most complete at the lowest inspiratory pressures independent of volume state [range from 80% (SD 7%) after bleeding to 103% (SD 8%) at PEEP 10 cmH2O of QIVC before inspiratory hold]. The QIVC recovery thus defends venous return, possibly via hepatosplanchnic vascular waterfall.","Berger, David; Moller, Per W; Weber, Alberto; Bloch, Andreas; Bloechlinger, Stefan; Haenggi, Matthias; Sondergaard, Soren; Jakob, Stephan M; Magder, Sheldon; Takala, Jukka",American journal of physiology.

We tested whether a wavelet method that uses near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or intracranial pressure (ICP) decreases index variability compared to that of commonly used correlation indices. We also compared whether the methods identify the optimal arterial blood pressure (ABPopt) and lower limit of autoregulation (LLA). 68 piglets were randomized to cardiac arrest or sham procedure with continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler, NIRS and ICP. The arterial blood pressure (ABP) was gradually reduced until it dropped to below the LLA. Several autoregulation indices were calculated using correlation and wavelet methods, including the pressure reactivity index (PRx and wPRx), cerebral oximetry index (COx and wCOx), and hemoglobin volume index (HVx and wHVx). Wavelet methodology had less index variability with smaller standard deviations. Both wavelet and correlation methods distinguished functional autoregulation (ABP above LLA) from dysfunctional autoregulation (ABP below the LLA). Both wavelet and correlation methods also identified ABPopt with high agreement. Thus, wavelet methodology using NIRS may offer an accurate vasoreactivity monitoring method with reduced signal noise after pediatric cardiac arrest.","Liu, Xiuyun; Hu, Xiao; Brady, Ken M; Koehler, Raymond; Smielewski, Peter; Czosnyka, Marek; Donnelly, Joseph; Lee, Jennifer K",Scientific reports,70,1

METHODS In this cross-sectional study conducted during the second phase of the pandemic, adult patients with PNES documented by video-EEG and followed up in two tertiary epilepsy centers responded to a structured telephone survey. Data were gathered on demographics, clinical features and frequency of PNES, history of psychiatric comorbidity, access to treatment, as well as on anxiety (GAD-7 items) and depressive symptoms (NDDI-E). RESULTS Fifty-four patients (78% female; mean age of 31.36 years [SD = 10.6]) were contacted and 15 (28%) reported increased frequency of PNES during the pandemic. Higher scores of GAD-7 items (p < 0.001) and NDDI-E (p < 0.001) were associated with PNES worsening. There was strong evidence of a correlation between higher stress levels (p < 0.001) and poor sleep quality (p 0.005) with PNES aggravation. After regression, stress was the strongest predictor of PNES increased frequency. SIGNIFICANCE Patients with functional neurological disorders are vulnerable during ubiquitously felt stressors. However, the atmosphere of uncertainty did not affect these patients equally. Patients with PNES showing symptoms of anxiety and depression are at higher risk of seizure worsening. Early identification of this subset of patients may prevent this detrimental outcome.","Valente, Kette D; Alessi, Rudá; Baroni, Gislaine; Marin, Rachel; Dos Santos, Bernardo; Palmini, André",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,70,33

The aim of our study is a comparative analysis of the differences between AM related and unrelated to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS The retrospective study included children with AM treated from January 2018 to November 2020. RESULTS The study included 24 patients; 7 of 24 had AM related to SARS-CoV-2 and they were older than 7. They were more likely to have abdominal pain (P = 0.014), headache (P = 0.003), cutaneous rash (P = 0.003), and conjunctivitis (P = 0.003), while fulminant myocarditis was commonly registered in AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 (P = 0.04). A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 was diagnosed in six adolescents. Patients with AM related SARS-CoV-2 had lower serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P = 0.012), and platelets (P < 0.001), but had a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) value (P = 0.04), and N-terminal-pro hormone BNP in comparison to patients with AM unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The patients with AM related to SARS-CoV-2 had significant reduction of CRP (P = 0.007).

Segmentation was performed in two steps: (1) nidus segmentation from propagation (vertical then horizontal) of tagging on the reference slice (i.e., the slice on which the nidus had the biggest surface); (2) contiguity propagation (based on density and variance) from tagging of arteries and veins distant from the nidus. Segmentation quality was evaluated by comparison with six frame/s DSA by two independent reviewers. Analysis of supraselective microcatheterisation was performed to dispel discrepancy. RESULTS Mean duration for bAVM segmentation was 64 ± 26 min. Quality of segmentation was evaluated as good or fair in 93% of cases. Segmentation had better results than six frame/s DSA for the depiction of a focal ectasia on the main draining vein and for the evaluation of the venous drainage pattern. CONCLUSION This segmentation algorithm is a promising tool that may help improve the understanding of bAVM angio-architecture, especially the venous drainage. KEY POINTS • The segmentation algorithm allows for the distinction of the AVM's components • This algorithm helps to see the venous drainage of bAVMs more precisely • This algorithm may help to reduce the treatment-related complication rate.","Clarençon, Frédéric; Maizeroi-Eugène, Franck; Bresson, Damien; Maingreaud, Flavien; Sourour, Nader; Couquet, Claude; Ayoub, David; Chiras, Jacques; Yardin, Catherine; Mounayer, Charbel",European radiology,70,5

As HIV transmission occurs mainly via mucosal surfaces, HIV replicates significantly in the gastrointestinal tract, and the oral route of vaccination is a convenient one to implement worldwide, we explored three SIV vaccine modalities administered orally and composed of SIV DNA priming with different boosting immunogens, with the goal of evaluating whether they could provide lasting humoral and cellular responses, including at mucosal surfaces that are sites of HIV entry. Twenty-four Cynomolgus macaques (CyM), were primed with replication-incompetent SIV DNA provirus and divided into three groups for the following booster vaccinations, all administered in the oral cavity: Group 1 with recombinant SIV gp140 and E. coli heat-labile toxin adjuvant dmLT, Group 2 with recombinant SIV-Oral Poliovirus (SIV-OPV), and Group 3 with recombinant SIV-MVA. Cell-mediated responses were measured using blood, lymph node, rectal and vaginal mononuclear cells. Significant levels of systemic and mucosal T-cell responses against Gag and Env were observed in all groups. Some SIV-specific plasma IgG, rectal and salivary IgA antibodies were generated, mainly in animals that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA, but no vaginal IgA was detected. Susceptibility to infection after SIVmac251 challenge was similar in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals, but acute infection viremia levels were lower in the group that received SIV DNA + SIV-MVA. Non-vaccinated CyM macaques maintained central memory and total CD4+ T cell levels in the normal range during the 5 months of post-infection follow-up as did the vaccinated animals, precluding evaluation of vaccine impact on disease progression. We conclude that the oral cavity vaccination tested in these regimens can stimulate cell-mediated immunity systemically and mucosally, but humoral response stimulation was limited with the doses and the vaccine platforms used.","Chaudhary, Omkar; Wang, Lingyun; Bose, Deepanwita; Narayan, Vivek; Yeh, Ming Te; Carville, Angela; Clements, John; Andino, Raul; Kozlowski, Pamela A; Aldovini, Anna",AIDS research and human retroviruses,70,31

There are gonochoric, hermaphroditic, and parthenogenetic species among them. The main aim of this study was to analyze the structure of the ovary, the structure of female germ cell clusters, and the course of oogenesis in the parthenogenetic species Hypsibius exemplaris, which in 2007 was recognized as a model organism. The material was analyzed using light and confocal microscopy as well as transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Histochemical and immunohistochemical methods were used. Our study showed that in the meroistic-polytrophic ovary of the examined species, branched germ cell clusters are formed in which one cell differentiates into an oocyte while the remaining cells become trophocytes. Vitellogenesis is of the mixed type: the first part of the yolk is synthesized by the oocyte (autosynthesis); the second part is synthesized by trophocytes and transported to the oocyte by cytoplasmic bridges; and the third part is synthesized outside the ovary (in storage cells) and transported to the oocyte by endocytosis. At the end of oogenesis, the trophocytes die by apoptosis. Parthenogenetic female of H. exemplaris lays from one to a dozen smooth eggs into exuviae.","Jezierska, Marta; Miernik, Aleksandra; Sojka, Julia; Student, Sebastian; Śliwińska, Małgorzata A; Gross, Vladimir; Poprawa, Izabela",Micron,70,20

Various treatment-related factors may elicit anxiety among oncology patients, including fear of diagnostic imaging (such as MRI scans) and impending treatment and medical procedures (such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy). It is common in oncology settings to manage acute anxiety relating to medical procedures with anxiolytic medication. However, pharmacological approaches are not suitable for many patients. Despite this, non-pharmacological interventions are infrequently used. The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether non-pharmacological interventions delivered prior to, or during, radiotherapy are effective in reducing procedural anxiety. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Data sources will include the bibliographic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (from inception onward). Eligible studies will include adult patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment. Included studies will be those which employ a non-pharmacological intervention, delivered within existing radiotherapy appointments, with the aim of reducing procedural anxiety related to radiotherapy. All research designs with a control or other comparison group will be included. The primary outcome will be change in levels of self-reported procedural anxiety. Secondary outcomes will be changes in scores on physiological measures of anxiety and/or changes in treatment completion and/or changes in treatment duration and/or changes in psychological distress. Two investigators will independently complete title and abstract screening, full-text screening, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality. If appropriate, a meta-analyses will be performed. Any important amendments to this protocol will be updated in the PROSPERO registration and documented in the resulting review publication. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical issues are anticipated from this review. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and at conferences by presentation.

The rapid pace of emerging scientific information and need for expeditious translation into clinical nutritional care prompted this activity to discover research/knowledge gaps. This methodology adhered with recommendations from the Joanna Briggs Institute. There were 2301 citations imported, 439 articles fully abstracted, with 23 main topic areas identified across 24 article types, sourced across 61 countries and 51 specialties, in eight settings, and amongst 14 populations. Epidemiological/mechanistic relationships between nutrition and COVID-19 were reviewed, important topics catalogued, and results mapped to ""Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Time"" (PICO-T) questions. The aggregated data was analyzed by clinical stage: pre-COVID-19, acute COVID-19, and chronic/post-COVID-19. Research gaps were discovered for all PICO-T questions. Important nutrition topics meriting urgent research included: food insecurity/societal infrastructure and transcultural factors (Pre-COVID-19); cardiometabolic-based chronic disease, pediatrics, nutrition support, and hospital infrastructure (Acute COVID-19); registered dietitian nutritionist counseling (Chronic/Post-COVID-19); and malnutrition and management (All Stages). The paucity of randomized, control trials (RCTs) was particularly glaring. Knowledge gaps were discovered for PICO-T questions on pediatrics, micronutrients, bariatric surgery, and transcultural factors (Pre-COVID-19); enteral nutrition, protein-energy requirements, and glycemic control with nutrition (Acute COVID-19); and home enteral and parenteral nutrition support (Chronic/Post-COVID-19). In conclusion, this ASPEN scoping review has identified multiple critical areas for urgent nutrition research, particularly using RCT design, to improve nutritional care for patients before, during, and after COVID-19.

Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Indices (NODDI) multicompartment modeling was used to test the relationships between tissue alterations in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple psychiatric symptoms. METHODS The sample included participants with prior TBI (TBI; N = 37) but no PNES, and with TBI and PNES (TBI + PNES; N = 34). Participants completed 3T Siemens Prisma MRI high angular resolution imaging diffusion protocol. Statistical maps, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), neurite dispersion [orientation dispersion index (ODI)] and density [intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), and free water (i.e., isotropic) volume fraction (V-ISO)] signal intensity, were generated for each participant. Linear mixed-effects models identified clusters of between-group differences in indices of white matter changes. Pearson's r correlation tests assessed any relationship between signal intensity and psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS Compared to TBI, TBI + PNES revealed decreases in FA, ICVF, and V-ISO and increases in MD for clusters within cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, fornix/stria terminalis, and corticospinal tract pathways (cluster threshold α = 0.05). Indices of white matter changes for these clusters correlated with depressive, anxiety, PTSD, psychoticism, and somatization symptom severity (FDR threshold α = 0.05). A follow-up within-group analysis revealed that these correlations failed to reach the criteria for significance in the TBI + PNES group alone. INTERPRETATION The results expand support for the hypothesis that alterations in pathways comprising the specific PNES network correspond to patient profiles. These findings implicate myelin-specific changes as possible contributors to PNES, thus introducing novel potential treatment targets.","Goodman, Adam M; Allendorfer, Jane B; Blum, Andrew S; Bolding, Mark S; Correia, Stephen; Ver Hoef, Lawrence W; Gaston, Tyler E; Grayson, Leslie E; Kraguljac, Nina V; Lahti, Adrienne C; Martin, Amber N; Monroe, William S; Philip, Noah S; Tocco, Krista; Vogel, Valerie; LaFrance, W Curt; Szaflarski, Jerzy P",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,70,24

The patient developed sepsis caused by Klebsiella pneumonia. There were no signs of improvement after 3 weeks of systematic antibiotic administration. We performed surgical drainage of bilateral psoas abscesses by retroperitoneoscopy. Intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound was useful to determine abscess location in the muscles prior to drainage and confirm no residual abscesses after drainage. The patient was afebrile 3 days later, and his clinical symptoms resolved. Retroperitoneoscopic drainage may represent a feasible minimally invasive therapeutic option for psoas abscess, and intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound has the potential to increase the safety and efficacy of this surgical procedure.","Kodama, Koichi; Takase, Yasukazu; Motoi, Isamu; Mizuno, Hideki; Goshima, Kenichi; Sawaguchi, Takeshi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,70,17

The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is a novel regional technique and may provide better pain reduction while preserving motor function, but these blocks have not been directly compared. METHODS In a single-center double-blinded randomized comparative trial, patients presenting for hip fracture surgery received analgesia with either FNB or PENG block. The primary outcome measure was pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10). Secondary outcomes were postoperative quadriceps strength, opiate use, complications, length of hospital stay, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS Sixty patients were randomized and equally allocated between groups. Baseline demographics were similar. Postoperatively in recovery (day 0), the PENG group experienced less pain compared with the FNB group. (In the PENG group, 63% experienced no pain, 27% mild pain, and 10% moderate to severe pain. In comparison, 30% of the FNB group reported no pain, 27% mild pain, and 36% moderate to severe pain; p=0.04). This was assessed using an 11-point Likert NRS. Quadriceps strength was better preserved in the PENG group in the recovery unit (assessed using Oxford muscle strength grading, 60% intact in the PENG group vs none intact in the FNB group; p<0.001) and on day 1 (90% intact vs 50%, respectively; p=0.004). There was no difference in other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Patients receiving a PENG block for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia during hip fracture surgery experience less postoperative pain in the recovery room with no difference detected by postoperative day 1. Quadriceps strength was better preserved with the PENG block. Despite the short-term analgesic benefit and improved quadriceps strength, there were no differences detected in the quality of recovery.","Lin, D-Yin; Morrison, Craig; Brown, Brigid; Saies, Alex; Pawar, Reshma; Vermeulen, Marthinus; Anderson, Stewart Robert; Lee, Tsai Sheng; Doornberg, Job; Kroon, Hidde; Jaarsma, Ruurd",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,70,1

Sialic acids are often involved in interaction between the cells and the infectious agents by regulating the molecular relations as well as mediating a variety of cell-cell adhesion processes in the immune response. This study was conducted to assess the effect of T. annulata infection on sialic acid concentration in blood sera in naturally infected buffaloes. T. annulata-infected (n = 22) and uninfected control (n = 20) adult buffaloes were selected. Theileria infection was revealed by Giemsa-stained peripheral blood and was confirmed by nested-PCR using T. annulata-specific primers. Based on the detected parasitemia, the infected animals were subgrouped into low <1 %, moderate 1-3 %, high 3-5 %, and very high >5 %. Hematological parameters and the concentrations of total sialic acid (TSA), lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA), and protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA) were measured and correlated to parasitemia. The results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in red blood cells (RBCs), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb), and sialic acid concentrations between infected and control groups. As the parasitemia increased accordingly, a significant decrease in RBCs, PCV, Hb and increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and serum sialic acids was observed. We concluded that T. annulata infection could elevate the serum sialic acid concentrations. The increased levels of serum sialic acid concentrations during parasitemia presumably stimulate the host immune response and influence the parasite-host cell adhesion.","Esmaeilnejad, Bijan; Froushani, Seyyed Meysam Abtahi",Tropical animal health and production,70,27

Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits at a community-based hospital in the United States. Methods: Patients and providers were electronically surveyed at the end of 2020 regarding telemedicine visit experiences. These visits took place throughout the majority of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A total of 85.7% (6) of providers reported spending the same or less time on telemedicine visits compared with in-person visits. All providers were either somewhat or very satisfied with the interpersonal connections made in telemedicine visits. All providers wished to see telemedicine visits continued in the future. A total of 355 patients responded. Over 90% of participants reported feeling comfortable speaking to their provider about personal issues through telemedicine. Around 73.2% of patients were very satisfied with their telemedicine visit. Around 69.8% of patients report that they would like to use either primarily telemedicine visits or a combination of telemedicine and in-person visits when it is safe to return to in-person care. Conclusions: Patients and providers exhibited high levels of satisfaction with telemedicine use in a weight management center. They both wish to see these visit types offered in the future. Patients who saved more than 30 min of time traveling with a telemedicine visit were significantly more likely to show high levels of satisfaction. Patients who found it easier to connect with the virtual platforms also were significantly more likely to have higher satisfaction levels.,"Vosburg, Ralph Wesley; Robinson, Kortney A; Gao, Chuanyun; Kim, Julie J",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,70,1

It has been widely reported that plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) play a critical role in antiviral innate immunity. In contrast, not much is known about the role of pDCs in the interaction between allergy and viral infection. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of RSV infection on pDC function in the regulation of allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of Dermatophagoides farinae-sensitized allergic asthma. METHODS Splenic pDCs isolated from D. farinae-sensitized donor mice were infected with live RSV ex vivo. Subsequently, these pDCs were inoculated into the airways of D. farinae-sensitized recipient mice. Lung pathology, lung tissue cytokine profiles, the number of regulatory T cells (T(reg)) and mDCs as well as the effects of IL-10 neutralization in the lung tissue of recipient mice were determined. RESULTS Intranasal inoculation of D. farinae-sensitized pDCs significantly inhibited the development of allergic airway inflammation and both Th1 and Th2 immunity. Live RSV infection of these pDCs prior to inoculation interfered with their inhibitory effects through decreasing T(reg) and IL-10 and increasing mDCs. CONCLUSIONS In asthmatic airways, pDCs mediate tolerance to inhaled allergens through the regulation of T(reg), IL-10 and mDCs. RSV infection of pDCs potentially inhibits their immunotolerogenic effects and thus exacerbates allergic airway inflammation.","Tsuchida, Tomoko; Matsuse, Hiroto; Fukahori, Susumu; Kawano, Tetsuya; Tomari, Shinya; Fukushima, Chizu; Kohno, Shigeru",International archives of allergy and immunology,70,1

The aim of our study is to report outcomes associated with increasing fluid and air leak criteria of protocol based management. METHODS A 6-year retrospective analysis of protocolised chest drain management starting in 2007 with a fluid criteria of 3 mL/kg increasing to 7 mL/kg in 2011 to no fluid criteria in 2012, and an air leak criteria of 24 hours without leak till 2012 when digital air leak monitoring was introduced with a criteria of <20 mL/min of air leak for more than 6 hours. Patient data were obtained from electronic hospital records and digital chest films were reviewed to determine the duration of chest tube drainage and post-drain removal complications. RESULTS From 2009 to 2012, 626 consecutive patients underwent thoracic surgery procedures under a single consultant. A total of 160 did not require a chest drain and data was missing in 22, leaving 444 for analysis. The mean age [standard deviation (SD)] was 57±19 years and 272 (61%) were men. There were no differences in the incidence of pneumothoraces (P=0.191), effusion (P=0.344) or re-interventions (P=0.431) for drain re-insertions as progressively permissive criteria were applied. The median drain duration dropped from 1-3 days (P<0.001) and accordingly hospital stay reduced from 4-6 days (P<0.001).

DESIGN Prospective open cohort study with 2 years follow-up of each subject. SETTING All THR-performing clinics in Sweden. METHODS All patients registered for a primary THR in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register between July 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, were selected for the study (45,531 patients with 49,219 THRs) and were matched with the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. All patients with a minimum of 4 weeks of continuous outpatient antibiotic treatment within 2 years after their primary THR (1,989 patients with 2,219 THRs) were selected for a medical records review, and the number of cases with PJI was determined. RESULTS The cumulative incidence of PJI within 2 years after primary THR was 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.02; n = 443), and 405 of these had been reoperated. The incidence rate of PJI for the first 3 months was 5 per 10,000 THR-weeks and, thereafter, 0.3 per 10,000 THR-weeks. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common bacteria isolated. CONCLUSIONS This study describes a new method of national postoperative infection surveillance.

In the United States, as elsewhere, control of contagion may require the cooperation of community members with emergency public health measures. The US general public is largely unfamiliar with these measures, and our understanding of factors that influence behaviors in this context is limited. The few previous reviews of research on this topic focused on non-US samples. For this review, we examined published research on the psychosocial influences of adherence in US sample populations. Of 153 articles identified, only 9 met the inclusion criteria. Adherence behaviors were categorized into 2 groups: self-protective behaviors (personal hygiene, social distancing, face mask use, seeking out health care advice, and vaccination) and protecting others (isolation, temperature screening, and quarantine). A lack of uniformity across studies regarding definitions and measures was noted. Only 5 of the 9 articles reported tests of association between adherence with emergency measures and psychosocial factors; perceived risk and perceived seriousness were found to be significantly associated with adherence or adherence intentions. Although it is well documented that psychosocial factors are important predictors of protective health behaviors in general, this has not been rigorously studied in the context of bioevents.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a delayed onset in America. Despite the time advantage for the implementation of preventative measures to contain its spread, the pandemic followed growth rates that paralleled those observed before in Europe. Objectives: To analyze the temporal and geographical distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic at district-level in Perú during the full lockdown period in 2020. Methods: Analysis of publicly available data sets, stratified by altitude and geographical localization. Correlation tests of COVID-19 case and death rates to population prevalence of comorbidities. Results: We observe a strong protective effect of altitude from COVID-19 mortality in populations located above 2,500 m. We provide evidence that internal migration through a specific land route is a significant factor progressively overriding the protection from COVID-19 afforded by high altitude. This protection is independent of poverty indexes and is inversely correlated with the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Discussion: Long-term adaptation to residency at high altitude may be the third general protective factor from COVID-19 severity and death, after young age and female sex. Multisystemic adaptive traits or acclimatization processes in response to chronic hypobaric hypoxia may explain the apparent protective effect of high altitude from COVID-19 death.","Thomson, Timothy M; Casas, Fresia; Guerrero, Harold Andre; Figueroa-Mujíca, Rómulo; Villafuerte, Francisco C; Machicado, Claudia",High altitude medicine & biology,70,31

Recently, its mRNA was found in hypothalamo-pituitary axis and rat testis, leading us to hypothesize that resistin may be expressed in ovary. In this study, we determined in rats and cows 1) the characterization of resistin in ovary by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry and 2) the effects of recombinant resistin (10, 100, 333, and 667 ng/ml) ± IGF1 (76 ng/ml) on steroidogenesis, proliferation, and signaling pathways of granulosa cells (GC) measured by enzyme immunoassay, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and immunoblotting respectively. We observed that resistin mRNA and protein were present in several bovine and rat ovarian cells. Nevertheless, only bovine GC abundantly expressed resistin mRNA and protein. Resistin treatment decreased basal but not IGF1-induced progesterone (P<0.05; whatever the dose) and estradiol (P<0.005; for 10 and 333 ng/ml) production by bovine GC. In rats, resistin (10 ng/ml) increased basal and IGF1-induced progesterone secretion (P<0.0001), without effect on estradiol release. We found no effect of resistin on rat GC proliferation. Conversely, in cows, resistin increased basal proliferation (P<0.0001; for 100-667 ng/ml) and decreased IGF1-induced proliferation of GC (P<0.0001; for 10-333 ng/ml) associated with a decrease in cyclin D2 protein level (P<0.0001). Finally, resistin stimulated AKT and p38-MAPK phosphorylation in both species, ERK1/2-MAPK phosphorylation in rats and had the opposite effect on the AMPK pathway (P<0.05). In conclusion, our results show that resistin is expressed in rat and bovine ovaries.

However, its expression profile and detailed roles in glioblastoma (GBM) remain unknown. In this study, we mainly investigated the expression and roles of LINC01094 in GBM and focused on the mechanism by which LINC01094 regulates the malignant characteristics of GBM. Patients and Methods LINC01094 expression in GBM was determined with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo of GBM cells were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, migration assay, invasion assay, and tumor xenograft models, respectively. Results LINC01094 was overexpressed in GBM tissues and cell lines. Moreover, increased LINC01094 expression was associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in patients with GBM. Loss of LINC01094 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; promoted cell apoptosis; and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanically, LINC01094 functioned as a molecular sponge for microRNA-577 (miR-577) and consequently enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in GBM cells. Both miR-577 inhibition and BDNF expression enhancement reversed LINC01094 deficiency-mediated inhibition of malignant processes in GBM cells. Conclusion Our results verified the involvement of the LINC01094/miR-577/BDNF pathway in GBM cells and its enhancing effects on the aggressive behaviors of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo.

However, the effectiveness of this medication in patients with burns remains uncertain. Accordingly, investigators sought to assess wound re-epithelialization in patients with second-degree burns after adding pirfenidone to usual care. DESIGN AND SETTING Single-center pilot, proof-of-concept, single-blind randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION Eight patients with second-degree burns were treated with occlusive hydrocolloid dressings and were randomly allocated to receive either no additional treatment or pirfenidone. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate wound healing between groups based on the thickness of the re-epithelialized epidermis at day 7. Secondary outcomes were to qualitatively assess the development of fibrotic tissue in the dermis, anomalies in the basal membrane, and the development of collagen fibers by histologic analysis. Liver and renal functions were measured daily to assess the overall safety of oral pirfenidone. MAIN RESULTS Patients treated with pirfenidone showed a remarkable improvement in wound re-epithelialization at day 7 (148.98 ± 13.64 vs 119.27 ± 15.55 μm; P = .029; 95% confidence interval, 4.14-55.29). Histologic evaluations showed less wound fibrosis in the pirfenidone group. CONCLUSIONS A decrease in wound healing time by enhancing wound re-epithelialization was observed with pirfenidone. Larger clinical trials are needed to reach more reliable conclusions.","Mecott, Gabriel A; González-Cantú, Iván; Dorsey-Treviño, Edgar Gerardo; Matta-Yee-Chig, Daniel; Saucedo-Cárdenas, Odila; Montes de Oca-Luna, Roberto; Pérez-Porras, Sergio; García-Pérez, Mauricio M",Advances in skin & wound care,70,28

This finding is remarkable given the presence of apparently vigorous HIV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. We review the dynamics of antibody responses and viral escape from these responses during primary HIV-1 infection. RECENT FINDINGS Many B cell dysfunctions appear early in HIV-1 infection, and compromise humoral responses to HIV-1 and other pathogens. The rate of viral escape from autologous neutralization varies greatly between individuals with primary HIV-1 infection, and is on average higher than the rate of escape in chronically infected individuals. Mutations, changes in glycosylation and insertions and deletions in the viral envelope may all contribute to viral escape. There may be differences in neutralization sensitivity and evolution of neutralization escape between different HIV-1 subtypes. Although several broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been identified, the factors that contribute to the development of broad heterologous responses remain unclear. SUMMARY The rapid escape of HIV-1 in response to neutralizing antibodies and the plethora of B cell dysfunctions that occur during HIV infection pose significant obstacles to the design of an effective HIV-1 vaccine. The study of large cohorts of individuals enrolled during primary HIV-1 infection using high-throughput immunoassays, sequencing of the virus and the host, and new statistical tools may help to elucidate the pathways of viral escape, to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses, and to suggest means of minimizing the impact of HIV-1 on humoral immunity.","Frost, Simon D W; Trkola, Alexandra; Günthard, Huldrych F; Richman, Douglas D",Current opinion in HIV and AIDS,70,25

Despite recent advances in NSCLC treatment, the five-year survival rate is still around 23%. Radiotherapy is indicated in the treatment of both early and advanced stage NSCLC; however, treatment response in patients is heterogeneous. Thus, identification of new and more effective treatment combinations is warranted. We have identified Ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) s a regulator of major double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways in response to ionizing radiation (IR) by its impact on both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) in NSCLC. USP14 is a proteasomal deubiquitinase. IR treatment increases levels and DSB recruitment of USP14 in NSCLC cell lines. Genetic knockdown, using shUSP14 expression or pharmacological inhibition of USP14, using IU1, increases radiosensitization in NSCLC cell lines, as determined by a clonogenic survival assay. Moreover, shUSP14-expressing NSCLC cells show increased NHEJ efficiency, as indicated by chromatin recruitment of key NHEJ proteins, NHEJ reporter assay, and increased IR-induced foci formation by 53BP1 and pS2056-DNA-PKcs. Conversely, shUSP14-expressing NSCLC cells show decreased RPA32 and BRCA1 foci formation, suggesting HR-deficiency. These findings identify USP14 as an important determinant of DSB repair in response to radiotherapy and a promising target for NSCLC radiosensitization.","Sharma, Arishya; Almasan, Alexandru",International journal of molecular sciences,70,30

This article describes necessary changes and points to potential challenges on a technical, content, and organizational level. As a technical precondition, electronic laboratory reports have to become machine-readable and interpretable.

Even if only single ""atomized"" results of the whole report are extracted, the necessary information for correct interpretation must be available. Therefore, interpretive comments, e.g., concerns about an increased measurement uncertainty must be electronically attached to every affected measurement result. Standardization of laboratory analyses with traceable standards and reference materials will enable knowledge transfer and safe interpretation of laboratory analyses from multiple laboratories. In an interconnected health care system, laboratories should strive to transform themselves into a data hub that not only receives samples but also extensive information about the patient. On that basis, they can return measurement results enriched with high-quality interpretive comments tailored to the individual patient and unlock the full potential of laboratory medicine.","Bietenbeck, Andreas; Streichert, Thomas",Diagnostics,70,11

METHODS A consecutive series of patients who underwent a LRYGB from 2006 until 2011 were evaluated in this study. Signs of abdominal pain, pyrosis, nausea or other symptoms of ulcer disease were analysed. Acute symptoms of (perforated) MU such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, melena and haematemesis were also collected. Patient baseline characteristics, medication and intoxications were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with MU. RESULTS A total of 350 patients underwent a LRYGB. Minimal follow-up was 24 months. Twenty-three patients (6.6%) developed a symptomatic MU of which four (1.1%) presented with perforation. Smoking, the use of corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was significantly associated with the development of MU. Five out of 23 patients (22%) underwent surgery. All other patients could be treated conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Marginal ulcers occurred in 6.6% of the patients after a LRYGB.

Although IgG positivity showed a higher prevalence than IgM across all three virus antigen subunits, there were no significant differences among mentioned immunoglobulins of the studied groups. The most prevalent antibody was from the IgG subtype against virus nucleoprotein (NP), while the lowest prevalence was attributed to receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgM.Conclusion: High seropositive rate among asymptomatic end-stage renal disease patients, as a sample of high-risk population, reflected the importance of considering SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody screening for disease containment.","Etemadi, Jalal; Bordbar, Shima; Soltani-Zangbar, Mohammad Sadegh; Hajivalili, Mahsa; Aghebati-Maleki, Leili; Motavalli, Roza; Mahmoodpoor, Ata; Shahmohammadi-Farid, Sima; Abedi Azar, Sima; Niknafs, Bahram; Roshangar, Leila; Babaloo, Zohreh; Ahmadian Heris, Javad; Hosseini, Maryam; Shareghi-Oskoue, Oldouz; Parhizkar, Forough; Khosroshahi, Hamid Tayebi; Yousefi, Mehdi",Immunological investigations,70,29

This study of single incision transabdominal preperitoneal (SITAPP) inguinal hernia repair is a continuing study exploring the peroperative variables and short and long term complications of this procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS All the 183 patients were operated by the same surgeon through a horizontal transumbilical incision positioned across the lower third of the umbilicus. Port access was through three separate transfacial punctures. Routine rigid instruments were used and the peritoneal flaps were either tacked or sutured into place. Patients with irreducible hernia and obstructed hernia were included, while those with strangulated hernia were excluded. RESULTS All the patients were male with an average age of 41.4 years. Twenty four patients had bilateral hernia, 15 patients had irreducible and 6 patients had obstructed hernia. The mean operating time was 38.3 mins for unilateral hernias completed with tackers and 42.8 mins in those with intracorporeal suturing. The corresponding operating time for bilateral hernias was 53.2 and 62.7 minutes. There was minimal serous discharge from the umbilicus in 8 patients, port site infection in 1 patient and recurrence in 2 patients over a 36 months period. CONCLUSIONS SITAPP for groin hernias, performed with conventional instruments is feasible, easy to learn, has a very high patient acceptance and is cosmetically superior to conventional TAPP.

However, the implementation of health legal preparedness differs between low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and developed countries. Objective This paper examines recent trends regarding public health legal preparedness for emergencies and discusses its role in the recent Ebola outbreak. Design A rigorous literature review was conducted using eight electronic databases as well as Google Scholar. The results encompassed peer-reviewed English articles, reports, theses, and position papers dating from 2011 to 2014. Earlier articles concerning regulatory actions were also examined. Results The importance of PHLP has grown during the past decade and focuses mainly on infection-disease scenarios. Amid LMICs, it mostly refers to application of international regulations, whereas in developed states, it focuses on independent legislation and creation of conditions optimal to promoting an effective emergency management. Among developed countries, the United States' utilisation of health legal preparedness is the most advanced, including the creation of a model comprising four elements: law, competencies, information, and coordination. Only limited research has been conducted in this field to date. Nevertheless, in both developed and developing states, studies that focused on regulations and laws activated in health systems during emergencies, identified inconsistency and incoherence. The Ebola outbreak plaguing West Africa since 2014 has global implications, challenges and paralleling results, that were identified in this review. Conclusions The review has shown the need to broaden international regulations, to deepen reciprocity between countries, and to consider LMICs health capacities, in order to strengthen the national health security.

However, their relevance is in no way paralleled by our current understanding of their structures and functions. This is because membrane proteins present a number of experimental obstacles that are difficult to surmount by classical methods developed for water-soluble proteins. Moreover, membrane proteins are not only challenging on their very own but, when embedded in a biological membrane, also reside in an outstandingly complex milieu. These difficulties have fostered a ""divide and conquer"" approach, in which a membrane protein is dissected into shorter and easier-to-handle transmembrane (TM) peptides. Under suitable conditions, such peptides fold independently and retain many of the properties displayed in the context of the full-length parent protein. This contribution reviews some of the most notable insights into alpha-helical membrane proteins gleaned from experiments on protein-derived TM peptides. We recapitulate some peculiar properties of lipid bilayers that render them such a complex and unique environment and discuss generic features pertaining to hydrophobic peptides derived from alpha-helical membrane proteins. The main part of the review is devoted to a critical discussion of particularly interesting examples of TM peptides studied in membrane-mimetic systems of increasing complexity: isotropic solvents, detergent micelles, lipid bilayers, and biological membranes. The unifying theme is to explore to what extent TM peptides in combination with different membrane-mimetic systems can aid in advancing our knowledge and comprehension of alpha-helical membrane proteins as well as in developing new pharmacological tools.","Bordag, Natalie; Keller, Sandro",Chemistry and physics of lipids,70,26

RESULTS The RVP Fast assay performed well in less than 4 h for detecting type A influenza H1 viruses, particularly (H1N1)pdm09, and human entero/rhinoviruses, with 95.2% and 90.05% agreement, respectively, when compared to monoplex real-time PCR assays. This multiplex assay also detected at least 1 virus in 69.3% of the specimens and detected multiple infections in 40 samples. CONCLUSIONS The multiplex assay detected clinically important viruses in a single genomic test. It will thus be useful for detecting several viruses causing respiratory tract disorders.","Mansuy, Jean-Michel; Mengelle, Catherine; Da Silva, Isabelle; Grog, Isidore; Sauné, Karine; Izopet, Jacques",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,70,23

Finding predictors for it affects implants, operative techniques and allows for preventive measures. METHODS Prospectively collected data from 932 outpatient open inguinal hernia operations between 2003 and 2010 were subjected to regression analysis. Visual analogue scale score (VAS) at least a year after operation and a measurement of chronic pain at one year were the target variables. RESULTS Chronic pain was present in 99 (11.5%) patients one year after operation. Independent predictors for the occurrence of chronic pain were positively recurrence (Odds ratio, OR 6.77 vs. no recurrence, P = 0.005), complication (OR 5.16 vs. no complication, P = 0.002), mid-density mesh (OR 2.28 vs. lightweight mesh, P = 0.012), higher preoperative VAS score (OR 1.15, P = 0.006) and negatively higher age (OR 0.98, P = 0.027). Predictors for a higher postoperative VAS score were recurrence (regression coefficient, RC, 1.49 vs. no recurrence, P = 0.001), complication (RC 0.76 vs. no complication, P = 0.016), heavyweight mesh (RC 0.50 vs. lightweight mesh, P = 0.046) and higher preoperative VAS level (RC 0.10, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Recurrence, complication, mesh weight, preoperative VAS score and age are predictors for the occurrence chronic pain after open mesh based inguinal hernia repair. Recurrence, complication, mesh weight and preoperative VAS score are predictors of postherniorrhaphy VAS level.","Pierides, Georgios A; Paajanen, Hannu E; Vironen, Jaana H",International journal of surgery,70,16

METHODS A mixed-method approach using survey, focus groups, and interviews produced data from 398 parents. Adult respondents completed the University of California at Los Angeles Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD-RI) Parent Version and the PTSD Check List Civilian Version (PCL-C). RESULTS Disease-containment measures such as quarantine and isolation can be traumatizing to a significant portion of children and parents. Criteria for PTSD was met in 30% of isolated or quarantined children based on parental reports, and 25% of quarantined or isolated parents (based on self-reports). CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that pandemic disasters and subsequent disease-containment responses may create a condition that families and children find traumatic. Because pandemic disasters are unique and do not include congregate sites for prolonged support and recovery, they require specific response strategies to ensure the behavioral health needs of children and families. Pandemic planning must address these needs and disease-containment measures.","Sprang, Ginny; Silman, Miriam",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,70,26

Treatment-induced changes in intracranial hemodynamics and their impact on the clinical management of VGAM patients remain unclear. OBJECTIVE To evaluate hemodynamic alterations in the cerebral arterial and venous network in pediatric patients with VGAMs during staged embolizations. METHODS Serial 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging (21 scans) was performed in 6 VGAM patients (3 female; mean age, 2.1 ± 4.0 years) undergoing staged embolization. Time-integrated pathlines were used to visualize 3-dimensional blood flow changes in intracranial arterial and venous systems. Total cerebral arterial inflow (flow in bilateral internal carotid arteries plus basilar artery), arteriovenous shunt flow, and blood flow in other major cerebral arteries (middle cerebral artery; posterior cerebral artery) were quantified for all patients. RESULTS Intracranial 3-dimensional blood flow visualization demonstrated marked reduction of arteriovenous shunting and distinct hemodynamic alterations after embolization. From baseline to endpoint embolization, total cerebral arterial inflow dropped by 40.2% (from 22.70 ± 6.54 mL/s to 13.57 ± 4.87 mL/s), corresponding to arteriovenous shunt flow reduction of 73.5% (from 9.69 ± 6.16 mL/s to 2.57 ± 3.79 mL/s). In addition, the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery/middle cerebral artery flow ratio decreased by 86.9% (from 4.20 ± 6.28 to 0.55 ± 0.23). CONCLUSION Hemodynamic alterations in VGAMs after embolization can be visualized and quantified using 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebral arterial inflow and arteriovenous shunt flow reduction and complex flow redistribution after embolization illustrate the potential of 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging to better evaluate the efficacy of interventions and monitor treatment effects.","Wu, Can; Schoeneman, Samantha E; Kuhn, Ryan; Honarmand, Amir R; Schnell, Susanne; Ansari, Sameer A; Carr, James; Markl, Michael; Shaibani, Ali",Operative neurosurgery,70,1

This study aimed to investigate what technology O&M professionals in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client work, to inform the development of O&M technologies and build capacity in the international O&M profession. MATERIALS AND METHODS A technology survey was completed by professionals (n = 36) attending O&M workshops in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&M specialists (n = 31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&M professionals. Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data. RESULTS Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&M professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to use technology during O&M client programmes, initial professional training, ongoing professional development and research. CONCLUSIONS Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and early-adopter O&M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&M professionals need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream O&M technologies to expand clients' travel choices. COVID-19 has created an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&M tele-practice. O&M technology could support comprehensive O&M specialist training and practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&M clients with complex needs. Implications for rehabilitation Most orientation and mobility (O&M) clients are travelling with a smartphone, so O&M specialists need to be abreast of mainstream technologies, accessibility features and apps used by clients for orientation, mobility, visual efficiency and social engagement. O&M specialists who are technology laggards need human-guided support to develop confidence in using travel technologies, and O&M clients are the experts. COVID-19 has created an imperative to learn skills for O&M tele-practice. Affordability is a significant barrier to O&M professionals and clients accessing specialist travel technologies in Malaysia, and to O&M professionals upgrading technology in Australia. Comprehensive training for O&M specialists is needed in Malaysia to meet the travel needs of clients with low vision or blindness who also have physical, cognitive, sensory or mental health complications.","Deverell, Lil; Bhowmik, Jahar; Lau, Bee Theng; Al Mahmud, Abdullah; Sukunesan, Suku; Islam, Fakir M Amirul; McCarthy, Chris; Meyer, Denny",Disability and rehabilitation.

Assessment of verbal STM/WM is critical for identifying and addressing these delays, but standard assessment procedures require face-to-face (FTF) administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and validity of remote testing methods (teleassessment) of verbal STM/WM in youth with CIs as a method of addressing COVID-19-related restrictions on FTF test administration. Method Tests of verbal STM/WM for nonwords, digit spans, letter-number sequences, sentences, and stories were individually administered by speech-language pathologists over a teleassessment platform to 28 youth (aged 9-22 years) with CIs and 36 same-aged normal-hearing peers. Examiners, parents, and participants completed quality and satisfaction ratings with the teleassessment procedure. Teleassessment scores were compared to results of tests obtained at FTF visits an average of 1.6 years earlier. Results Quality and satisfaction ratings for teleassessment were high and in almost all cases did not differ between the CI and normal-hearing samples. Youth with CIs scored lower than normal-hearing peers on measures of verbal STM/WM, and scores for digit span and letter-number sequencing did not differbetween teleassessment and FTF methods. Correlations across teleassessment and FTF visits were strong for digit span, letter-number sequencing, and sentence memory, but were more modest for nonword repetition. Conclusion With some caveats, teleassessment of verbal STM/WM was feasible and valid for youth with CIs.","Kronenberger, William G; Montgomery, Caitlin J; Henning, Shirley C; Ditmars, Allison; Johnson, Courtney A; Herbert, Carolyn J; Pisoni, David B",American journal of speech-language pathology,70,31

Currently, the spread of the disease is mostly quantified by the reported numbers of infections, hospitalisations, recoveries and deaths; these quantities inform epidemiology models that provide forecasts for the spread of the epidemic and guide policy making. The veracity of these forecasts depends on the discrepancy between the numbers of reported, and unreported yet infectious, individuals. We combine Bayesian experimental design with an epidemiology model and propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of limited testing resources in space and time, which maximises the information gain for such unreported infections. The proposed approach is applicable at the onset and spread of the epidemic and can forewarn of a possible recurrence of the disease after relaxation of interventions. We examine its application in Switzerland; the open source software is, however, readily adaptable to countries around the world. We find that following the proposed methodology can lead to vastly less uncertain predictions for the spread of the disease, thus improving estimates of the effective reproduction number and the future number of unreported infections. This information can provide timely and systematic guidance for the effective identification of infectious individuals and for decision-making regarding lockdown measures and the distribution of vaccines.","Chatzimanolakis, Michail; Weber, Pascal; Arampatzis, Georgios; Wälchli, Daniel; Kičić, Ivica; Karnakov, Petr; Papadimitriou, Costas; Koumoutsakos, Petros",Swiss medical weekly,70,16

The associated hardships during these times have highlighted the importance of being emotionally authentic, despite the potential difficulties of doing so at a distance. Even in normal times, a common requirement of workers is that they are expected to display certain emotions to customers, teammates, and supervisors, regardless of how they are actually feeling (e.g., ""service with a smile""). However, the risks of being perceived as surface acting-displaying inauthentic emotions even when required by the job-can be severe, as people react negatively to those who are perceived as inauthentic. Utilizing 2 experiments and a matched parent-teacher survey of international schools in Vietnam, I examine the interpersonal consequences of communication media choice on perceptions of emotional inauthenticity. I find that there are opposing mechanisms in this process: Less rich communication media (e.g., e-mail) are beneficial for masking emotional leakage, yet richer communication media (e.g., face-to-face) are perceived to be a more authentic means of expressing emotion. In line with these mechanisms, for those communicating authentic emotion (i.e., when cue leakage is not relevant), I find richer media to be optimal. Alternatively, for surface actors, across longer-term relationships, I find medium richness communication media are optimal: Using telephone/audio results in improved interactional outcomes for surface actors because this mode masks nonverbal leakage better than face-to-face/video interactions, yet appears higher effort (and thus more authentic) than messages received via e-mail.

The Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy procedure uses the appendix to create an easily accessible continent, catheterizable channel into the urinary bladder. Historically, the procedure is performed by an open surgical approach in prune belly patients. We describe our initial experience herein. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between October 2008 and February 2010 three patients with prune belly syndrome underwent RALMA. The appendicovesicostomy anastomosis was performed on the anterior bladder wall and the stoma was brought to the umbilical site or right lower quadrant. At least 4 cm of detrusor backing was ensured. The appendicovesicostomy stent was left in place for 4 weeks postoperatively before initiation of catheterization. RESULTS Mean age at surgery was 9.7 years (range 5-14 years). Blood loss volume was 20 mL in each case. Overall mean operative time was 352 min (range 319-402 min). There were no intraoperative complications and no open conversions. There was one postoperative complication in the form of wound infection. All patients are catheterizing their stomas and are continent at an average follow-up of 14.7 months (range 5-21 months). CONCLUSION In our initial experience, RALMA is a feasible option with encouraging early experience for creating a continent catheterizable channel into the urinary bladder in patients with prune belly syndrome.","Wille, Mark A; Jayram, Gautam; Gundeti, Mohan S",BJU international,70,1

The present study utilized the two-bottle choice and operant self-administration procedures to investigate neuroanatomical substrates that mediate the effects of PPARγ agonism on alcohol drinking and seeking in msP rats. Bilateral infusions of pioglitazone (0, 5, and 10 μg/μl) in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) decreased voluntary alcohol drinking and alcohol self-administration. Microinjections of pioglitazone in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), central amygdala (CeA), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell had no such effect. Notably, water, food, and saccharin consumption was unaltered by either treatment. The yohimbine-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking was prevented by infusions of pioglitazone (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μg/μl) in the CeA, VTA, and RMTg but not in the NAc shell. These results emphasize the involvement of mesocorticolimbic circuitries in mediating the effects of PPARγ agonists on alcohol drinking and seeking. These results will facilitate future studies that investigate the pathophysiological role of PPARγ in alcohol use disorder and help clarify the mechanisms by which the activation of this receptor decreases the motivation for drinking.","Fotio, Yannick; Borruto, Anna Maria; Benvenuti, Federica; Demopulos, Gregory; Gaitanaris, George; Roberto, Marisa; Ciccocioppo, Roberto",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,70,26

In this work, using the porcine long bones, the 3-point bending tests were conducted to explore the bone fracture behaviors under the rigid impactor. The bone fracture dynamic process was recorded by high-speed photography and the fracture surface profile was observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the CT scanning, their cross-section properties were calculated by a homemade MATLAB script for correlating with their strengths. Also, a subject-specific finite element (FE) model was developed to identify the influence on simulation. Findings led to conclusions as follows: 1) The tension fracture came with fracture path deflection, which was caused by the bone indentation induced mesoscale crack-opening. Due to this damage before the whole bone fracture, a bone fracture moment correction was defined to compensate experimental data. 2) The plastic indentation caused the impact force fluctuation. 3) The bone failure moment is higher correlated with the inertial moment of the bone cross-section than the traditional cross-section area. 4) In the subject-specific simulation, the indentation caused compression fracture and a much lower failure force. To reject the element erosion on impact location during only validation was verified as a good option to solve this issue.","Du, Xianping; Jiang, Binhui; Zhang, Guanjun; Chou, Clifford; Bai, Zhonghao",Journal of biomechanical engineering,70,1

Inappropriate control of drug release from such products may result in reduced efficacy or increased toxicity. OBJECTIVE This paper is a summary report of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, International Pharmaceutical Federation, and Product Quality Research Institute workshop titled ""Challenges and Opportunities in Establishing Scientific and Regulatory Standards for Assuring Therapeutic Equivalence of Modified Release Products"", held October 1-2, 2009, in Baltimore, Maryland. METHODS The workshop provided an opportunity for pharmaceutical scientists from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies to discuss current regulatory expectations and industry practices for evaluating the pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence of oral MR products. RESULTS In the case of conventional monophasic MR formulations, the current regulatory approaches and criteria for bioequivalence evaluation were considered adequate for the assessment of therapeutic equivalence and inter-changeability of drug products. Additional measures may occasionally be needed to determine the bioequivalence of multiphasic MR products. The metric of partial AUC proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration received broad support as an additional measure for evaluating bioequivalence of multiphasic MR products designed to have a rapid onset of drug action followed by sustained response. The cutoff for partial AUCs may be based on the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic/ response characteristics of the products under examination. If the new metric is highly variable, the bioequivalence limits may be set based on the known within-subject variability for the reference product. CONCLUSIONS The current regulatory approaches and criteria for bioequivalence evaluation were considered adequate for the assessment of therapeutic equivalence and interchangeability of conventional monophasic MR products. Additional measures may occasionally be needed to establish the bioequivalence of multiphasic MR products, and development of such measures is an important objective. The metric of partial AUC was proposed for products designed to have a rapid drug action followed by sustained response.","Chen, Mei-Ling; Shah, Vinod P; Ganes, Derek; Midha, Kamal K; Caro, James; Nambiar, Prabu; Rocci, Mario L; Thombre, Avinash G; Abrahamsson, Bertil; Conner, Dale; Davit, Barbara; Fackler, Paul; Farrell, Colm; Gupta, Suneel; Katz, Russell; Mehta, Mehul; Preskorn, Sheldon H; Sanderink, Gerard; Stavchansky, Salomon; Temple, Robert; Wang, Yaning; Winkle, Helen; Yu, Lawrence",Clinical therapeutics,70,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who had a renal tumor in a solitary kidney, and underwent renal cryoablation and partial nephrectomy between December 2000 and January 2012. Renal tumor complexity was categorized into 3 groups by R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score as low (4 to 6), intermediate (7 to 9) and high (10 to 12). All baseline demographic data, perioperative parameters and followup data including renal function were collected. Comparisons were made among similar tumor complexities. RESULTS In the renal cryoablation and partial nephrectomy groups 29 patients (43 tumors) and 33 patients were identified, respectively. In all renal tumor complexities, renal cryoablation provided a better perioperative outcome in terms of median operative time, estimated blood loss, transfusion, hospital stay and complications. The median change in serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate was slightly greater in the partial nephrectomy group. However, the differences were not statistically significant for any of the tumor complexities. Three patients (10%) in the renal cryoablation group and 2 (6%) in the partial nephrectomy group required long-term dialysis. CONCLUSIONS In patients with solitary kidneys, renal cryoablation is associated with superior perioperative outcomes compared to partial nephrectomy. Specifically, partial nephrectomy is not associated with greater loss of renal function than renal cryoablation regardless of the extent of tumor complexity.","Panumatrassamee, Kamol; Kaouk, Jihad H; Autorino, Riccardo; Lenis, Andrew T; Laydner, Humberto; Isac, Wahib; Long, Jean-Alexandre; Eyraud, Remi; Kassab, Ahmad; Khalifeh, Ali; Hillyer, Shahab; Rizkala, Emad; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Stein, Robert J",The Journal of urology,70,5

Research conducted during past epidemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of this study was to investigate antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during this pandemic in Greece. METHODS All women receiving routine antenatal care, during a three-month period, starting one week after the total lockdown in Greece, in a University department, were asked to fill in two questionnaires, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS Overall, 505 women (93.3% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The prevalence of antenatal depression (EPDS score≥13) in the population of the study was 13.5%. Unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.447; 95% CI: 1.235-4.846), smoking (OR: 2.268; 95% CI: 1.166-4.411) and antenatal anxiety (OR: 5.074; 95% CI: 2.898-8.883) increased the risk of antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. State (current)-anxiety affected 34.1% of the participants, whereas Trait (lifetime)-anxiety affected 15.8%. The State-anxiety score (median) was significantly higher than the Trait-anxiety (median) (41 vs. 36; p<0.001), revealing an increase in the levels of anxiety in the pandemic, while there was also a positive linear correlation between the two scales (rho=0.592; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety, but not depression levels of pregnant women in Greece. Population level interventions to address adverse effects on anxiety status in the initial phases of similar situations may be helpful in the future.","Tsakiridis, Ioannis; Dagklis, Themistoklis; Mamopoulos, Apostolos; Athanasiadis, Apostolos; Pearson, Rebecca; Papazisis, Georgios",Journal of perinatal medicine,70,16

However, the safety issue of intracameral injection of MXF for human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) is still debatable. In this study, we investigated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity (0.05-1 mg/ml) of MXF for immortalized HCECs (B4G12 cell) and the underlying mechanism. Reactive oxygen generation (ROS) and cell viability after MXF exposure was measured. Flow cytometric analysis and TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptotic HCECs after MXF exposure. Ultrastructure of damaged HCECs by MXF was imaged by transmission electron microscope. Western blot analysis and caspase 2, 3 and 8 analysis were used to reveal the underlying mechanism of MXF induced damage in HCECs. We found that MXF induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HCECs. MXF exposure increased ROS generation and induced autophagy in HCECs. Increased LDH release represented the cellular membrane damage by MXF. In addition, caspases activation, Bax/Bcl-xL-dependent apoptosis pathway and apoptosis inducing factor nuclear translocation were all involved in MXF induced HCECs' damage, especially after exposure to high dose of MXF (0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml). These findings suggest that MXF toxicity on HCECs should be thoroughly considered by ophthalmologists when intracameral injection of MXF is planned.","Park, Joo-Hee; Kim, Martha; Chuck, Roy S; Park, Choul Yong",Scientific reports,70,20

The German Lung Screening Intervention Trial (""LUSI"") is a randomized trial among 4052 long-term smokers (2622 men), 50.3-71.9 years of age from the general population around Heidelberg, Germany, comparing five annual rounds of low-dose computed tomography (n=2029) with a control arm without intervention (n=2023). After a median follow-up of 9.77 years post-randomization and 5.73 years since last screening, 74 participants were diagnosed with lung cancer in the control arm and 90 in the screening arm: 69 during the active screening period; of which 63 screen-detected and 6 interval cancers. The excess cumulative incidence in the screening arm (N=16) represented 25.4% [95%CI -11.3, 64.3] of screen-detected cancer cases (N=63). Analyzed by histologic subtype, excess incidence in the screening arm appeared largely driven by adenocarcinomas. Statistical modeling yielded an estimated mean pre-clinical sojourn time (MPST) of 5.38 [4.76, 5.88] years and a screen-test sensitivity of 81.6 [74.4%, 88.8%] for lung cancer overall, all histologic subtypes combined. Based on modeling, we further estimated that about 48% (47.5% [43.2%, 50.7%]) of screen-detected tumors have a lead time ≥4 years, whereas about 33% (32.8% [28.4%, 36.1%]) have a lead time ≥6 years, 23% (22,6% [18,6%, 25,7%]) ≥8 years, 16% (15.6% [12,2%, 18,3%]) ≥10 years and 11% (10,7% [8,0%, 13,0%]) ≥12 years.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy of echocardiography in assessing the anatomy of coronary arteries in neonates with transposition of the great arteries, and determine impact on outcomes. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of data in neonates with transposition of the great arteries. Preoperative echocardiographic coronary artery pattern and surgical intraoperative reports were compared. Mismatch between transthoracic echocardiography and surgical intraoperative reports and the impact on perioperative outcome were assessed. Coronary patterns were classified into four groups: type 1 (normal); type 2 (risk of coronary with intramural course); type 3 (coronary loop); and type 2+3. RESULTS Overall, 108 neonates who underwent an arterial switch operation were included: 68 were classified as type 1; seven as type 2; 32 as type 3; and one as type 2+3. Overall, 10 adverse events occurred. Five patients died, three from coronary causes. Survival was 96% at 1 month. Transthoracic echocardiography and surgical intraoperative reports differed in 17.6% of cases. Mortality was 15.8% in case of inappropriate diagnosis and 2.2% for appropriate diagnosis (P=0.01). Mortality in type 2 was 66.7% in case of discordance versus 0% when concordant. Multivariable analysis found that inappropriate preoperative transthoracic echocardiography diagnosis of coronary pattern was the only significant risk factor for mortality (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS Echocardiography can assess coronary artery anatomy in neonates with transposition of the great arteries. Intramural coronary course is often misdiagnosed. Preoperative misdiagnosis of coronary artery anomaly may impact perioperative mortality. However, this assessment will have to be confirmed by further larger studies.","Bertail-Galoin, Claire; Leconte, Cecile; Bakloul, Mohamed; Perouse-de-Montclos, Thomas; Moulin-Zinsch, Anne; Martin-Bonnet, Caroline; Debost, Bernard; Di Filippo, Sylvie",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,70,16

However, it has gained widespread acceptance only in the last few years since studies have shown significant survival benefit. Many centers have established prone ventilation in their treatment algorithm for mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Physiologically, PP should also benefit awake, non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, proning in non-intubated (PINI) patients did not gain any momentum until a few months ago when the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surged. A large number of sick patients overwhelmed the health care system, and many centers faced a dearth of ventilators. In addition, outcomes of patients placed on mechanical ventilation because of COVID-19 infection have been highly variable and often dismal. Hence, increased focus has shifted to using various strategies to prevent intubation, such as PINI. There is accumulating evidence that PINI is a low-risk intervention that can be performed even outside intensive care unit with minimal assistance and may prevent intubation in certain patients with ARDS. It can also be performed safely at smaller centers and, therefore, may reduce the patient transfer to larger institutions that are overwhelmed in the current crisis. We present a case series of 2 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who experienced significant improvements in oxygenation with PP. In addition, the physiology of PP is described, and concerns such as proning in obese and patient's anxiety are addressed; an educational pamphlet that may be useful for both patients and health care providers is provided.","Paul, Vishesh; Patel, Shawn; Royse, Michelle; Odish, Mazen; Malhotra, Atul; Koenig, Seth",Journal of intensive care medicine,70,12

END was defined as any persisting increase in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥2 points within 24 hours after admission and favorable outcome as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2 at 90 days. We assessed the association of END with clinical and imaging variables, acute treatment and outcome using multivariable regression, calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS Sixty-one of 365 (16.7%) patients with acute lacunar stroke (median age 71.8 years, 39.5% female, median NIHSS score on admission 3) had END.

CONCLUSION One in six patients with lacunar stroke has END and patients at high risk of END can be identified using radiological and clinical variables. Targeted therapeutic trials for this population seem justified. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that early neurologic deterioration in patients with acute lacunar stroke predicts poorer functional outcome at 90 days as determined by the modified Rankin Scale.","Vynckier, Jan; Maamari, Basel; Grunder, Lorenz; Goeldlin, Martina Béatrice; Meinel, Thomas Raphael; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Hakim, Arsany; Arnold, Marcel; Gralla, Jan; Seiffge, David Julian; Fischer, Urs",Neurology,70,1

Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study. Most positive patients had aprior remote infection, but their infectiousness while being screened remains unclear.Abbreviations: REI: reproductive endocrinology and infertility; IUI: intrauterine insemination; IVF: in vitro fertilization; sono: sonography; cryo: cryopreservation; FET: frozen embryo transfer.","Gingold, Julian A; Galperin, Sharon; Fowler, Sabrina; Kappy, Michelle; Pollack, Staci; Singh, Manvinder; Lieman, Harry; Jindal, Sangita",Systems biology in reproductive medicine,70,1

Aim This study aimed to investigate the impacts of novel Vietnamese government regulations on radiological PhD and professorship candidates. Methods This study evaluated freely accessible data, available online, and, therefore, did not require institutional review board approval. We assessed the numbers of radiological PhD candidates at Hanoi Medical University and the numbers of published Vietnamese radiological papers, from 2012 to 2019, indexed in the SCImago database. In addition, we evaluated the numbers of qualified radiological professors and associate professors employed at universities during the same period. We did not include nuclear medicine PhD and professorship candidates, in this study. The data are presented as bar and line charts. Results Following the enactment of 08/2017/TT-BGDĐT and 37/2018/QĐ-TTg, we observed that the numbers of radiological PhD and professorship candidates were significantly reduced. From 2012 to 2019, only one candidate qualified for appointment as a radiological professor. However, the number of radiological papers rose dramatically during the same time period. Conclusion The enactment of 08/2017/TT-BGDĐT and 37/2018/QĐ-TTg had strong impacts on the numbers of PhD and professorship candidates. Owing to these new regulations, the number of published, international, peer-reviewed radiological papers has increased; however, some undesired consequences may have occurred, such as papers being published in predatory or suspected predatory journals, double or triple submissions, and plagiarism.","Duc, Nguyen Minh; Ha, Hoang Duc; Khoa, Mai Trong; Thong, Pham Minh",Acta informatica medica : AIM : journal of the Society for Medical Informatics of Bosnia & Herzegovina : casopis Drustva za medicinsku informatiku BiH,70,1

METHOD This article reviews the literature on violence against people with disabilities as well as emerging literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and its social and medical consequences. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic magnifies existing issues and barriers facing people with disabilities who are experiencing interpersonal violence. These issues include reliance on the perpetrator for care and assistance, barriers to reporting abuse and seeking help, fear of retaliation and other negative consequences if abuse is reported, emotional abuse related to disability, and exacerbation of secondary physical and mental health sequalae of abuse. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences enhance the already increased risk for abuse among people with disabilities. Providers who work with individuals with disabilities should address these issues at both the individual client and systems levels.

This study examined whether community prevention coalitions in Chile and Colombia perceived these reports of RPFs-based on the results of the Communities That Care Youth Survey-to be understandable, valid, useful, and worth disseminating. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data collected from 7 focus groups with 75 coalition members. Results indicated heterogeneity between and within coalitions in terms of participants' understanding of RPFs. However, most participants found reports of RPFs to be easy to understand, thorough, 'true' to their communities, and useful for diagnosing and prioritizing needs, action planning, and mobilizing others in their communities.

Evidence based strategies are urgently needed to improve these outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) to determine whether school-based interventions promote safe sex behaviors, reduce sexual risk behaviors and risk of curable STIs, HSV-2, HIV and unintended pregnancies among young adolescents aged 9-19 years in SSA. Electronic databases were searched for published studies and manual searches were conducted through reviewing of references of cited literature in the English language up to December 2019. Two independent reviewers screened and abstracted the data. We identified 428 articles and data from nine RCTs (N = 14,426 secondary school students) that fulfilled the selection criteria were analysed. Two studies measured pregnancy as an outcome and showed significant declines in unintended pregnancies. Of the five studies that measured HIV/AIDS related-knowledge, condom-use outcomes (normative beliefs, knowledge, and self-efficacy) and attitudes to HIV testing, four showed significant improvements. Of the six studies that measured sexual debut, four reported moderate but non-significant declines and in two studies sexual debut information was either incomplete or unreliable. One study measured curable STIs and found no significant declines; whilst the second study that measured HSV-2 and HIV, no significant declines were observed. This review highlights the need to undertake well-designed research studies to provide evidence on the impact of interventions on curable STIs, HSV-2 and HIV, critical to improving the health of young adolescents.","Shangase, Nosipho; Kharsany, Ayesha B M; Ntombela, Nonzwakazi P; Pettifor, Audrey; McKinnon, Lyle R",AIDS and behavior,70,24

Radiolabeled subnanomolar anti-HER2 affibody ZHER2:342 was developed for imaging of HER2 expression in tumors, and a clinical study has demonstrated that the (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled affibody molecules can efficiently detect HER2 expressing metastases in breast cancer patients. However, a significant renal accumulation of radioactivity after systemic injection of a radiolabeled anti-HER2 affibody conjugate is observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of renal reabsorption of anti-HER2 affibody at the molecular level. Renal accumulation of radiolabeled anti-HER2 affibody molecules was studied in a murine model and in vitro using opossum-derived proximal tubule (OK) cells. It was found that kidney reabsorption of affibody molecule was not driven by megalin/cubilin. Amino acids in the target-binding side of affibody molecule were involved in binding to OK cells. On OK cells, two types of receptors for anti-HER2 affibody molecule were found: KD1=0.8 nM, Bmax1=71,500 and KD2=9.2 nM, Bmax2=367,000. The results of the present study indicate that affibody molecule and other scaffold-based targeting proteins with a relatively low kidney uptake can be selected using in vitro studies with tubular kidney cells.","Altai, Mohamed; Varasteh, Zohreh; Andersson, Karl; Eek, Annemarie; Boerman, Otto; Orlova, Anna",Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,70,27

METHODS We searched electronic databases to June 2017. Randomised or cluster randomised studies in communities within rural/remote areas of Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were included. Data were analysed as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR), and effects were adjusted for clustering. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects and evidence quality was assessed. RESULTS Eleven randomised trials were included from 5440 citations. Meta-analysis of all community interventions combined compared with control showed a small improvement in the number of women attending at least one antenatal care visit (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.33). Two community mobilisation sub groups: home care using both male and female mobilisers, and education by community mobilisers, improved the number of women attending at least one antenatal visit. There was no difference in the number of women attending at least one antenatal visit for any other subgroup. There was no difference in the number of women attending 3 or more antenatal visits for all community interventions combined, or any community subgroup. Likewise, there was no difference in attendance at birth between all community interventions combined and control. Health care facility births were modestly increased in women's education groups (adjusted RR (1.15, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.20; 2 studies)). Risk of maternal deaths after 2 years (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.64; 5 studies), and 3 years (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.36; 2 studies), were no different between women's education groups and control. Community level mobilisation rather than health care messages at district level improved the numbers of women giving birth at health care facilities (RR1.09 (95%CI 1.06 to 1.13; 1 study)). Maternal health care knowledge scores improved in two community-based interventions, one involving education of male community members. CONCLUSION Women's education interventions may improve the number of women seeking birth at a health care facility, but the evidence is of low quality. No impact on maternal mortality was observed Future research should explore the effectiveness of including male mobilisers.

The present study demonstrated for the first time that porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which is the primary causative agent of an emerging swine disease, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, can activate JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in PCV2-infected PK15 cells. However, PCV2 at an early stage of infection, as well as UV-irradiated PCV2, failed to activate these two MAPK families, which demonstrated that PCV2 replication was necessary for their activation. We further found that PCV2 activated the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK downstream targets c-Jun and ATF-2 with virus replication in the cultured cells. The roles of these kinases in PCV2 infection were further evaluated using specific inhibitors: the JNK inhibitor 1 for JNK1/2 and SB202190 for p38. Inhibition of JNK1/2 and p38 kinases by these specific inhibitors did result in significant reduction of PCV2 viral mRNA transcription and protein synthesis, viral progeny release, and blockage of PCV2-induced apoptotic caspase-3 activation in the infected cells. Taken together, these data suggest that JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK pathways play important roles in the PCV2 replication and contribute to virus-mediated changes in host cells.","Wei, Li; Zhu, Zhongwu; Wang, Jing; Liu, Jue",Journal of virology,70,29

Sedation or general anaesthetic are often required to close lacerations safely and to a good surgical standard. Our hospital introduced the use of local anaesthetic gel (LAT) following an audit, to reduce the need for paediatric admissions. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, this can be a valuable tool to help avoid admissions. OBJECTIVES To ascertain the usefulness of LAT gel in reducing paediatric admissions. METHODS Data was collected prospectively of all children presenting to the paediatric emergency department for input by the oral and maxillofacial team after the introduction of LAT gel. Data collected included age, aetiology, length and position of laceration, associated injuries and management. Use of LAT gel and other anaesthetics was recorded. FINDINGS Over a 12 month period, 536 children attended the paediatric ED. Paediatric lacerations accounted for 45% of the reasons for attendance. LAT gel was used in management of 33% of patients with facial lacerations. The use of the gel was successful in 76% of occasions. Ninety children (16.8% of all attendances) were admitted to hospital during this time, of which 49 were paediatric lacerations.

Splenomegaly increases the technical difficulties of LS. LS for massive splenomegaly has generally been found to fail in adults and children. With improvements in laparoscopic technique and accumulation of laparoscopic experience, however, concerns about completing the procedure in pediatric cases with even massive splenomegaly have been lowered. A retrospective review (April 1997-October 2009) of databases at 2 institutions identified 145 children undergoing splenectomy, 79 laparoscopic and 66 open. We defined splenic margin below the umbilicus or anteriorly extending over the midline as massive splenomegaly. By this definition, 22 cases of pediatric laparoscopic and 17 cases of open splenectomies for massive splenomegaly were performed. Perioperative and follow-up data of laparoscopic pediatric splenectomies were compared with those of open splenectomies, including operative time, bleeding, spleen size, complications, and hospital stay. There were no deaths, wound infections, or instances of pancreatitis. No accessory spleen was missed by laparoscopic; accessory spleens were missed in 2 patients in open splenectomies. The complication rate of laparoscopic versus open was 13.6% versus 41.2%. No subsequent surgery was necessary for dealing with complications both in laparoscopic and open series. Laparoscopic pediatric splenectomy for massive splenomegaly is a feasible, effective, and safe procedure and is associated with low morbidity and a short hospital stay.","Zhu, Jinhui; Ye, Huan; Wang, Yuedong; Zhao, Ting; Zhu, Yangwen; Xie, Zhijie; Liu, Jinming; Wang, Kewei; Zhan, Xiaoli; Ye, Zaiyuan",Surgical innovation,70,24

Infants who saw objects or faces as stimuli both exhibited selective attention to the familiar stimulus prior to preferring novel stimuli, although infants shown kaleidoscope patterns did not. These results document a preference for familiarity early in processing with a procedure that is not subject to ambiguities due to individual differences in processing speed or to collapsing data across infants.

The biodistribution studies in Balb-c mice have shown that 2a and 3a presented an high bone uptake (2a 18.3 ± 0.6% I.D./g, 3a 17.3 ± 6.1% I.D./g, at 1 h post injection), similar to (99m)Tc-MDP (17.1 ± 2.4% I.D./g, at 1 h post injection), with comparable clearance from most tissues and increased total excretion (2a 66% I.D., 3a 67% I.D. and (99m)Tc-MDP 49% I.D., at 1 h post injection). The bone-to-blood (2a 86.2, 3a 74.7) and the bone-to-muscle ratios (2a 77.7, 3a 79.0) are higher than the ones found for (99m)Tc-MDP (70.9, 47.9), at 4 h post injection. Planar whole-body gamma camera images of the rats injected with the (99m)Tc(CO)(3)-labeled pamidronate (2a) and alendronate (3a) confirmed the overall adequate biological profile of the new radiotracers for bone imaging.","Palma, Elisa; Correia, João D G; Oliveira, Bruno L; Gano, Lurdes; Santos, Isabel C; Santos, Isabel",Dalton transactions,70,16

Here, we show that the ultralow interfacial tension in fluid-fluid demixed colloid-polymer systems, which is roughly one million times smaller than in ordinary liquids, manifests itself in a wide variety of interface characteristics and processes. Discussed are the interfacial wetting behaviour close to a hard wall, the thermal capillary waves at the free interface and the process of droplet coalescence and breakup. These subjects can be studied in a single experiment by combining modern soft matter chemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. This combination allows a further exploration of a broad range of interface issues.","Aarts, Dirk G A L",Soft matter,70,33

In this report, we describe quality interventions to ensure fast endovascular treatment times in the ESCAPE (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal Occlusion with Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times) trial. Methods An ""audit and feedback"" intervention using webinar and letter was used to improve treatment time over the course of the trial. The time metrics were computed tomography-to-groin-puncture (target < 60 min) and computed tomography-to-first-reperfusion (target < 90 min). Each site was provided with their data for computed tomography-to-groin-puncture and computed tomography-to-first-reperfusion for all their patients that were randomized to the treatment arm, and their median time was compared to the overall median times of all sites in the trial. We assessed for changes in treatment time over the course of the trial. Results There were 165 patients enrolled into the endovascular arm from 22 sites. The computed tomography-to-groin-puncture time dropped from 57 to 47 min (p = 0.14) while computed tomography-to-reperfusion time dropped from 89 to 81 min (p = 0.48). Over the course of the trial, the absolute treatment benefit increased by 7.8% (p < 0.001). Conclusions An ""audit and feedback"" intervention throughout the conduct of the ESCAPE trial was a feasible way to ensure fast treatment times. Quality improvement processes should continue as standard practice beyond the trial to encourage good patient selection and the best clinical outcomes.","Kamal, Noreen; Smith, Eric E; Menon, Bijoy K; Eesa, Muneer; Ryckborst, Karla J; Poppe, Alexandre Y; Roy, Daniel; Thornton, John; Williams, David; Casaubon, Leanne K; Silver, Frank L; Butcher, Kenneth; Shuaib, Ashfaq; Rempel, Jeremy L; Jovin, Tudor G; Sapkota, Biggya L; Demchuk, Andrew M; Goyal, Mayank; Hill, Michael D",European stroke journal,70,1

Rural adult cancer patients or those living far removed from treatment may present with later stage disease, receive different treatments than their closer counterparts, and experience worsened survival. While the financial and psychosocial strain of increased travel is well documented, effects of travel distance on similar outcomes for pediatric cancer patients remain ill-defined. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize literature examining the effect of travel distance and/or rurality (as a proxy for distance) on pediatric cancer treatment experiences and survival outcomes. Included studies examined travel distance to specialized centers or rural status for patients aged above 21. Studies were excluded if they focused on financial or quality of life outcomes. We analyzed 24 studies covering myriad malignancies and outcomes, including location of care, clinical trial participation, and likelihood of receiving specialized treatments such as stem cell transplants or proton beam therapy. Most were retrospective, and 9 were conducted outside the United States. While some studies suggest rural patients may experience worsened survival and those traveling furthest may experience shorter hospitalization times/rates, the available evidence does not uniformly assert negative effects of increased distance.","Tarnasky, Aaron M; Olivere, Lindsey A; Ledbetter, Leila; Tracy, Elisabeth T",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,70,16

This study aimed to compare different outcomes of large cohorts of patients undergoing bilateral versus unilateral TEP. METHODS Based on prospective data of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery (SALTS), all patients undergoing elective unilateral or bilateral TEP from 1995 to 2006 were included in the study. The outcomes compared included conversion rates; intraoperative, surgical, and general postoperative complications; duration of operation; and length of hospital stay (LOS). Unadjusted and risk-adjusted multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS Data for 6,505 patients undergoing unilateral (n = 3,457) and bilateral (n = 3,048) TEP were prospectively collected. The average age and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were similar in the two groups. The patients undergoing bilateral TEP repair had a slightly increased rate of intraoperative complications (bilateral, 3.1% vs. unilateral, 1.9%) and surgical postoperative complications (bilateral, 3.2% vs. unilateral, 2.3%). The operation time was longer for bilateral TEP repair (86 vs. 67 min). No significant differences in postoperative LOS, general postoperative complications, or conversion rates were found. CONCLUSIONS This is the first population-based analysis in the literature to compare different outcomes in a prospective cohort of more than 6,500 patients undergoing bilateral versus unilateral TEP. Although the rates for intraoperative and surgical postoperative complications were slightly higher for the patients undergoing bilateral TEP repair, the absolute differences were small and of minor clinical relevance. Bilateral TEP repair is associated with a minimal increase in operating time and similar LOS, general postoperative complications, and conversion rates. Therefore, for patients with bilateral inguinal hernia, a simultaneous endoscopic approach represents an excellent therapeutic option.","Gass, Markus; Rosella, Laura; Banz, Vanessa; Candinas, Daniel; Güller, Ulrich",Surgical endoscopy,70,33

While some volcanoes are prone to erupt magmas of a wide compositional variety, others sample rather monotonous chemistries through time. Whether such differences are a consequence of physical filtering or reflect intrinsic properties of different magmatic systems remains unclear. Here we show, using thermal and petrological modelling, that magma flux and the thermal structure of the crust modulate diversity and temporal evolution of magma chemistry in mid to deep crustal reservoirs. Our analysis shows that constant rates of magma input leads to extractable magma compositions that tend to evolve from felsic to more mafic in time. Low magma injection rates into hot or deep crust produces less chemical variability of extractable magma compared to the injection of large batches in colder or shallower crust. Our calculations predict a correlation between magma fluxes and compositional diversity that resembles trends observed in volcanic deposits. Our approach allows retrieval of quantitative information about magma input and the thermal architecture of magmatic systems from the chemical diversity and temporal evolution of volcanic products.","Weber, Gregor; Simpson, Guy; Caricchi, Luca",Scientific reports,70,31

METHODS Individual participant data were obtained from 5 acute stroke randomized controlled trials. Data were obtained on demographics, medication use, in-hospital treatment, and functional outcome. Study-specific crude and adjusted models were used to estimate sex differences in outcomes and management, and then pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS There were 19,652 participants, of whom 7,721 (40%) were women. After multivariable adjustments, women with ischemic stroke had higher survival at 3-6 months (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.97), higher likelihood of disability (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06-1.36), and worse quality of life (weighted mean difference -0.07, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04). For management, women were more likely to be admitted to an acute stroke unit (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.34), but less likely to be intubated (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93), treated for fever (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.95), or admitted to an intensive care unit (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93). For preadmission medications, women had higher odds of being prescribed antihypertensive agents (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.31) and lower odds of being prescribed antiplatelets (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.93), glucose-lowering agents (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.94), or lipid-lowering agents (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94).

The aim of this systematic review is to identify the domains and outcomes reported in exercise interventions in oesophagogastric cancer survivors to be included in a Delphi study, with a view to informing the development of a core outcome set (COS). METHODS EMBASE, PubMed, CINHAL, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and PEDro were searched up to March 2020 using a predefined search strategy. The outcomes identified during data extraction were categorised using the core areas outlined in the OMERACT Filter 2.0. RESULTS Fourteen domains and 63 outcomes were identified. The most frequently reported outcomes were in the domains of quality of life using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the relevant disease-specific modules (100%), exercise capacity/fitness/physical function (100%), anthropometrics (83.33%), physical activity (66.67%), and biomarker analysis (50%). CONCLUSION This systematic review quantifies and describes the domains and outcomes examined in exercise interventions in oesophagogastric cancer survivors. Some inconsistency exists within the domains and outcomes used, and little attention was given to nutritional or economic endpoints. In order to develop a COS, a Delphi consensus process with key stakeholders is needed to identify the relevant domains and outcomes for inclusion.","O'Connor, Louise; Smyth, Emily; Bennett, Annemarie E; Smith, Valerie; O'Neill, Linda; Reynolds, John V; Hussey, Juliette; Guinan, Emer",BMC cancer,70,1

While bocaparvoviruses are known to infect various animals, it was not known that they exist in dromedaries. In this study, we describe the discovery of two novel dromedary camel bocaparvoviruses (DBoVs), DBoV1 and DBoV2, from dromedary faecal samples in Dubai. Among 667 adult dromedaries and 72 dromedary calves, 13.9 % of adult dromedaries and 33.3 % of dromedary calves were positive for DBoV1, while 7.0 % of adult dromedaries and 25.0 % of dromedary calves were positive for DBoV2, as determined by PCR. Sequencing of 21 DBoV1 and 18 DBoV2 genomes and phylogenetic analysis showed that DBoV1 and DBoV2 formed two distinct clusters, with only 32.6-36.3 % amino acid identities between the DBoV1 and DBoV2 strains. Quasispecies were detected in both DBoVs. The amino acid sequences of the NS1 proteins of all the DBoV1 and DBoV2 strains showed <85 % identity to those of all the other bocaparvoviruses, indicating that DBoV1 and DBoV2 are two bocaparvovirus species according to the ICTV criteria. Although the typical genome structure of NS1-NP1-VP1/VP2 was observed in DBoV1 and DBoV2, no phospholipase A2 motif and associated calcium binding site were observed in the predicted VP1 sequences for any of the 18 sequenced DBoV2, and no start codons were found for their VP1. For all 18 DBoV2 genomes, an AT-rich region of variable length and composition was present downstream to NP1. Further studies will be crucial to understand the pathogenic potential of DBoVs in this unique group of animals.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Patteril, Nissy Georgy; Yeung, Hazel C; Joseph, Sunitha; Wong, Emily Y M; Muhammed, Rubeena; Chow, Franklin W N; Wernery, Ulrich; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,70,16

In COVID-19, the relationship of many laboratory parameters to morbidity and mortality has been defined. In our study, we aimed to determine the relationship of serum vitamin D level to clinical course and prognosis. Materials and Methods This study included 108 patients; 88 patients who stayed in Ataturk University and Erzurum City Hospital between March 24, 2020 and May 15, 2020, who were identified as COVID-19 by real-time PCR method from the nasopharyngeal swab and 20 asymptomatic voluntary medical personnel who tested negative for real-time PCR after routine check-up in our hospital. Result In statistical analysis conducted between healthy control group and vitamin D levels of patients admitted due to COVID-19, it was observed that patients infected with COVID-19 had a lower level (p= 0.004). In 20 patients developing MAS, a lower level of vitamin D was observed (p= 0.004) compared to 68 patients who did not develop. In the comparison of vitamin D levels of the patients (n= 8) who developed exitus in their follow up due to COVID-19, it was observed that vitamin D levels were statistically significantly lower compared to the living (p= 0.009). Conclusions Due to COVID-19, pandemic, long-running quarantines caused insufficient use of sunlight and worsening of vitamin D deficiency. We wanted to draw attention again with our study to vitamin D which can be responsible for the heavy clinical course of COVID-19 and whose replacement is easy to apply.","Kerget, Buğra; Kerget, Ferhan; Kızıltunç, Ahmet; Koçak, Abdullah Osman; Araz, Ömer; Yılmazel Uçar, Elif; Akgün, Metin",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,70,28

In this review, we try to discuss our current view on why advanced life support (ALS) today can be performed without the use of drugs, and instead gain all focus on improving the tasks we know improve survival: CPR and defibrillation. RECENT FINDINGS Previous and recent cardiac arrest drug studies have been reviewed. These are mostly consisting of retrospective register data, some experimental data and a few new randomized trials. The alternative drug-free ALS concept is also discussed with relevant studies. SUMMARY There is currently no evidence to support any specific drugs during cardiac arrest. Good-quality CPR, early defibrillation and goal-directed postresuscitation care is more important. Healthcare systems should not prioritize implementation of unproven drugs before good quality of care can be documented. More drug studies are indeed required, and future research needs to incorporate better diagnostic tools to test more specific and tailored therapies that account for underlying causes and individual responsiveness.","Sunde, Kjetil; Olasveengen, Theresa M",Current opinion in critical care,70,30

The purpose of our study was to explore the current evidence on barriers and enablers for the implementation of humanoid robots in health and social care. DESIGN Systematic review of studies entailing hands-on interactions with a humanoid robot. SETTING From April 2018 to June 2018, databases were searched using a combination of the same search terms for articles published during the last decade. Data collection was conducted by using the Rayyan software, a standardised predefined grid, and a risk of bias and a quality assessment tool. PARTICIPANTS Post-experimental data were collected and analysed for a total of 420 participants. Participants comprised: older adults (n=307) aged ≥60 years, with no or some degree of age-related cognitive impairment, residing either in residential care facilities or at their home; care home staff (n=106); and informal caregivers (n=7). PRIMARY OUTCOMES Identification of enablers and barriers to the implementation of socially assistive humanoid robots in health and social care, and consequent insights and impact. Future developments to inform further research. RESULTS Twelve studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. None of the selected studies had an experimental design; hence overall quality was low, with high risks of biases. Several studies had no comparator, no baseline, small samples, and self-reported measures only. Within this limited evidence base, the enablers found were enjoyment, usability, personalisation and familiarisation. Barriers were related to technical problems, to the robots' limited capabilities and the negative preconceptions towards the use of robots in healthcare. Factors which produced mixed results were the robot's human-like attributes, previous experience with technology and views of formal and informal carers. CONCLUSIONS The available evidence related to implementation factors of socially assistive humanoid robots for older adults is limited, mainly focusing on aspects at individual level, and exploring acceptance of this technology.

DATA SOURCES We searched (from inception until April 27, 2020) Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers, independently and in duplicate, screened citations and manuscripts for eligible randomized controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independently and in duplicate, we performed data abstraction, risk of bias assessment, and certainty assessment using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models or, if insufficient data, presented findings narratively. RESULTS We identified seven randomized controlled trials (n = 1,575). Pooled analysis demonstrated low certainty evidence for no difference of levetiracetam on time to seizure cessation (mean difference, -3.11 min; 95% CI, -6.67 to 0.45), early seizure cessation (relative risk, 1.09, 95% CI, 0.95-1.26), or late seizure cessation (relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93-1.18). Adverse event outcomes were limited by low event numbers. We found low certainty evidence for less respiratory depression with levetiracetam (relative risk, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69). CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of levetiracetam is comparable with phenytoin or fosphenytoin in children with benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus (low certainty evidence). Levetiracetam may cause less respiratory depression. Clinicians and guideline developers should weigh safety profiles when choosing between these agents.","Klowak, Jennifer Ann; Hewitt, Mark; Catenacci, Vanessa; Duffett, Mark; Rochwerg, Bram; Jones, Kevin; Choong, Karen",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,70,16

In this manuscript, we evaluated a therapeutical approach to address PASC-derived fatigue in a cohort of past-COVID-19 positive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS A number of 100 patients, previously diagnosed as COVID-19 positive subjects and meeting our eligibility criteria, was diagnosed having PASC-related fatigue. They were recruited in the study and treated with oxygen-ozone autohemotherapy (O2-O3-AHT), according to the SIOOT protocol. Patients' response to O2-O3-AHT and changes in fatigue were measured with the 7-scoring Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), according to previously published protocols. RESULTS Statistics assessed that the effects of O2-O3-AHT on fatigue reduced PASC symptoms by 67%, as a mean, in all the investigated cohort of patients (H = 148.4786 p < 0.0001) (Figure 1). Patients following O2-O3-AHT therapy, quite completely recovered for PASC-associated fatigue, a quote amounting to about two fifths (around 40%) of the whole cohort undergoing ozone treatment and despite most of patients were female subjects, the effect was not influenced by sex distribution (H = 0.7353, p = 0.39117). CONCLUSIONS Ozone therapy is able to recover normal functionality and to relief pain and discomfort in the form of PASC-associated fatigue in at least 67% of patients suffering from post-COVID sequelae, aside from sex and age distribution.","Tirelli, U; Franzini, M; Valdenassi, L; Pisconti, S; Taibi, R; Torrisi, C; Pandolfi, S; Chirumbolo, S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,70,31

Substantial efforts have been made to decipher the relationship between CNVs and pathogenesis but with limited success. RESULTS We have developed a novel computational framework X-CNV ( www.unimd.org/XCNV ), to predict the pathogenicity of CNVs by integrating more than 30 informative features such as allele frequency (AF), CNV length, CNV type, and some deleterious scores. Notably, over 14 million CNVs across various ethnic groups, covering nearly 93% of the human genome, were unified to calculate the AF. X-CNV, which yielded area under curve (AUC) values of 0.96 and 0.94 in training and validation sets, was demonstrated to outperform other available tools in terms of CNV pathogenicity prediction. A meta-voting prediction (MVP) score was developed to quantitively measure the pathogenic effect, which is based on the probabilistic value generated from the XGBoost algorithm. The proposed MVP score demonstrated a high discriminative power in determining pathogenetic CNVs for inherited traits/diseases in different ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS The ability of the X-CNV framework to quantitatively prioritize functional, deleterious, and disease-causing CNV on a genome-wide basis outperformed current CNV-annotation tools and will have broad utility in population genetics, disease-association studies, and diagnostic screening.","Zhang, Li; Shi, Jingru; Ouyang, Jian; Zhang, Riquan; Tao, Yiran; Yuan, Dongsheng; Lv, Chengkai; Wang, Ruiyuan; Ning, Baitang; Roberts, Ruth; Tong, Weida; Liu, Zhichao; Shi, Tieliu",Genome medicine,70,13

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated an already fragile infrastructure for supplying critical medications to hospitals and health-systems. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight to the history, thought-processes, and response to critical medication shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on hydromorphone infusions and the action steps taken to engage in non-sterile to sterile (NSTS) compounding. Over a period of 6 weeks, we compounded 1,613 NSTS hydromorphone infusion bags. All lots were cleared for sterility, particulate, potency, and endotoxin testing by an outside FDA registered laboratory. We did not have any safety reports filed specific to the NSTS compounded hydromorphone infusion bags. Over a period of 15 weeks, 715 infusions were consumed. The drug supply chain suffers frequent interruptions and critical shortages, particularly in times of a natural disaster or a global pandemic. Non-sterile to sterile compounding is often associated with risks of inaccuracies, impurities, and contamination. There are instances in which non-sterile to sterile compounding is appropriate and should be considered in times of drug shortages to support the care of hospitalized patients.","Belisle, Caryn D; Anger, Kevin; Kanaan, Dareen; Rocchio, Megan A; Triggs, Angela; Chacon, Pablo; Kwok, Keely; Cotugno, Michael; Morris, Charles A; Fanikos, John",Journal of pharmacy practice,70,17

The aim of this study was to evaluate this clinical cutoff with a different widely used commercially available HCV RNA test. Results from samples tested prospectively with Roche High Pure TaqMan HCV 2.0 test (HPS) were compared to those tested retrospectively with the Abbott RealTime HCV RNA test (ART). Using 6 million IU/mL as the cut-off, pre-treatment results were concordant in 70.4% of cases.

Here, we build and characterize the performance of a novel modular 3-axis TMS coil that can be utilized as a unit element in large-scale multichannel TMS arrays. METHODS We determined the basic physical characteristics of the 3-axis TMS coil x-, y- and z-elements using a custom 2-channel programmable stimulator prototype. We mapped the temporal rate-of-change of the induced magnetic field (dB/dt) on a 2D plane parallel to the coil surface (including an extended line for full spatial coverage) and compared those values with predictions from magnetic field simulations. Temperature measurements were carried out to assess the incorporated air-cooling method. We measured the mutual and self-inductances of the x/y/z-elements to assess coupling between them. Additionally, we measured and calculated the coupling between z-elements in the array configuration. Finally, we performed electric field simulations to evaluate the stimulation intensity and focality of the coil and compared the results to conventional TMS coils as well as demonstrated suitability of the 3-axis coil for a multichannel array configuration. RESULTS The experimentally obtained dB/dt values validated the computational model of the 3-axis coil and therefore confirmed that both the coil and stimulator system are operating as intended. The air-cooling system was effective for brief high-frequency pulse trains and extended single- and paired-pulse TMS protocols. The electromagnetic simulations suggested that an array of the 3-axis coils would have comparable stimulation intensity to conventional TMS coils, therefore enabling clearly suprathreshold stimulation of the human brain. The recorded coil coupling between the x/y/z-elements was < 1% and the maximal coupling between z-elements in the array configuration was 1.8% and 3.4% for the measured and calculated values, respectively. CONCLUSION We presented a 3-axis coil intended for multichannel TMS arrays. The electromagnetic measurements and simulations verified that the coil fabrication met the desired specifications and that the inductive coupling between the elements was negligible. The air-cooled 3-axis TMS coil appears suitable to be used as an element in multichannel TMS arrays.","de Lara, Lucia I Navarro; Daneshzand, Mohammad; Mascarenas, Anthony; Paulson, Douglas; Pratt, Kevin; Okada, Yoshio; Raij, Tommi; Makarov, Sergey N; Nummenmaa, Aapo",NeuroImage,70,24

We studied the effect of advanced modality imaging with CT perfusion (CTP) or MRI compared with non-contrast CT (NCT) in a multicenter cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective study of 10 stroke centers who select patients for endovascular treatment using institutional protocols. Approval was obtained from each institution's review board as only de-identified information was used. We collected demographic and radiographic data, selected time intervals, and outcome data. ANOVA was used to compare the groups (NCT vs CTP vs MRI). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with a good clinical outcome. RESULTS 556 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 66 ± 15 years and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18 (IQR 14-22). NCT was used in 286 (51%) patients, CTP in 190 (34%) patients, and MRI in 80 (14%) patients. NCT patients had significantly lower median times to groin puncture (61 min, IQR (40-117)) compared with CTP (114 min, IQR (81-152)) or MRI (124 min, IQR (87-165)). There were no differences in clinical outcomes, hemorrhage rates, or final infarct volumes among the groups. CONCLUSIONS The current retrospective study shows that multimodal imaging may be associated with delays in treatment without reducing hemorrhage rates or improving clinical outcomes. This exploratory analysis suggests that prospective randomised studies are warranted to support the hypothesis that advanced modality imaging is superior to NCT in improving clinical outcomes.","Sheth, Kevin N; Terry, John B; Nogueira, Raul G; Horev, Anat; Nguyen, Thanh N; Fong, Albert K; Gandhi, Dheeraj; Prabhakaran, Shyam; Wisco, Dolora; Glenn, Brenda A; Tayal, Ashis H; Ludwig, Bryan; Hussain, Muhammad Shazam; Jovin, Tudor G; Clemmons, Paul F; Cronin, Carolyn; Liebeskind, David S; Tian, Melissa; Gupta, Rishi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,70,1

Standard laboratory and ROTEM parameters were evaluated in 45 patients (20 COVID group patients and 25 non-COVID group patients) at time of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (T0) and at 5 (T5) and 10 days (T10) later. In all evaluations times, platelet count was found higher in COVID group rather than in non-COVID group. At T0, COVID group revealed a fibrinogen value greater than non-COVID group. D-Dimer values were high in both groups and they were not statistically different. At T0 COVID group showed a significant reduction of clot formation time in INTEM and in EXTEM and a significant increase of maximum clot firmness in INTEM, EXTEM and FIBTEM respect to non-COVID group. Moreover, COVID group demonstrated a coagulability state with ROTEM profiles higher than non-COVID group at T5 and T10. Coagulation profiles showed that critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia are characterized by a higher coagulable state than others; this greater procoagulative state persists over time.","Pavoni, Vittorio; Gianesello, Lara; Pazzi, Maddalena; Horton, Andrew; Suardi, Lorenzo R",Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,70,1

In 2019, the early winter influenza season coincided with mid-year school breaks, enabling us the unusual opportunity to examine how influenza incidence changed during school holiday closure dates. Methods: The weekly influenza data from five Australian state and one territory health departments for the period of week 19 (mid-May) to week 39 (early October) 2019 were compared to each state's public-school holiday closure dates. We used segmented regression to model the weekly counts and a negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion due to autocorrelation. The models' goodness-of-fit was assessed by plots of observed versus expected counts, plots of residuals versus predicted values, and Pearson's Chi-square test. The main exposure was the July two-week school holiday period, using a lag of one week. The effect is estimated as a percent change in incidence level, and in slope. Results: School holidays were associated with significant declines in influenza incidence in three states and one territory by between 41% and 65%. Two states did not show evidence of declines although one of those states had already passed its peak by the time of the school holidays. The models showed acceptable goodness-of-fit. The first decline during school holidays is seen in the school aged (5-19 years) population, with the declines in the adult and infant populations being smaller and following a week later. Conclusions: Given the significant and rapid reductions in incidence, these results have important public health implications. Closure or extension of holiday periods could be an emergency option for state governments.","Scott, Anna Mae; Bakhit, Mina; Clark, Justin; Vermeulen, Melanie; Jones, Mark; Looke, David; Del Mar, Chris; Glasziou, Paul",F1000Research,70,26

Interventions Lifestyle-intensive medical management intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program and LookAHEAD trials for 2 years, with and without (60 participants each) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery followed by observation to year 5. Main Outcomes and Measures The American Diabetes Association composite triple end point of hemoglobin A1c less than 7.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg at 5 years. Results Of 120 participants who were initially randomized (mean age, 49 years [SD, 8 years], 72 women [60%]), 98 (82%) completed 5 years of follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups: mean (SD) body mass index 34.4 (3.2) for the lifestyle-medical management group and 34.9 (3.0) for the gastric bypass group and had hemoglobin A1c levels of 9.6% (1.2) and 9.6% (1.0), respectively. At 5 years, 13 participants (23%) in the gastric bypass group and 2 (4%) in the lifestyle-intensive medical management group had achieved the composite triple end point (difference, 19%; 95% CI, 4%-34%; P = .01). In the fifth year, 31 patients (55%) in the gastric bypass group vs 8 (14%) in the lifestyle-medical management group achieved an HbA1c level of less than 7.0% (difference, 41%; 95% CI, 19%-63%; P = .002). Gastric bypass had more serious adverse events than did the lifestyle-medical management intervention, 66 events vs 38 events, most frequently gastrointestinal events and surgical complications such as strictures, small bowel obstructions, and leaks. Gastric bypass had more parathyroid hormone elevation but no difference in B12 deficiency. Conclusions and Relevance In extended follow-up of obese adults with type 2 diabetes randomized to adding gastric bypass compared with lifestyle and intensive medical management alone, there remained a significantly better composite triple end point in the surgical group at 5 years. However, because the effect size diminished over 5 years, further follow-up is needed to understand the durability of the improvement.

SETTING ICU of Bari Policlinico Academic Hospital (Italy), dedicated to care patients with confirmed diagnosis of novel coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS Eight patients with early severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome and static respiratory compliance higher than or equal to 50 mL/cm H2O. INTERVENTIONS We compared a ""lower"" and a ""higher"" positive end-expiratory pressure approach, respectively, according to the intervention arms of the acute respiratory distress syndrome network and the positive end-expiratory pressure setting in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome studies. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patients were ventilated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome network and, subsequently, with the ExPress protocol. After 1 hour of ventilation, for each protocol, we recorded arterial blood gas, respiratory mechanics, alveolar recruitment, and hemodynamic variables. Comparisons were performed with analysis of variance for repeated measures or Friedman test as appropriate. Positive end-expiratory pressure was increased from 9 ± 3.5 to 17.7 ± 1.7 cm H2O (p < 0.01). Alveolar recruitment was 450 ± 111 mL. Static respiratory system compliance decreased from 58.3 ± 7.6 mL/cm H2O to 47.4 ± 14.5 mL/cm H2O (p = 0.018) and the ""stress index"" increased from 0.97 ± 0.03 to 1.22 ± 0.07 (p < 0.001). The PaO2/FIO2 ratio increased from 131 ± 22 to 207 ± 41 (p < 0.001), and the PaCO2 increased from 45.9 ± 12.7 to 49.8 ± 13.2 mm Hg (p < 0.001). The cardiac index went from 3.6 ± 0.4 to 2.9 ± 0.6 L/min/m (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the ""higher"" positive end-expiratory pressure approach in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome and high compliance improves oxygenation and lung aeration but may result in alveolar hyperinflation and hemodynamic alterations.","Grasso, Salvatore; Mirabella, Lucia; Murgolo, Francesco; Di Mussi, Rossella; Pisani, Luigi; Dalfino, Lidia; Spadaro, Savino; Rauseo, Michela; Lamanna, Angela; Cinnella, Gilda",Critical care medicine,70,1

Recently, some large single-centre series have shown encouraging results for the percutaneous treatment of CFA obstructions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and one-year efficacy of the endovascular treatment of CFA obstructions with combined use of directional atherectomy (DA) and a paclitaxel-coated balloon (DCB). METHODS AND RESULTS Between January 2012 and July 2014, 30 consecutive patients with severely calcified obstructions of the common femoral artery were treated in our centre using DA followed by DCB dilatation. Provisional stenting was allowed in the case of a suboptimal result. Twenty cases (66%) were isolated CFA interventions, whereas five (17%) and five (17%) also involved inflow and outflow vessels, respectively. Chronic total CFA occlusions (CTO) were recanalised in six cases (20%). Procedural success was achieved in all cases; stenting was needed in three cases (10%). At one year, restenosis and target lesion revascularisation were observed in two of 30 (6.6%) and one of 30 (3.3%) patients, respectively. The secondary patency rate was 96.7%.

METHODS Laser evoked potentials were recorded by 61 electroencephalogram channels before (T0), 1 h (T1) and 7 days after (T2) Erenumab 70 mg injection, stimulating the left and right forehead and the right hand. Laser evoked potential control 1 h after the injection served as placebo session. RESULTS Seventeen migraine patients were evaluated. The N1 and N2 component obtained from the right and left trigeminal stimulation diminished in amplitude at T2, compared to T0 and T1 conditions. N2 habituation reduction slightly recovered at T2. Laser evoked potential changes did not correlate with clinical improvement after 3 months of Erenumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS A single dose of Erenumab has a mild inhibitory effect on cortical responses evoked from trigeminal cutaneous a-delta fibers. Though this phenomenon was not predictive of the clinical outcome, it confirms a wide representation of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors on trigeminal afferents.","de Tommaso, Marina; Delussi, Marianna; Gentile, Eleonora; Ricci, Katia; Quitadamo, Silvia Giovanna; Libro, Giuseppe",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,70,1

In insects, alternative splicing has been found associated with resistance to pesticides and Bt toxins. Up to date the alternative splicing in western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) has not been studied. To investigate its alternative splicing pattern and relation to Bt resistance, we carried out single-molecule real-time (SMRT) transcript sequencing and Iso-seq analysis on resistant, eCry3.1Ab-selected and susceptible, unselected, western corn rootworm neonate midguts which fed on seedling maize with and without eCry3.1Ab for 12 and 24 hours. We present transcriptome-wide alternative splicing patterns of western corn rootworm midgut in response to feeding on eCry3.1Ab-expressing corn using a comprehensive approach that combines both RNA-seq and SMRT transcript sequencing techniques. The results showed genes in western corn rootworm are highly alternatively spliced, which happens on 67.73% of multi-exon genes. One of the alternative splicing events we identified was a novel peritrophic matrix protein with two alternative splicing isoforms. Analysis of differential exon usage between resistant and susceptible colonies showed that in eCry3.1Ab-resistant western corn rootworm, expression of one isoform was significantly higher than in the susceptible colony, while no significant differences between colonies were observed with the other isoform. Our results provide the first survey of alternative splicing in western corn rootworm and suggest that the observed alternatively spliced isoforms of peritrophic matrix protein may be associated with eCry3.1Ab resistance in western corn rootworm.","Zhao, Z; Elsik, C; Hibbard, B; Shelby, K",Insect molecular biology,70,1

The evidence regarding the status of the patient safety culture in Arab countries in general shows that it is at a suboptimal level due to a punitive approach to errors and deficits in the openness of communications. OBJECTIVES To identify factors contributing to the patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia. DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS A systematic search was carried out in May 2018 in five electronic databases and updated in July 2020-MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Relevant journals and reference lists of included studies were also hand-searched. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted their relevant characteristics. The Yorkshire Contributory Factors Framework (YCFF) was used to categorise factors affecting safety culture in the included papers. RESULTS 14 papers were included and the majority of studies were appraised as being of good quality. Strength and weakness factors that contribute to patient safety culture were identified. Ineffective leadership, a blame culture, workload/inadequate staffing and poor communication are reported as the main factors hindering a positive patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia. Conversely, 'strength' factors contributing to a positive patient safety culture included supportive organisational attitudes to learning/continuous improvement, good teamwork within units and support from hospital management for patient safety. There is an absence of patient perspectives regarding patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION Policymakers in the Saudi healthcare system should pay attention to the factors that may contribute to a positive patient safety culture, especially establishing a blame-free culture, improving communications and leadership capacity, learning from errors and involving patient perspectives in safety initiatives. Further research is required to understand in depth the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a positive patient safety culture in Saudi Arabia.","Albalawi, Abdulmajeed; Kidd, Lisa; Cowey, Eileen",BMJ open,70,1

PURPOSE To assess the torsional strength and mode of failure of cervical plates misaligned relative to the midsagittal vertical axis. STUDY DESIGN Plastic and foam model spine segments were tested using static compression and torsion to assess effects of misaligned and various lengths anterior cervical plate (ACPs). METHODS Different length ACPs and cancellous fixed angle screws underwent axial torsional testing on a servo-hydraulic test frame at a rate of 0.5°/s. A construct consisted of one ACP, four screws, one ultrahigh-molecular weight polyethylene inferior block, and one polyurethane foam superior block. Group 1 had ACPs aligned in the midsagittal vertical axis, group 2 plates were positioned 20° offset from the midline, and group 3 had the ACP shifted 5 mm away and 20° offset from midline. Torques versus angle data were recorded. The failure criterion was the first sign of pullout determined visually and graphically. RESULTS Group 1 had a more direct screw pullout during failure. For the misaligned plates, failure was a combination of the screws elongating the holes and shear forces acting between the plate and block. The misaligned plates needed more torque to failure. The failure torque was 50% reduced for the longer versus the shorter plates in the neutral position. Graphically shown initial screw slippage inside the block preceded visual identification of slippage in some cases. CONCLUSIONS We observed different failure mechanisms for neutral versus misaligned plates. Clinically, misalignment may have the benefit of needing more torque to fail. Misalignment was a risk factor for failure of the screw-bone interface, especially in longer plate constructs. These comparisons of angulations may be a solid platform for expansion toward a more applicable in vivo model.","Chin, Kingsley R; Cumming, Vanessa B R; Henson, MeLeah; Murrell, Brian; Chan, Frank W",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,70,1

Although behavioral compensation can attenuate or even reverse the energy deficit generated by exercise, few data are available on predictors of compensatory responses to exercise. The present study aimed to identify eating-related predictors of compensatory changes in energy balance following exercise. Overweight and obese, physically inactive women (N=48) completed self-report measures of disinhibition and binge eating and participated in two experimental conditions, exercise and rest, in counterbalanced order. Energy intake and expenditure were measured for 24-hours following each experimental condition to estimate energy balance. On average, women were 21.33±2.09years old and 63% were white. Of the sample, 63% compensated for the energy expended during exercise by increasing their energy intake or decreasing their energy expenditure. Linear mixed effects modeling with repeated measurement showed that disinhibition was not predictive of behavioral compensation. However, there was a significant difference between the negative energy balance observed following the rest condition and the positive energy balance observed following the exercise condition among women who reported binge eating, which was driven by a tendency to spend less time being physically active and more time being sedentary following exercise. These findings indicate that women who binge eat may be at greatest risk of compensating for exercise. Future research is needed to better understand psychosocial predictors and common mechanisms through which behavioral compensation is promoted.","Emery, Rebecca L; Levine, Michele D; Jakicic, John M",Eating behaviors,70,16

This study was conducted to determine the impact of the introduction of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) as a surgical option for suspected small- to medium-sized (<8 cm) tumors located in the left lateral section (LLS). METHODS This is a retrospective review of 156 consecutive patients who underwent LLR or open liver resection (OLR) of tumors located in the LLS. The study was divided into 2 consecutive periods (period 1, January 2003 through September 2006, and period 2, October 2006 through April 2014); LLR was available as a surgical option only in the latter period. Comparisons made were LLR versus OLR, LLR versus OLR (in period 2 only), and resections performed in period 1 versus period 2. RESULTS Forty-two patients underwent LLR with 4 conversions. LLR was significantly associated with a longer median operative time [167.5 minutes (range, 60-525) vs 105 minutes (range, 40-235); P < .001], decreased need for the Pringle maneuver [n = 1 (2%) vs 22 (19%); P = .008], and shorter postoperative stay [n = 4 (range, 1-10) days vs 5 days (range, 2-47); P < .001] compared with open resection. Comparison of the 42 patients who underwent LLR with the 64 contemporaneous patients who underwent OLR demonstrated similar outcomes. Again, LLR was associated with a significantly longer operation, decreased need for the Pringle maneuver, and shorter hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS LLR can be safely adopted to treat lesions in the LLS. The procedure is associated with a shorter postoperative stay and a decreased need for the Pringle maneuver, but longer operative time compared with that required for OLR.","Goh, Brian K P; Chan, Chung-Yip; Lee, Ser-Yee; Lee, Victor T W; Cheow, Peng-Chung; Chow, Pierce K H; Ooi, London L P J; Chung, Alexander Y F",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,70,17

METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of 945 patients who were scheduled for laparoscopic total extraperitoreal (TEP) repair of inguinal hernia from May 2002 to May 2010. There were 66 patients who had incarcerated hernia and 879 patients who had non-incarcerated hernia. RESULTS The mean age was younger in the incarcerated hernia group than in the non-incarcerated hernia group (41.67 vs. 48.50 years, P < 0.01), and all the incarcerated inguinal hernias patients were male. Most of the incarcerated hernias (63 out of 66 cases, 95%) were indirect hernias. The mean hospital stay showed no difference between the two groups (1.03 vs. 0.93 days, P = 0.142) but the operation time was longer for the incarcerated group than that for the non-incarcerated group (33.36 vs. 24.59 minutes, P < 0.01). Postoperative swelling (including seroma) was more frequent in the incarcerated group (14 out of 66 cases, 21%, P < 0.01), but postoperative pain was similar in both groups (3.0 vs. 8.9%, P = 0.095). There was one recurrence in the non-incarcerated group, but this had no statistical significance. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic TEP repair for the patients with chronic incarcerated inguinal hernias was safe and feasible. However, a well-designed study is needed to confirm if it is suitable for acute incarcerated inguinal hernias.","Choi, Yoon Young; Kim, Zisun; Hur, Kyung Yul",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,70,19

Although obviously very useful, such doctor-patient interactions can be fraught with risk. The General Medical Council (GMC) requires that newly graduated doctors should be adaptable to the challenge of delivering treatment advice and management remotely. Yet, currently, there is limited specific training in telephone consultation skills in both undergraduate and postgraduate curricula.Authentic and properly supervised exposure of medical students to GP telephone consultations can be difficult to achieve in clinical placements. Therefore, we have developed emergency telephone consultations within our primary care Safe and Effective Clinical Outcomes (SECO) clinics which are simulated GP surgeries organised for our final year students. We have expanded the range of patients presenting in these clinics by including trained, simulated patients requesting an urgent telephone consultation with a GP. In doing so we aim to enhance our student's skills and confidence in conducting telephone consultations.This teaching exchange paper aims to describe the ideas behind the construction of simulated patient telephone scripts together with the difficulties and successes encountered in introducing telephone consultations into our GP SECO clinic.

Sporadic NIID case was more frequently encountered than familial. In our study, we reported two adult-onset NIID patients from a family and described their clinical, imaging, and pathological features. The first patient was a 61-year-old man who only presented with non-specific headache and dizziness; however, Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) sequence showed high-intensity signal involving a small regional portion of corticomedullary junction in the frontal and parietal lobe. The older sister of former, a 64-year-old female, who developed sudden onset of weakness of the right limb was admitted to our neurology department. Compared with the first patient, similar DWI high-intensity signal but more extensive area in the corticomedullary junction was found in her brain MRI examination, also prominent leukoencephalopathy in T2-weighted image. Significantly, skin pathology of the first patient showed that typical inclusions with strongly positive P62 and ubiquitin antibody could be seen in the nuclei of sweat gland cells, adipocytes, and fibroblasts. FMR1 gene was negative. Although rare, adult-onset NIID should be considered when the characteristic radiology changes of high intensity signal involving the corticomedullary junction in the brain DWI sequence was found. In addition, the pathological result of skin biopsy combined with negative genetic testing FMR1 or NOTCH2NLC can contribute to the accurate diagnosis of the disease.

Participants silently read sentences in which we manipulated the cloze probability and the semantic congruency of the final word that served as an index for precision and prediction error respectively. With respect to the neural correlates, our findings indicate an enhanced activation within the left inferior frontal and middle temporal gyrus suggesting an effect of precision on prediction update in higher (lexico-)semantic levels.

However, questions have been raised about the role and reliability of models. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of combining probabilistic forecasts from multiple models for forecasts of incident and cumulative COVID mortalities. Methods We considered 95% interval and point forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative COVID-19 mortalities between 16 May 2020 and 8 May 2021 in multiple locations in the United States. We compared the accuracy of simple and more complex combining methods, as well as individual models. Results The average of the forecasts from the individual models was consistently more accurate than the average performance of these models, which provides a fundamental motivation for combining. Weighted combining performed well for both incident and cumulative mortalities, and for both interval and point forecasting. Inverse score with tuning was the most accurate method overall. The median combination was a leading method in the last quarter for both mortalities, and it was consistently more accurate than the mean combination for point forecasting of both mortalities. For interval forecasts of cumulative mortality, the mean performed better than the median. The leading individual models were most competitive for point forecasts of incident mortality. Conclusions We recommend that harnessing the wisdom of the crowd can improve the contribution of probabilistic forecasting of epidemics to health policy decision making, and report that the relative performance of the different combining methods depends on several factors including the type of data, type of forecast and timing.","Taylor, K.

Focusing on the Italian public and policy debate on education and adopting an archaeological analytics, it explores what 'other' coordinates for the forms of schooling are emerging through the encounters, clashes and co-options between different epistemological standpoints. Mapping the knowledge production about the space(s), time(s) and subjectivity(/ies) of schooling, we discuss the emergence of a problematization of the school form articulated around the concept of 'blending' and unfolding around a distinctive set of organizing dualisms: developmentalizing/securing, normalization/pluralization and individual/population. We offer a preliminary sketch of the contours and tensions that constitute the epistemic space where this problematization unfolded. First, we show how medical, economic, digital and educational knowledges converge around the imperative to blend the school form and make it secure and productive through the 'digital'. Second, we describe the paradoxical traits of the emerging figure of the blended-school form at the intersection between different possible configurations of the space(s) and time(s) of schooling and isolate four strategies for the (self-)governing of its subjectivities: therapy, prudentialism, discipline and enhancement.","Taglietti, D.; Landri, P.; Grimaldi, E.",European Educational Research Journal,70,1

Schools can be opportune sites for delivery of mental health interventions. India, however, is without a whole-school mental health approach. This article describes the study design for the Safeguarding Adolescent Mental Health in India (SAMA) project. The aim of SAMA is to co-design and feasibility test a suite of multi-component interventions across the intersecting systems of adolescents, schools, families and their local communities in India. Methods and analysis Our project will co-design and feasibility test four interventions to run in parallel in eight schools (three assigned to waitlist) in Bengaluru and Kolar in Karnataka, India. The primary aim is to reduce the prevalence of adolescent anxiety and depression. Co-design of interventions will build on existing evidence and resources. Interventions for adolescents at school will be universal, incorporating curriculum and social components. Interventions for parents and teachers will target mental health literacy, and also for teachers, training in positive behaviour practices. Intervention in the school community will target school climate to improve student mental health literacy and care. Intervention for the wider community will be via adolescent-led films and social media. We will generate intervention cost estimates, test outcome measures and identify pathways to increase policy action on the evidence.

Using fine needle aspiration of draining axillary lymph nodes from individuals who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, we show that frequency of TFH correlates with that of S-binding germinal center B cells. Mining of the responding TFH T cell receptor repertoire revealed a strikingly immunodominant HLADPB1* 04-restricted response to S167-180 in individuals with this allele, which is among the most common HLA alleles in humans. Paired blood and lymph node specimens show that while circulating S-specific TFH cells peak one week after the second immunization, S-specific TFH persist at nearly constant frequencies for at least six months.

However, there are other factors associated with parking spaces that can influence someone's choice of parking such as fare, parking rule, walking distance to destination, travel time, likelihood to be unoccupied at a given time. More importantly, these factors may change over time and conflict with each other which makes the recommendations produced by current parking recommender systems ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel problem called multi-objective parking recommendation. We present a solution by designing a multi-objective parking recommendation engine called MoParkeR that considers various conflicting factors together. Specifically, we utilise a non-dominated sorting technique to calculate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, consisting of recommended trade-off parking spots. We conduct extensive experiments using two real-world datasets to show the applicability of our multi-objective recommendation methodology.","Rahaman, Mohammad Saiedur; Shao, Wei; Salim, Flora D.; Turky, Ayad; Song, Andy; Chan, Jeffrey; Jiang, Junliang; Bradbrook, Doug",,70,1

We systematically investigated the impact of PAF units in a mock classroom, as a supplement to background ventilation, on localized and whole-room surface deposition and particle concentration. Fluorescently tagged particles with a volumetric mean diameter near two micrometers were continuously introduced into the classroom environment via a breathing simulator with a prescibed inhalation-exhalation waveform. Deposition velocities were inferred on >50 horizontal and vertical surfaces throughout the classroom, while aerosol concentrations were spatially monitored via optical particle spectrometry. Results revealed a particle decay rate consistent with expectations based upon the reported clean air delivery rates of the PAF units. Additionally, the PAF units reduced peak concentrations by a factor of around 2.5 compared to the highest concentrations observed and led to a statistically significant reduction in deposition velocities for horizontal surfaces >2.5 m from the aerosol source. Our results not only confirm PAF units can reduce particle concentrations but also demonstrate that they may lead to reduced particle deposition throughout an indoor environment when properly positioned.","Kong, M.; Li, L.; Eilts, S.; Hogan, C.

However, some healthcare settings have faced barriers in implementation. We present a study to investigate changes in rates of remote consultation during the pandemic using a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset.MethodsThe Clinical Record Interactive Search tool (CRIS) was used to examine de-identified EHR data of people receiving mental healthcare in South London, UK. Data from around 37,500 patients were analysed for each week from 7th January 2019 and 20th September 2020 using linear regression and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to investigate changes in the number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals and prescribing of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers. The data are presented in an interactive dashboard: http://rpatel.co.uk/TelepsychiatryDashboard.ResultsThe frequency of in-person contacts was substantially reduced following the onset of the pandemic (β coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts increased significantly (β coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite the increase in remote contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in prescribing.

This study aimed to assess the public transportation users’ perceptions, needs, and preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Amman, Jordan. A cross-sectional correlation design was used to recruit 510 participants between March 2020 - October 2020. We used an online survey that included the users’ sociodemographic data sheet, frequency of using PT and other traveling modes, and travelers’ perception towards PT before and after the pandemic. This study indicated a dramatic decrease in using PT during the pandemic, reaching 50%, and a reduction in the frequency of PT daily usage from 16% to 4%, however, all other traveling modes experienced an increase. In addition, 50% of the participants indicated that social distancing was the most important criterion to choose the mode of traveling during the pandemic, while equally 22% of the participants considered the duration and cost before traveling as an important criterion. A significant correlation between the frequency of using PT during the pandemic and anxiety was observed. However, the frequency of using PT or walking indicated a significant correlation with education levels only before the pandemic. Besides, 50% and 40% of the participants reported that neither public transportation nor walking infrastructure conditions were appropriate, respectively.

To explore the potency of the CT-P59 monoclonal antibody against P.1 variant, we tried to conduct binding affinity, in vitro neutralization, and in vivo animal tests. In in vitro assays revealed that CT-P59 is able to neutralize P.1 variant in spite of reduction in its binding affinity against a RBD (receptor binding domain) mutant protein including K417T/E484K/N501Y and neutralizing activity against P.1 pseudoviruses and live viruses. In contrast, in vivo hACE2 (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)-expressing TG (transgenic) mouse challenge experiment demonstrated that a clinically relevant or lower dosages of CT-P59 is capable of lowering viral loads in the respiratory tract and alleviates symptoms such as body weight losses and survival rates. Therefore, a clinical dosage of CT-P59 could compensate for reduced in vitro antiviral activity in P.1-infected mice, implying that CT-P59 has therapeutic potency for COVID-19 patients infected with P.1 variant. Highlights CT-P59 could bind to and neutralize P.1 variant, but CT-P59 showed reduced susceptibility in in vitro tests. The clinical dosage of CT-P59 demonstrated in vivo therapeutic potency against P.1 variants in hACE2-expressing mice challenge study.

In the United States, changes to transit service and reductions in passenger volume due to COVID-19 are lasting longer than originally anticipated. In this paper we examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual travel behavior across the United States. We analyze mobility data from a sample drawn from a nationwide smartphone-based panel curated by a private firm, Embee Mobile, in combination with a survey that we administered to that sample in August 2020. Our analysis provides insight into travel patterns and the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on transit riders. We investigated three questions. First, how do transit riders differ socio-demographically from non-riders? Second, how has the travel behavior of transit riders changed due to the pandemic in comparison to non-riders, controlling for other factors? And third, how has this travel behavior varied across different types of transit riders? The travel patterns of transit riders were more significantly disrupted by the pandemic than the travel of non-riders, as measured by the average weekly number of trips and distance traveled before and after the onset of the pandemic. This was calculated using GPS traces from panel member smartphones. Our survey of the panel revealed that of transit riders, 75% reported taking transit less since the pandemic, likely due to a combination of being affected by transit service changes, concerns about infection risk on transit, and trip reductions due to shelter-in-place rules. Less than 10 percent of transit riders in our sample reported that they were comfortable using transit despite COVID-19 infection risk, and were not affected by transit service reductions. Transit riders were also more likely to have changed their travel behavior in other ways, including reporting an increase in walking. However, lower-income transit riders were different from higher-income riders in that they had a significantly smaller reduction in the number of trips and distance traveled, suggesting that these lower-income households had less discretion over the amount of travel they carried out during the pandemic. These results have significant implications for understanding the way welfare has been affected for transportation-disadvantaged populations during the course of the pandemic, and insight into the recovery of U.S. transit systems. The evidence from this unique dataset helps us understand the future effects of the pandemic on transit riders in the United States, either in further recovery from the pandemic with the anticipated effects of mass vaccination, or in response to additional waves of COVID-19 and other pandemics.","Parker, Madeleine E.

To achieve herd immunity, widespread use of the vaccine is required, and it is therefore critical for government and public health agencies to understand public perceptions of the vaccine to help sustain subsequent vaccinations. Objective: This study aims to explore the opinions and sentiments of tweets about COVID-19 vaccination among Twitter users in Japan, both before and at the beginning of the COVID-19 vaccination program. Methods: We collected 144,101 Japanese tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords from Japanese Twitter users between August 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Specifically, we identified temporal changes in the number of tweets and key events that triggered a surge in the number of tweets. In addition, we performed sentiment analysis, and calculated the correlation between different sentiments and the number of deaths, infections, and vaccinations. We also built latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also provided a word cloud of high-frequency unigram and bigram tokens as additional evidence, and conducted further analysis on three different vaccine brands. Results: The overall number of tweets has continued to increase since the start of mass vaccination in Japan. Sentiments were generally neutral, but negative sentiment was more significant than positive sentiment. Before and after the first vaccination in Japan, the correlations of negative/positive sentiment with death, infection, and vaccination cases changed significantly. Public concerns revolved around three themes: information on vaccine reservations and vaccinations in Japan; infection and mutation of COVID-19 in Japan; and prevention measures, vaccine development and supply, and vaccination status in other countries. Furthermore, public attention to the three brands of vaccines has a temporal shift as clinical trials move forward. Conclusions: The number of tweets and changes in sentiment are primarily driven by major news events in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine, with negative sentiments dominating positive sentiments overall. Death and infection cases correlated significantly with negative sentiments, but the correlation fell after vaccinations began as morbidity and mortality decreased. The attention of the public to different vaccine brands had a temporal change during their clinical trial process, and although the discussion points are slightly different, the core remains effective and secure.","Niu, Q.; Liu, J.; Nagai-Tanima, M.; Aoyama, T.; Masaya, K.; Shinohara, Y.; Matsumura, N.",,70,17

As this explains virus assembly quite well, the information of capsid structure must be imprinted not only in the capsid protein structures but also in the base sequence of the whole genome. We compared folding probability of the original sequence with that of the random sequence in which base composition was the same as the original. All the actual genomes of RNA viruses were more folded than the corresponding random sequences, even though most transcripts of chromosomal genes tended to be less folded. The data can be related to encapsidation of viral genomes.

RESULTS: The search resulted in 852 titles and abstracts, which were narrowed down to 43 studies involving 374 women. The most common symptoms of patients were fever (59.1%) and cough (48.4%), respectively. Gastrointestinal symptoms included diarrhea (4.5%), abdominal pain (1.6%), nausea (0.8%), and loss of appetite (0.3%), respectively. In studies on pregnant women with gastrointestinal symptoms, 13 fetal abortions occurred, most of which were induced abortions due to the risks posed by COVID-19.In thirty cases, and infected pregnant women reported a history of chronic pregnancy-related diseases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in pregnant women, similar to the general population, can present with gastrointestinal manifestations. The gastrointestinal tract can be a potential route for infection with the novel coronavirus.","Makvandi, Somayeh; Ashtari, Sara; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,70,1

We determined to reduce length of stay and admissions in patients presenting with symptoms of possible myocardial infarction; the most common presentation group. After establishing stakeholder consensus, the existing accelerated diagnostic pathway (ADP) based on the ED Assessment of Chest-pain Score (EDACS), electrocardiogram, and troponin measurements with a high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTn) on presentation and two hours later (EDACS-ADP) was modified to stream patients following an initial troponin measure as follows: (i) to a very-low risk group who could be discharged home without follow-up or further testing, and (ii) to a low-risk group who could be discharged with next-day follow-up community troponin testing. Simulations were run in an extensive research database to determine appropriate hs-cTnI and EDACS thresholds for risk classification. This COVID-ADP was developed in ~2-weeks and was implemented in the ED within a further 3-weeks. A comparison of all chest pain presentations for the 3 months prior to implementation of the COVID-ADP to 3 months following implementation showed that there was a 64.7% increase in patients having only one troponin test in the ED, a 30-minute reduction of mean length of stay of people discharged home from the ED, and a 24.3% reduction in hospital admissions of patients ultimately diagnosed with non-cardiac chest pain.","Than, Martin P.; Pickering, John W.; Adamson, Philip; Clendon, Thomas; Florkowski, Christopher M.; Lainchbury, John; Loubser, Jacques; Nankivel, Alison; Aldous, Sally J.",EJIFCC,70,6

OBJECTIVES Describe the perceptions of health professionals in the Central Maghreb (Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) as to the Strengths/Opportunities and Weaknesses/Threats of the national response plans against COVID-19, during the first weeks of their execution, and report their proposals for optimizing the performance of control strategies. METHODS This is a qualitative study of the perceptions of health professionals in the Maghreb Central regarding their experience of the first six weeks of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was collected using the ""Delphi"" technique in one turn, based on an electronic form such as ""Google Form"", developed according to SWOT analysis. The respondents' verbatim was grouped into homogeneous groups of items, the occurrence of which was subsequently measured. RESULTS A total of 382 health professionals from the Maghreb Central participated in this study, with a median age of 37 years and a median professional tenure of 10 years. The major force of the Maghreb response strategies, the most shared by the respondents, was the performance of the human resources mobilized (doctors, biologists, nurses, etc.) who succeeded in quickly learning from the international epidemiological expertise accumulated in Asia and in Europe. The fight against COVID-19 in the Central Maghreb was confronted with the general and chronic fragility of the national health systems and the low support of the general population for the recommendations of the steering committees of response, threatening the capacity of the Maghreb to confront new epidemics. CONCLUSION The success of the national response plans against COVID-19 and of possible epidemics or pandemics in the Central Maghreb, is strongly attributed to the commitment of health professionals and to community participation, necessitating the launch of assistant motivation programs. and development of health personnel and mobilization and loyalty of civil society.","Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Benzarti, Sofien; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Nouira, Sarra; Mlouki, Imen; Yahia, Faten; Ben Abdelaziz, Asma; Barhoumi, Tarek; Quessar, Asmaa; Ben Salem, Kamel",La Tunisie medicale,70,28

To investigate membrane alterations and to characterize the RC of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we performed biochemical and ultrastructural studies using MHV-infected cells. Biochemical fractionation showed that all 10 of the MHV gene 1 polyprotein products examined pelleted with the membrane fraction, consistent with membrane association of the RC. Furthermore, MHV gene 1 products p290, p210, and p150 and the p150 cleavage product membrane protein 1 (MP1, also called p44) were resistant to extraction with Triton X-114, indicating that they are integral membrane proteins. The ultrastructural analysis revealed double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) in the cytoplasm of MHV-infected cells. The DMVs were found either as separate entities or as small clusters of vesicles. To determine whether MHV proteins and viral RNA were associated with the DMVs, we performed immunocytochemistry electron microscopy (IEM). We found that the DMVs were labeled using an antiserum directed against proteins derived from open reading frame 1a of MHV. By electron microscopy in situ hybridization (ISH) using MHV-specific RNA probes, DMVs were highly labeled for both gene 1 and gene 7 sequences. By combined ISH and IEM, positive-stranded RNA and viral proteins localized to the same DMVs. Finally, viral RNA synthesis was detected by labeling with 5-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate. Newly synthesized viral RNA was found to be associated with the DMVs. We conclude from these data that the DMVs carry the MHV RNA replication complex and are the site of MHV RNA synthesis.","Gosert, Rainer; Kanjanahaluethai, Amornrat; Egger, Denise; Bienz, Kurt; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,70,1

METHODS Specific antibodies of IgM and IgG against SARS virus in 267 serum specimens from patients with SARS and 132 from non-SARS patients or healthy persons were assayed with IFA or ELISA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were used to evaluate the significance of the antibodies in diagnosis of SARS. The concordance of different measurements was tested with Kappa. RESULTS The positive rate of specific IgM and IgG detected by IFA increased sharply on the eleventh day of the disease. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of IgM in diagnosis of SARS on eleventh day or later were 65.6%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 71.0% and 81.3%, respectively, and IgG were 91.1%, 97.0% 97.3%, 90.1%, and 93.8%, respectively.

METHODS Core biopsy needles of 16-G/9-cm were customized to serve as experimental ablation probes. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous irreversible electroporation was performed in in vivo porcine kidneys with pairs of experimental (n = 10) or standard probes (n = 10) using a single parameter set (1667 V/cm, ninety 100 µs pulses). Two biopsy samples were taken immediately following ablation using the experimental probes (n = 20). Ablation outcomes were compared using computed tomography, simulation, and histology. Biopsy and necropsy histology were compared. RESULTS Simulation-suggested ablations with experimental probes were smaller than that with standard electrodes (455.23 vs 543.16 mm2), although both exhibited similar shape. Computed tomography (standard: 556 ± 61 mm2, experimental: 515 ± 67 mm2; P = .25) and histology (standard: 313 ± 77 mm2, experimental: 275 ± 75 mm2; P = .29) indicated ablations with experimental probes were not significantly different from the standard. Histopathology indicated similar morphological changes in both groups. Biopsies from the ablation zone yielded at least 1 core with sufficient tissue for analysis (11 of the 20). CONCLUSIONS A combined probe for irreversible electroporation ablation and periprocedural tissue sampling from the ablation zone is feasible. Ablation outcomes are comparable to those of standard electrodes.","Wimmer, Thomas; Srimathveeravalli, Govindarajan; Silk, Mikhail; Monette, Sebastien; Gutta, Narendra; Maybody, Majid; Erinjery, Joseph P; Coleman, Jonathan A; Solomon, Stephen B; Sofocleous, Constantinos T",Technology in cancer research & treatment,70,1

METHODS Forty-eight patients selected from the authors' hospital, whose diagnosis confirmed as SARS were analysed to sum-up the diagnostic type and basic feature of patients and the chief clinical characteristics. All the patients were randomly divided into the trial group and the control group, 24 in each. The control group was treated with the western medical therapeutic program and the trial group was treated with ICWM therapeutic program. The differences between the two groups were compared in terms of development of illness, time of using corticosteroid and absorption time of pulmonary inflammatory lesion, etc. RESULTS Most patients were youth and adult aged between 18 to 40 years old, the initial symptom was mainly the high fever, accompanied with general soreness, chest stuffiness and cough, etc. The hospitalization time, body temperature fluctuation sustaining time and time of using corticosteroid in the trial group were shorter than those in the control group, showing significant difference (P < 0.05). ICWM treatment showed a better effect in defervescence and inflammatory lesion absorption time, but with no statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients of SARS are mainly youth and adults in the prime of life, fever always appears as the initiation of illness and some accompanying symptoms would appear. As compared with the western treatment, ICWM treatment could evidently shorten the course of illness, prevent the rebounding of fever and reduce the time of using corticosteroid.","Li, Jun; Li, Shao-dan; Du, Ning",Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,70,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS This questionnaire study was undertaken from 21 May 2009 to 31 August 2009. RESULTS There were 92 respondents, ranging in age from 15 to 77 years. Of the 90 who identified their role, 35.6% were patients, 12.2% visitors and 52.2% health care professionals. About 23% of respondents disagreed that one could have H1N1 without fever or fl u-like symptoms, while 14.3% thought influenza could not be caught from an asymptomatic infected person. About 30% perceived the H1N1 death rate as high. From this study, 82.2% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that Singapore's H1N1 responses were essential, while 14.6% found it overdone. In particular, healthcare workers and doctors found their professional work to be inconvenienced. Although more than two-thirds of doctors held this view, an equal proportion agreed the outbreak response was essential. CONCLUSIONS There was a high level of acceptance of response measures as essential, despite the perceived inconvenience.

The virus takes advantage of the host-RNA-processing machinery to provide the alternative splicing capability necessary for the expression of this proteomic diversity. Serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins and the kinases that activate them are central to this alternative splicing machinery. In studies reported here, we use the HIV genome as a model. We show that HIV expression decreases overall SR protein/activity. However, we also show that HIV expression is significantly increased (20-fold) when one of the SR proteins, SRp75 is phosphorylated by SR protein kinase (SRPK)2. Thus, inhibitors of SRPK2 and perhaps of functionally related kinases, such as SRPK1, could be useful antiviral agents. Here, we develop this hypothesis and show that HIV expression down-regulates SR proteins in Flp-In293 cells, resulting in only low-level HIV expression in these cells. However, increasing SRPK2 function up-regulates HIV expression. In addition, we introduce SR protein phosphorylation inhibitor 340 (SRPIN340), which preferentially inhibits SRPK1 and SRPK2 and down-regulates SRp75. Although an isonicotinamide compound, SPRIN340 (or its derivatives) remain to be optimized for better specificity and lower cytotoxicity, we show here that SRPIN340 suppresses propagation of Sindbis virus in plaque assay and variably suppresses HIV production. Thus, we show that SRPK, a well known kinase in the cellular RNA-processing machinery, is used by at least some viruses for propagation and hence suggest that SRPIN340 or its derivatives may be useful for curbing viral diseases.","Fukuhara, Takeshi; Hosoya, Takamitsu; Shimizu, Saki; Sumi, Kengo; Oshiro, Takako; Yoshinaka, Yoshiyuki; Suzuki, Masaaki; Yamamoto, Naoki; Herzenberg, Leonore A; Herzenberg, Leonard A; Hagiwara, Masatoshi",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,70,16

While some countries, such as Greece, Belarus or Ukraine, have a mortality rate of less than 5 cases/100,000 inhabitants, other countries such as Belgium, Spain or the United Kingdom have a mortality rate of well over 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants. It is generally considered that the reason for this variability is multifactorial (including political reasons), but there are few studies that associate factors related to this variability. The objective of this work was to analyse political risk factors/markers that could explain the variability in mortality due to Covid-19 among different European countries. METHODS This is a retrospective, multinational, ecological study based on the exploitation of the database provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control which collects daily information worldwide on new cases and deaths. The accumulated mortality of Covid-19 in European countries (with more than 100 deaths on 01/05/2020) was calculated up to 29/05/2020. Political variables were compiled from different sources in the countries included in the study. The variables analysed were: the democracy index and the different factors included in it, the country's political system and the country's corruption index. On the other hand, specific political measures implemented in the different countries were collected, such as the number of days elapsed from the notification of the first infected person to 100 infected persons, to lockdown, to the closure of schools or the cancelation of meetings. The number of people infected up to the date of lockdown was also registered. For the statistical analysis of the association between the dependent variable (mortality) and the factors studied, correlation index were calculated, and the association was studied through univariate and multivariate linear regression models. RESULTS At May 1 2020, 27 European countries had at least 100 deaths. The mean mortality was 19.83 cases/100,000 inhabitants (SD 22.4) and a median of 7.95. Mortality varied from a minimum of 1.49 cases/100,000 population in Ukraine to 82.19 cases/100,000 population in Belgium. About factors analyzed both the democracy index (as well as the factors included in it), the political system (full democracy vs. no) and the corruption index were statistically associated with mortality. Also, the time until the implementation of the political measures was associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS In Europe, there is a west to east (from highest to lowest) gradient in the mortality of Covid-19. Some of the observed mortality variability can be explained by political factors.","Mazzucchelli, Ramón; Agudo Dieguez, Alberto; Dieguez Costa, Elisa M; Crespí Villarías, Natalia",Revista espanola de salud publica,70,4

Briefly, the new data on airway mucosal exudation mechanisms suggest that the protein systems of plasma contribute significantly to the mucosal biology, not only in injured airways but also in such mildly inflamed airways that lack oedema and exhibit no sign of epithelial derangement. Plasma as a source of pluripotent growth factor, adhesive, leucocyte-activating, etc., molecules may deserve a prominent position in schemes that claim to illustrate immunological and inflammatory mechanisms of the airway mucosa in vivo.","Persson, C G; Erjefält, J S; Greiff, L; Erjefält, I; Korsgren, M; Linden, M; Sundler, F; Andersson, M; Svensson, C",Scandinavian journal of immunology,70,17

We describe the first outbreak of HPIV-4 infection in a developmental disabilities unit, involving 38 institutionalized children and three staff members, during a 3-week period in autumn 2004. Most subjects had upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), while lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) occurred in three children (7%), one complicated by respiratory failure requiring ventilation support. All patients recovered. Nasopharyngeal aspirates tested for HPIV-4 were positive by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) in all 41 cases (100%), by direct immunofluorescence in 29 of 39 tested cases (74%), and by cell cultures in 6 of 37 cases (16%), and serum was positive for antibodies against HPIV-4 in all 35 cases (100%) with serum samples available. In addition, RT-PCR detected HPIV-4 in four children (three LRTI and one URTI) out of 115 patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infection. Molecular analysis of the 1,198-bp phosphoprotein sequences showed that HPIV-4 isolates among the cases were genetically similar, whereas the community controls were more genetically distant, supporting nosocomial transmission of a single HPIV-4 genotype during the outbreak. Moreover, the HPIV-4 causing the outbreak is more closely related to HPIV-4A than HPIV-4B. HPIV-4 may be an important cause of more severe respiratory illness in children. The present RT-PCR assay is a sensitive, specific, and rapid method for the diagnosing HPIV-4 infection. To better define the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease of HPIV-4 infections, HPIV-4 should be included in the routine panels of respiratory virus detection on respiratory specimens.","Lau, Susanna K P; To, Wing-Kin; Tse, Philomena W T; Chan, Alex K H; Woo, Patrick C Y; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Leung, Annie F Y; Li, Kenneth S M; Chan, Paul K S; Lim, Wilina W L; Yung, Raymond W H; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of clinical microbiology,70,20

It is based on data from four main surveillance systems: a) ongoing sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness cases with virological surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses; b) sentinel surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections and associated deaths; c) surveillance of acute respiratory infections in children under the age of five years and pneumonia in all age groups; and d) case and cluster surveillance. On 9 May 2009, the first confirmed case of pandemic H1N1 influenza in Peru was diagnosed in a Peruvian citizen returning from New York with a respiratory illness. By July, community transmission of influenza had been identified and until 27 September 2009, a total of 8,381 cases were confirmed. The incidence rate per 10,000 persons was 4.4 (in the 0-9 year-olds) and 4.1 (in the 10-19 year-olds). During epidemiological weeks (EW) 26 to 37, a total of 143 fatal cases were notified (a case fatality of 1.71%, based on confirmed cases). The maximum peak in the number of cases was reached in EW 30 with 37 deaths. Currently, the impact of the pandemic in the Peruvian population has not been too severe, and fortunately, healthcare centres have not been overwhelmed. However, the future of this pandemic is uncertain and despite the fact that our country has not been seriously affected, we should be prepared for upcoming pandemic waves.","Gomez, J; Munayco, Cv; Arrasco, Jc; Suarez, L; Laguna-Torres, Va; Aguilar, Pv; Chowell, G; Kochel, Tj",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,70,1

The knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to respond to future threats is unfamiliar to most emergency responders. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this report to describe the development, implementation and evaluation of a multidisciplinary, interactive and simulation-enhanced course to prepare responders to acts of terrorism. METHODS We used a 5-step systematic process to develop a blended-learning, simulation-enhanced training program. Learners completed a self-confidence questionnaire and written examination prior to the course and a self-confidence questionnaire, written examination and course evaluation when they finished the course. RESULTS From July 7, 2003 to March 8, 2005, 497 consenting learners completed the course. After course completion, learners demonstrated significant increases in their knowledge of terrorism response (t = -64.3, df = 496, p < 0.05) and their confidence in responding to terrorist events (t = -45.5, df = 496, p < 0.05). Learner feedback about the course was highly positive. CONCLUSIONS We successfully implemented a two-day course for professionals likely to respond to terrorist acts that included scenario-based performance training and assessment. Course participants increased their knowledge and were more confident in their ability to respond to acts of terrorism after participating in this course.","Miller, Geoffrey T; Scott, Joseph A; Issenberg, S Barry; Petrusa, Emil R; Brotons, Angel A; Gordon, David Lee; McGaghie, William C; Gordon, Michael S",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,70,16

Objectives of this review were to: 1) Determine whether there have been advancements in the measurement and analysis of perceived discrimination; 2) Identify the use of theories and/or frameworks in perceived discrimination and mental health research; and 3) Assess the extent to which stress buffers are being considered and evaluated in the existing literature. RECENT FINDINGS Metrics and analytic approaches used to assess discrimination remain largely unchanged. Theory and/or frameworks such as the stress and coping framework continue to be underused in majority of the studies. Adolescents and young adults experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination were at greater risk of adverse mental health outcomes, and the accumulation of stressors over the life course may have an aggregate impact on mental health. Some growth seems evident in studies examining the mediation and moderation of stress buffers and other key factors with the findings suggesting a reduction in the effects of discrimination on mental health. SUMMARY Discrimination scales should consider the multiple social identities of a person, the context where the exposure occurs, how the stressor manifests specifically in adolescents, the historical traumas, and cumulative exposure. Life course theory and intersectionality may help guide future work. Despite existing research, gaps remain in in elucidating the effects of racial and ethnic discrimination on mental health, signaling an opportunity and a call to social epidemiologists to engage in interdisciplinary research to speed research progress.","Vines, Anissa I; Ward, Julia B; Cordoba, Evette; Black, Kristin Z",Current epidemiology reports,70,1

METHODS: This was a multi-center and cross-sectional observational study. The study population included 1788 STEMI patients from 15 centers in Turkey. The patients were divided into two groups: COVID-19 era (March 11st-May 15st, 2020; n = 733) or pre- COVID-19 era group (March 11st-May 15st, 2019; n = 1055). Also, the patients in COVID-19 era were grouped as COVID-19 positive (n = 65) or negative (n = 668). RESULTS: There was a 30.5% drop in STEMI admission during COVID-19 era in comparison to pre-COVID-19 era. The patients admitted to the medical centers during COVID-19 era had a longer symptom-to-first medical contact time [120 (75-240) vs. 100 (60-180) minutes, p < 0.001]. COVID-19 positive STEMI patients had higher thrombus grade and lower left ventricular ejection fraction compared to COVID-19 negative patients. COVID-19 positive patients had higher mortality (28% vs. 6%, p < 0.001) and cardiogenic shock (20% vs. 7%, p < 0.001) rates compared with those without COVID-19. Matching based on propensity scores showed higher mortality and high thrombus grade in STEMI patients who were infected by SARS-COV-2 (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We detected significantly lower STEMI hospitalization rates and significant delay in duration of symptom onset to first medical contact in the context of Turkey during the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, high thrombus grade and mortality were more common in COVID-19 positive STEMI patients.","Kiris, Tuncay; Avci, Eyüp; Ekin, Tuba; Akgün, Didar Elif; Tiryaki, Mücahit; Yidirim, Arafat; Hazir, Kutluhan; Murat, Bektas; Yeni, Mehtap; Altindag, Rojhad; Gül, Sefa; Arik, Baran; Güzel, Tuncay; Murat, Selda; Oz, Ahmet; Karabacak, Mustafa; Aktas, Zihni; Yildirim, Tarik; Kilicaslan, Baris; Ergene, Asim Oktay",J. thromb. thrombolysis,70,1

The post-pandemic recovery should address fundamental questions concerning our food systems. Is it possible to reset existing ecologically unsustainable production systems towards healthier and more connected systems of conscious consumers and ecologically oriented farmers? Based on three illustrative cases from different parts of India, we show how managing transitions towards sustainability require institutional innovations and new intermediaries that build agency, change relations, and transform structures in food systems. Lessons from three diverse geographies and commodities in India are presented: Urban farming initiatives in Mumbai, conscious consumer initiatives in semi-urban Gujarat for pesticide-free mangoes, and resource-poor arid regions of Andhra Pradesh. Through these examples, we show that, beyond the technological solutions, institutional innovations such as urban community-supported farming models, Participatory Guarantee Schemes, and Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) can enable sustainable transitions. Sustainable lifestyles in a post COVID-19 world, as the cases show, require collective experimentation with producers that go beyond changed consumer behaviour to transform structures in food systems. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to determine clinical outcomes for patients with established ORN managed solely via PENTO or PENTOCLO. METHODS: The study retrospectively reviewed and collected data from the medical records of 169 patients diagnosed with ORN and treated via medical management. Patients that received any additional interventions such as surgery or hyperbaric oxygen were not included. RESULTS: Medical management led to healed ORN in 54.4% (n=92/169) of patients after an average of 12.9 months. Outcome comparison between PENTO and PENTOCLO identified the former regime to be significantly superior (p=0.0001). There is an inverse relationship with increasing ORN severity and healing with medical management (p<0.0001) with oropharyngeal cancer (p=0.0347) patients responding favourably via this approach. Infection had a critical role in the final outcome with those healing requiring 1.3 antibiotic prescriptions, while those that had disease progression requiring 4.3 prescriptions. CONCLUSION: Medical management is a viable treatment option for ORN. It appears to be most effective in Notani I and non-infected ORN.

Human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) serves as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to infect people via binding to spike proteins. Herein we report development and characterization of a rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model. C57BL/6J (B6) mice expressing hACE2 in the lung were transduced by oropharyngeal delivery of the recombinant human adenovirus type 5 that expresses hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2). Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at day 4 post-transduction and developed interstitial pneumonia associated with perivascular inflammation, accompanied by significantly higher viral load in lungs at days 3, 6, and 12 post-infection compared to Ad5-empty control group. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pneumocytes in alveolar septa. Transcriptomic analysis of lungs demonstrated that the infected Ad5-hACE mice had a significant increase in interferon-dependent chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, and genes associated with effector T cell populations including Cd3g, Cd8a, and Gzmb. Pathway analysis showed that several KEGG pathways were enriched in the dataset, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the measles pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. This response is correlative to clinical response in lungs of COVID-19 patients. These results demonstrate that expression of hACE2 via adenovirus delivery system sensitized the mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted in the development of a mild COVID-19 phenotype, highlighting the immune and inflammatory host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model is useful for preclinical and pathogenesis studies of COVID-19.

The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, a joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.","Lee, Se Yoon; Lei, Bowen; Mallick, Bani",PLoS One,70,30

One of the consequences of this lockdown is delays in medical and surgical procedures for common diseases. The aim of this study was to model the impact on survival of tumor growth caused by such delays in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. Material and methods: Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. We constructed an exponential growth model for both SCC and melanoma to estimate tumor growth between patient-reported onset and surgical excision at different time points. Results: Data from 200 patients with SCC of the head and neck and 1000 patients with cutaneous melanoma were included. An exponential growth curve was calculated for each tumor type and we estimated tumor size after 1, 2, and 3 months of potential surgical delay. The proportion of patients with T3 SCC (diameter > 4â¯cm or thickness > 6â¯mm) increased from 41.5% (83 patients) in the initial study group to an estimated 58.5%, 70.5%, and 72% after 1, 2, and 3 months of delay. Disease-specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in patients whose surgery was delayed by 3 months decreased by 6.2%, 8.2%, and 5.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients with ultrathick melanoma (> 6â¯mm) increased from 6.9% in the initial study group to 21.9%, 30.2%, and 30.2% at 1, 2, and 3 months. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survival both decreased by 14.4% in patients treated after a potential delay of 3 months. Conclusions: In the absence of adequate diagnosis and treatment of SCC and melanoma in the current lockdown situation in Spain, we can expect to see to a considerable increase in large and thick SCCs and melanomas. Efforts must be taken to encourage self-examination and facilitate access to dermatologists in order to prevent further delays.","Tejera-Vaquerizo, A; Cañueto, J; Toll, A; Santos-Juanes, J; Jaka, A; Ferrandiz, C; Sanmartín, O; Ribero, S; Moreno-Ramírez, D; Almazán, F; Fuente, M J; Podlipnik, S; Nagore, E",Actas Dermosifiliogr,70,1

We show that bulletin board contact tracing gives comparable results in terms of the reproductive number, duration, prevalence and incidence but is less resource intensive, easier to implement and offers a wider range of privacy options. Classical contact tracing focuses on contacting individuals whom an infectious person has been in proximity to. A bulletin board approach focuses on identifying locations visited by an infectious person, and then contacting those who were at those locations. We present results comparing their effects on the overall reproductive number as well as the incidence and prevalence of disease. We evaluate them by building a new discrete time stochastic model based on the Susceptible Exposed Infectious and Recovered (SEIR) framework for disease spread. We conduct simulation experiments to quantify the effectiveness of these two models of contact tracing by calibrating the model to be compatible with SARS-CoV-2. Our experiments show that location-based bulletin board contact tracing can improve manual contact tracing.","Pokharel, Atul; Soul'e, Robert; University, Avi Silberschatz New York; University, Yale",,70,4

We sought to examine informatics and digital health strategies that supported the primary care response to COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, the review aims to answer: how Australian primary health care responded and adapted to COVID-19, the facilitators and inhibitors of the Primary care informatics and digital health enabled COVID-19 response and virtual models of care observed in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a rapid scoping review complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and synthesis of the included studies. Any disagreement in the eligibility screening, data extraction or synthesis was resolved through consensus meeting and if required. was referred to a third reviewer. Evidence was synthesised, summarised, and mapped to several themes that answer the research question s of this review. RESULTS: We identified 377 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Following title, abstract and full-text screening, 29 eligible papers were included. The majority were ""perspectives"" papers. The dearth of original research into digital health and COVID-19 in primary care meant limited evidence on effectiveness, access, equity, utility, safety, and quality. Data extraction and evidence synthesis identified 14 themes corresponding to 3 research questions. Telehealth was the key digital health response in primary care, together with mobile applications and national hotlines, to enable the delivery of virtual primary care and support public health. Enablers and barriers such as workforce training, digital resources, patient experience and ethical issues, and business model and management issues were identified as important in the evolution of virtual primary care. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has transformed Australian primary care with the rapid adaptation of digital technologies to complement ""in-person"" primary care with telehealth and virtual models of care. The pandemic has also highlighted several literacy, maturity/readiness, and micro, meso and macro-organisational challenges with adopting and adapting telehealth to support integrated person-centred health care. There is a need for more research into how telehealth and virtual models of care can improve the access, integration, safety, and quality of virtual primary care.","Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Godinho, Myron Anthony; Liaw, Siaw-Teng",Int J Med Inform,70,16

Prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in three acute hospitals. Electronic case notes were analyzed for baseline characteristics and admission investigations. Scottish index for multiple deprivation (SIMD) was used to divide patients into two groups: more deprived (SIMD 1-5) and less deprived (SIMD 6-10) and results compared. Poor outcome was defined as either need for intubation and/or death. One hundred and seventy-three patients were identified, one was excluded.

In this study, we found that Ryk-an atypical Wnt receptor with a pseudokinase domain-has a Wnt-modulating effect in bone marrow stromal cells to control hematopoiesis-supporting activities. We first found that Ryk is predominantly expressed in the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of the bone marrow (BM) compared with hematopoietic cells. Downregulation of Ryk in MSCs decreased their clonogenic activity and ability to support self-renewing expansion of primitive hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs) in response to canonical Wnt ligands. In contrast, under high concentrations of Wnt, Ryk exerted suppressive effects on the transactivation of target genes and HPC-supporting effects in MSCs, thus fine-tuning the signaling intensity of Wnt in BM stromal cells. This ability of Ryk to modulate the HPC-supporting niche activity of MSCs was abrogated by induction of deletion mutants of Ryk lacking the intracellular domain or extracellular domain, indicating that the pseudokinase-containing intracellular domain mediates the Wnt-modulating effects in response to extracellular Wnt ligands. These findings indicate that the ability of the BM microenvironment to respond to extracellular signals and support hematopoiesis may be fine-tuned by Ryk via modulation of Wnt signaling intensity to coordinate hematopoietic activity.","Jeong, Seon-Yeong; Lyu, Jungmook; Kim, Jin-A; Oh, Il-Hoan",Exp. mol. med,70,26

Like other members of this family, the virus possesses a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome encodes for the nsp12 protein, which houses the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity responsible for the replication of the viral genome. A homology model of nsp12 was prepared using the structure of the SARS nsp12 (6NUR) as a model. The model was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp12. This exercise showed that vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) may bind to the active site of the nsp12 protein. A model of the nsp12 in complex with substrate RNA and incoming NTP showed that vitamin B12 binding site overlaps with that of the incoming nucleotide. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA plus NTP and methylcobalamin suggested that the vitamin may bind to the active site of nsp12 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that methylcobalamin binding may prevent association with RNA and NTP and thus inhibit the RdRP activity of nsp12. Overall, our computational studies suggest that methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp12 protein.","Narayanan, Naveen; Nair, Deepak T",IUBMB life,70,20

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all cornea donors dying from causes other than SARS-CoV-2 between August 2020 and December 2020 was performed. Informed consent was obtained from the next of kin of the deceased for RT-PCR testing from NP swabs. Rapid antigen testing from all the deceased was performed before in situ cornea excision. In addition, NP samples in viral transport media for RT-PCR were also collected for SARS-CoV-2 analysis. Corneas were released from the eye bank only after a negative RT-PCR report. RESULT: One hundred eighteen corneas from 59 donors were obtained by the eye bank. Eleven donors (18.64%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR testing. Six of these 11 donors had a Ct value of E gene less than 25. CONCLUSIONS: NP samples of cornea donors dying due to causes other than coronavirus disease-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. This implicates that donors could be having asymptomatic/undetected coronavirus disease infection. We recommend adding the routine testing of NP samples of all cornea donors in the eye banking protocol in this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Arora, Ritu; Sharda, Shipra; Sahu, Jigyasa; Manchanda, Vikas; Jain, Parul; Gupta, Isha; Gotmare, Nikhil; Bharti, Nisha",Cornea,70,21

There is currently not enough data in favour of danger or benefit from corticosteroids in COVID-19, so until this matter is resolved it is advisable to limit their indications to the most serious clinical pictures for which it is well established that this type of treatment has a positive impact on the progression of symptoms. In Grade V and VI Bell's palsy according to the House-Brackmann grading system, a week's course of oral corticosteroids is recommended. Corticosteroid therapy is also recommended in cases of sudden hearing loss of more than 60dB, either in the form of intratympanic injections or a week's course of oral medication. In rhinology, there is no indication for systemic corticosteroid therapy in the current situation. However, patients are advised to continue with their local corticosteroid therapy in the form of a nasal spray or by inhalation. Treatments with corticosteroid nasal sprays can still be prescribed if there is no alternative. Finally, systemic or local corticosteroid therapy is not indicated for bacterial ENT infections.","Herman, P; Vincent, C; Parietti Winkler, C; Loundon, N; Couloigner, V; Tankere, F; Tringali, S; Gallet, P; Papon, J-F; Montava, M; Lavieille, J-P; Charpiot, A; Schmerber, S",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,70,24

Although governments all over the world have taken severe measurements to slow down the virus spreading (e.g., travel restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities, quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot more are still in danger. Indeed, a recently conducted study~\cite{ref2} has reported that 79\% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients. Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.","Benreguia, Badreddine; Moumen, Hamouma; Merzoug, Mohammed Amine",,70,20

We develop a method to quantify neighborhood activity behaviors at high spatial and temporal resolutions and test whether, and to what extent, behavioral responses to social-distancing policies vary with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. We define exposure density ([Formula: see text]) as a measure of both the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of activity occurring in distinct land-use types. Using detailed neighborhood data for New York City, we quantify neighborhood exposure density using anonymized smartphone geolocation data over a 3-mo period covering more than 12 million unique devices and rasterize granular land-use information to contextualize observed activity. Next, we analyze disparities in community social distancing by estimating variations in neighborhood activity by land-use type before and after a mandated stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effects of localized demographic, socioeconomic, and built-environment density characteristics on infection rates and deaths in order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our findings demonstrate distinct behavioral patterns across neighborhoods after the stay-at-home order and that these variations in exposure density had a direct and measurable impact on the risk of infection. Notably, we find that an additional 10% reduction in exposure density city-wide could have saved between 1,849 and 4,068 lives during the study period, predominantly in lower-income and minority communities.","Hong, Boyeong; Bonczak, Bartosz J; Gupta, Arpit; Thorpe, Lorna E; Kontokosta, Constantine E",Proc.

An Activity Based Costing evaluation was used to calculate the acquisition of PPE and decontamination solutions recommended for dental practice during COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. PPE and decontamination solutions quantity and frequency of use were based on the newly COVID-19 recommendations. Costs (in Brazilian Real – R$) for biosafety recommendations pre-and post-COVID-19 were outlined and calculated for each patient, service shift and year. A sensitivity analysis considered 20% variation of direct costs. Previously to COVID-19 pandemic, direct costs of biosafety recommendations consisted of R$0.84 per patient, R$6.69 per service shift and R$3,413.94 per year. Post-COVID-19 costs of biosafety recommendations resulted in R$16.01 per patient, R$128.07 per service shift, and R$32,657.96 per year. Yearly costs can vary between R$26,126.37 and R$39,189.56.

Whether these alterations persist and could be related to long-term respiratory dysfunction is unknown. DesignFrom the NOR-Solidarity trial (n=181), plasma was collected during hospital admission and after three months, and analyzed for markers of gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation. At the three-month follow-up, pulmonary function was assessed by measuring diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and rectal swabs for gut microbiota analyses were collected (n= 97) and analysed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. ResultsGut microbiota diversity was reduced in COVID-19 patients with persistent respiratory dysfunction, defined as DLCO below lower limit of normal three months after hospitalization. These patients also had an altered global gut microbiota composition, with reduced abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and increased abundance of Flavonifractor and Veillonella, the latter potentially being linked to fibrosis. During hospitalization, increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were strongly associated with respiratory failure, defined as pO2/fiO2-(P/F-ratio)<26.6 kPa. LBP levels remained elevated during and after hospitalization, and was associated with low-grade inflammation and persistent respiratory dysfunction after three months. ConclusionPersistent respiratory dysfunction after COVID-19 is associated with reduced biodiversity and gut microbiota alterations, along with persistently elevated LBP levels. Our results point to a potential gut-lung axis that should be further investigated in relation to long-term pulmonary dysfunction and long COVID.

The disinfectants evaluated were 0.17% food additive glade calcium hydroxide (FdCa(OH)2) solution, sodium hypochlorite at 500 or 1,000 ppm of total chlorine (NaClO-500 or NaClO-1000, respectively), NaClO at 500 ppm of total chlorine in 0.17% FdCa(OH)2 (Mix-500) and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) diluted 500-fold in water (QAC-500). In the suspension test, all solutions inactivated IBV inoculum that contained 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under detectable level within 30 sec. In the carrier test, all solutions, except NaClO-500, could inactivate IBV with 0.5% FBS on a carrier to undetectable level in the wiping-sheets and wiped-carriers. We thus conclude that suspension and carrier tests should be introduced to evaluate disinfectants for the field usage, and that this evaluation system is important and workable for resultful selection of the tested disinfectants against avian coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces, particularly on plastic fomite.","Miyaoka, Yu; Kabir, Md Humayun; Hasan, Md Amirul; Yamaguchi, Makiko; Shoham, Dany; Murakami, Harumi; Takehara, Kazuaki",J. vet. med. sci,70,24

Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19. Preventive measures to reduce the chances of contagion consist mainly of confinement, avoiding crowded places, social distancing, masks, and applying strict personal hygiene as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). After the first wave of infection in many countries, the potential effects of relaxing containment and physical distancing control measures suggest that as a result of these measures, a second wave of COVID-19 appears probable in these countries. In sport, the period of self-isolation, and quarantine, for COVID-19 affects the physical preparation of athletes as well as their mental health and quality of life to an even greater extent (i.e., nutrition, sleep, healthy lifestyle), and thus, relevant and practical recommendations are needed to help alleviate these physical and mental health concerns. Our review aims to summarize the physiological and psychological effects of detraining associated with athletes' confinement during the proposed second wave of COVID-19. This article also proposes answers to questions that concern the advantages and disadvantages of different types of social media platforms, the importance of nutrition, and the effects of sleep disturbance on the health and modified lifestyle of athletes during this worldwide pandemic. Thus, this review provides some general guidelines to better manage their modified lifestyle and optimally maintain their physical and mental fitness with respect to measures taken during this restrictive proposed second wave of the COVID-19 confinement period.","Tayech, Amel; Mejri, Mohamed Arbi; Makhlouf, Issam; Mathlouthi, Ameni; Behm, David G; Chaouachi, Anis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),70,29

Self-reported outcomes are cost-effective; however, they are subject to error. Diagnosis of silent events may also occur through the use of imperfect laboratory-based diagnostic tests. In this paper, we describe an approach for variable selection in high dimensional datasets for settings in which the outcome is observed with error. METHODS: We adapt the spike and slab Bayesian Variable Selection approach in the context of error-prone, self-reported outcomes. The performance of the proposed approach is studied through simulation studies. An illustrative application is included using data from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource, which includes extensive genotypic (>900,000 SNPs) and phenotypic data on 9,873 African American and Hispanic American women. RESULTS: Simulation studies show improved sensitivity of our proposed method when compared to a naive approach that ignores error in the self-reported outcomes. Application of the proposed method resulted in discovery of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in a dataset of 9,873 African American and Hispanic participants in the Women's Health Initiative. There was little overlap among the top ranking SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes risk between the racial groups, adding support to previous observations in the literature of disease associated genetic loci that are often not generalizable across race/ethnicity populations. The adapted Bayesian variable selection algorithm is implemented in R. The source code for the simulations are available in the Supplement. CONCLUSIONS: Variable selection accuracy is reduced when the outcome is ascertained by error-prone self-reports. For this setting, our proposed algorithm has improved variable selection performance when compared to approaches that neglect to account for the error-prone nature of self-reports.","Gu, Xiangdong; Tadesse, Mahlet G; Foulkes, Andrea S; Ma, Yunsheng; Balasubramanian, Raji",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,70,1

Due to this unexpected catastrophe, education has shifted to virtual-learning and auto-grading models in most parts of the world. This study explores the validity and appropriateness of auto-grading-assessment for online exams by comparing students' online exam scores where they are first auto-graded and then manually graded. Furthermore, it investigates whether the mean differences in their scores are statistically significant. The study included two calculus courses taught by the authors, during the spring semester 2019-2020 at a private university in Saudi Arabia. The online exam was performed on the WebAssign platform, which has built-in calculus questions. The sample consisted of fifty-five students who were registered on those calculus courses. The quantitative data was analysed using the SPSS statistical tool. A paired t-test at an alpha level of 0.05 was performed on differences in mean exam scores between auto-graded and manually-graded scores. The statistical analysis results revealed a statistically significant difference in students' mean scores. Our findings illustrate the importance of human intelligence, its role in assessing students' achievements and understanding of mathematical concepts, and the extent to which instructors can currently rely on auto-grading. A careful manual investigation of auto-graded exams revealed different types of mistakes committed by students. Those mistakes were characterized into two categories: non-mathematical mistakes (related to Platform Design) and minor mathematical mistakes, which might deserve partial credit. The study indicated a need to reform the auto-grading system and provided some suggestions to overcome its setbacks. © 2021 The authors and IJLTER.ORG. All rights reserved.","Azmi, F.

While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease1, the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody (AAb) discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP)7 to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ""exoproteome""). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.","Wang, Eric Y; Mao, Tianyang; Klein, Jon; Dai, Yile; Huck, John D; Jaycox, Jillian R; Liu, Feimei; Zhou, Ting; Israelow, Benjamin; Wong, Patrick; Coppi, Andreas; Lucas, Carolina; Silva, Julio; Oh, Ji Eun; Song, Eric; Perotti, Emily S; Zheng, Neil S; Fischer, Suzanne; Campbell, Melissa; Fournier, John B; Wyllie, Anne L; Vogels, Chantal B F; Ott, Isabel M; Kalinich, Chaney C; Petrone, Mary E; Watkins, Anne E; Dela Cruz, Charles; Farhadian, Shelli F; Schulz, Wade L; Ma, Shuangge; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Ko, Albert I; Iwasaki, Akiko; Ring, Aaron M",Nature (Lond.),70,1

METHOD: 74 patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and 97 healthy controls (HCs) were evaluated before lockdown (T1) and during lockdown (T2). Patients were also evaluated at the beginning of treatment (T0). Questionnaires were collected to assess psychopathology, childhood trauma, attachment style, and COVID-19-related post-traumatic symptoms. RESULTS: A different trend between patients and HCs was observed only for pathological eating behaviors. Patients experienced increased compensatory exercise during lockdown; BN patients also exacerbated binge eating. Lockdown interfered with treatment outcomes: the descending trend of ED-specific psychopathology was interrupted during the epidemic in BN patients. Previously remitted patients showed re-exacerbation of binge eating after lockdown. Household arguments and fear for the safety of loved ones predicted increased symptoms during the lockdown. BN patients reported more severe COVID-19-related post-traumatic symptomatology than AN and HCs, and these symptoms were predicted by childhood trauma and insecure attachment. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 epidemic significantly impacted on EDs, both in terms of post-traumatic symptomatology and interference with the recovery process. Individuals with early trauma or insecure attachment were particularly vulnerable.","Castellini, Giovanni; Cassioli, Emanuele; Rossi, Eleonora; Innocenti, Matteo; Gironi, Veronica; Sanfilippo, Giulia; Felciai, Federica; Monteleone, Alessio M; Ricca, Valdo",Int J Eat Disord,70,32

Data were collected at baseline and during the clinical course in SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in four COVID-19 epicenters. Patients were followed up posthospital discharge for up to 3 months. Of sixty-six SCD patients with COVID-19, fifty patients (75%) required hospitalization, and seven died (10.6%). Patients with preexisting kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) were more likely to be hospitalized. The most common presenting symptom was vaso-occlusive pain. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 30 (60%) of the 50 hospitalized patients and in all who died. Older age and histories of pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and stroke were more prevalent in patients who died, as were higher creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer levels. Anticoagulation use while inpatient was twice less common in patients who died. All deaths occurred in individuals not taking hydroxyurea or any other SCD-modifying therapy.

We herein performed a network meta-analysis to examine the role of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in Asian patients with AF. METHODS: A systematic search of the publications was conducted in PubMed and Embase databases for eligible studies until July 2019. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were regarded as the effect estimates. The surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) for the ranking probabilities was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were included. For comparisons of NOACs vs warfarin, dabigatran (ORâ=â0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.86), rivaroxaban (ORâ=â0.72, 95% CI 0.65-0.81), apixaban (ORâ=â0.56, 95% CI 0.49-0.65), but not edoxaban reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, wheres dabigatran (ORâ=â0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.76), rivaroxaban (ORâ=â0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.86), apixaban (ORâ=â0.49, 95% CI 0.36-0.66), and edoxaban (ORâ=â0.34, 95% CI 0.24-0.49) decreased the risk of major bleeding. In reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, apixaban and rivaroxaban ranked the best and second best (SUCRA 0.2% and 31.4%, respectively), followed by dabigatran (50.2%), edoxaban (75.2%), and warfarin (93.0%). In reducing the risk of major bleeding, edoxaban, and apixaban ranked the best and second best (1.5% and 30.8%, respectively), followed by dabigatran (48.4%), rivaroxaban (69.2%), and warfarin (100%). CONCLUSION: NOACs were at least as effective as warfarin, but more safer in Asians with AF. Apixaban was superior to other NOACs for reducing stroke or systemic embolism, while edoxaban showed a better safety profile than other NOACs.","Liu, Xuyang; Huang, Manxiang; Ye, Caisheng; Zeng, Junquan; Zeng, Changai; Ma, Jianyong",Medicine (Baltimore),70,6

Little is known about risk, presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in kidney transplantation recipients, who may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression, comorbidity and residual chronic kidney disease. Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease. Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. Two of seven patients presented within three months of transplantation. Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units. All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever. Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein. Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic. Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients. Three patients with severe disease were diabetic. During a three week follow up one patient recovered, and one patient died. Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission. The symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever. Most patients had their immunosuppression reduced and were treated with supportive therapy.","Banerjee, Debasish; Popoola, Joyce; Shah, Sapna; Ster, Irina Chis; Quan, Virginia; Phanish, Mysore",Kidney Int,70,14

Symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild to severe, including respiratory symptoms, systemic inflammatory responses, and even death. Currently, remdesivir is the only FDA-approved therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19, although it shows limited efficacy. We were interested in learning about the drug design process for a novel virus. We focused on drug research targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, known as nsp5 or Mpro. The nsp5 protease is an enzyme critical for viral replication, with ebselen, cinanserin, and N3 being lead compounds identified as possible effective drugs (Jin, 2020). Starting with these chemical drug structures, we used an in silico drug design process to explore how to modify and refine these drugs. Our goal was to make the compounds more drug-like, according to Lipinski's and Veber's rules. Using the crystal structure file 6YB7 from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we focused on the protease active site, defined by amino acids His41, Met49, Asn142, Cys145, His164, Met165, Glu166, Pro168, and Gln189. Cys145 is especially important, as it is the target for irreversible covalent inhibitors. Based on this information, we used molecular docking software to first re-dock these drugs into the nsp5 protease. We then made changes to the structures of the lead compounds, docked those new compounds, and used the energetic information to continue the refinement process. Once we completed our own drug design explorations, we created a three-dimensional printed model of the full nsp5 protease, with the key amino acids highlighted. We also created a three-dimensional model zoomed in on the active site, with the different drugs fitting into that active site model. Here, we present what we learned about the drug design process for a novel virus such as SARS-CoV-2. Our docking protocols and models are useful for teaching the fundamentals of drug design and about modern drug discovery and design processes.","Dencklau, Dalton Evertsen Michel Juhler Isabelle Larson Kallista Pinos Alexa Rothfus Jesse Hall Bonnie",The FASEB Journal,70,16

This study was conducted to assess the CT features in confirmed cases with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, initial chest CT data of 363 confirmed cases with COVID-19 were reviewed. All subjects were stratified into three groups based on patients' clinical outcomes; non-critical group (n=194), critical group (n=65), and death group (n=104). The detailed of CT findings were collected from patients' medical records and then evaluated for each group. In addition, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors according to CT findings in three groups of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with the non-critical group, mixed ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation lesion, pleural effusion lesion, presence of diffuse opacity in cases, more than 2 lobes involved and opacity scores were significantly higher in the critical and death groups (P<0.05). Having more mixed GGO with consolidation, pleural effusion, lack of pure GGO, more diffuse opacity, involvement of more than 2 lobes and high opacity score identified as independent risk factors of critical and death groups. CONCLUSION: CT images of non-critical, critical and death groups with COVID-19 had definite characteristics. CT examination plays a vital role in managing the current COVID-19 outbreak, for early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, initial CT findings may be useful to stratify patients, which have a potentially important utility in the current global medical situation.","Ashtari, S; Vahedian-Azimi, A; Shojaee, S; Pourhoseingholi, M A; Jafari, R; Bashar, F R; Zali, M R",,70,32

One strategy that attracted significant attention was the use of digital contact-tracing apps to quickly alert users of possible exposure to the virus, and to direct them into quarantine. The initially high expectations placed upon this strategy were not met-despite the implementation of a digital contact-tracing app in Germany, further restrictions have been placed on the general population in response to further waves of the virus. We consider how digital contact tracing might have been made more effective. Arguments: We argue that there is a conflict between collecting as little data as possible, and more effective epidemic control. In contrast to the ""Corona-Warn-App"" that was implemented in Germany, an app that stored more information on a central server (a so-called ""centralized"" app) had the potential to significantly decrease viral spread. We then look at the privacy-based arguments against the centralized storage of information, suggesting that ""decentralized"" systems have privacy problems of their own. Results: The German debate on digital contact tracing apps was quickly dominated by privacy concerns, to the detriment of other ethical factors such as enhancing potential effectiveness. Furthermore, the potential problems with privacy inherent in decentralized apps were obscured in the discussion. Once we recognize these two aspects, we can see that there is an argument to be made for preferring centralized digital contact-tracing apps.","van Basshuysen, Philippe; White, Lucie",Ethik Med,70,23

This research aims to clarify popular perceptions of the COVID-19 threat and its effects on victims. In four studies with over 4,100 U.S. participants, we consistently found that people perceive the threat of COVID-19 to be substantially greater than that of several other causes of death to which it has recently been compared, including the seasonal flu and automobile accidents. Participants were less willing to help COVID-19 victims, who they considered riskier to help, more contaminated, and more responsible for their condition. Additionally, politics and demographic factors predicted attitudes about victims of COVID-19 above and beyond moral values;whereas attitudes about the other kinds of victims were primarily predicted by moral values. The results indicate that people perceive COVID-19 as an exceptionally severe disease threat, and despite prosocial inclinations, do not feel safe offering assistance to COVID-19 sufferers. This research has urgent applied significance: the findings are relevant to public health efforts and related marketing campaigns working to address extended damage to society and the economy from the pandemic. In particular, efforts to educate the public about the health impacts of COVID-19, encourage compliance with testing protocols and contact tracing, and support safe, prosocial decision-making and risk assessment, will all benefit from awareness of these findings.

In this study, recent research on the characteristics of expiratory particles and flow is reviewed, with a special focus on different respiratory activities, to provide guidance for reducing the viral infection risk in the built environment. Furthermore, environmental influence on particle evaporation, dispersion, and virus viability after exhalation and the current methods for infection risk assessment are reviewed. Finally, we summarize promising control strategies against infectious expiratory particles. The results show that airborne transmission is a significant viral transmission route, both in short and long ranges, from infected individuals. Relative humidity affects the evaporation of middle-sized droplets most, and temperature accelerates the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 both on surfaces and in aerosols. Future research is needed to improve infection risk models to better predict the infection potential of different transmission routes. Moreover, further quantitative studies on the expiratory flow features after wearing a mask are needed. Systematic investigations and the design of advanced air distribution methods, portable air cleaners, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation systems, which have shown high efficacy in removing contaminants, are required to better control indoor viral infection.","Bu, Yunchen Ooka Ryozo Kikumoto Hideki Oh Wonseok",Sustainable Cities and Society,70,24

We assessed COVID-19 awareness, adoption of COVID-19 prevention measures, and the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status, socio-economic disruptions and engagement in unhealthy behaviours among 2500 in- and out-of-school adolescent boys and young men (ABYM) aged 10-24 years in Kampala, Uganda. 74.8% (n = 1869) were in-school; nearly half (47.3%, n = 1182) were aged 15-19 years. Although > 80% were aware of at least two COVID-19 prevention measures, only 22.2% (n = 555) reported that they always wore a face mask while in a public place; 40.9% (n = 1023) always washed their hands with soap and running water while 17.6% (n = 440) always avoided gatherings of more than five people. COVID-19 lockdown led to: (a) increased mental health challenges (e.g. 1.2% [n = 31] contemplated committing suicide); (b) limited ability to meet basic needs (e.g. 62.0% [n = 1549] found it difficult to afford a diverse/balanced diet); (c) socio-economic disruptions (e.g. 30.3% [n = 756] experienced a reduction in income) and (d) engagement in unhealthy behaviours (e.g. 62% [n = 1554] reported a sedentary life style such as excessive watching of TV). These effects were more pronounced among older adolescent boys (15-19 years) and young men (20-24 years) and out-of-school compared to in-school ABYM.

Reliable laboratory diagnosis of the disease has been one of the foremost priorities for promoting public health interventions. The routinely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the reference method for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it also reported a number of false-positive or -negative cases, especially in the early stages of the novel virus outbreak. In this work, a dual-functional plasmonic biosensor combining the plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction provides an alternative and promising solution for the clinical COVID-19 diagnosis. The two-dimensional gold nanoislands (AuNIs) functionalized with complementary DNA receptors can perform a sensitive detection of the selected sequences from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through nucleic acid hybridization. For better sensing performance, the thermoplasmonic heat is generated on the same AuNIs chip when illuminated at their plasmonic resonance frequency. The localized PPT heat is capable to elevate the in situ hybridization temperature and facilitate the accurate discrimination of two similar gene sequences. Our dual-functional LSPR biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity toward the selected SARS-CoV-2 sequences with a lower detection limit down to the concentration of 0.22 pM and allows precise detection of the specific target in a multigene mixture. This study gains insight into the thermoplasmonic enhancement and its applicability in the nucleic acid tests and viral disease diagnosis.","Qiu, Guangyu; Gai, Zhibo; Tao, Yile; Schmitt, Jean; Kullak-Ublick, Gerd A; Wang, Jing",ACS Nano,70,24

Identifying a reliable and fast diagnostic device is needed for effective testing. We assessed performance and ease-of-use of the Abbott PanBio antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT). METHODS: This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study enrolled at two sites in Germany. Following routine testing with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a second study-exclusive swab was performed for Ag-RDT testing. Routine swabs were nasopharyngeal (NP) or combined NP/oropharyngeal (OP) whereas the study-exclusive swabs were NP. To evaluate performance, sensitivity and specificity were assessed overall and in predefined sub-analyses accordingly to cycle-threshold values, days after symptom onset, disease severity and study site. Additionally, an ease-of-use assessment (EoU) and System Usability Scale (SUS) were performed. RESULTS: 1108 participants were enrolled between Sept 28 and Oct 30, 2020. Of these, 106 (9.6%) were PCR-positive. The Abbott PanBio detected 92/106 PCR-positive participants with a sensitivity of 86.8% (95% CI: 79.0% - 92.0%) and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.4%-100%). The sub-analyses indicated that sensitivity was 95.8% in Ct-values <25 and within the first seven days from symptom onset. The test was characterized as easy to use (SUS: 86/100) and considered suitable for point-of-care settings. CONCLUSION: The Abbott PanBio Ag-RDT performs well for SARS-CoV-2 testing in this large manufacturer independent study, confirming its WHO recommendation for Emergency Use in settings with limited resources.","Krüger, Lisa J; Gaeddert, Mary; Tobian, Frank; Lainati, Federica; Gottschalk, Claudius; Klein, Julian A F; Schnitzler, Paul; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg; Nikolai, Olga; Lindner, Andreas K; Mockenhaupt, Frank P; Seybold, Joachim; Corman, Victor M; Drosten, Christian; Pollock, Nira R; Knorr, Britta; Welker, Andreas; de Vos, Margaretha; Sacks, Jilian A; Denkinger, Claudia M",PLoS One,70,24

Lots of efforts have emphasized on environmental samples from unexplored or underexplored natural habits and identified numerous rare actinomycete taxa producing structurally diverse bioactive natural products. Herein, we report a survey of the rare actinobacteria diversity in Xinjiang region together with the discovery of anti-TB active natural products from these strains. We have collected 17 soil samples at different sites with different environmental conditions, from which 39 rare actinobacteria were identified by using a selective isolation strategy with 5 media variations. Among those isolated strains, XJ31 was identified as a new Nocardia sp. based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Through one strain-many compounds (OSMAC) strategy combined with anti-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin bioassay-guided isolation, two groups of compounds were identified. They were twelve siderophores (nocardimicins, 1-12) and two anthraquinones (brasiliquinones, 13 and 14) and ten of them were identified as new compounds. The structures of the purified compounds were elucidated using HR-ESI-MS, 1D NMR, and 2D NMR techniques. The anti-TB bioassays revealed that the two benz[&#945;]anthraquinones have potent activity against BCG (MICs = 25 µM), which can be used as a promising start point for further anti-TB drug development.

A narrative report",14.068357,9.130517,2021,"The novel corona-virus disease (also known as COVID-19) has led to a pandemic, impacting more than 200 countries across the globe. With its global impact, COVID-19 has become a major concern of people almost everywhere, and therefore there are a large number of tweets coming out from every corner of the world, about COVID-19 related topics. In this work, we try to analyze the tweets and detect the trending topics and major concerns of people on Twitter, which can enable us to better understand the situation, and devise better planning. More specifically we propose a model based on the universal sentence encoder to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent months. We used universal sentence encoder in order to derive the semantic representation and the similarity of tweets. We then used the sentence similarity and their embeddings, and feed them to K-means clustering algorithm to group similar tweets (in semantic sense). After that, the cluster summary is obtained using a text summarization algorithm based on deep learning, which can uncover the underlying topics of each cluster. Through experimental results, we show that our model can detect very informative topics, by processing a large number of tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning of the tweets). Since this framework has no restriction on specific data distribution, it can be used to detect trending topics from any other social media and any other context rather than COVID-19. Experimental results show superiority of our proposed approach to other baselines, including TF-IDF, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).","Asgari-Chenaghlu, Meysam; Nikzad-Khasmakhi, Narjes; Minaee, Shervin",,70,27

In this study, we compared teletherapy conversion and utilization rates between SMI and general populations in an outpatient psychiatric clinic (n = 816) during COVID-19. We found no differences in telehealth conversion for patients with SMI (52%) and non-SMI (48%), suggesting equivalent adoption of teletherapy among SMI and non-SMI populations. Beyond conversion, we found that the SMI group had a significantly greater number of teletherapy visits compared to non-SMI patients, indicating that SMI group utilized teletherapy regularly after conversion. There were no group differences in new patients beginning therapy via telehealth, which shows that the SMI group was not more deterred to seek help.

Remarkable progress has led this field toward animal trials and the next challenge lies with translation to humans. There is an emerging number of small human trials that can take advantage of new models integrating behavioral and social factors. Understanding dynamic aging mechanisms, given the powerful social determinants of aging (Crimmins, 2020) and human variability and environmental contexts (Moffitt, 2020), will be critical. Behavioral and social factors are intrinsic to aging. Toxic stressors broadly defined can lead to stress-acceleration of aging, either directly impacting aging processes or by shaping poor behavioral health, and underlie the socioeconomic disparities of aging. In contrast, hormetic stressors, acute intermittent stressors of moderate intensity, can produce stress resilience, the ability for quick recovery and possibly rejuvenation of cells and tissues. Although health research usually examines static biomarkers, aging is reflected in dynamic ability to recover from challenges pointing to new interventions and targets for examining mechanisms. A fuller model incorporating stress resilience provides innovative biobehavioral interventions, both for bolstering response to challenges, such as COVID-19, and for improving healthspan.","Epel, Elissa S",Ageing Res Rev,70,1

Here, we present two cases in which life-threatening acute endocarditis was initially misdiagnosed as COVID-19 infection during the height of the pandemic in New York City. The first was a case of Klebsiella pneumoniae mitral valve endocarditis leading to papillary muscle rupture and severe mitral regurgitation, and the second a case of Streptococcus mitis aortic valve endocarditis with heart failure due to severe aortic regurgitation. These cases highlight the importance of careful clinical reasoning and demonstrate how cognitive errors may impact clinical reasoning. They also underscore the limitations of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 testing and illustrate the ways in which difficulty interpreting results may also influence clinical reasoning. Accurate diagnosis of acute endocarditis is critical given that surgical intervention can be lifesaving in unstable patients.","Hayes, Dena E; Rhee, David W; Hisamoto, Kazuhiro; Smith, Deane; Ro, Richard; Vainrib, Alan F; Bamira, Daniel; Zhou, Fang; Saric, Muhamed",Echocardiography,70,30

The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every potential clinical tool, including phototherapy-one of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 ""Spanish influenza"" pandemic. This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections. The evidence shows that violet/blue (400-470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis. Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection. Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder. The ubiquity of inexpensive light emitting lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), makes it relatively easy to develop safe low-cost light-based devices with the potential to reduce infections, sanitize equipment, hospital facilities, emergency care vehicles, homes, and the general environment as pilot studies have shown.","Enwemeka, Chukuka Samuel; Bumah, Violet Vakunseh; Masson-Meyers, Daniela Santos",J Photochem Photobiol B,70,17

Fragmented information may affect people's perceptions and behaviors, especially in times of governmental miscommunication, potentially jeopardizing efforts aimed at containing the spread of the disease. To test whether and how people have been sensitive to broken information during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, we performed a randomized survey experiment on a sample of 571 respondents. We found that more pessimistic or more optimistic fragmented messages about the pandemic have no overall significant average effect on perceptions and planned behavior of the respondents. The exploratory analyses showed that particular sociodemographic groups are more sensitive to these fragmented messages. While less educated people react to more pessimistic messages with an increased likelihood to intensify prevention measures, people aged 60 or older - the high-risk group for COVID-19 complications - react to more optimistic messages with a reduced probability to intensify prevention measures. Besides providing insights to the public administration literature on disaster management, the results reinforce the need for governments to consistently centralize communication efforts to guarantee that people are equipped with complete and accurate information to form their perceptions and adequate their behaviors towards a health crisis.","Melo, Carolina; Cabral, Sandro",Rev. adm. pública (Online),70,17

Studies show the link between obesity and severe outcome of influenza and COVID-19. Thus, we aimed to compare the impacts of obesity on the severity and mortality of influenza and COVID-19 by performing a meta-analysis. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, EMASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science from January 2009 to July 2020. The protocol was registered onto PROSPERO (CRD42020201461). After selection, 46 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed. We found obesity was a risk factor for the severity and mortality of influenza (ORsevere outcome = 1.56, CI: 1.28-1.90; ORmortality = 1.99, CI: 1.15-3.46). For COVID-19, obesity was a significant risk factor only for severe outcome (OR = 2.07, CI: 1.53-2.81) but not for mortality (OR = 1.57, CI: 0.85-2.90). Compared with obesity, morbid obesity was linked with a higher risk for the severity and mortality of both influenza (OR = 1.40, CI: 1.10-1.79) and COVID-19 (OR = 3.76, CI: 2.67-5.28). Thus, obesity should be recommended as a risk factor for the prognosis assessment of COVID-19.

We evaluated a simple negative-pressure mask technique to reduce viral exposure. METHODS: Two models simulating respiratory droplets >5-10 µm and fine respiratory nuclei <5 µm using fluorescein dye and wood smoke, respectively, were utilized in a fixed cadaveric study in a controlled environment. Using ultraviolet light, fluorescein droplet spread was assessed during simulated ESS with powered microdebrider and powered drilling. Wood smoke ejection was used to evaluate fine particulate escape from a negative-pressure mask using digital subtraction image processing. RESULTS: The use of a negative-pressure mask technique resulted in 98% reduction in the fine particulate aerosol simulation and eliminated larger respiratory droplet spread during simulated ESS, including during external drill activation.

Presentation of case: A 60-year-old male presented cough without any breathing difficulty. Vital signs showed blood pressure 130/75 mmHg, pulse 84x/minute, respiratory rate (RR) 21x/minute, body temperature 36.5C, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 75% on room air. RT-PCR for COVID-19 were positive. On third day, he complained of worsening of breath shortness, but his RR was still normal (22x/minute) with SpO2 of 98% on 3 L/minute oxygen via nasal cannula. On fifth day, he experienced severe shortness of breath with RR 38x/minute. He was then intubated using a synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.54, PaO2 58.9 mmHg, PaCO2 31.1 mmHg, HCO3 26.9mEq/L, SaO2 94.7%, FiO2 30%, and P/F ratio 196 mmHg. On eighth day, his condition deteriorated with blood pressure 80/40 mmHg with norepinephrine support, pulse 109x/minute, and SpO2 72% with ventilator. He experienced cardiac arrest and underwent basic life support, then resumed strained breathing with return of spontaneous circulation. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.07, PaO2 58.1 mmHg, PaCO2 108.9 mmHg, HCO3 32.1mEq/L, SaO2 78.7%, FiO2 90%, and P/F ratio 65 mmHg. Three hours later, he suffered cardiac arrest again and eventually died. Discussion: Possible mechanisms of silent hypoxemia are V/Q mismatch, intrapulmonary shunting, and intravascular microthrombi. Conclusions: Silent hypoxemia might be considered as an early sign of deterioration of COVID-19 patients, thus, physician may be able to intervene early and decrease its morbidity and mortality.","Gani, Munawar; Fauzi, Aditya Rifqi; Yuliyanti, Ririn Enggy; Inggriani, Maria Patricia; Nugroho, Bagus; Agustiningsih, Denny",Ann Med Surg (Lond),70,16

Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been observed. A great concern was raised about whether COVID-19 may affect male reproductive functions. In this study, we collected semen specimens from 12 male COVID-19 patients for virus detection and semen characteristics analysis. No SARS-CoV-2 was found in semen specimens. Eight out of 12 patients had normal semen quality. We also compared the sex-related hormone levels between 119 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 273 age-matched control men. A higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a lower ratio of testosterone (T) to LH were observed in the COVID-19 group. Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum T: LH ratio was negatively associated with white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels in COVID-19 patients. It's the first report about semen assessment and sex-hormone evaluation in reproductive-aged male COVID-19 patients. Although further study is needed to clarify the reasons and underlying mechanisms, our study presents an abnormal sex hormone secretion among COVID-19 patients, suggesting that attention should be paid to reproductive function evaluation in the follow-up.","Ma, Ling; Xie, Wen; Li, Danyang; Shi, Lei; Ye, Guangming; Mao, Yanhong; Xiong, Yao; Sun, Hui; Zheng, Fang; Chen, Zhimin; Qin, Jyuling; Lyu, Jing; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Zhang, Ming",J Med Virol,70,20

After such individuals have cleared the virus, only the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory can reveal the exposure, and hopefully the establishment of immune protection. With most viral infections, the presence of specific serum antibodies has provided a reliable biomarker for the exposure to the virus of interest. SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, does not reliably induce a durable antibody response, especially in sub-clinically infected individuals. Consequently, it is plausible for a recently infected individual to yield a false negative result within only a few months after exposure. Immunodiagnostic attention has therefore shifted to studies of specific T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2. Most reports published so far agree that a T cell response is engaged during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they also state that in 20-81% of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals, T cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (mega peptide pools), allegedly due to T cell cross-reactivity with Common Cold coronaviruses (CCC), or other antigens. Here we show that, by introducing irrelevant mega peptide pools as negative controls to account for chance cross-reactivity, and by establishing the antigen dose-response characteristic of the T cells, one can clearly discern between cognate T cell memory induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. cross-reactive T cell responses in individuals who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Lehmann, Alexander A; Kirchenbaum, Greg A; Zhang, Ting; Reche, Pedro A; Lehmann, Paul V",Front Immunol,70,24

It is highly infectious, with quick spreading and a wide range of impact. It has been broken out in many countries around the world and has become a public health emergency of international concern. Chinese medicine has a long history in treating plague, and viral disease is the clinical advantage in Chinese medicine. Under the premise that there is currently no specific drug treatment, Chinese medicine has achieved certain effects in the treatment of COVID-19, which has attracted much attention and has been upgraded to a national strategy. Regarding the treatment of COVID-19 with Chinese medicine, it is believed that in terms of the name of Chinese medicine, the modern connotation of &quot;uniform of typhoid and febrile disease&quot; should be re-recognized, and it is advisable to use drugs based on specific clinical prescriptions and indications. In terms of pathogenesis, the COVID-19 has the pathogenesis rules including from the mild to severe conditions, from the surface to the inside, from the excess syndrome to the deficiency syndrome. We should pay attention to the Taiyang syndrome damaged by wet disease in initial stage, Shaoyang syndrome complicated with Yangming syndrome in the middle stage, phlegm-heat obstructing lung in critical period, lung and spleen deficiency in the recovery stage. In terms of clinical treatment strategies, Dayuan Yin is recommended to induce sweat and disperse the stasis in early stage. Xiaochaihu Decoction and Maxing Shigan Decoction is used to relieve both exterior and interior symptoms in middle stage. In critical stage, Tingli Dazao Xiefei Decoction, Weijing Decoction, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, and Sanzi Yangqin Decoction are considered to reduce phlegm and clear heat.

The current TNM stage system is limited due to the heterogeneous clinical outcomes displayed in patients of same stage. Therefore, searching for a novel tool to identify patients at high recurrence-risk for improving post-operative individual management is an urgent need. Methods: Using four independent public cohorts and qRT-PCR data from 66 tissues, we developed and validated a recurrence-associated immune signature (RAIS) based on global immune genes. The clinical and molecular features, tumor immune microenvironment landscape, and immune checkpoints profiles of RAIS were also investigated. Results: In five independent cohorts, this novel scoring system was proven to be an independent recurrent factor and displayed excellent discrimination and calibration in predicting the recurrence-risk at 1~5 years. Further analysis revealed that the high-risk group displayed high mutation rate of TP53, while the low-risk group had more abundance of activated CD4+/CD8+ T cells and high expression of PD-1/PD-L1. Conclusions: The RAIS model is highly predictive of recurrence in patients with stage II/III CRC, which might serve as a powerful tool to further optimize decision-making in adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as tailor surveillance protocol for individual patients.","Liu, Zaoqu; Lu, Taoyuan; Li, Jing; Wang, Libo; Xu, Kaihao; Dang, Qin; Liu, Long; Guo, Chunguang; Jiao, Dechao; Sun, Zhenqiang; Han, Xinwei",Front Immunol,70,21

Family planning is one component of maternal health-care service that needs attention during this devastating time. Compromise on family planning services and the preventive strategies of COVID-19 might increase the burden of unintended pregnancy, but there is limited evidence that shows the magnitude of unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among women attending antenatal care in northwest Ethiopia. Methods: This study was an institutional-based cross-sectional study, including 424 women attending antenatal care from November 12/2020 to December 12/2020. The study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. A pretested questionnaire was used. Binary logistic regression (bivariable and multivariable) was employed. The adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to declare statistically significant variables based on p&lt;0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. Results: The magnitude of unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic among women attending antenatal care was found to be 47.17% (42.2-52.2%). Women did not expose to community education (AOR=2.2;95% CI1.1-4), women with no bad obstetric history (AOR=2.3;95% CI1.3-4.1), a woman was not the primary decision maker for family planning service (AOR=2.9;95% CI 1.5-5.7), no complication during index pregnancy (AOR=5.4;95% CI 2.2-13) and women with no health-care provider support (AOR=2.4, 95% CI1.4-3.9) were significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. Conclusions: The magnitude of unintended pregnancy was found to be high. Community education about maternal health services including family planning, improving women's decision-making power for maternal health-care services, giving emphasis on pregnancy-related complications with health-care provider support, and pregnant women with bad obstetric history were suggested to reduce the problem.","Hunie Asratie, M.",International Journal of Women&#039;s Health,70,24

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated couples using fresh partner ejaculate for IUI from January 2005 to September 2017. Variables included female age, semen characteristics, and ovarian stimulation type. Using cycle-level data, we evaluated the association of these characteristics with the probability of viable birth by fitting generalized regression models for a binary outcome with a logit link function, using generalized estimating equation methodology to account for the correlation between cycles involving the same patient. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1117 women with 2912 IUI cycles; viable birth was achieved in 275 (9.4%) cycles. Futile care (viable birth rate < 1%) was identified for women age > 43, regardless of stimulation type or inseminate motility (IM). Very poor prognosis (viable birth rate < 5%) was identified for women using oral medications or Clomid plus gonadotropins who were (1) age < 35 with IM < 49%, (2) age 35-37 with IM < 56%, or (3) age &#8805; 38, and (4) women age &#8805; 38 using gonadotropins only with IM < 60%. A clinical prediction model and nomogram was developed with an optimism-corrected c-statistic of 0.611. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the impact of multiple clinical factors on IUI success, identifies criteria consistent with very poor prognosis and futile care, and provides a nomogram to individualize counseling regarding the probability of a viable birth.","Ainsworth, Alessandra J; Barnard, Emily P; Baumgarten, Sarah C; Weaver, Amy L; Khan, Zaraq",J. assist. reprod. genet,70,23

Free vascularized fibular (FVF) flaps have been used successfully in the treatment of segmental bone defects; however, their efficacy in the treatment of radiated nonunions is limited. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome following FVFG for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions. METHODS: 23 (11 male and 12 female; mean age 60â¯±â¯12 years) patients underwent FVF for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions. The most common indication for radiotherapy was soft tissue sarcomas (nâ¯=â¯16). The mean follow-up was 5â¯±â¯4 years. Mean radiation dose was 51â¯±â¯14â¯Gy at a mean of 11â¯±â¯3 years prior to FVF. The mean FVF length was 17â¯±â¯4â¯cm and placed commonly with an intramedullary nail (nâ¯=â¯18). RESULTS: First time union was 52% (nâ¯=â¯12) following additional bone grafting, the overall union was 78% (nâ¯=â¯18) at a mean of 13â¯±â¯6 months. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores improved from 30% preoperatively to 73% at latest follow-up (pâ¯<â¯0.0001). Five fractures failed to unite; 3 were converted to proximal femoral replacements. CONCLUSIONS: FVF are a reasonable treatment option for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions, providing a union rate of 78% and an improvement in functional outcome.

The results revealed that the nurses were moderately competent in managing the COVID-19 care situation. Each of the 3 differentiating characteristics (age, work experience, and previous disaster experience) did not predict how nurses would manage COVID-19 preparedness significantly. Besides, we also found only 2 dimensions of preparedness (familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance and familiarity with psychological issues) significantly predicted nurses' anxiety levels. Familiarity with epidemiology and surveillance predicted nurses' anxiety positively; in contrast, familiarity with psychological issues negatively influenced nurses' anxiety.","Chua, Bee Seok; Cosmas, Getrude; Arsat, Norkiah",Asia Pac J Public Health,70,31

Given the current lack of an effective vaccine, several drugs have been repurposed for treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in an attempt to find an effective cure. AREAS COVERED: The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) initially garnered widespread attention following the publication of preliminary results showing that this drug exerts an anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. EXPERT OPINION: To date, clinical evidence suggests lack of benefit from HCQ use for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In such patients, HCQ also appears to be associated with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, FDA has recently revoked the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of HCQ and chloroquine to treat COVID-19. Conversely, whether HCQ use may represent an effective prophylactic strategy against COVID-19 is a separate question that still remains to be answered. In addition, relevant aspects regarding the potential risks and benefits of HCQ need to be clarified, in pursuit of a rational use of this drug in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","Infante, Marco; Ricordi, Camillo; Alejandro, Rodolfo; Caprio, Massimiliano; Fabbri, Andrea",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,70,26

We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and associations with mortality among COVID-19-confirmed individuals admitted to an infectious diseases referral hospital in Metro Manila. MAIN TEXT: This was a single-centre retrospective analysis including the first 500 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 individuals admitted to San Lazaro Hospital, Metro Manila, Philippines, from January to October 2020. We extracted clinical data and examined epidemiological and clinical characteristics and factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Of the 500 individuals, 133 (26.6%) were healthcare workers (HCW) and 367 (73.4%) were non-HCW, with HCW more likely presenting with milder symptoms. Non-HCW admissions were more likely to have at least one underlying disease (51.6% vs. 40.0%;p = 0.002), with hypertension (35.4%), diabetes (17.4%), and tuberculosis (8.2%) being the most common. Sixty-one (12.2%) died, comprising 1 HCW and 60 non-HCW (0.7% vs. 16.3%;p &lt; 0.001). Among the non-HCW, no death occurred for the 0-10 years age group, but deaths were recorded across all other age groups. Compared to those who recovered, individuals who died were more likely to be older (p &lt; 0.001), male (p = 0.015), report difficulty of breathing (p &lt; 0.001), be HIV positive (p = 0.008), be intubated (p &lt; 0.001), categorised as severe or critical (p &lt; 0.001), have a shorter mean hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001), or have an additional diagnosis of pneumonia (p &lt; 0.001) or ARDS (p &lt; 0.001).

Most resident testing occurs via nasopharyngeal swab that potentially causes epistaxis with rates of 5% to 8% in healthy populations. It is estimated that 48% of long-term care residents receive oral anticoagulation that increases risk of bleeding. A long-term care resident receiving oral anticoagulation experienced an episode of acute blood loss anemia after nasopharyngeal sampling. Current medications were not reviewed before testing, and oral anticoagulation was not held resulting in acute blood loss anemia. A medication review is indicated for skilled nursing and assisted living residents to identify oral anticoagulation before nasopharyngeal testing. Less invasive testing may be recommended or should bleeding occur, discontinuation of oral anticoagulation for a short term may be appropriate.","Watkins, April Kathleen; Heinzman, Kristopher M; Kurian, Thomas K; Hong, Mauricio; Clark, Angela P; Champion, Jane Dimmitt",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),70,16

Currently, there are no official guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a licensed antiviral treatment against HIV and has shown activity against other coronaviruses. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we review the evidence of the use of lopinavir/ritonavir as a potential treatment candidate against COVID-19. METHOD: This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020182067). A systematic search of the literature for the observational and randomized controlled trial was conducted in PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar through May 2nd, 2020. Two reviewers independently searched and selected. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Jadad scale, Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment tool, and National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 1,965 articles were screened from which 6 articles were selected. Of 6 articles that were included in this study, 4 reported no significant benefit in clinical improvement with lopinavir/ritonavir when compared to standard care of treatment, while 2 studies reported otherwise. Lopinavir/ritonavir was also not associated with a reduction of 28-day mortality rate as reported by 1 included study. Most included studies reported gastrointestinal symptoms as side effects from lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. CONCLUSION: There is not yet enough evidence to support the regular use of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of COVID19. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate lopinavir/ritonavir's efficacy in treatment.","Hariyanto, Timotius Ivan; Kristine, Elizabeth; Jillian Hardi, Catherine; Kurniawan, Andree",Infectious disorders.

METHODS: 8 Wistar rats were used, between 300-400g weight and two identical epigastric flaps were raised in each animal (control and experiment), the vasculature of one flap was left intact and in the second flap the arterial pedicle was clamped for 16 hours and reperfused for 45 minutes. Skin samples were obtained from each flap after these periods of time and submitted to MDA and XO analysis. RESULTS: Reperfused flaps had significantly increased MDA and XO values compared to the control flaps biopsies. CONCLUSION: The lipid peroxidation levels were higher in the rat epigastric skin flaps subjected to 16 hours of ischemia and 45 minutes of reperfusion.","Alonso Sabino de Freitas, Frederico; Eli Piccinato, Carlos; Dorival Campos, Antônio; Cherri, Jesualdo",Acta cir. bras.,70,24

With the difficulties in face-to-face consultations because of social distancing measures, telepsychiatry services can be beneficial. The study proposes implementing an e-consult for SUD management and measuring its acceptability among the health care providers (HCPs) in India. METHODS: The mobile-based e-consult for SUD, connecting HCPs with addiction specialists, was implemented during the COVID lockdown period in India from 25 March to 31 May (71 days). A total of 153 HCPs, i.e., doctors, nurses, counselors, consulted for 110 cases of SUD. Sixty-eight provided feedback by filling the survey form derived from the Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ). RESULT: More than 60% of HCPs reported overall high satisfaction. More than 98% providers reported high acceptability concerning""access to specialist care,"" ""trusted to work appropriately"", ""saving time,"" ""would like torecommend to others,"" easier to get touch with a specialist."" The doctors reported significantly high acceptability about ""access to specialist care,"" ""satisfied with recommendations,""recommend to others"" compared to other HCPs. CONCLUSION: During COVID 19 pandemic lockdown in India, e-consult was an acceptable tool in managing SUDs. The majority of HCPs could discuss their cases with addiction experts.

Participants were 907 Polish people (522 women and 385 men). We used the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FOC-6), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. The relationship between stress and life satisfaction was mediated by the sense of coherence, and the relationship between stress and sense of coherence was moderated by fear of COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 acted as a buffer in the relationship between stress and sense of coherence weakening the impact of stress on the sense of coherence. This study is the first to verify the proposed model of moderated mediation during the COVID-19 pandemic and was undertaken in a very large sample. This manuscript highlights the important role of the fear of COVID-19 and sense of coherence in our well-being.

Within HCWs, personnel of intensive care units (ICUs) are at the forefront of treating patients with a severe course of COVID-19 infection and therefore represent an extremely vulnerable group. Thus, our objective is to contribute to establish means of infection control protecting HCWs in the frontline of the current pandemic. DESIGN: An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was detected and contained in a pediatric ICU (PICU). The first positive case was identified with a point-of-care diagnostic system on site. Real-time PCR-based testing systems from self-collected nasopharyngeal samples swabs were used to test for viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the follow-up. SETTING: PICU within a tertiary university hospital in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers of the PICU. INTERVENTIONS: Positive HCWs were sent into quarantine. Containment measures were implemented including wearing of surgical-masks, physical distancing and systematic testing. RESULTS: Among 432 HCWs, 91 (25%) were tested. Forty-five percent reported symptoms corresponding to characteristics of COVID-19. Of those, only 19,5% (8 HCWs) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No infection occurred outside the PICU. After the implementation of containment measures, viral transmission was stopped. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, a large outbreak within a team of healthcare workers of a PICU, affecting almost one fifth of the entire personnel is documented, along with detailed insights about how the outbreak was contained and how operability of the unit was maintained.","Knoll, Rebecca Luise; Klopp, Jonas; Bonewitz, Gloria; Gröndahl, Britta; Hilbert, Katja; Kohnen, Wolfgang; Weise, Kerstin; Plachter, Bodo; Hitzler, Walter; Kowalzik, Frank; Runkel, Stefan; Zepp, Fred; Winter, Julia; Cacicedo, Maximiliano Luis; Gehring, Stephan",Pediatr Infect Dis J,70,11

Instead of that, in this work, we introduce dynamical parameters whose time-dependence may be phenomenologically obtained by adequately extrapolating a chosen subset of the daily provided data. This phenomenological approach works extremely well to properly adjust the number of infected (and removed) individuals in time for the countries we consider. Besides, it can handle the sub-epidemic events that some countries may experience.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to predict mild and severe cases of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 140 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 12, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to disease severity: a mild group (MG) (n = 107) and a severe group (SG) (n = 33). Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients, the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased in 95 (67.9 %), 91 (65.0 %), and 8 (5.7 %) patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG. Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with IL-6 > 32.1 pg/mL or CRP > 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications. CONCLUSION: The serum levels of IL-6 and CRP can effectively assess disease severity and predict outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Fang; Li, Lin; Xu, MengDa; Wu, Juan; Luo, Ding; Zhu, YuSi; Li, BiXi; Song, XiaoYang; Zhou, Xiang",J Clin Virol,70,20

Assessing potential drugs for safety and efficacy enables clinicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions and contributes to overall outbreak control. However, it is difficult to launch clinical trials in the unpredictable environment of an outbreak. We conducted a bibliometric systematic review for the 2009 influenza pandemic to determine the speed and quality of evidence generation for treatments. This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. RESULTS: Thirty-three thousand eight hundred sixty-nine treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. Five hundred ninety-two patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results was available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. CONCLUSION: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture. The result was a reliance on use under compassionate circumstances, resulting in continued uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and harms of anti-viral treatment. Rapid scaling of clinical trials is critical for generating a quality evidence base during pandemics.","Rojek, Amanda M; Martin, Genevieve E; Horby, Peter W",BMC Med,70,33

We summarise the literature on the performance of different rapid tests for exertional desaturation and draw on this evidence base to provide guidance in the context of acute Covid-19. MAIN RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia at home or in an ambulatory setting in the context of Covid-19 and to what extent have they been validated? 2. What exercise tests have been used to assess exertional hypoxia in other lung conditions, to what extent have they been validated and what is the applicability of these studies to acute Covid-19? METHOD: AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE MEDLINE, Cochrane and PubMed using LitCovid, Scholar and Google databases were searched to September 2020. Studies where participants had Covid-19 or another lung disease and underwent any form of exercise test which was compared to a reference standard were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS 2. A protocol for the review was published on the Medrxiv database. RESULTS: Of 47 relevant papers, 15 were empirical studies, of which 11 described an attempt to validate one or more exercise desaturation tests in lung diseases other than Covid-19. In all but one of these, methodological quality was poor or impossible to fully assess. None had been designed as a formal validation study (most used simple tests of correlation). Only one validation study (comparing a 1-min sit-to-stand test [1MSTST] with reference to the 6-min walk test [6MWT] in 107 patients with interstitial lung disease) contained sufficient raw data for us to calculate the sensitivity (88%), specificity (81%) and positive and negative predictive value (79% and 89% respectively) of the 1MSTST. The other 4 empirical studies included two predictive studies on patients with Covid-19, and two on HIV-positive patients with suspected pneumocystis pneumonia. We found no studies on the 40-step walk test (a less demanding test that is widely used in clinical practice to assess Covid-19 patients). Heterogeneity of study design precluded meta-analysis. DISCUSSION: Exertional desaturation tests have not yet been validated in patients with (or suspected of having) Covid-19. A stronger evidence base exists for the diagnostic accuracy of the 1MSTST in chronic long-term pulmonary disease; the relative intensity of this test may raise safety concerns in remote consultations or unstable patients. The less strenuous 40-step walk test should be urgently evaluated.","Kalin, Asli; Javid, Babak; Knight, Matthew; Inada-Kim, Matt; Greenhalgh, Trisha",Syst Rev,70,10

Other potential risk factors include lack of exposure to sunlight, darker skin pigmentation, co-morbidities, poor diet, certain medications, disadvantaged social and economic status, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol. A key question is to understand how and why certain groups of people are more susceptible to COVID-19, whether they have weakened immune systems and what the roles of good nutrition and specific micronutrients are in supporting immune functions. A varied and balanced diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables and the essential nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin A, B vitamins (folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12), vitamin C and the minerals, Fe, Cu, Se and Zn are all known to contribute to the normal functions of the immune system. Avoidance of deficiencies and identification of suboptimal intakes of these micronutrients in targeted groups of patients and in distinct and highly sensitive populations could help to strengthen the resilience of people to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to highlight evidence-based public health messages, to prevent false and misleading claims about the benefits of foods and food supplements and to communicate clearly that the extent of knowledge between micronutrients and COVID-19 infection is still being explored and that no diet will prevent or cure COVID-19 infection. Frequent handwashing and social distancing will be critical to reduce transmission.","Richardson, David P; Lovegrove, Julie A",Br J Nutr,70,24

Given its mild initial symptoms, T2DM is often diagnosed several years after its onset, leaving half of diabetic individuals undiagnosed. While several classical clinical and genetic biomarkers have been identified, improving early diagnosis by exploring other kinds of omics data remains crucial. In this study, we have combined longitudinal data from two population-based cohorts CoLaus and DESIR (comprising in total 493 incident cases vs. 1360 controls) to identify new or confirm previously implicated metabolomic biomarkers predicting T2DM incidence more than 5 years ahead of clinical diagnosis. Our longitudinal data have shown robust evidence for valine, leucine, carnitine and glutamic acid being predictive of future conversion to T2DM. We confirmed the causality of such association for leucine by 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on independent data. Our MR approach further identified new metabolites potentially playing a causal role on T2D, including betaine, lysine and mannose. Interestingly, for valine and leucine a strong reverse causal effect was detected, indicating that the genetic predisposition to T2DM may trigger early changes of these metabolites, which appear well-before any clinical symptoms. In addition, our study revealed a reverse causal effect of metabolites such as glutamic acid and alanine. Collectively, these findings indicate that molecular traits linked to the genetic basis of T2DM may be particularly promising early biomarkers.","Porcu, Eleonora; Gilardi, Federica; Darrous, Liza; Yengo, Loic; Bararpour, Nasim; Gasser, Marie; Marques-Vidal, Pedro; Froguel, Philippe; Waeber, Gerard; Thomas, Aurelien; Kutalik, Zoltán",Sci Rep,70,2

While there is broad agreement that travel restrictions and social distancing are beneficial in limiting spread, recommendations around face mask use are inconsistent. Here, we use mathematical modeling to examine the epidemiological impact of face masks, considering resource limitations and a range of supply and demand dynamics. Even with a limited protective effect, face masks can reduce total infections and deaths, and can delay the peak time of the epidemic. However, random distribution of masks is generally suboptimal; prioritized coverage of the elderly improves outcomes, while retaining resources for detected cases provides further mitigation under a range of scenarios. Face mask use, particularly for a pathogen with relatively common asymptomatic carriage, is an effective intervention strategy, while optimized distribution is important when resources are limited.","Worby, Colin J; Chang, Hsiao-Han",Nat Commun,70,16

METHODS: The irradiance levels (mW/cm2) of 26 LED LCUs from general dental practices and 207 LED LCUs from two dental hospitals were measured using a digital radiometer (Blue Phase II, Ivoclar, Vivadent, Amherst, NY). Ten LED light guide tips (Satelec Mini, Acteon, Merignac, France) were selected to evaluate the effect of chipping, contamination (tip debris), and use of protective sleeves and tips to sensor distance on irradiance (mW/cm2) using a MARC Resin Calibrator (Blue Light Analytics, Halifax, Canada). Homogeneity of the light output was evaluated using a laser beam profiler (SP620; Ophir-Spiricon, North Longan, UT, USA). Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey test (&#945;=0.05) and linear regression with stepwise correlation tests. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the LCUs delivered irradiance output less than 500 mW/cm2. The condition of the light curing tips was poor, with 16% contaminated with resin debris, 26% damaged, and 10% both contaminated and damaged. The irradiance output was significantly reduced in contaminated (62%) and chipped (50%) light curing tips and when using protective sleeves (24%) (p<0.05). Irradiance was also reduced when increasing the distance with 25% and 34% reduction at 7 mm and 10 mm, respectively (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: There remains a lack of awareness of the need for regular monitoring and maintenance of dental LCUs. Damaged and contaminated light curing tips, use of protective sleeves, and increasing the distance from the restoration significantly reduced the irradiance output and the performance of the LCUs.","Altaie, A; Hadis, M A; Wilson, V; German, M J; Nattress, B R; Wood, D; Palin, W M",Oper.

All countries launched preventive measures such as quarantine, lockdown, and physical distancing to control the disease spread. These restrictions might effect on daily life and mental health. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at the Treatment Center. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was carried out at Hmawbi COVID-19 Treatment Center, Myanmar from December 2020 to January 2021. A total of 142 patients with COVID-19 who met the criteria were invited to participate in the study. A pre-tested Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used as a tool for depressive symptoms assessment. Data were analyzed by using binary logistic regression to identify associated factors of depressive symptoms. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed to determine the level of significance with a p < 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with COVID-19 was 38.7%, with the means (± standard deviation, SD) subscale of somatic symptom, negative effect, and anhedonia were 4.64 (±2.53), 2.51 (± 2.12), and 5.01 (± 3.26), respectively. The patients with 40 years and older (AOR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.36-6.59), < 4 of household size (AOR: 3.45, 95% CI: 1.46-8.15), &#8804; 400,000 kyats of monthly family income (AOR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.02-5.54) and infection to family members (AOR: 4.18, 95% CI: 1.74-10.07) were significant associated factors of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of depressive symptoms, approximately 40%, was found in patients with COVID-19 in the Treatment Center.

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",Encephale,70,32

Because of the lockdown measures taken to limit the virus spread in Italy, in-person teaching and learning have been interrupted in all health care disciplines and readapted in virtual formulae. METHODS: As academic ophthalmology departments, we had to maintain the educational needs of medical and orthoptic students, internships, surgical training of residents, as well as to cover the scientific update of health care personnel (HCPs), and the continuation of research and academic activities. To assure these needs we ideated an educational strategy and a team, which was then translated on a multichannel virtual platform created with Microsoft Teams. RESULTS: In this platform there were 21 channels organized in a public view mode, open to all Team members, or in private view mode to separate non-permanent HCPs, internships, residents, and students' tasks, from permanent HCPs tasks. Virtual channels were dedicated to provide theoretical lessons, clinical cases, surgical video, internal meetings and webinar, to offer news from scientific societies, requests of appointments from biomedical companies, links with ophthalmological websites, to move forward research projects, to participate at institutional academic duties, and to obtain feedbacks from users. Residents continued their training on surgery using a surgical simulator, after consulting an agenda uploaded into the dedicated virtual channel. CONCLUSION: These positive initial results should represent a boost to rapidly proceed with the development of even more versatile virtual learning solutions, given that the forecasts for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic are not encouraging.","Gallenga, Carla Enrica; Agnifili, Luca; D039,; Aloisio, Rossella; Brescia, Lorenza; Toto, Lisa; Perri, Paolo",Eur J Ophthalmol,70,23

In this study, web-based traffic information covering the Greater Taipei Area was obtained using a vision-based traffic analysis system. Web-based traffic data were normalized and applied to the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to study the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality in the Greater Taipei Area. According to an analysis of the obtained traffic data, sedans were the most common vehicles in the Greater Taipei Area, followed by motorcycles. Moderate traffic conditions with an average speed of 30-50 km/h were most prominent during weekdays, whereas traffic flow with an average speed of 50-70 km/h was most common during weekends. The proportion of traffic flows in free-flow conditions (>70 km/h) was higher on weekends than on weekdays. Two peaks of traffic flow were observed during the morning and afternoon peak hours on weekdays. On the weekends, this morning peak was not observed, and the variation in vehicle numbers was lower than on weekdays. The simulation results suggested that the addition of real-time traffic data improved the CMAQ model's performance, especially for the carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. According to sensitivity tests for total and vehicle emissions in the Greater Taipei Area, vehicle emissions contributed to >90% of CO, 80% of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and approximately 50% of PM2.5 in the downtown areas of Taipei. The vehicle emissions contribution was affected by both vehicle emissions and meteorological conditions. The connection between the surveillance camera data, vehicle emissions, and regional air quality models in this study can also be used to explore the impact of special events (e.g., long weekends and COVID-19 lockdowns) on air quality.","Tsai, I-Chun; Lee, Chen-Ying; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice; Su, Chih-Wen",Sci Total Environ,70,16

The drying behavior of thin-film dewatered sewage sludge was investigated based on a conductive dryer assisted with mechanical compression at hot wall temperatures of 120-210 °C. The heat and mass transfer behavior of the sludge in the conductive drying process alone was compared to those in the mechanical compression assisted conductive drying process at three external mechanical loads of 25, 100, and 200 kPa. The average drying rates with mechanical compression were higher than those without mechanical load and were enhanced with the increase of mechanical loads at 210 °C. The extrusion of interfacial vapor film and the reduction of sludge surface roughness was responsible for the enhanced interfacial heat transfer efficiency under mechanical compression. The effective moisture diffusivity, mass transfer coefficient, and effective thermal conductivity were enhanced by mechanical compression. The improved moisture transfer inside sludge and on the open surface, and the decreased heat transfer resistance of sludge was due to the generated pressure-driven flow and the reduced gas cavities in sludge, resulting in the higher drying rates. Additionally, this finding provided reference data for developing a new sludge drying method.","Ma, Dexiao; Li, Aimin; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Dong; Ji, Guozhao",Waste Manag,70,23

No national guidelines for PPSV23 have been developed. We analyzed PPSV23 coverage and utilization in Hangzhou to determine patterns of PPSV23 use and the occurrence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in Hangzhou. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals over 2 years of age in Hangzhou were included. Vaccination data during 2006-2017 was retrieved from Hangzhou's Immunization Information System (HZIIS). We used descriptive epidemiological methods to determine PPSV23 usage patterns and AEFI occurrence. RESULTS: In 2017, there were 9,027,973 persons above 2 years of age with the coverage of PPSV23 of 2.98%. The coverage of PPSV23 among elders ranged from 0.17% to 0.69%, and the overall coverage was higher in urban areas (3.70%) than in rural (3.34%) and suburban areas (2.16%). 93.45% of 268957 recipients were vaccinated with PPSV23 at 2-4 years of age. 394 AEFI of PPSV23 cases were reported to the Chinese national adverse event following immunization information system (CNAEFIS) during 2008-2017, with the reporting rate of 140.39 per 100,000 doses. CONCLUSION: Persons in Hangzhou had overall low PPSV23 vaccination coverage especially for adults. Most of PPSV23 were used in children, while the proportion of the old population over 60 years slightly increased over year. PPSV23 was safe with a low reported AEFI rate, which was a little higher for children than for the elderly (over 60 years).","Liu, Yan; Xu, Yuyang; Wang, Jun; Che, Xinren; Gu, Wenwen; Du, Jian; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Xuechao; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Junfang; An, Zhijie",Hum Vaccin Immunother,70,26

We aimed to analyse characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Brazil, and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on health-care resources and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of all patients aged 20 years or older with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe, a nationwide surveillance database in Brazil, between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 8-33). We also examined the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across three 4-week periods within this timeframe (epidemiological weeks 8-12, 19-22, and 27-30). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We compared the regional burden of hospital admissions stratified by age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and respiratory support. We analysed data from the whole country and its five regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. FINDINGS: Between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020, 254â288 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe. The mean age of patients was 60 (SD 17) years, 119â657 (47%) of 254â288 were aged younger than 60 years, 143â521 (56%) of 254â243 were male, and 14â979 (16%) of 90â829 had no comorbidities. Case numbers increased across the three 4-week periods studied: by epidemiological weeks 19-22, cases were concentrated in the North, Northeast, and Southeast; by weeks 27-30, cases had spread to the Central-West and South regions. 232â036 (91%) of 254â288 patients had a defined hospital outcome when the data were exported; in-hospital mortality was 38% (87â515 of 232â036 patients) overall, 59% (47â002 of 79â687) among patients admitted to the ICU, and 80% (36â046 of 45â205) among those who were mechanically ventilated. The overall burden of ICU admissions per ICU beds was more pronounced in the North, Southeast, and Northeast, than in the Central-West and South. In the Northeast, 1545 (16%) of 9960 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU compared with 431 (8%) of 5388 in the South. In-hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 years was 31% (4204 of 13â468) in the Northeast versus 15% (1694 of 11â196) in the South. INTERPRETATION: We observed a widespread distribution of COVID-19 across all regions in Brazil, resulting in a high overall disease burden. In-hospital mortality was high, even in patients younger than 60 years, and worsened by existing regional disparities within the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to improve access to high-quality care for critically ill patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, particularly in LMICs.

The disease-causing agent (Sars-CoV-2) has a binding structure to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, enabling entry into cells that express ACE2, such as the pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. However, studies also indicate the possibility of damage to renal cells, since these cells express high levels of ACE2. Currently, there is no evidence to indicate a specific treatment for covid-19. Several drugs have been used, and some of them may have their excretion process altered in patients with abnormal kidney function.

It is particularly useful for employers to know how many employees have already contracted the infection and for how many people are still at risk of the coronavirus infection. For this purpose, it is appropriate to examine IgG antibodies. However, the testing strategy is different at present - antigen testing is mandatory to look for infectious individuals, regardless of human immunity. The aim of the pilot study was to determine the number of immune individuals after infection at three clinics of GENNET s.r.o. At the same time, unvaccinated individuals who had not had COVID-19 or had undergone it more than three months ago were tested with antigen tests. The cohort included 297 subjects, of whom 182 were not vaccinated (61.3 %) and 115 subjects (38.7 %) were after the vaccination. Of the unvaccinated, 71 people had in the past a positive PCR test (39 %), another 18 people had positive IgG antibodies without infection (9.9 %) and 38 people (20.9 %) had negative IgG antibodies. So far, 55 persons (30.2 %) have not been examined. If we add people vaccinated and people with antibodies, then 74.3 % of employees of the GENNET Archa clinic, 68 % of employees from the GENNET Kostelní clinic and 58.1 % from the GENNET Liberec clinic were immune to infection. 153 individuals on average (60 of whom had antibodies) were tested for the antigen test in four rounds. The infection was detected in two people. Both belonged to the group without tested antibodies. No person with antibodies was tested positive for antigen. People who have antibodies after vaccination or infection are substantially less prone to infection and have a low risk of continuing to spread the virus. By examining antibodies, employers will gain a better overview of the situation in the workplace. Based on our study, we recommend including antibody testing into antiepidemic measures and limit antigen testing to seronegative individuals.","Krátká, Z.; Sedláčková, L.; Luxová, Š Hrubá D.; Katina, S.",Cas Lek Cesk,70,1

While actual case numbers appear vague, mortality numbers related to COVID-19 seem more precise. In this study, we used the mortality rate as the main indicator to evaluate the extent of underreporting and underdetection of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We have analyzed all available data provided by the World Health Organization on the development of international COVID-19 cases and mortality numbers on March 17th, 2020. A crude case-fatality risk (cCFR) and adjusted case-fatality risk (aCFR) was calculated for China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran and the United States. Additionally, a fold-change (FC) was derived for each country. RESULTS: The highest aCFR and FC were detected for Spain. Based on their FC values, an extremely high number of undetected COVID-19 cases was displayed in France, the United States, Italy and Spain. For these countries, our findings indicate a detection rate of only 1-2% of total actual COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Due to limited testing capacities, mortality numbers may serve as a better indicator for COVID-19 case spread in many countries. Our data indicate that countries like France, Italy, the United States, Iran and Spain have extremely high numbers of undetected and underreported cases. Differences in testing availability and capacity, containment as well as overall health care and medical infrastructure result in significantly different mortality rates and COVID-19 case numbers for each respective country.","Lau, H; Khosrawipour, T; Kocbach, P; Ichii, H; Bania, J; Khosrawipour, V","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",70,16

We present fastv as an ultra-fast tool to detect microbial sequences present in sequencing data, identify target microorganisms and visualize coverage of microbial genomes. This tool is based on the k-mer mapping and extension method. K-mer sets are generated by UniqueKMER, another tool provided in this toolset. UniqueKMER can generate complete sets of unique k-mers for each genome within a large set of viral or microbial genomes. For convenience, unique k-mers for microorganisms and common viruses that afflict humans have been generated and are provided with the tools. As a lightweight tool, fastv accepts FASTQ data as input and directly outputs the results in both HTML and JSON formats. Prior to the k-mer analysis, fastv automatically performs adapter trimming, quality pruning, base correction and other preprocessing to ensure the accuracy of k-mer analysis. Specifically, fastv provides built-in support for rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) identification and typing. Experimental results showed that fastv achieved 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 from sequencing data; and can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and other coronaviruses.

While the search for an effective antiviral is still ongoing, experimental therapies based on repurposing of available antivirals is being attempted, of which HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have gained considerable interest. Inhibition profiling of the PIs directly against the viral protease has never been attempted in vitro, and while few studies reported an efficacy of lopinavir and ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2 context, the mechanism of action of the drugs remains to be validated. METHODS: We carried out an in-depth analysis of the efficacy of HIV PIs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) in cell culture and in vitro enzymatic assays, using a methodology that enabled us to focus solely on any potential inhibitory effects of the inhibitors against the viral protease. For cell culture experiments a dark-to-bright GFP reporter substrate system was designed. RESULTS: Lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, saquinavir, and atazanavir were able to inhibit the viral protease in cell culture, albeit in concentrations much higher than their achievable plasma levels, given their current drug formulations. While inhibition by lopinavir was attributed to its cytotoxicity, ritonavir was the most effective of the panel, with IC50 of 13.7 µM. None of the inhibitors showed significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in our in vitro enzymatic assays up to 100 µM concentration. CONCLUSION: Targeting of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by some of the HIV PIs might be of limited clinical potential, given the high concentration of the drugs required to achieve significant inhibition. Therefore, given their weak inhibition of the viral protease, any potential beneficial effect of the PIs in COVID-19 context might perhaps be attributed to acting on other molecular target(s), rather than SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Mahdi, Mohamed; Mótyán, János András; Szojka, Zsófia Ilona; Golda, Mária; Miczi, Márió; Tozsér, József",Virol J,70,1

The current study was aimed at analysing the genetic sequence of this highly contagious corona virus from an evolutionary perspective, comparing the genetic variation features of different geographic strains, and identifying the key miRNAs as well as their gene targets from the transcriptome data of infected lung tissues. METHODS: A multilevel robust computational analysis was undertaken for viral genetic sequence alignment, phylogram construction, genome-wide transcriptome data interpretation of virus-infected lung tissues, miRNA mapping, and functional biology networking. RESULTS: Our findings show both genetic similarities as well as notable differences in the S protein length among SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS viruses. All SARS-CoV-2 strains showed a high genetic similarity with the parent Wuhan strain, but Saudi Arabian, South African, USA, Russia and New Zealand strains carry 3 additional genetic variations like P333L (RNA -dependant RNA polymerase), D614G (spike), and P4715L (ORF1ab). The infected lung tissues demonstrated the upregulation of 282 (56.51%) antiviral defensive response pathway genes and downregulation of 217 (43.48%) genes involved in autophagy and lung repair pathways. By miRNA mapping, 4 key miRNAs (hsa-miR-342-5p, hsa-miR-432-5p, hsa-miR-98-5p and hsa-miR-17-5p), targeting multiple host genes (MYC, IL6, ICAM1 and VEGFA) as well as SARS-CoV2 gene (ORF1ab) were identified. CONCLUSION: Systems biology methods offer a new perspective in understanding the molecular basis for the faster spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We compared it to a DenseNet201. To evaluate generalization, we tested the DNNs with an external dataset (from distinct localities) and used Bayesian inference to estimate the probability distributions of performance metrics, like F1-Score. Our proposed DNN achieved 0.917 AUC on the external test dataset, and the DenseNet, 0.906.

Prior studies suggest SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present in peripheral blood 10 months after infection. Further analysis of the function, durability, and diversity of the cellular response long after natural infection, over a wider range of ages and disease phenotypes, is needed to further identify preventative and therapeutic interventions. MethodsWe identified participants in our multi-site longitudinal, prospective cohort study 12-months post SARS-CoV-2 infection representing a range of disease severity. We investigated the function, phenotypes, and frequency of T cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 using intracellular cytokine staining and spectral flow cytometry. In parallel, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was compared. ResultsSARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and T cells were detected at 12-months post-infection. Severity of acute illness was associated with higher frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells and antibodies at 12-months.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional research. METHODS: Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 151). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D tool. More precisely, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used to quantify problems in five health dimensions (i.e. mobility, self-care, usually activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) was used to record the according self-rated health status. Explanatory variables include sex, age, education, marital status, country of origin, health insurance, and chronic alcohol consumption. RESULTS: With regard to HRQoL, most frequently, problems were reported as pain/discomfort (47.3%), followed by anxiety/depression (32.4%), mobility (29.7%), usual activities (20.7%) and self-care (4.6%). The mean EQ-VAS score was 75.34 (SD 22.23; range 1-100), and the mean EQ-5D-5L index was 0.84 (SD 0.23; range 0.32-1). Regressions showed increasing problems in mobility and self-care with higher age, whereas EQ-VAS was positively associated with younger age. Furthermore, EQ-5D-5L index was positively associated with younger age and higher education. Summarized, among this cohort, a higher age is associated with a lower HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Remarkably high EQ-VAS values and rather few problems in the five dimensions investigated here were reported among the homeless individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic particularly compared with the general population. Moreover, study findings particularly stress the link between higher age and lower HRQoL among homeless individuals. This knowledge is important to address homeless individuals at risk of poor HRQoL. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm the given findings.","van Rüth, V; König, H-H; Bertram, F; Schmiedel, P; Ondruschka, B; Püschel, K; Heinrich, F; Hajek, A",Public Health,70,6

Various laboratory tests can identify the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 in specimens, or specific anti-viral antibodies in blood/serum. Due to the current pandemic situation, a development of point-of-care diagnostics (POCD) allows us to substantially accelerate taking clinical decisions and implement strategic planning at the national level of preventative measures.

Many of the drugs that are currently in (pre)clinical development are addressing late symptoms of the disease. This review focuses on potential pharmacologic intervention at an early stage of infection which could result in less-infected individuals and less cases with severe COVID-19 disease due to reduced virus entry into the cells. METHOD: We scanned the literature for evidence on drugs that target the virus entry machinery into host cells and consist mainly of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as well as other cellular molecules regulating ACE2 expression, such as ADAM-17 and calmodulin. RESULTS: Several drugs/drug classes have been identified. Most of them are already used clinically for other indications. They include recombinant soluble ACE2, indirect ACE2 modulators (angiotensin receptor blockers, calmodulin antagonists, selective oestrogen receptor modifiers), TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat mesylate, nafamostat mesylate, antiandrogens, inhaled corticosteroids) and ADAM-17 enhancers (5-fluorouracil). CONCLUSION: Several agents have potential for prophylactic and therapeutic intervention at the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease and they should be urgently investigated further in appropriate preclinical models and clinical studies.","Ragia, Georgia; Manolopoulos, Vangelis G",Eur J Clin Pharmacol,70,26

As we used microelectrode recording to guide the RF thalamotomy, we could also study for the first time the electrophysiological properties of previously sonicated thalamic neurons bordering the MRgFUS-induced cavity. These neurons displayed electrophysiological characteristics identical to those recorded from nonsonicated thalamic cells in ET patients.

Reply,13.850515,9.213792,2021,"BACKGROUND: Though SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been documented in occupational settings and in-person essential work has been suspected as a risk factor for COVID-19, occupational differences in excess mortality have, to date, not been examined. Such information could point to opportunities for intervention, such as vaccine prioritization or regulations to enforce safer work environments. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using autoregressive integrated moving average models and California Department of Public Health data representing 356,188 decedents 18-65 years of age who died between January 1, 2016 and November 30, 2020, we estimated pandemic-related excess mortality by occupational sector and occupation, with additional stratification of the sector analysis by race/ethnicity. During these first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, working-age adults experienced 11,628 more deaths than expected, corresponding to 22% relative excess and 46 excess deaths per 100,000 living individuals. Sectors with the highest relative and per-capita excess mortality were food/agriculture (39% relative excess; 75 excess deaths per 100,000), transportation/logistics (31%; 91 per 100,000), manufacturing (24%; 61 per 100,000), and facilities (23%; 83 per 100,000). Across racial and ethnic groups, Latino working-age Californians experienced the highest relative excess mortality (37%) with the highest excess mortality among Latino workers in food and agriculture (59%; 97 per 100,000). Black working-age Californians had the highest per-capita excess mortality (110 per 100,000), with relative excess mortality highest among transportation/logistics workers (36%). Asian working-age Californians had lower excess mortality overall, but notable relative excess mortality among health/emergency workers (37%), while White Californians had high per-capita excess deaths among facilities workers (70 per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: Certain occupational sectors are associated with high excess mortality during the pandemic, particularly among racial and ethnic groups also disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In-person essential work is a likely venue of transmission of coronavirus infection and must be addressed through vaccination and strict enforcement of health orders in workplace settings.","Chen, Yea-Hung; Glymour, Maria; Riley, Alicia; Balmes, John; Duchowny, Kate; Harrison, Robert; Matthay, Ellicott; Bibbins-Domingo, Kirsten",PLoS One,70,23

Specific prevention of coronavirus infection,14.197579,9.211703,2020,"PURPOSE: To confirm the ocular tropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by evaluating the expression of viral entry factors in human ocular tissues using immunohistochemistry. METHODS: Fresh donor corneas and primary explant cultures of corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells were evaluated for the expression of viral entry factors. Using immunohistochemistry, the samples were tested for the expression of angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), DC-SIGN-related protein (DC-SIGNR), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). RESULTS: In total, 5 donor corneas were evaluated for the expression of viral entry factors. In all specimens, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed throughout the surface epithelium (corneal, limbal, and conjunctival) and corneal endothelium. In corneal stromal cells, ACE2 was sporadically expressed, whereas TMPRSS2 was absent. DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR expression varied between donor specimens. Four specimens expressed DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR in a similar distribution to ACE2, but 1 specimen from a young donor showed no expression of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR. ACE2, TMPRSS2, and DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR were all expressed in the cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Both corneal and conjunctival epithelia express ACE2, DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR, and TMPRSS2, suggesting that the ocular surface is a potential route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The risk of viral transmission with corneal transplantation cannot be ruled out, given the presence of ACE2 in corneal epithelium and endothelium. Cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells mimic the expression of viral entry factors in fresh donor tissue and may be useful for future in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection studies.","Roehrich, Heidi; Yuan, Ching; Hou, Joshua H",Cornea,70,16

Loco-regional recurrence remains the predominant pattern of failure mandating adequate local therapy for acceptable loco-regional control and survival. There is high-quality evidence that intensification of treatment by either by adding concurrent chemotherapy or by altering radiotherapy (RT) fractionation improves outcomes in the curative-intent management of loco-regionally advanced HNSCC. Even conservative estimates indicate that >50% of patients in LMIC are unlikely to get access to timely RT, which will only get compounded with the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. The radiation oncology community has been systematically testing altered fractionation schedules in several solid cancers (breast, lung, and head-neck), given the cost-effectiveness, convenience, and compliance to short-course RT regimens. Radiobiological modelling suggests that standard fractionation of 6-7 weeks in HNSCC can be compressed safely into a 4-week schedule to counter accelerated repopulation by increasing the dose per fraction and delivering 5 fractions per week which is currently being tested in the ongoing multicentric trial of hypo- vs normo-fractionated accelerated RT (HYPNO study). Herein, we discuss the radiobiological basis of curative-intent hypofractionated-accelerated RT schedule delivering 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks in HNSCC followed by critical appraisal of the published literature on such regimens with concurrent systemic therapy and its inherent resource-sparing potential applicable across large parts of the world particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Gupta, Tejpal; Ghosh-Laskar, Sarbani; Agarwal, Jai Prakash",Oral Oncol,70,16

The fusion peptide (FP), a short peptide segment in the spike protein, plays a central role in the initial penetration of the virus into the host cell membrane, followed by the fusion of the two membranes. Here, we use an array of molecular dynamics simulations that take advantage of the highly mobile membrane mimetic model to investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV2 FP with a lipid bilayer representing mammalian cellular membranes at an atomic level and to characterize the membrane-bound form of the peptide. Six independent systems were generated by changing the initial positioning and orientation of the FP with respect to the membrane, and each system was simulated in five independent replicas, each for 300 ns. In 73% of the simulations, the FP reaches a stable, membrane-bound configuration, in which the peptide deeply penetrated into the membrane. Clustering of the results reveals three major membrane-binding modes (binding modes 1-3), in which binding mode 1 populates over half of the data points. Taking into account the sequence conservation among the viral FPs and the results of mutagenesis studies establishing the role of specific residues in the helical portion of the FP in membrane association, the significant depth of penetration of the whole peptide, and the dense population of the respective cluster, we propose that the most deeply inserted membrane-bound form (binding mode 1) represents more closely the biologically relevant form. Analysis of FP-lipid interactions shows the involvement of specific residues, previously described as the ""fusion-active core residues,"" in membrane binding. Taken together, the results shed light on a key step involved in SARS-CoV2 infection, with potential implications in designing novel inhibitors.","Gorgun, Defne; Lihan, Muyun; Kapoor, Karan; Tajkhorshid, Emad",Biophys. j,70,1

Achieving herd immunity by disease spread and vaccination may result in 2 million to 4 million total US deaths. The future perfect of the vaccine should not be the enemy of the present good, which is masking. Masking, especially when combined with social distancing, crowd avoidance, frequent hand and face washing, increased testing capabilities, and contact tracing, is likely to prevent at least as many premature deaths as the widespread utilization of an effective and safe vaccine. Worldwide, masking is the oldest and simplest engineered control to prevent transmission of respiratory pathogens. Masking has been a cornerstone of infection control in hospitals, operating rooms, and clinics for more than a century. Unfortunately, since the epidemic began in the United States, masking has become politicized. All countries, but especially the United States, must adopt masking as an urgent necessity and a component of coordinated public health strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Any economic advantages of pandemic politics are short-lived and shortsighted in comparison with public health strategies of proven benefit that can prevent needless and mostly avoidable premature deaths from COVID-19. During the worst epidemic in more than 100 years, most Americans (75%) trust their health care providers. As competent and compassionate health care professionals, we recommend that effective strategies, especially masking, and not pandemic politics, should inform all rational clinical and public health decision-making.","Maki, D.

Survey items were analyzed via descriptive statistics by question. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 40.8% (n = 223) with the majority of respondents in an attending-level role. We observed that musculoskeletal components of the exam were rated as the most reliable components of a telemedicine exam and 86.5% of survey respondents reported engaging the patient or patient caregiver to help conduct the virtual exam. However, 65.7% of providers reported not being able to elicit the information needed from a telemedicine visit to make a complete clinical assessment. We also noted areas of disagreement regarding areas of patient engagement and confidentiality. We found that approximately one-third (35.8%) of those surveyed felt that their level of burnout was increased due to telemedicine. CONCLUSION: In general, providers found exam reliability (specifically around focused musculoskeletal elements) in telemedicine visits but overall felt that they were unable to generate the information needed to generate a complete clinical assessment.

CoV infections present mainly as respiratory infections that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, CoVs, such as COVID-19, also present as a hyperactivation of the inflammatory response that results in increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1ß and its downstream molecule IL-6. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex involved in the activation of caspase-1 that leads to the activation of IL-1ß in a variety of diseases and infections such as CoV infection and in different tissues such as lungs, brain, intestines and kidneys, all of which have been shown to be affected in COVID-19 patients. Here we review the literature regarding the mechanism of inflammasome activation by CoV infection, the role of the inflammasome in ARDS, ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) as well as the potential mechanism by which the inflammasome may contribute to the damaging effects of inflammation in the cardiac, renal, digestive, and nervous systems in COVID-19 patients.","de Rivero Vaccari, Juan Carlos; Dietrich, W Dalton; Keane, Robert W; de Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo",Front Immunol,70,33

In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (98% versus 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA, and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July to August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R = 0.83, P < 0.0001 and R = 0.87, P < 0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R = 0.76, P = 0.037). On repeat antibody testing 3 months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in geometric median fluorescence intensity of 62% versus 79% (P < 0.01) for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG, respectively. This novel MMIA using DBS could be scalable for rapid and affordable SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance in the United States and globally.","Schultz, Jonathan S; McCarthy, Mary K; Rester, Cody; Sabourin, Katherine R; Annen, Kyle; DomBourian, Melkon; Eisenmesser, Elan; Frazer-Abel, Ashley; Knight, Vijaya; Jaenisch, Thomas; Morrison, Thomas E; Rochford, Rosemary; Kedl, Ross M",J. clin. microbiol,70,20

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with a GI malignancy (ICD10: C15-C26) who received medical care within the health system during the observation period (first 44 weeks of 2019 and 2020) were identified for a retrospective cohort study. Deidentified patient encounter parameters were collected for this observation period and separated into pre-pandemic (weeks 1-10) and early pandemic (weeks 11-20) study periods. Difference-in-difference analyses adjusted for week-specific and year-specific effects quantified the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on care delivery between pre-pandemic and early pandemic study periods in 2020. Across all GI malignancies, the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a significant decline in the number of patients with new patient visits (NPVs) (p = 1.2 × 10-4 ), Radiology encounters (p = 1.9 × 10-7 ), Surgery encounters (p = 1.6 × 10-3 ), Radiation Oncology encounters (p = 4.1 × 10-3 ), and infusion visits (6.1 × 10-5 ). Subgroup analyses revealed cancer-specific variations in changes to delivery. Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) had the most significant decrease in NPVs (p = 7.1 × 10-5 ), which was significantly associated with a concomitant decrease in colonoscopies performed during the early pandemic period (r2 = 0.722, p = 2.1 × 10-10 ). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant disruptions to care delivery. While these effects were appreciated broadly across GI malignancies, CRC, diagnosed and managed by periodic screening, has been affected most acutely.","Perkons, Nicholas R; Kim, Casey; Boedec, Chris; Keele, Luke J; Schneider, Charles; Teitelbaum, Ursina R; Ben-Josef, Edgar; Gabriel, Peter E; Plastaras, John P; Shulman, Lawrence N; Wojcieszynski, Andrzej P",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),70,14

Most governments employ a set of quasi-standard measures to fight COVID-19 including wearing masks, social distancing, virus testing and contact tracing. We argue that some non-trivial factors behind the varying effectiveness of these measures are selfish decision-making and the differing national implementations of the response mechanism. In this paper, through simple games, we show the effect of individual incentives on the decisions made with respect to wearing masks and social distancing, and how these may result in a sub-optimal outcome. We also demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games properly regarding the chosen policies and their influence on the preferred outcome. We promote a mechanism design approach: it is in the best interest of every government to carefully balance social good and response costs when implementing their respective pandemic response mechanism.","Pejo, Balazs; Biczok, Gergely",,70,6

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document the change in diet quality and in food insecurity observed during the COVID-19-related early lockdown. We hypothesized that the lockdown was associated with a deterioration in overall diet quality and an increase in food insecurity. METHODS: Data are from a COVID-19 subsample of NutriQuébec, a web-based cohort destined to study temporal changes in dietary habits among adults in Quebec, Canada. Participants completed questionnaires before (between June 2019 and February 2020) and during (April to May 2020) early lockdown, including a validated web-based 24-h recall (n = 853) and a questionnaire on food security (n = 922). Primary study outcomes were temporal changes in diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and in the prevalence of food insecurity. RESULTS: There was a small increase in the HEI-2015 during the COVID-19 early lockdown compared with baseline (+1.1 points; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.5), mostly due to small improvements in the intakes of whole grains, greens and beans, refined grains, total vegetables, total dairy, seafood and plant proteins, added sugar, and total protein subscores of the HEI-2015. Exploratory analyses suggested that individuals aged 18-29 y (+3.6 points; 95% CI: 2.4, 4.7), participants with lower education (+1.9 points; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.6), or with obesity (+3.8 points; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.8) showed particularly important increases in the HEI-2015. The prevalence of food insecurity was reduced from 3.8% at baseline to 1.0% during the early lockdown (prevalence ratio = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypotheses, diet quality has slightly improved and prevalence of food insecurity was reduced in this sample of adults from Quebec during the COVID-19-related early lockdown. These results may be generalizable only to relatively healthy populations.","Lamarche, Benoît; Brassard, Didier; Lapointe, Annie; Laramée, Catherine; Kearney, Michèle; Côté, Mélina; Bélanger-Gravel, Ariane; Desroches, Sophie; Lemieux, Simone; Plante, Céline",Am. j. clin. nutr,70,16

RESULTS: Compared with 53 COVID-19 patients without HIV infection, the patients with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV coinfection had higher maximum body temperatures (38.7°C vs 37.6°C, P = 0.044), longer duration of fever (8.7 ± 4.5 vs 4.2 ± 2.1 days, P = 0.038), longer time to have improvement of chest CT images (22 vs 15 days from the onset of illness, P = 0.011), lower level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG (5.11 ± 32.33 vs 37.45 ± 15.48 AU/ml, P = 0.042). However, no statistically significant difference of duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the two groups was found (12.3 ± 2.6 vs 13.4 ± 2.4 days, , P = 0.813).

Most striking is the huge difference in risk to dialysis patients and staff across the world. Per-population cases and deaths among dialysis patients vary over 100-fold across participating countries, mirroring burden in the general population. International data indicate case fatality ratio remains at 10-30% among dialysis patients, confirming the gravity of infection, and that cases are much more common among in-center than home dialysis patients. This latter finding merits urgent study because in-center patients often have greater community exposure, and in-center transmission may be uncommon under optimal protocols. Greater telemedicine use is a welcome change here to stay, and our community needs to improve emergency planning and protect dialysis staff from the next pandemic.

Patients were included if receiving HFNC for hypoxemia (saturation pulse oxygen (SpO2) <92% under oxygen â©¾6 L/min) associated with ARDS and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Main clinical characteristics and outcomes are described in patients: (a) with do not intubate order (HFNC-DNIO); (b) who did not need intubation (HFNC-only); and (c) eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation). Medians are presented with (1st-3rd) interquartile range. RESULTS: From 26 February to 30 June 2020, 46 patients of median age 75 (70-79) years were included. In the HFNC-DNIO group (n = 11), partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2) ratio median worst PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 109 (102-172) and hospital mortality was 54.5%. Except the HFNC-DNIO patients (n = 35), 20 patients (57%) were eventually intubated (HFNC-intubation group) and 15 were only treated by HFNC (HFNC-only). HFNC-intubation patients presented higher worst respiratory rates per minute in ICU [37 (34-41) versus 33 (24-34) min, p < 0.05] and worsened ICU admission PaO2/FiO2 ratios [121 (103-169) versus 191 (162-219), p < 0.001] compared with HFNC-only patients. Hospital mortality was 35% (n = 7/20) in HFNC-intubation group, 0% in HFNC-only group with a global mortality of these two groups of 20% (n = 7/35). Among tests performed in healthcare workers, 1/12 PCR in symptomatic healthcare workers and 1.8% serologies in asymptomatic healthcare workers were positive. After review of each case, COVID-19 was likely to be acquired outside hospital. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC seems to be useful for COVID-19-related ARDS and safe for healthcare workers. ARDS severity with PaO2/FiO2 <150 associated with respiratory rate >35/min could be regarded as a predictor of intubation.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Delbove, Agathe; Foubert, Ambroise; Mateos, François; Guy, Tiphaine; Gousseff, Marie",Ther Adv Respir Dis,70,8

We investigated the degree to which adiposity modified the association between dietary inflammatory potential and incident T2DM. Methods: Data from 6,016 US men in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study who completed a 3-day diet record were used. The inflammatory potential of diet was characterized by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and adiposity was assessed with body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage (BF) and waist-to-height ratio. Inverse probability weights were used in modified Poisson regression models to examine whether adiposity modifies the relationship between the DII and T2DM, while accounting for selection bias from participants who were lost to follow-up. Results: There were 336 incident cases of T2DM after a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. DII scores were not significantly associated with T2DM incidence in multivariable models, but point estimates were consistently elevated across increasing DII quartiles compared to the most anti-inflammatory DII quartile. In the model that evaluated BF, the term for overall effect modification was significant (p = 0.02), but there was no evidence of effect modification on the multiplicative and additive scales when examined further. Effect modification was not present for any other adiposity measures. Conclusions: We did not observe evidence that a pro-inflammatory diet, as measured by the DII, is associated with incidence of T2DM, nor evidence that adiposity modifies a potential relationship. Further investigation is needed in larger cohorts with longer follow-up.","Guinter, Mark A; Merchant, Anwar T; Tabung, Fred K; Wirth, Michael D; Shivappa, Nitin; Hurley, Thomas G; Hebert, James R; Sui, Xuemei; Blair, Steven N; Steck, Susan E",,70,29

Social isolation and distancing measures have been the only prevention available for months. Scientific research has done a great deal of work, developing in a few months safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. In the European Union, nowadays, four vaccines have been authorized for use: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca/Oxford), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), and three others are currently under rolling review.Vaccine allocation policy is crucial to optimize the advantage of treatment preferring people with the highest risk of contagion. These days the priority in the vaccination program is of particular importance since it has become clear that the number of vaccines is not sufficient for the entire Italian population in the short term. Cardiovascular diseases are frequently associated with severe COVID-19 infections, leading to the worst prognosis. The elderly population suffering from cardiovascular diseases is, therefore, to be considered a particularly vulnerable population. However, age cannot be considered the only discriminating factor because in the young-adult population suffering from severe forms of heart disease, the prognosis, if affected by COVID-19, is particularly ominous and these patients should have priority access to the vaccination program. The aim of this position paper is to establish a consensus on a priority in the vaccination of COVID-19 among subjects suffering from different cardiovascular diseases.","Indolfi, Ciro; Barillà, Francesco; Basso, Cristina; Ciccone, Marco Matteo; Curcio, Antonio; Mancone, Massimo; Mercuro, Giuseppe; Muscoli, Saverio; Nodari, Savina; Pedrinelli, Roberto; Romeo, Francesco; Sinagra, Gianfranco; Filardi, Pasquale Perrone",G Ital Cardiol (Rome),70,5

Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care. Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the long-term, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.","Smith, Anthony C; Thomas, Emma; Snoswell, Centaine L; Haydon, Helen; Mehrotra, Ateev; Clemensen, Jane; Caffery, Liam J",J Telemed Telecare,70,16

Postextubation respiratory failure causes increased morbidity and mortality. HFNC has been widely employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to report a single-centre experience on the effectiveness and safety of HFNC in weaning COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nine patients showed severe acute respiratory failure and interstitial pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2. After mechanical ventilation (5 Helmet CPAP, 4 invasive mechanical ventilation), they were de-escalated to HFNC. Settings were: 34-37°C, flow from 50 to 60 L min-1. FiO2 was set to achieve appropriate SpO2. RESULTS: Nine patients (4 females; age 63 ± 13.27 years; BMI 27.2 ± 4.27) showed a baseline PaO2/FiO2 of 109 ± 45 mm Hg. After a long course of ventilation all patients improved (PaO2/FiO2 336 ± 72 mm Hg). Immediately after initiation of HFNC (2 hours), PaO2/FiO2 was 254 ± 69.3 mm Hg. Mean ROX index at two hours was 11.17 (range: 7.38-14.4). It was consistent with low risk of HFNC failure. No difference was observed on lactate. After 48 hours of HFNC oxygen therapy (day 3), mean PaO2/FiO2 increased to 396 ± 83.5 mm Hg. All patients recovered from respiratory failure after 7 ± 4.1 days. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC might be helpful in weaning COVID-19 respiratory failure. Effectiveness and comfort should be assessed between 2 and 48 hours. Clinical outcomes, oxygenation, and ROX index should be considered, to rule out the need for intubation. Further evidence is required for firm conclusions.","Simioli, Francesca; Annunziata, Anna; Langella, Gerardo; Polistina, Giorgio E; Martino, Maria; Fiorentino, Giuseppe",Anaesthesiol. Intensive Ther.

We explore these themes by analyzing Twitter reactions to ""calculated ageism"" - a term we use to refer to a political figure's edict that older adults should sacrifice their lives if it will mitigate the pandemic's economic damage to younger people. METHODS: Using thematic analysis, we examine tweets (n=188) responding to Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick's March 23, 2020, statement that encouraged generational self-sacrifice. Themes that emerged included positions of support or opposition and tweeters' critiques. RESULTS: The large majority of tweets - 90 percent - opposed calculated ageism, while only 5 percent supported it and 5 percent conveyed no position. Opposition centered on moral critiques, political-economic critiques, assertions of older adults' worth, and public health arguments. Support centered on individual responsibility and patriotism. DISCUSSION: While prior research reveals ageism to be solidly entrenched in popular culture, our study finds that limits prevail and identifies the reasons underlying them. The most common reasons for opposing calculated ageism center on its immorality and on its privileging of the economic interests of the powerful few over the many, patterns suggesting that the boundaries of ageism are influenced by core beliefs about fairness. They also are shaped by a bedrock conviction that older lives have value. This intergenerational solidarity could be leveraged to reduce ageism during the pandemic and beyond.","Barrett, Anne E; Michael, Cherish; Padavic, Irene",,70,20

Coughs, recorded in a quiet (73$\pm$5 dB) and noisy (34$\pm$17 dB) environment, were used to extract i-vectors, x-vectors and d-vectors, used as features to the classifiers. The system achieves 90.02\% accuracy from an MLP to discriminate 51 coughers using 2-sec long cough segments in the noisy environment. When discriminating between 5 and 14 coughers using longer (100 sec) segments in the quiet environment, this accuracy rises to 99.78\% and 98.39\% respectively.

These coughs were added as an extra class in the Google Speech Commands dataset and features were extracted by preserving the end-to-end time-domain information in an event. The highest accuracy of 88.58\% is achieved in spotting coughs among 35 other trigger phrases using a Resnet50. Wake-cough represents a personalised, non-intrusive, cough monitoring system, which is power efficient as using wake-word detection method can keep a smartphone-based monitoring device mostly dormant. This makes wake-cough extremely attractive in multi-bed ward environments to monitor patient's long-term recovery from lung ailments such as tuberculosis and COVID-19.","Pahar, Madhurananda; Klopper, Marisa; Reeve, Byron; Warren, Rob; Theron, Grant; Diacon, Andreas; Niesler, Thomas",,70,1

Furthermore, no studies investigated the variables that may modulate the efficacy of vaccination. The aim of this analysis was to assess whether there are modifying factors that may potentially influence the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. A quantitative synthesis of data from Phase III trials was performed via pairwise and network meta-analyses, along with meta-regression analysis. Data from Phase III trials are currently available only for AZD1222, BNT162b2, mRNA-1237, and Sputnik V. Vaccination resulted to be generally effective (90.0%, 95%CI 72.6-96.4;p &lt; 0.001), although the efficacy of AZD1222 (62.1%) introduced a significant level of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 92.17%, p &lt; 0.001). No significant modifying factors resulted from the meta-regression analysis. However, considering the mRNA-based vaccines, a trend toward significance (p = 0.081) resulted for age. The network meta-analysis provided the following rank of effectiveness: BNT162b2 mRNA-1273 &gt; Sputnik V &gt;&gt; AZD1222. In conclusion, no modifying factors seem to modulate the efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19. This quantitative synthesis will need to be updated as soon as further clinical results on the efficacy profile are available from Phase III trials for further licensed COVID-19 vaccines.","Calzetta, L.; Ritondo, B.

METHODS: This was a prospective monocentric case-controlled study. Twenty SARS-CoV2-infected patients with OFL were included and compared to 20 age-matched control healthy subjects. All infected patients underwent olfactory function assessment and 3T MRI, performed both at the early stage of the disease and at one-month follow-up. RESULTS: At the early stage, SARS-CoV2-infected patients had a mean olfactory score of 2.8 +/- 2.7 (range 0-8), and MRI displayed a complete obstruction of the OC in 19 out of 20 patients. Controls had normal olfactory scores and no obstruction of the OC on MRI. At one month follow-up, the olfactory score had improved to 8.3 +/- 1.9 (range 4-10) in patients, and only 7 out of 20 patients still had an obstruction of the OC. There was a correlation between olfactory score and obstruction of the OC (p=0.004).

Although SARS-CoV-2 established sustained transmission in Brazil early in the pandemic, important gaps remain in our understanding of local virus transmission dynamics. Here, we describe the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using near-full genomes sampled from 27 Brazilian states and an adjacent country - Paraguay. We show that the early stage of the pandemic in Brazil was characterised by the co-circulation of multiple viral lineages, linked to multiple importations predominantly from Europe, and subsequently characterized by large local transmission clusters. As the epidemic progressed, the absence of effective restriction measures led to the local emergence and international spread of Variants of Concern (VOC) and under monitoring (VUM), including the Gamma (P.1) and Zeta (P.2) variants. In addition, we provide a preliminary genomic overview of the epidemic in Paraguay, showing evidence of importation from Brazil. These data reinforce the need for the implementation of widespread genomic surveillance in South America as a toolkit for pandemic monitoring and providing a means to follow the real-time spread of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with possible implications for public health and immunization strategies.","Giovanetti, Marta; Slavov, Svetoslav Nanev; Fonseca, Vagner; Wilkinson, Eduan; Tegally, Houriiyah; Patane, Jose; Viala, Vincent Louis; San, Emmanuel James; Rodrigues, Evandra Strazza; Santos, Elaine Vieira; Aburjaile, Flavia; Xavier, Joilson; Fritsch, Hegger; Adelino, Talita Emile Ribeiro; Pereira, Felicidade; Leal, Arabela; Iani, Felipe Campos de Melo; Pereira, Glauco de Carvalho; Vazquez, Cynthia; Sanabria, Gladys Mercedes Estigarribia; Oliveira, Elaine Cristina de; Demarchi, Luiz; Croda, Julio; Bezerra, Rafael Dos Santos; Lima, Loyze Paola Oliveira de; Martins, Antonio Jorge; Barros, Claudia Renata dos Santos; Marqueze, Elaine Cristina; Bernardino, Jardelina de Souza Todao; Moretti, Debora Botequio; Brassaloti, Ricardo Augusto; Cassano, Raquel de Lello Rocha Campos; Mariani, Pilar Drummond Sampaio Correa; Kitajima, Joao Paulo; Santos, Bibiana; Siqueira, Rodrigo Proto; Cantarelli, Vlademir Vicente; Tosta, Stephane; Nardy, Vanessa Brandao; Silva, Luciana Reboredo de Oliveira da; Gomez, Marcela Kelly Astete; Lima, Jaqueline Gomes; Ribeiro, Adriana Aparecida; Guimaraes, Natalia Rocha; Watanabe, Luiz Takao; Silva, Luana Barbosa Da; Ferreira, Raquel da Silva; Penha, Mara Patricia F. da; Ortega, Maria Jose; Fuente, Andrea Gomez de la; Villalba, Shirley; Torales, Juan; Gamarra, Maria Liz; Aquino, Carolina; Figueredo, Gloria Patricia Martinez; Fava, Wellington Santos; Castro, Ana Rita C.

METHODS: Up-to-date trials were identiï¬ed by the authors through searches of the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv databases from inception up to September 14, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: According to the observational studies, patients who received CBPs showed a decline in all-cause mortality compared with patients who did not receive CBPs (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.56; p < 0.00001). However, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no difference between the intervention group and the control group regarding all-cause mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57-1.19; p = 0.30). The use of CBPs did not increase the risk of adverse events (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60-1.29; p = 0.51). Using CBPs earlier compared with using CBPs later was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.40; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the outcomes of RCTs, CBPs may not decrease all-cause mortality. Furthermore, compared with later initiation of CBP therapy, earlier initiation of this therapy may decrease the rate of mortality.","Shao, Shuai; Wang, Yishan; Kang, Hanyujie; Tong, Zhaohui",Int J Infect Dis,70,16

No specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently available. Usual palliative treatment includes maintaining hydration and nutrition and controlling fever and cough. The clinical severity and extent of transmission need to be determined, and therapeutic options need to be developed and optimized. METHODS: The present review discusses the recent repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 treatment. RESULTS: Several compounds, including remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, interferon-ß, ribavirin, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and ivermectin, have emerged as promising alternatives. They block the virus from entering host cells, prevent viral replication, and attenuate exacerbation of the host's immune response. CONCLUSION: Although some evidence indicates the positive actions of different classes of compounds for the treatment of COVID-19, few clinical assays have been established to definitively demonstrate their therapeutic value in humans. Multicenter clinical studies are urgently needed to validate and standardize therapeutic regimens that involve these agents. Although science has not yet presented us with a specific drug against COVID-19, the repurposing of drugs appears to be promising in our fight against this devastating disease.","Lovato, Evellyn Claudia Wietzikoski; Barboza, Lorena Neris; Wietzikoski, Samantha; de Souza, Amanda Nascimento Vasques; Auth, Pablo Alvarez; Junior, Arquimedes Gasparotto; Dos Reis Lívero, Francislaine Aparecida",Curr. pharm. des,70,20

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim of assessing the prevalence of rheumatic manifestations in patients affected by COVID-19, as initial symptom or during disease course. METHODS: A database search was run on May 18th, 2020, using two distinct strategies. We were interested in the percentage of symptoms of potential rheumatologic interest observed in large population studies of COVID-19 cases, and in identifying uncommon autoimmune disorders described in patients with COVID-19. For manifestations individually reported, a meta-analysis was performed taking into consideration the proportion of COVID-19 patients presenting the symptom. RESULTS: Eighty eight original articles were included in the systematic review and 51 in the meta-analysis. We found pooled estimates of 19% for muscle pain and 32% for fatigue as initial symptom of COVID-19 presentation and, respectively, of 16 and 36% during the disease course. Only one article discussed arthralgia as unique symptom. Additionally, we found that vasculitis, chilblains, presence of autoantibodies commonly found in patients with rheumatic diseases, or autoimmune haematological and neurological disorders have all been reported in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our review and meta-analysis emphasises that symptoms potentially leading to rheumatologic referral are common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, COVID-19 is a new differential diagnosis to bear in mind when evaluating patients with musculoskeletal symptoms and rheumatologists might play a crucial role in identifying COVID-19 cases in early phases of the illness.","Ciaffi, Jacopo; Meliconi, Riccardo; Ruscitti, Piero; Berardicurti, Onorina; Giacomelli, Roberto; Ursini, Francesco",BMC Rheumatol,70,12

We also contend that the pathogenic analysis of this pandemic needs to be balanced with a salutogenic approach that examines the positive adaptation of people, systems and society, termed COVID-19 resilience. This begs the question: how and why do some older adults and communities adapt and thrive better than others?

This study reviews knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as the characteristics of COVID-19 positive women who delivered in Portugal by 31 of March 2020. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed up to 8 April 2020, using PRISMA standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. Portuguese cases were ascertained by contact with all Portuguese maternities and based on the information provided by their health professionals. Results: We identified 30 original studies reporting 212 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (30 discharged while pregnant), 200 from China and 12 from other countries. The 182 published deliveries resulted in one stillbirth and 185 live births. Four women with severe COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit but no cases of maternal death were reported. There was one neonatal death. Preterm births occurred in 28.7% of cases, but it is unclear whether this was iatrogenic. All cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were negative. Four newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and three newborns had high levels of IgM antibodies. None of the first eight infants born in Portugal tested positive. Breast milk samples from 13 mothers and described in seven studies showed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The evidence related to the effect of COVID-19 on pregnant women is still limited. Pregnant women and newborns should be considered particularly vulnerable populations regarding COVID-19 prevention and management strategies.","Rodrigues, C.; Baia, I.; Domingues, R.; Barros, H.",,70,30

The unparalleled volume of available genetic data presents a unique opportunity to gain real-time insights into the virus transmission during the pandemic, but also a daunting computational hurdle if analysed with gold-standard phylogeographic approaches. To tackle this practical limitation, we here describe and apply a rapid analytical pipeline to analyse the spatio-temporal dispersal history and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineages. As a proof of concept, we focus on the Belgian epidemic, which has had one of the highest spatial densities of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our pipeline has the potential to be quickly applied to other countries or regions, with key benefits in complementing epidemiological analyses in assessing the impact of intervention measures or their progressive easement.","Dellicour, Simon; Durkin, Keith; Hong, Samuel L; Vanmechelen, Bert; Martí-Carreras, Joan; Gill, Mandev S; Meex, Cécile; Bontems, Sébastien; André, Emmanuel; Gilbert, Marius; Walker, Conor; De Maio, Nicola; Faria, Nuno R; Hadfield, James; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; Bours, Vincent; Wawina-Bokalanga, Tony; Artesi, Maria; Baele, Guy; Maes, Piet",Mol Biol Evol,70,16

METHODS: Outpatient and inpatient data from the neurology department were extracted from the electronic medical record system of three tertiary Grade A hospitals in Wenzhou. Data were analyzed across 5 months following the beginning of the pandemic (from January 13 to May 17) and compared with the same period in 2019. Data on reperfusion therapy for acute infarction stroke were extracted monthly from January to April. RESULTS: The number of outpatients declined from 102,300 in 2019 to 75,154 in 2020 (26.54%), while the number of inpatients in the three tertiary Grade A hospitals decreased from 4641 to 3437 (25.94%). The latter trend showed a significant drop from the 3rd week to the 7th week. The number of patients in these hospitals decreased significantly, and a significant drop was seen in the neurology department. As usual, stroke was the most common disease observed; however, anxiety/depression and insomnia increased dramatically in the outpatient consultation department. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study revealed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical practice of neurology in Wenzhou during the outbreak.

The scenario is very grim in India where the daily count on April 15, 2021 itself is double of the first peak. The epidemic evolution there is quite complex due to regional inhomogeneities. In this paper, we characterize the virus spread in the ongoing second wave in India, as well as study the dynamical evolution of epidemic from the beginning of the pandemic. Methods: Variations in the effective reproduction number (Rt) in India are taken as a quantifiable measure of the virus transmissibility and are compared with those of other countries where the second wave is already over. Further, characteristics of COVID-19 spread are analyzed for Indian states by estimating test positivity and case fatality rates. Finally, forecasts and actionable inputs are provided based on mathematical and epidemiological models. Results: Effective reproduction number for almost every state in India has value greater than 1 indicating the presence of the second wave. An exponential fit on recent data indicates that the infection rate is much higher than the first wave however the case fatality rate is lower. Preliminary estimates with the SIR model suggest the peak for the second wave to occur in mid-May 2021 with daily count exceeding 0.35 million. Conclusions: The spread of the second wave is much faster than the first wave. Hence, quick and effective administrative intervention is needed to arrest the rapid growth of the epidemic.","Ranjan, R.; Sharma, A.; Verma, M. K.",,70,16

Targeting the interaction between S1 and ACE2 is a practical strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we show encouraging results indicating that human cathelicidin LL37 can simultaneously block viral S1 and cloak ACE2. LL37 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 with high affinity (11.2 nM) and decreases subsequent recruitment of ACE2. Owing to the RBD blockade, LL37 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.74 μg/mL. Interestingly, LL37 also binds to ACE2 with an affinity of 25.5 nM and cloaks the ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby decreasing S1 adherence and protecting cells against pseudovirion infection in vitro. Intranasal administration of LL37 to C57 mice infected with adenovirus expressing human ACE2 either before or after pseudovirion invasion decreased lung infection. The study identified a versatile antimicrobial peptide in humans as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment using dual mechanisms, thus providing a potential candidate for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and treatment.","Wang, Cheng; Wang, Shaobo; Li, Daixi; Chen, Peiqin; Han, Songling; Zhao, Gaomei; Chen, Yin; Zhao, Jianqi; Xiong, Jiachuan; Qiu, Jingfei; Wei, Dong-Qing; Zhao, Jinghong; Wang, Junping",ACS Infect Dis,70,20

The results presented demonstrate that MHV-4 can selectively block γ-interferon-induced class II antigen expression on cerebral endothelial cells. The blocking effect of class II expression occurs in a strain-dependent manner, and is limited to virus-susceptible mouse strains. Virus replication is not required to obtain the blocking effect since UV-inactivated MHV-4 produces the same result. MHV-4 blocking of γ-interferon-induced class II antigen expression is observed at both the cell surface (flow cytometry) and transcriptional level (Norhtern analysis).","Joseph, Jeymohan; Knobler, Robert L.; Lublin, Fred D.; Hart, M.

The study covered detection of PED virus (PEDV) in fecal and intestinal samples through reverse transcription PCR and sequence analysis of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Results showed that 10 out of 34 fecal and intestinal samples examined were positive for PEDV. The partial nucleotide sequence of the N gene of the field samples showed 98–99% homologous to PEDV sequences registered in the GenBank. It was also noted that N gene sequences between field samples were 98% homologous. Interestingly, the partial sequences of the N genes of the field samples were genetically similar to the PEDV isolates from USA, China, Mexico, Canada and Japan. The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the Philippine samples clustered in group 2–1 of the PEDV, wherein the isolates of this group were responsible for the outbreaks in Asia and the USA. Analysis of the partial nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed polymorphisms, deletions and insertions in the N-gene of the PEDV.

Epidemic simulation using the SIRS model,14.012028,9.157022,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a robust vertical global health programme. The extent to which vertical programmes financially support health security has not been investigated. We, therefore, endeavoured to quantify the extent to which the budgets of this vertical programme support health security. We believe this is a crucial area of work as the global community works to combine resources for COVID-19 response and future pandemic preparedness. METHODS: We examined budgets for work in Kenya, Uganda, Vietnam, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone from January, 2014 to December, 2020. These ten countries were selected because of the robustness of investments and the availability of data. Using the International Health Regulations Joint External Evaluation (JEE) tool as a framework, we mapped budget line items to health security capacities. Two researchers independently reviewed each budget and mapped items to the JEE. Budgets were then jointly reviewed until a consensus was reached regarding if an item supported health security directly, indirectly, or not at all. The budgets for the study countries were inputted into a single Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and line items that mapped to JEE indicators were scaled up to their respective JEE capacity. Descriptive analyses were then done to determine the total amount of money budgeted for activities that support health security, how much was budgeted for each JEE capacity, and how much of the support was direct or indirect. FINDINGS: The research team reviewed 37 budgets. Budgets totalled US$6 927 284 966, and $2 562 063 054 (37·0%) of this mapped to JEE capacities. $1 330 942 712 (19·2%) mapped directly to JEE capacities and $1 231 120 342 (17·8%) mapped indirectly to JEE capacities. Laboratory systems, antimicrobial resistance, and the deployment of medical countermeasures and personnel received the most overall budgetary support; laboratory systems, antimicrobial resistance, and workforce development received the greatest amount of direct budgetary support. INTERPRETATION: Over one-third of the Global Fund's work also supports health security and the organisation has budgeted more than $2 500 000 000 for activities that support health security in ten countries since 2014. Although these funds were not budgeted specifically for health security purposes, recognising how vertical programmes can synergistically support other global health efforts has important implications for policy related to health systems strengthening.

The situation is different in Europe and Australia, where myxomatosis and rabbit hemorrhagic disease are endemic. Advances in epidemiology and virology have led to detection of other lapine viruses that are now recognized as agents of emerging infectious diseases. Rabbit caliciviruses, related to rabbit hemorrhagic disease, are generally avirulent, but lethal variants are being identified in Europe and North America.

We assessed whether delayed surgery improves hip joint function and reduces major complications better than nonoperative therapy. Patients and methods — In this retrospective observational study, we collected data from 24 different hospitals from January 1, 2020, to July 20, 2020. 145 patients with hip fractures aged 65 years or older were eligible. Clinical data was extracted from electronic medical records. The primary outcomes were visual analogue scale (VAS) score and Harris Hip Score. Major complications, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pneumonia within 1 month and 3 months, were collected for further analysis. Results — Of the 145 hip fracture patients 108 (median age 72; 70 females) received delayed surgery and 37 (median age 74; 20 females) received nonoperative therapy. The median time from hip fracture injury to surgery was 33 days (IQR 24–48) in the delayed surgery group. Hypertension, in about half of the patients in both groups, and cerebral infarction, in around a quarter of patients in both groups, were the most common comorbidities. Both VAS score and Harris Hip Score were superior in the delayed surgery group. At the 3-month follow-up, the median VAS score was 1 in the delayed surgery group and 2.5 in the nonoperative group (p < 0.001). Also, the percentage of complications was higher in the nonoperative group (p = 0.004 for DVT, p < 0.001 for pulmonary infection). Interpretation — In hip fracture patients, delayed surgery compared with nonoperative therapy significantly improved hip function and reduced various major complications.","Mi, Bobin; Chen, Lang; Tong, Dake; Panayi, Adriana C; Ji, Fang; Guo, Junfei; Ou, Zhiyong; Zhang, Yingze; Xiong, Yuan; Liu, Guohui",Acta orthopaedica,70,21

In this review, we aimed to summarize the recent advances in the therapeutic effects and molecular mechanisms of key common bioactive compounds from Chinese herbal medicine. Based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine related to lung diseases, we searched several electronic databases to determine the high-frequency Chinese medicines in clinical application. The active compounds and metabolites from the selected medicines were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) by analyzing oral bioavailability and drug similarity index. Then, the pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of the selected bioactive compounds in the viral and bacterial infections, inflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung cancer were summarized. We found that 31 bioactive compounds from the selected 10 common Chinese herbs, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), kaempferol, isorhamnetin, quercetin, and β-sitosterol, can mainly regulate NF-κB, Nrf2/HO-1, NLRP3, TGF-β/Smad, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways to inhibit infection, inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition, and tumor growth in a series of lung-related diseases.

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 140 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 12, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to disease severity: a mild group (MG) (n = 107) and a severe group (SG) (n = 33). Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients, the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased in 95 (67.9 %), 91 (65.0 %), and 8 (5.7 %) patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG. Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with IL-6 > 32.1 pg/mL or CRP > 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an important semiconductor material frequently employed in foods, cosmetics, paints, coatings, food packaging materials, optical devices, and particularly, antimicrobials due to its strong photocatalytic disinfection ability. This chapter describes the preparation and characterization of acrylated epoxidized linseed oil nanocomposite coatings reinforced with TiO2 nanoparticles. The effect of TiO2 loading on the morphology, barrier, thermal, mechanical, tribological, and antibacterial performance of the coatings is summarized. The coatings exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria even in the absence of UV light, and the bactericidal effect increases with the TiO2 loading. These nanocomposite coatings could be used to prevent microbial proliferation in public places with high risk of infections such as hospitals.","Díez-Pascual, Ana M.",Handbook of Antimicrobial Coatings,70,32

Les résultats de l’ECMO veino-veineuse sont comparables dans le COVID- 19 à ceux obtenus dans les SDRA d’autres origines. La gestion de l’ECMO durant la pandémie COVID- 19 a des spécificités liées à la maladie (comme par exemple la gestion de l’anticoagulation) et à l’allocation des ressources. Plus rarement, la COVID-19 peut se compliquer de défaillance hémodynamique dans le cadre d’une myocardite fulminante ou d’une embolie pulmonaire massive et nécessiter alors la mise en place d’une ECMO veino-artérielle. Bien que les cas rapportés soient peu nombreux, l’assistance circulatoire peut permettre une évolution favorable dans ces 2 indications. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is mainly used as a rescue therapy in COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). More rarely, COVID-19 can be complicated by hemodynamic failure due to fulminant myocarditis or massive pulmonary embolism necessitating the implantation of venous-arterial ECMO. The management of ECMO during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging due to some specificities related to the disease characteristics, such as the management of anticoagulation in patients with a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. In large retrospective cohorts, survival of ECMO-rescued COVID-19 patients with ADRS was reported to be similar to that reported in previous studies on ECMO support for severe ARDS. Full consideration of ECMO candidacy is crucial for appropriate allocation of resources.","Hekimian, Guillaume; Frere, Corinne; Collet, Jean-Philippe",Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),70,1

Today there is no systematic intervention developed, implemented or evaluated in Sweden addressing loneliness. The overall aim for this project is to develop, test and refine a person-centred Swedish model for social prescribing (SPiS), and to assess whether and how it reduces loneliness, promotes health and improves well-being among older adults. DESCRIPTION: The focus will be to develop, culturally adapt, evaluate and refine the SPiS model. Following the sequential structure of realist evaluation in three consecutive phases qualitative and quantitative data along with subsequent analysis methods will be collected and utilized. The project will provide knowledge of what works with the social prescribing model, for whom, in what conditions and why, in relation to loneliness, health and well-being among older adults. DISCUSSION: SPiS has the unique position of providing initial knowledge regarding how to reduce loneliness in the Swedish context. However, evaluation is complex as this research goes beyond the unidimensional question “Is it working?”. CONCLUSION: Developing, implementing and evaluating such a complex program needs systematic and close evaluation.","Johansson, Erika; Jonsson, Frida; Rapo, Emil; Lundgren, Anna-Sofia; Hörnsten, Åsa; Nilsson, Ingeborg",International journal of integrated care,70,29

A rapid, sensitive and specific method for the detection of EHDV and PALV is critical for virus detection, monitoring, and successful control and elimination of related diseases. RESULTS: In the present study, a recombinase polymerase amplification combined with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) assay for the co-detection of genome segment 1 (Seg-1) of EHDV and PALV was developed and evaluated. The analytical sensitivities of the established RPA-LFD assay in the detection of EHDV and PALV were 7.1 copies/µL and 6.8 copies/µL, respectively. No cross-reaction with other members of the genus Orbivirus, including African horse sickness virus, bluetongue virus, Guangxi orbivirus, Tibet orbivirus and Yunnan orbivirus was observed. The established RPA-LFD assay accurately detected 39 EHDV strains belonging to 5 serotypes and 29 PALV strains belonging to 3 serotypes. The trace back results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and the established RPA-LFD assay on sentinel cattle were consistent. The coincidence rates of qRT-PCR and the established RPA-LFD assay in 56 blood samples from which EHDV or PALV had been isolated and 96 blood samples collected from cattle farms were more than 94.8 %. The results demonstrated that the established RPR-LFD assay is specific, sensitive and reliable, and could be applied in early clinical diagnosis of EHDV and PALV. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the development and application of the RPA-LFD assay in the co-detection of EHDV and PALV for the first time. The assay could be used as a potential optional rapid, reliable, sensitive and low-cost method for field diagnosis of EHDV and PALV.

Massive data is a fundamental aspect of the most powerful AI-based algorithms. However, for AI-based healthcare solutions, there are several socioeconomic, technical/infrastructural, and most importantly, legal restrictions, which limit the large collection and access of biomedical data, especially medical imaging. To overcome this important limitation, several alternative solutions have been suggested, including transfer learning approaches, generation of artificial data, adoption of blockchain technology, and creation of an infrastructure composed of anonymous and abstract data. However, none of these strategies is currently able to completely solve this challenge. The need to build large datasets that can be used to develop healthcare solutions deserves special attention from the scientific community, clinicians, all the healthcare players, engineers, ethicists, legislators, and society in general. This paper offers an overview of the data limitation in medical predictive models; its impact on the development of healthcare solutions; benefits and barriers of sharing data; and finally, suggests future directions to overcome data limitations in the medical field and enable AI to enhance healthcare. This perspective is dedicated to the technical requirements of the learning models, and it explains the limitation that comes from poor and small datasets in the medical domain and the technical options that try or can solve the problem related to the lack of massive healthcare data.","Pereira, Tania; Morgado, Joana; Silva, Francisco; Pelter, Michele M.; Dias, Vasco Rosa; Barros, Rita; Freitas, Cláudia; Negrão, Eduardo; Flor de Lima, Beatriz; Correia da Silva, Miguel; Madureira, António J.; Ramos, Isabel; Hespanhol, Venceslau; Costa, José Luis; Cunha, António; Oliveira, Hélder P.",Healthcare (Basel),70,17

We conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis. Survivors of PEMS were obtained from a research flock that had been purposefully infected at 5 d of age with PEMS inoculum that included turkey corona virus. The PEMS survivors were assigned to Experiments 1 and 2, beginning at 40 and 35 d of age, respectively. Three groups (large, L; medium, M; and small, S) and two groups (L and S) of 20 poults each were selected to represent different degrees of stunting in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. When the body weights of each group in both experiments were plotted using initial body weight as the starting point, all of the weights fell on the normal growth curve except Group S in Experiment 1. Therefore, there was no evidence of compensatory growth over the period studied. In Experiment 1, apparent fat absorption (AFA) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for control (85.9%) than for M (78.5%) and S (78.3%) groups, and AME, for the control group was significantly higher than all the PEMS-survivor groups. In Experiment 2, Group L had a higher AFA and AMEn than Group S. AFA and AMEn improved in both groups over time. The digestive capabilities of PEMS survivors were depressed proportionally to the degree of stunting. Impaired fat digestibility and dietary energy utilization in PEMS-afflicted birds are likely contributors to stunted growth and reduced recovery rates.","Odetallah, N. H.; Ferket, P. R.; Garlich, J.

These modalities, if applied correctly, could help health systems overcome situations such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the mismanagement of such traditional structures results in fear, stress, anxiety, and risky behavior among society. The current study aimed to assess the penetration of the recommendations and rumors related to PM during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationships of these recommendations and rumors with related health factors. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study performed in March 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) in southern Iran, eligible participants were randomly selected. The participants completed a 29-item online questionnaire assessing different aspects of the rumors and recommendations pertaining to PM linked with the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 523 participants took part in the survey. The mean fear score was 65.2/100. Approximately 99% of the study population had heard at least one of the rumors/recommendations of PM related to COVID-19. The average scores of disagreement with the rumors and recommendations linked to PM were 16.4/50 and 18.4/35, respectively. The fear score and the level of disagreement with the rumors were significantly related (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The use of PM might be beneficial in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic provided that a revolution occurs in data sharing. Various approaches should be considered in the management of traditional medicine modalities such as PM during disease outbreaks to help overcome the current dilemma.","Vardanjani, Hossein Molavi; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Dowran, Behzad; Pasalar, Mehdi",Integr Med Res,70,22

This study focuses on the effects of extraction time (1 and 2 h) and solvents (0.1 M HCl, 1% citric acid and deionised water) on the extraction of protein and FAAs including umami FAAs from Irish brown seaweeds (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus). Extraction yields were influenced by both the extraction solvent and time, and also varied according to the seaweed used. Both seaweeds investigated were found to be good sources of protein, FAAs including umami FAAs, demonstrating potential application as flavouring agents in the food industry. Overall, the use of green solvents (deionised water and citric acid) resulted in higher recoveries of compounds compared to HCl. The results of this study will facilitate the use of more sustainable solvents in industry for the extraction of proteins and flavouring agents from seaweed.","Ummat, Viruja; Garcia-Vaquero, Marco; Poojary, Mahesha M.; Lund, Marianne N.; O’Donnell, Colm; Zhang, Zhihang; Tiwari, Brijesh K.",J Appl Phycol,70,2

We aimed to investigate and characterize associations between clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with RT-PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were asymptomatic at presentation. All were retrospectively identified from 825 patients with chest CT scans and positive RT-PCR following exposure or travel risks in outbreak settings in Japan and China. CTs were obtained for every patient within a day of admission and were reviewed for infiltrate subtypes and percent with assistance from a deep learning tool. Correlations of clinical, laboratory, and imaging features were analyzed and comparisons were performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 74 (65%) initially asymptomatic patients had CT infiltrates that pre-dated symptom onset by 3.8 days. The most common CT infiltrates were ground glass opacities (45/48; 94%) and consolidation (22/48; 46%). Patient body temperature (p < 0.01), CRP (p < 0.01), and KL-6 (p = 0.02) were associated with the presence of CT infiltrates. Infiltrate volume (p = 0.01), percent lung involvement (p = 0.01), and consolidation (p = 0.043) were associated with subsequent development of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 CT infiltrates pre-dated symptoms in two-thirds of patients. Body temperature elevation and laboratory evaluations may identify asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 CT infiltrates at presentation, and the characteristics of CT infiltrates could help identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients who subsequently develop symptoms. The role of chest CT in COVID-19 may be illuminated by a better understanding of CT infiltrates in patients with early disease or SARS-CoV-2 exposure. KEY POINTS: • Forty-eight of 74 (65%) pre-selected asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 had abnormal chest CT findings. • CT infiltrates pre-dated symptom onset by 3.8 days (range 1–5). • KL-6, CRP, and elevated body temperature identified patients with CT infiltrates.

In this study, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was investigated in two dog populations. The first group was comprised of 1069 dogs admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital for any given reason. The second group included dogs that shared households with confirmed COVID-19 cases in humans. This study group numbered 78 dogs. In COVID-19 infected households, 43.9% tested ELISA positive, and neutralising antibodies were detected in 25.64% of dogs. Those data are comparable with the secondary attack rate in the human population. With 14.69% of dogs in the general population testing ELISA positive, there was a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the dog population amid the second wave of the pandemic. Noticeably seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the dog and the human population did not differ at the end of the study period. Male sex, breed and age were identified as significant risk factors. This study gives strong evidence that while acute dog infections are mostly asymptomatic, they can pose a significant risk to dog health.

In this review article, we will discuss the potential role of coagulation factor Xa (FXa) in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. FXa, a serine protease, has been shown to play a role in the cleavage of SARS-CoV-1 spike protein (SP), with the inhibition of FXa resulting in the inhibition of viral infectivity. FX is known to be primarily produced in the liver, but it is also expressed by multiple cells types, including alveolar epithelium, cardiac myocytes, and macrophages. Considering that patients with preexisting conditions, including cardiopulmonary disease, are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19, we discuss the potential role of increased levels of FX in these patients, resulting in a potential increased propensity to have a higher infectious rate and viral load, increased activation of coagulation and inflammation, and development of fibrosis. With these observations in mind, we postulate as to the potential therapeutic role of FXa inhibitors as a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for high-risk patients with COVID-19.","Frydman, Galit H.; Streiff, Michael B.; Connors, Jean M.; Piazza, Gregory",TH Open,70,5

It has caused huge economic losses to the global pig industry and that is why it is necessary to develop effective new treatment compounds. Zedoary turmeric oil has been used for treating myocarditis. Curcumol extracted from the roots of curcuma is one of the main active ingredient of zedoary turmeric oil. The anti-EMCV activity of curcumol along with the molecular mechanisms involved with a focus on IFN-β signaling pathway was investigated in this study. METHOD: 3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the maximum non-toxic concentration (MNTC), 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)), maximum inhibition rate (MIR) and 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) against EMCV. Through EMCV load, the anti-viral effect of curcumol was quantitatively determined using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The effect of curcumol on the expression of IFN-β was investigated using real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA. Western blot was used to determine the amounts of MDA5, MAVS, TANK, IRF3 and P-IRF3 proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK-293 T) cells infected with EMCV. RESULTS: The results of MTT showed that compared with the ribavirin positive control group, the maximum inhibition ratio (MIR) of curcumol was greater but the selection index (SI) value was much smaller than that of ribavirin. The results of qPCR showed that curcumol and ribavirin significantly reduced the replication of EMCV in HEK-293 T cells. The curcumol (0.025 mg/mL) treatment has significantly increased IFN-β mRNA expression in the EMCV-infected HEK-293 T cells while ribavirin treatment did not. The results of ELISA showed that curcumol (0.025 mg/mL and 0.0125 mg/mL) has significantly increased the expression of IFN-β protein in EMCV-infected HEK-293 T cells. The results of Western blot showed that curcumol can inhibit the degradation of TANK protein mediated by EMCV and promote the expression of MDA5 and P-IRF3, while the protein expression level of MAVS and IRF3 remain unchanged. CONCLUSION: Curcumol has biological activity against EMCV which we suggest that IFN-β signaling pathway is one of its mechanisms.

It was found that: i) Photoacoustic signal amplitude values of bread significantly increase from 37 to 90% when moringa powder concentration raises from 1.25% to 10%, at 300 nm wavelength. ii) Comparing the photoacoustic signal values at 300, 330, and 370 nm wavelengths, produced by the different bread types, there were statistically significant differences. iii) The sanitary quality of bread mixed with a 2.5% of moringa is relatively higher than the ones obtained for other concentrations, such that the number of fungal colonies were reduced by 99% in comparison with the control bread without moringa, after six days of storage. Moringa at 2.5% of concentration could thus improve the sanitary quality of wheat bread. iv) The addition of moringa for making bread slows down its textural changes (hardness, elasticity, cohesiveness, resilience, and chewiness) during storage. v) Finally, the highest correlation between the photoacoustic amplitude and the moringa concentration occurs at the wavelengths of 300 and 330 nm, which could be related to significant changes in the content of flavonoids and phenolic acids.","Hernandez-Aguilar, C.; Dominguez-Pacheco, A.; Valderrama-Bravo, C.; Cruz-Orea, A.; Martínez Ortiz, E.; Ivanov, Rumen; Ordonez-Miranda, J.",Curr Res Food Sci,70,16

Metabolomics offers promise in deducing mechanisms of disease states, providing risk stratification, and understanding therapeutic responses in regards to CPB/DHCA related organ injury. OBJECTIVES: Using an infant porcine model, we sought to determine the individual and additive effects of CPB/DHCA and lung region on the metabolic fingerprint, metabolic pathways, and individual metabolites in lung tissue. METHODS: Twenty-seven infant piglets were divided into two groups: mechanical ventilation + CPB/DHCA (n = 20) and mechanical ventilation only (n = 7). Lung tissue was obtained from dorsocaudal and ventral regions. Targeted analysis of 235 metabolites was performed using HPLC/MS–MS. Data was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), ANOVA, and pathway analysis. RESULTS: Profound metabolic differences were found in dorsocaudal compared to ventral lung zones by PCA and PLS-DA (R2 = 0.7; Q2 = 0.59; p < 0.0005). While overshadowed by the regional differences, some differences by exposure to CPB/DHCA were seen as well. Seventy-four metabolites differed among groups and pathway analysis revealed 20 differential metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate significant metabolic disturbances between dorsocaudal and ventral lung regions during supine mechanical ventilation with or without CPB/DHCA. CPB/DHCA also leads to metabolic differences and may have additive effects to the regional disturbances. Most pathways driving this pathology are involved in energy metabolism and the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and reduction–oxidation pathways.

Many national societies and local governments provided recommendations for surgeons to initially suspend and progressively resume elective surgery. The authors used a survey to the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons (ACAPS) to assess the effect on plastic surgeons. METHODS: An electronic survey questionnaire was distributed to 532 members of ACAPS. Data on individual and plastic surgery practice demographics, COVID-19 prevention measures, and procedures or services that were being performed or delayed were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: An estimated 161 members (30.2%) completed the survey. Changes in hospital policy were cited as the most common reason (89%) for determining which procedures were currently offered. Results vary by specialty. Notably, <10% of respondents who normally offered aesthetic procedures currently offered any procedures during the survey. Subspecialty-specific results and prevention measures when seeing clinic patients are further summarized and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Plastic surgeons have seen a drastic decrease in the variety of procedures and services they are allowed to offer during the COVID-19 pandemic. To help plan a return to normalcy, surgeons should create and implement plans to protect patients and staff from coronavirus transmission, assure financial solvency, and consider the effects of delayed surgeries on both the physical and mental health of their patients. In doing so, surgeons and their patients will be better prepared in the event of a resurgence of the virus.","Sarac, Benjamin A.; Schoenbrunner, Anna R.; Wilson, Stelios C.; Chiu, Ernest S.; Janis, Jeffrey E.",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,70,27

In Portugal, most patients were followed in ambulatory, monitored by phone calls or face-to-face visits by their General Practitioner. OBJECTIVE The aim was to characterize the pathway of COVID-19 outpatients in Primary Care and establish the risk factors that mostly influences the need for hospitalization or death during the follow-up. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was established, based on the official Portuguese dataset of the first wave between March 2nd and June 30th 2020. The predictive effects of variables, including age, gender, residency and clinical features, were analysed using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 38,545 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was included for analysis (56.3% female), with a median age of 47 years old. There were 4,327 hospitalized patients, 253 in intensive care units and 1,153 deaths. Females present lower risk of hospitalization (HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73-0.82; P < 0.001) and age is associated with higher risk (HR = 7.08; 95% CI: 6.68-7.50; P < 0.001), as well as the presence of at least one comorbidity (HR = 7.03; 95% CI: 6.43-7.69; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV and other immunodeficiencies, transplant or immunosuppression, haematological disorders, neurological disorders and liver disease increased the risk of hospitalization. CONCLUSION Male gender, age and the presence of comorbidities are the main determinants for hospitalization and death.

A feasible and reliable parameter estimation method based on modified hybrid Nelder-Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimisation is also presented to fit the real data using fractional SEIAR model. The effective methods to solve the fractional epidemic models we introduced construct a simple and effective analytical technique that can be easily extended and applied to other fractional models, and can help guide the concerned bodies in preventing or controlling, even predicting the infectious disease outbreaks.","Chen, Yuli; Liu, Fawang; Yu, Qiang; Li, Tianzeng",Appl Math Model,70,1

Methods: We used 2003–2013 data derived from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct this nationwide, population-based. We identified AS patients newly diagnosed between 2005 to 2013 as the study group and applied age-sex matched (1:20) and propensity score-matched (PSM) (1:2) non-SLE individuals as controls. The association between APS and risk of incident SLE was determined by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: We identified 1,245 patients with APS as well as 24,900 age- and sex-matched non-APS controls and 727 APS patients as well as 1,454 PSM non-APS controls. We found that the risk for incident SLE in the APS group was 80.70 times higher than the non-APS group, and the association remained robust after PSM (HR, 28.55; 95% CI, 11.49–70.91). The increased risk for SLE in patients with APS mainly existed within 5 years after the diagnosis of APS. The sensitivity analyses found that the risk for SLE in patients with APS was consistent excluding patients with ITP/AIHA and using distinct definitions of SLE. Conclusion: The present population-based study revealed a robust association between SLE risk and recent APS and highlights the need for vigilance of SLE-associated symptoms in patients who had been diagnosed with APS.","Chen, Hsin-Hua; Lin, Ching-Heng; Chao, Wen-Cheng",Front Med (Lausanne),70,17

Our aim was to compare the sensitivity of two testing metrics--population testing number and testing coverage--to population mortality outcomes and identify a benchmark for testing adequacy with respect to population mortality and capture of potential disease burden. This ecological study aggregated publicly available data through April 12 on testing and outcomes related to COVID-19 across 36 OECD (Organization for Economic Development) countries and Taiwan. All OECD countries and Taiwan were included in this population-based study as a proxy for countries with highly developed economic and healthcare infrastructure. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the aforementioned metrics and following outcome measures: deaths per 1 million people, case fatality rate, and case proportion of critical illness. Fractional polynomials were used to generate scatter plots to model the relationship between the testing metrics and outcomes. Testing coverage, but not population testing number, was highly correlated with population mortality (rs= -0.79, P=5.975e-09 vs rs =- 0.3, P=0.05) and case fatality rate (rs= -0.67, P=9.067e-06 vs rs = -0.21, P=0.20). A testing coverage threshold of 15-45 signified adequate testing: below 15, testing coverage was associated with exponentially increasing population mortality, whereas above 45, increased testing did not yield significant incremental mortality benefit. Testing coverage was better than population testing number in explaining country performance and can be used as an early and sensitive indicator of testing adequacy and disease burden. This may be particularly useful as countries consider re-opening their economies.","Chen, W.; Lee, C.-C.; Hsu, T.-C.; Hsu, W.-T.; Chan, C.-C.; Chen, S.-C.; Chen, C.-J.",,70,20

We use an event study to compare COVID-19 hospitalizations, intensive-care (ICU) patients, and deaths in Sweden with Denmark and Norway. The outcome variables initially follow a common trend, but diverge 2–3 weeks after lockdown. Both the timing of the effect and the similarity in the trend between Denmark and Norway are highly consistent with a causal effect of the lockdown. We use our event study to build a counterfactual model that predicts the outcome variables for Denmark and Norway if they had followed Sweden’s approach. In the absence of strict NPIs, the peak number of hospitalizations would have been 2.5 (3.5) times as large in Denmark (Norway).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: CPSS is a dual-site longitudinal cohort (3.5 years) assessed quarterly. Cognitively normal participants (60–85 years) were recruited across Greater London and Edinburgh. Participants are classified as high, medium (amnestic or non-amnestic) or low risk for developing mild cognitive impairment–Alzheimer’s disease based on their Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status performance at screening. Additional AD-related assessments include: a novel cognitive composite, the Global Preclinical Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite, brain MRI and positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Lifestyle, other cognitive and functional data, as well as biosamples (blood, urine, and saliva) are collected. Primarily, study analyses will evaluate longitudinal change in cognitive and functional outcomes. Annual interim analyses for descriptive data occur throughout the course of the study, although inferential statistics are conducted as required. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: CPSS received ethical approvals from the London—Central Research Ethics Committee (15/LO/0711) and the Administration of Radioactive Substances Advisory Committee (RPC 630/3764/33110) The study is at the forefront of global AD prevention efforts, with frequent and robust sampling of the well-characterised cohort, allowing for detection of incipient pathophysiological, cognitive and functional changes that could inform therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or delay cognitive impairment and dementia. Dissemination of results will target the scientific community, research participants, volunteer community, public, industry, regulatory authorities and policymakers. On study completion, and following a predetermined embargo period, CPSS data are planned to be made accessible for analysis to facilitate further research into the determinants of AD pathology, onset of symptomatology and progression. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The CHARIOT:PRO SubStudy is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02114372). Notices of protocol modifications will be made available through this trial registry.","Udeh-Momoh, Chinedu T.; Watermeyer, Tamlyn; Price, Geraint; de Jager Loots, Celeste A; Reglinska-Matveyev, Natalia; Ropacki, Michael; Ketter, Nzeera; Fogle, Michael; Raghavan, Nandini; Arrighi, Michael; Brashear, Robert; Di, Jianing; Baker, Susan; Giannakopoulou, Parthenia; Robb, Catherine; Bassil, Darina; Cohn, Martin; McLellan-Young, Heather; Crispin, Jennifier; Lakey, Kristina; Lisa, Curry; Chowdary Seemulamoodi, Yellappa; Kafetsouli, Dimitra; Perera, Dinithi; Car, Josip; Majeed, Azeem; Ward, Heather; Ritchie, Karen; Perneczky, Robert; Kivipelto, Miia; Scott, David; Bracoud, Luc; Saad, Ziad; Novak, Gerald; Ritchie, Craig W; Middleton, Lefkos",BMJ Open,70,28

This has prompted the emergence of critical just-in-time COVID-19 education, including rapid simulation preparedness, evaluation and training across all healthcare sectors. Simulation has been proven to be pivotal for both healthcare provider learning and systems integration in the context of testing and integrating new processes, workflows, and rapid changes to practice (e.g., new cognitive aids, checklists, protocols) and changes to the delivery of clinical care. The individual, team, and systems learnings generated from proactive simulation training is occurring at unprecedented volume and speed in our healthcare system. Establishing a clear process to collect and report simulation outcomes has never been more important for staff and patient safety to reduce preventable harm. Our provincial simulation program in the province of Alberta, Canada (population = 4.37 million; geographic area = 661,848 km(2)), has rapidly responded to this need by leading the intake, design, development, planning, and co-facilitation of over 400 acute care simulations across our province in both urban and rural Emergency Departments, Intensive Care Units, Operating Rooms, Labor and Delivery Units, Urgent Care Centers, Diagnostic Imaging and In-patient Units over a 5-week period to an estimated 30,000 learners of real frontline team members. Unfortunately, the speed at which the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged in Canada may prevent healthcare sectors in both urban and rural settings to have an opportunity for healthcare teams to participate in just-in-time in situ simulation-based learning prior to a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Our coordinated approach and infrastructure have enabled organizational learnings and the ability to theme and categorize a mass volume of simulation outcome data, primarily from acute care settings to help all sectors further anticipate and plan. The goal of this paper is to share the unique features and advantages of using a centralized provincial simulation response team, preparedness using learning and systems integration methods, and to share the highest risk and highest frequency outcomes from analyzing a mass volume of COVID-19 simulation data across the largest health authority in Canada.","Dubé, Mirette; Kaba, Alyshah; Cronin, Theresa; Barnes, Sue; Fuselli, Tara; Grant, Vincent",Adv Simul (Lond),70,17

Previously insignificant fields of work have been added and organisational tasks in particular pose great challenges for the sports physician in charge. Preventive strategies such as the development of hygiene concepts and the implementation of testing strategies are a central part of preventing the occurrence (and spread) of infections and are thus a prerequisite for the continuation of training and competition measures. Knowledge of the direct medical handling of SARS-CoV-2 is required, including appropriate medical measures for the safe resumption of sporting activities. Secondary consequences of the pandemic, such as restrictions on necessary surgical and rehabilitative treatments or the occurrence of mental illnesses, must also be taken into account. Open and trusting communication within the team is basic for acceptance of the agreed measures.

METHODS: We use longitudinal data (1967–2018) from the INCAP birth cohort, Guatemala (n = 1386). Using wealth as a measure of socio-economic position, we assess the association of life course relative mobility using latent class analysis and absolute material gains using conditional wealth measures. We estimate associations of wealth mobility with indicators of human capital, specifically height, weight status (BMI in kg/m(2)), psychological distress (WHO SRQ-20 score) and fluid intelligence (Ravens Progressive Matrices score; RPM) in middle adulthood. RESULTS: We identified four latent classes of relative mobility – Stable Low (n = 498), Stable High (n = 223), Downwardly Mobile (n = 201) and Upwardly Mobile (n = 464). Attained schooling (years) was positively associated with membership in Upwardly Mobile (odds ratio; 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71) vs Stable Low, and inversely with membership in Downwardly Mobile (0.65, 95%CI: 0.54, 0.79) vs Stable High. Being Upwardly Mobile (vs Stable Low) was positively associated with height (1.88 cm, 95%CI: 1.04, 2.72), relative weight (1.32 kg/m(2), 95%CI: 0.57, 2.07), lower psychological distress (−0.82 units, 95%CI: 1.34, −0.29) and fluid intelligence (0.94 units, 95%CI: 0.28, 1.59). Being Downwardly Mobile (vs Stable High) was associated with lower fluid intelligence (−2.69 units, 95%CI: 3.69, −1.68), and higher psychological distress (1.15 units, 95%CI: 0.34, 1.95). Absolute wealth gains (z-scores) from early to middle adulthood were positively associated with relative weight (0.62 kg/m(2), 95%CI: 0.28, 0.96), lower psychological distress (−0.37 units, 95%CI: 0.60, −0.14) and fluid intelligence (0.50 units, 95%CI: 0.21, 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Higher attained schooling provided a pathway for upward relative mobility and higher absolute wealth gains as well as protection against downward relative mobility. Upward mobility was associated with lower psychological distress and higher fluid intelligence but also higher weight status.","Varghese, Jithin Sam; Patel, Shivani A.; Martorell, Reynaldo; Ramirez-Zea, Manuel; Stein, Aryeh D.",SSM Popul Health,70,1

The complete epidemic data are available for a complete assessment of epidemiological parameters in all regions and time periods. METHODS: This study aims to present a spatiotemporal epidemic model based on spatially stratified heterogeneity (SSH) to simulate the epidemic spread. A susceptible-exposed/latent-infected-removed (SEIR) model was constructed for each SSH-identified stratum (each administrative city) to estimate the spatiotemporal epidemiological parameters of the outbreak. RESULTS: We estimated that the mean latent and removed periods were 5.40 and 2.13 days, respectively. There was an average of 1.72 latent or infected persons per 10,000 Wuhan travelers to elsewhere until January 20(th), 2020. The space-time basic reproduction number (R(0)) estimates indicate an initial value between 2 and 3.5 in most cities on this date. The mean period for R(0) estimates to decrease to 80% and 50% of initial values in cities were an average of 14.73 and 19.62 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our model estimates the complete spatiotemporal epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak in a space-time domain, and the findings will help enhance a comprehensive understanding of the outbreak and inform the strategies of prevention and control in other countries worldwide.","Hu, Bisong; Ning, Pan; Qiu, Jingyu; Tao, Vincent; Devlin, Adam Thomas; Chen, Haiying; Wang, Jinfeng; Lin, Hui",Int J Infect Dis,70,18

At first are used univariate time series models in order to predict the evolution of the reported cases. Moreover, are considered combinations of the models in order to provide more accurate and robust results. Additionally, statistical probability distributions are considered in order to generate future scenarios. Final step is the build and use of an epidemiological model (tSIR) and the calculation of an epidemiological ratio (R(0)) for estimating the termination of the outbreak. The time series models include Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA approaches from the classical models, also Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Networks and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines from the machine learning toolbox. Combinations include simple mean, Newbolt-Granger and Bates-Granger approaches. Finally, the tSIR model and the R(0) ratio are used for estimating the spread and the reversion of the pandhemic. The suggested procedure is used to track the COVID-19 epidemic in Greece. This epidemic has appeared in China in December 2019 and has been widespread since then to all over the world.

These restrictions triggered an increased use of digital technologies and platforms by the public. This provides an opportunity for the authorities to capture public perceptions on COVID-19 from social media channels to make informed decisions. The use of social media analytics during pandemics for decision-making, however, is an understudied area of research. Thus, this study aims to generate insights into how social media analytics can assist authorities in pandemic-related policy decisions. METHODS: This study involved a social media analysis approach—i.e., systematic geo-Twitter analysis—that contains descriptive, content, sentiment, and spatial analyses. Australian states and territories are selected as the case study context for the empirical investigation. This study collected 96,666 geotagged tweets (originated from Australia between 1 January and 4 May 2020), and analysed 35,969 of them after data cleaning. RESULTS: The findings disclose that: (a) Social media analytics is an efficient approach to capture the attitudes and perceptions of the public during a pandemic; (b) Crowdsourced social media data can guide interventions and decisions of the authorities during a pandemic, and; (c) Effective use of government social media channels can help the public to follow the introduced measures/restrictions. CONCLUSION: The findings are invaluable for authorities to understand community perceptions and identify communities in needs and demands in a pandemic situation, where authorities are not in a position to conduct direct and lengthily public consultations.","Yigitcanlar, Tan; Kankanamge, Nayomi; Preston, Alexander; Gill, Palvinderjit Singh; Rezayee, Maqsood; Ostadnia, Mahsan; Xia, Bo; Ioppolo, Giuseppe",Health Inf Sci Syst,70,28

The diagnosis of SAE is currently a challenge. In fact, problems in making a diagnosis of SAE cause a great variability of incidence that can reach up to 70% of all septic patients. Even more, despite SAE is the most frequent type of encephalopathy occurring in critically ill patients, the molecular mechanisms that guide its progression have not been completely elucidated. On the other hand, miRNAs have proven to be excellent biomarkers for both diagnosis and prognosis, especially in brain pathologies because of their small size they can cross the blood–brain barrier easier than other biomolecules. The identification of new miRNAs as biomarkers may help to improve SAE diagnosis and prognosis and also to design new therapies for this clinical manifestation that produces diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) epitopes derived from HTNV has been extensively studied, but little is known of MHC-II epitopes. In silico predictions based on four databases indicated that the full-length HTNV GP has 1121 15-mer epitopes, of which 289 had a high score for binding to the human and murine MHC-II superfamily. It found that epitope ILTVLKFIANIFHTS could potentially bind most MHC-II molecules covering human and murine haplotypes.

We hypothesized that L-POCUS performed during the initial examination would identify non-severe COVID-19 patients with a high risk of getting worse. Methods POCUSCO was a prospective, multicenter study. Non-critical adult patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included and had L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following admission. The severity of lung damage was assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. The primary outcome was the rate of patients requiring intubation or who died within 14 days following inclusion. Results Among 296 participating patients, 8 (2.7%) had primary outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic of L-POCUS was 0.80 [95%CI:0.60-0.94]. The score values which achieved a sensibility > 95% in defining low-risk patients and a specificity > 95% in defining high-risk patients were <1 and [≥]16, respectively. The rate of patients with an unfavorable outcome was 0/95 (0%[95%CI:0-3.9]) for low-risk patients (score=0) versus 4/184 (2.17%[95%CI:0.8-5.5]) for intermediate-risk patients (score 1-15) and 4/17 (23.5%[95%CI:11.4-42.4]) for high-risk patients (score [≥]16). In patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n=58), the AUC of L-POCUS was 0.97 [95%CI:0.92-1.00]. Conclusions L-POCUS allows risk-stratification of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

Limited information is available regarding which patients will experience more severe disease symptoms. We evaluated hospitalized patients who were initially diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 for clinical parameters and radiological feature that showed an association with progression to severe/critical symptoms. METHODS: This study, a retrospective single-center study at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, enrolled 243 patients with confirmed COVID­19 pneumonia. Forty of these patients progressed from moderate to severe/critical symptoms during follow up. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between moderate- and severe/critical-type symptoms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the risk factors associated with symptom progression. RESULTS: Patients with severe/critical symptoms were older (p < 0.001) and more often male (p = 0.046). A combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and high maximum chest computed tomography (CT) score was associated with disease progression. Maximum CT score (> 11) had the greatest predictive value for disease progression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.861 (95% confidence interval: 0.811–0.902).

Data cut-off for this analysis was 21st April 2020. Main outcome measures: Visit to hospital and for those who attended hospital, the need for respiratory support in three subgroups (i) self-reported COVID-19 infection with classical symptoms (SR-COVID-19), (ii) self-reported positive COVID-19 test results (T-COVID-19), and (iii) imputed/predicted COVID-19 infection based on symptomatology (I-COVID-19). Multivariate logistic regressions for each outcome and each subgroup were adjusted for age and gender, with sensitivity analyses adjusted for comorbidities. Classical symptoms were defined as high fever and persistent cough for several days. Results: Older age and all comorbidities tested were found to be associated with increased odds of requiring hospital care for COVID-19. Obesity (BMI >30) predicted hospital care in all models, with odds ratios (OR) varying from 1.20 [1.11; 1.31] to 1.40 [1.23; 1.60] across population groups. Pre-existing lung disease and diabetes were consistently found to be associated with hospital visit with a maximum OR of 1.79 [1.64,1.95] and 1.72 [1.27; 2.31]) respectively. Findings were similar when assessing the need for respiratory support, for which age and male gender played an additional role. Conclusions: Being older, obese, diabetic or suffering from pre-existing lung, heart or renal disease placed participants at increased risk of visiting hospital with COVID-19. It is of utmost importance for governments and the scientific and medical communities to work together to find evidence-based means of protecting those deemed most vulnerable from COVID-19.

Despite innovative and notable advances in immunotherapy, challenges associated with variations in patient response rates and efficacies on select tumors minimize the overall effectiveness of these immunotherapy approaches. This review provides an overview of the current immunotherapy options available, followed by epigenetic immunomodulators that may enhance and transmogrify immunotherapy effectiveness. These approaches are positioned to harness trained immunity, improve immune response rates, and increase the efficacy of immunotherapies. ABSTRACT: Cancer immunotherapy harnesses the immune system by targeting tumor cells that express antigens recognized by immune system cells, thus leading to tumor rejection. These tumor-associated antigens include tumor-specific shared antigens, differentiation antigens, protein products of mutated genes and rearrangements unique to tumor cells, overexpressed tissue-specific antigens, and exogenous viral proteins. However, the development of effective therapeutic approaches has proven difficult, mainly because these tumor antigens are shielded, and cells primarily express self-derived antigens. Despite innovative and notable advances in immunotherapy, challenges associated with variable patient response rates and efficacy on select tumors minimize the overall effectiveness of immunotherapy. Variations observed in response rates to immunotherapy are due to multiple factors, including adaptative resistance, competency, and a diversity of individual immune systems, including cancer stem cells in the tumor microenvironment, composition of the gut microbiota, and broad limitations of current immunotherapeutic approaches. New approaches are positioned to improve the immune response and increase the efficacy of immunotherapies, highlighting the challenges that the current global COVID-19 pandemic places on the present state of immunotherapy.","Mokhtari, Reza Bayat; Sambi, Manpreet; Qorri, Bessi; Baluch, Narges; Ashayeri, Neda; Kumar, Sushil; Cheng, Hai-Ling Margaret; Yeger, Herman; Das, Bikul; Szewczuk, Myron R.",Cancers (Basel),70,20

METHODS: A behavioral observation study was undertaken involving medical students at the University of New South Wales. Their face-touching behavior was observed via videotape recording. Using standardized scoring sheets, the frequency of hand-to-face contacts with mucosal or nonmucosal areas was tallied and analyzed. RESULTS: On average, each of the 26 observed students touched their face 23 times per hour. Of all face touches, 44% (1,024/2,346) involved contact with a mucous membrane, whereas 56% (1,322/2,346) of contacts involved nonmucosal areas. Of mucous membrane touches observed, 36% (372) involved the mouth, 31% (318) involved the nose, 27% (273) involved the eyes, and 6% (61) were a combination of these regions. CONCLUSION: Increasing medical students' awareness of their habituated face-touching behavior and improving their understanding of self-inoculation as a route of transmission may help to improve hand hygiene compliance. Hand hygiene programs aiming to improve compliance with before and after patient contact should include a message that mouth and nose touching is a common practice. Hand hygiene is therefore an essential and inexpensive preventive method to break the colonization and transmission cycle associated with self-inoculation.","Kwok, Yen Lee Angela; Gralton, Jan; McLaws, Mary-Louise",Am J Infect Control,70,1

Therefore, HCWs based in hospitals must be equipped with good knowledge about the pathogen and disease to put up a robust fight against the virus. The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of HCWs about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at multiple public and private hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional, online questionnaire-based study was conducted between July and August of 2020. Logistic regression was used to investigate differences in the level of KAP among different participants. A total of 510 HCWs in hospitals completed the questionnaire. Only two-thirds of the participants (67.8%) had adequate knowledge about COVID-19, 72.2% of the participants had a positive attitude toward COVID-19, and 80.2% of the participants were practicing appropriately most of the time. Poor KAP was associated with a low education level. The females had better knowledge and attitude, whereas the males were more likely to practice appropriately most of the time. Notably, the participants from the nursing profession demonstrated a less favorable attitude compared with medical staff from other professions, but that did not prevent them from being the best when it comes to applying appropriate practices. The inadequate level of KAP among HCWs with the continuation of the pandemic and the possibility of a second wave demonstrates the need for continuous COVID-19-specific infection control training and emotional well-being supporting programs, especially for HCWs with a low education level.","Almohammed, Omar A.; Aldwihi, Leen A.; Alragas, Adel M.; Almoteer, Ali I.; Gopalakrishnan, Shivkumar; Alqahtani, Nasser M.",Front Public Health,70,23

As the viral infection is driven by increased angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression, with the kidney exhibiting the highest expression, it is crucial to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: This study considers up-to-date information on the biological determinants shared by COVID-19 and renal disease, and aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of RCC patients with COVID-19. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search was performed using all sources (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Libraries, and Web of Science). As of March 31, 2020, the Center for Disease Control reported that of the adults hospitalized for COVID-19 with underlying conditions in the USA, 74.8% had chronic renal disease. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence is discussed from epidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and molecular studies on the role of kidney in facilitating routes for SARS-CoV-2 entry, leading to increased virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical manifestation of symptoms in RCC. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis will advance our understanding of (1) the molecular signatures shared by RCC and COVID-19 and (2) the clinical implications of overlapping signaling pathways in the therapeutic management of RCC and COVID-19 patients.

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. RESULTS: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27 × 10e(−4) (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69 × 10e(−4) if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers. Our findings evidence the difficulty of establishing reliable predictive models for the episodic and rapidly evolving incidence of infections such as has characterized the SARS CoV2 pandemic.","de la Matta, M.; Delgado-Sánchez, J.M.; Gutiérrez, G.M.; López Romero, J.L.; del Mar Martínez Gómez, M.; Domínguez Blanco, A.",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim (Engl Ed),70,21

This polyprotein usually contains at least one protease, the primary function of which is to process the polyprotein into mature proteins. Such proteases also may have other functions in the replication cycle. For instance, cysteine proteases (PRO) frequently double up as ubiquitin hydrolases (DUB), thus interfering with cellular processes critical for virus replication. We previously reported the crystal structures of such a PRO/DUB from Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and of its complex with one of its PRO substrates. Here we report the crystal structure of TYMV PRO/DUB in complex with ubiquitin. We find that PRO/DUB recognizes ubiquitin in an unorthodox way: It interacts with the body of ubiquitin through a split recognition motif engaging both the major and the secondary recognition patches of ubiquitin (Ile(44) patch and Ile(36) patch, respectively, including Leu(8), which is part of the two patches). However, the contacts are suboptimal on both sides. Introducing a single-point mutation in TYMV PRO/DUB aimed at improving ubiquitin-binding led to a much more active DUB. Comparison with other PRO/DUBs from other viral families, particularly coronaviruses, suggests that low DUB activities of viral PRO/DUBs may generally be fine-tuned features of interaction with host factors.","Fieulaine, Sonia; Witte, Martin D.; Theile, Christopher S.; Ayach, Maya; Ploegh, Hidde L.; Jupin, Isabelle; Bressanelli, Stéphane",J Biol Chem,70,16

The commentary highlighted the importance of a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) and its potential in addressing surveillance gap, and the inadequacy of existing sociodemographic database used for palliative administration. The authors examined the HDSS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response and learning from the Nahuche model. The Nahuche HDSS model has the potential of identifying poor households as it collects standard data on the socio-economic status of each of the households within the demographic surveillance area (DSA). Standard questionnaire in assessing the household socio-economic status adapted from standard surveys, such as Nigeria Health and Demographic Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey, was administered on the household heads of each household every 2 years to monitor socio-economic advancement of the households. Data on variables such as household possessions, including animals and livestock, were collected and analyzed using factor analysis to group the households into different wealth indices. HDSS provides an opportunity to ameliorate the challenges associated with halting the spread of the virus in the areas of surveillance and administration of palliatives in Nigeria, where there is a paucity of reliable demographic and household-level socio-economic data. This paper calls for the setting up of a functioning HDSS in each region of Nigeria to address the dearth of reliable data for planning health and socio-economic interventions.","Alabi, Olatunji; Omoleke, Semeeh A.; Abdulwahab, Ahmad",J Prim Care Community Health,70,20

However recently, this enzyme has been proven to be a multifunctional protein involved in diverse non-glycolytic activities. In the present study, two paralogue isoforms of GAPDH mRNAs were characterized from a marine teleost species, rockbream (Oplegnathus fasciatus; Perciformes) and their transcriptional responses to bacterial and viral infections were examined. Rockbream GAPDH1 and GAPDH2 cDNAs encoded 333 and 335 amino acids, respectively, and the amino acid sequence identity between those two isoforms was 74%. Two isoform GAPDH mRNAs were detected ubiquitously in all of tissues examined, but their expression levels were quite variable among tissues. Based on the real-time RT-PCR analysis, the transcription of rbGAPDH1 was affected by neither bacterial (Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda, Vibrio anguillarum or Streptococcus iniae) nor viral (rockbream iridovirus; RBIV) challenges. However on the contrary, the mRNA expression of rbGAPDH2 was significantly up-regulated in liver resulting from the bacterial infections (up to 25-fold), and in both liver (more than sixfold) and kidney (up to fivefold) from the viral infection. Results in the present study suggest that teleost GAPDH isoforms may also be potentially involved in immune modulations especially with respect to inflammatory responses, which is distinct from its classical glycolytic function.","Cho, Young Sun; Lee, Sang Yoon; Kim, Ki Hong; Nam, Yoon Kwon",Fish Shellfish Immunol,70,16

In addition, these microorganisms may bring about fouling of food and essential materials resulting in substantial economic losses. Typically, the microorganisms get transmitted by their attachment and growth on various household and high contact surfaces such as doors, switches, currency. To prevent the rapid spread of microorganisms, it is essential to understand the interaction between various microbes and surfaces which result in their attachment and growth. Such understanding is crucial in the development of antimicrobial surfaces. Here, we have reviewed different approaches to make antimicrobial surfaces and correlated surface properties with antimicrobial activities. This review concentrates on physical and chemical modification of the surfaces to modulate wettability, surface topography, and surface charge to inhibit microbial adhesion, growth, and proliferation. Based on these aspects, antimicrobial surfaces are classified into patterned surfaces, functionalized surfaces, superwettable surfaces, and smart surfaces. We have critically discussed the important findings from systems of developing antimicrobial surfaces along with the limitations of the current research and the gap that needs to be bridged before these approaches are put into practice.

Socioeconomic inequalities in unmet dental care needs have been identified in the literature, but some knowledge gaps persist. This paper tries to identify the determinants of income-related inequality in unmet need for dental care and the reasons for its recent evolution in Spain, and it inquires about the traces left by the Great Recession. METHODS: Data from the EU-SILC forming a decade (2007–2017) were used. Income-related inequalities for three years were measured by calculating corrected concentration indices (CCI), which were further decomposed in order to compute the contribution of different factors to inequality. An Oaxaca-type decomposition approach was also used to analyze the origin of changes over time. Men and women were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Pro-rich inequality in unmet dental care needs significantly increased over time (CCI 2007: − 0.0272 and − 0.0334 for males and females, respectively; CCI 2017: − 0.0704 and − 0.0776; p < 0.001). Inequality showed a clear “pro-cycle” pattern, growing during the Great Recession and starting to decrease just after the economic recovery began. Gender differences only were significant for 2009 (p = 0.004) and 2014 (p = 0.063). Income was the main determinant of inequality and of its variation along time -particularly for women-, followed by far by unemployment –particularly for men-; the contributions of both were mainly due to changes in elasticites. CONCLUSIONS: The Great Recession left its trace in form of a higher inequality in the access to dental care. Also, unmet need for dental care, as well as its inequality, became more sensitive to the ability to pay and to unemployment along recent years. To broaden public coverage of dental care for vulnerable groups, such as low-income/unemployed people with high oral health needs, would help to prevent further growth of inequality.

However, there is concern over the lack of involvement of communities and ‘bottom-up’ approaches used within COVID-19 responses thus far. Identifying how community engagement approaches have been used in past epidemics may support more robust implementation within the COVID-19 response. METHODOLOGY: A rapid evidence review was conducted to identify how community engagement is used for infectious disease prevention and control during epidemics. Three databases were searched in addition to extensive snowballing for grey literature. Previous epidemics were limited to Ebola, Zika, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndromeand H1N1 since 2000. No restrictions were applied to study design or language. RESULTS: From 1112 references identified, 32 articles met our inclusion criteria, which detail 37 initiatives. Six main community engagement actors were identified: local leaders, community and faith-based organisations, community groups, health facility committees, individuals and key stakeholders. These worked on different functions: designing and planning, community entry and trust building, social and behaviour change communication, risk communication, surveillance and tracing, and logistics and administration. CONCLUSION: COVID-19’s global presence and social transmission pathways require social and community responses. This may be particularly important to reach marginalised populations and to support equity-informed responses. Aligning previous community engagement experience with current COVID-19 community-based strategy recommendations highlights how communities can play important and active roles in prevention and control. Countries worldwide are encouraged to assess existing community engagement structures and use community engagement approaches to support contextually specific, acceptable and appropriate COVID-19 prevention and control measures.","Gilmore, Brynne; Ndejjo, Rawlance; Tchetchia, Adalbert; de Claro, Vergil; Mago, Elizabeth; Diallo, Alpha A; Lopes, Claudia; Bhattacharyya, Sanghita",BMJ Glob Health,70,27

In this paper we investigate these dynamics by jointly looking at the reported number of detected COVID-19 infections with non-fatal and fatal outcomes in different age groups in Germany. We propose a statistical approach that allows us to spotlight the case detection ratio and quantify its changes over time. With this we can adjust the case counts reported at different time points so that they become comparable. Moreover we can explore the temporal development of the real number of infections, shedding light on the dark number. The results show that the case detection ratio has increased and, depending on the age group, is four to six times higher at the beginning of the second wave compared to what it was at the peak of the first wave. The true number of infection in Germany in October was considerably lower as during the peak of the first wave, where only a small fraction of COVID-19 infections were detected. Our modelling approach also allows quantifying the effects of different testing strategies on the case detection ratio. The analysis of the dynamics in the case detection rate and in the true infection figures enables a clearer picture of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schneble, M.; De Nicola, G.; Kauermann, G.; Berger, U.",,70,16

In this study, we used an alignment-free method that uses k-mers as genomic features for a large-scale comparison of complete viral genomes available in RefSeq. To determine the optimal feature length, k (an essential step in constructing a meaningful dendrogram), we designed a comprehensive strategy that combines three approaches: (1) cumulative relative entropy, (2) average number of common features among genomes, and (3) the Shannon diversity index. This strategy was used to determine k for all 3,905 complete viral genomes in RefSeq. The resulting dendrogram shows consistency with the viral taxonomy of the ICTV and the Baltimore classification of viruses.","Zhang, Qian; Jun, Se-Ran; Leuze, Michael; Ussery, David; Nookaew, Intawat",Sci Rep,70,16

Yet, they have also been utilized in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders with vasoconstriction. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in the development of vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects. A retrospective review was conducted on CCB use in hospitalized patients in search of any difference in outcomes related to specific endpoints: survival to discharge and progression of disease leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The electronic medical records for all patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were at or above the age of 65 and that expired or survived to discharge from a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, between the start of the public health crisis due to the viral disease up until April 13, 2020, were included. Of the 77 patients that were identified, 18 survived until discharge and 59 expired. Seven patients from the expired group were excluded since they died within one day of presentation to the hospital. Five patients were excluded from the expired group since their age was above that of the eldest patient in the survival group (89 years old). With 65 patients left, 24 were found to have been administered either amlodipine or nifedipine (CCB group) and 41 were not (No-CCB group). Patients treated with a CCB were significantly more likely to survive than those not treated with a CCB: 12 (50%) survived and 12 expired in the CCB group vs. six (14.6%) that survived and 35 (85.4%) that expired in the No-CCB treatment group (P<.01; p=0.0036). CCB patients were also significantly less likely to undergo intubation and mechanical ventilation. Only one patient (4.2%) was intubated in the CCB group whereas 16 (39.0%) were intubated in the No-CCB treatment group (P<.01; p=0.0026). Nifedipine and amlodipine were found to be associated with significantly improved mortality and a decreased risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Further clinical studies are warranted. Including either nifedipine or amlodipine in medication regimens for elderly patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 may be considered.","Solaimanzadeh, Isaac",Cureus,70,22

Therefore, this study aimed to explore factors associated with health services utilization among breast cancer patients during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. METHOD: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of perceived health status, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, anxiety, coping resources, health services utilization (contact with healthcare professionals and cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic), and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated; contact with healthcare professionals was the dependent variable. In addition, a logistic regression was calculated; cancellation of an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic because of the COVID-19 was the dependent variable. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients’ contact with healthcare professionals was lower than their contact prior to the pandemic. A higher extent of contact with healthcare professionals was related to patients’ perception of health as bad/reasonable, lower perceived susceptibility, a lower sense of mastery, and higher social support. In addition, the odds of cancelling an appointment to the oncology/hematology clinic were higher in the presence of additional chronic illnesses and a higher sense of mastery. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The results could provide public health agencies with a more complete picture of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among breast cancer patients. This is significant because, in the event that COVID-19 re-emerges, the findings of the current study could help guide public health officials and possibly prevent the future avoidance of health services’ use among this high-risk population.","Shinan-Altman, Shiri; Levkovich, Inbar; Tavori, Guy",Palliative & supportive care,70,24

Additional challenges arise as community transmission changes over time and as participants are vaccinated on different dates because of staggered enrollment of participants or crossover of placebo recipients to the vaccine arm before the end of the study. Here, we provide valid and efficient statistical methods for estimating potentially waning VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection with blood or nasal samples under time-varying community transmission, staggered enrollment, and blinded or unblinded crossover.

Presentation of case. A 42-year old man was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. Fever, respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia significantly improved over the next 2 weeks, but the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever. Computed tomography scan revealed absence of contrast enhancement of gallbladder wall and a micro-perforation of the fundus. At laparoscopy, gallbladder gangrene was confirmed and a subtotal cholecystectomy performed. Special precautions were adopted for patient transportation from the ward to a dedicated operating room, and two teams with adequate personal protective equipment took charge of the procedure. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7 under protective lockdown measures for 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of acute acalcolous gangrenous cholecystitis is multifactorial. It is unknown whether a prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 contributes to wall ischemia and perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy should be avoided in patients with gallbladder gangrene. Contraindications to laparoscopy are not evidence-based since aerosolization is produced during both open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. However, personal protective equipment is key for prevention CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and surgical therapy are critical in patients with gangrenous cholecystitis. Subtotal laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gangrenous gallbladder is safe and effective.","Lovece, Andrea; Asti, Emanuele; Bruni, Barbara; Bonavina, Luigi",Int J Surg Case Rep,70,24

METHODS: Nasal samples were collected in coastal Kenya through community-based and hospital-based surveillance. HCoV-NL63 was detected with multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR, and positive samples were targeted for nucleotide sequencing of the spike (S) protein. Additionally, paired samples from 25 individuals with evidence of repeat HCoV-NL63 infection were selected for whole-genome virus sequencing. RESULTS: HCoV-NL63 was detected in 1.3% (75/5573) of child pneumonia admissions. Two HCoV-NL63 genotypes circulated in Kilifi between 2008 and 2014. Full genome sequences formed a monophyletic clade closely related to contemporary HCoV-NL63 from other global locations. An unexpected pattern of repeat infections was observed with some individuals showing higher viral titers during their second infection. Similar patterns for 2 other endemic coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were observed. Repeat infections by HCoV-NL63 were not accompanied by detectable genotype switching. CONCLUSIONS: In this coastal Kenya setting, HCoV-NL63 exhibited low prevalence in hospital pediatric pneumonia admissions. Clade persistence with low genetic diversity suggest limited immune selection, and absence of detectable clade switching in reinfections indicates initial exposure was insufficient to elicit a protective immune response.","Kiyuka, Patience K; Agoti, Charles N; Munywoki, Patrick K; Njeru, Regina; Bett, Anne; Otieno, James R; Otieno, Grieven P; Kamau, Everlyn; Clark, Taane G; van der Hoek, Lia; Kellam, Paul; Nokes, D James; Cotten, Matthew",J Infect Dis,70,21

The objective of this study was to examine consecutive antibody seroprevalence changes among hospital staff, a high-risk population. A two-time survey was performed in May and October 2020 for 545 hospital staff to investigate the changes in the results of the rapid kit test and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). The seroprevalence of each assay was summarized at both the survey periods. The proportion of seropositive individuals in the CLIA for each survey period and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Central Fukushima were then compared. We chose 515 participants for the analysis. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in CLIA increased from 0.19% in May to 0.39% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 0.97% in May to 0.39% in October. The proportion of IgM seroprevalence in the rapid kit test decreased from 7.96% in May to 3.50% in October, and IgG seroprevalence decreased from 7.77% in May to 2.14% in October. The IgG and IgM antibody seroprevalence among hospital staff in rural Central Fukushima decreased; the seroprevalence among hospital staff was consistent with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Central Fukushima area. Although it is difficult to interpret the results of the antibody assay in a population with a low prior probability, constant follow-up surveys of antibody titers among hospital staff had several merits in obtaining a set of criteria regarding the accuracy of measures against COVID-19 and estimating the COVID-19 infection status among hospital staff.","Kobashi, Yurie; Nishikawa, Yoshitaka; Kawamura, Takeshi; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Shimazu, Yuzo; Obara, Daiji; Zhao, ianchen; Tsubokura, Masaharu",Int Immunopharmacol,70,32

However, little is known regarding the attitudes and acceptability of patients and providers in high risk obstetrics and if implementation improves access to care in non-rural settings. Objective The study aims to: 1) Describe patient and provider attitudes toward telehealth for delivery of high risk obstetrical care in a large health care system with both urban and suburban settings. 2) Determine if implementation of a telehealth model improves patient adherence to scheduled appointments in this patient population. Study DesignTwo self-administered surveys were designed. The first survey was sent to all high-risk obstetrical patients who received a telehealth visit between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020. The second survey was designed for providers who participated in these visits. We also compared the attended, cancelled and no show visit rates before (March 1-May 30, 2019) and after (March 1-May 30, 2020) telehealth implementation, as well as telehealth versus in person visits in 2020. We reviewed scheduled high-risk prenatal care appointments, diabetes education sessions, and genetic counseling and Maternal- Fetal Medicine consultations. Results A total of 91 patient surveys and 33 provider surveys were analyzed. Overall, 86.9% of patients were satisfied with the care they received and 78.3% would recommend telehealth visits to others. 87.8% of providers reported having a positive experience using telehealth, and 90.9% believed that telehealth improved patients’ access to care. When comparing patient and provider preference regarding future obstetrical care after experiencing telehealth, 73.8% of patients desired a combination of in person and telehealth visits during their pregnancy. However, a significantly higher rate of providers preferred in-person visits (56% vs 23% respectively). When comparing visits between 2019 and 2020, there was a significantly lower rate of no-show appointments, patient-cancelled appointments, and patient same-day cancellations with the implementation of telehealth. There was also a significantly lower rate of patient-cancelled appointments, and patient same-day cancellations with those receiving telehealth visits compared to in person visits in 2020. Conclusion Implementation of telehealth in high risk obstetrics has the potential to improve access to high risk obstetrical care, by reducing the rate of missed appointments. Both patients and providers surveyed expressed a high rate of satisfaction with telehealth visits and a desire to integrate telehealth into the traditional model of high risk obstetrical care.","JEGANATHAN, Sumithra; PRASANNAN, Lakha; BLITZ, Matthew J.; VOHRA, Nidhi; ROCHELSON, Burton; MEIROWITZ, Natalie",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,70,32

Here we show that hypoxia decreases the attachment of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S1 subunit (S1) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to epithelial cells. In Vero E6 cells, hypoxia reduces the protein levels of ACE2 and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which might in part explain the observed reduction of the infection rate. In addition, hypoxia inhibits the binding of the spike to NCI-H460 human lung epithelial cells by decreasing the cell surface levels of heparan sulfate (HS), a known attachment receptor of SARS-CoV-2. This interaction is also reduced by lactoferrin, a glycoprotein that blocks HS moieties on the cell surface. The expression of syndecan-1, an HS-containing proteoglycan expressed in lung, is inhibited by hypoxia on a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Hypoxia or deletion of syndecan-1 results in reduced binding of the RBD to host cells. Our study indicates that hypoxia acts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the hypoxia signaling pathway might offer therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of COVID-19.","Prieto-Fernández, Endika; Egia-Mendikute, Leire; Vila-Vecilla, Laura; Bosch, Alexandre; Barreira-Manrique, Adrián; Lee, So Young; García-del Río, Ana; Antoñana-Vildosola, Asier; Jiménez-Lasheras, Borja; Moreno-Cugnon, Leire; Jiménez-Barbero, Jesús; Berra, Edurne; Ereño-Orbea, June; Palazon, Asis",bioRxiv,70,18

Omics-based studies suggest gut dysbiosis and reduced microbiome diversity in critical conditions. However, the landscape of gut microbial metabolites is still to be outlined, not to mention the interplay correlation between the metabolome and gut microbiome in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between serum and fecal levels of AMM and compare them with the composition of gut microbiota in critically ill patients in the acute and chronic stages. METHODS: In this prospective observational pilot study, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome and the AMM spectrum across two distinct subgroups—acute critical ill (ACI) patients with nosocomial pneumonia and chronically critically ill (CCI) patients (9 subjects each group)—as well as performed comparison with 23 healthy volunteers. The AMM levels for each patient were measured using GC-MS in simultaneously taken serum and fecal samples (SFS). These parameters were compared with 16S rRNA fecal microbiome profiles. RESULTS: The observed proportions of bacterial taxa suggest a significant gut dysbiosis in the ACI and the CCI patients. Stronger imbalance in microbiome composition and dynamics observed in the ACI patients compared to the CCI ones resonates with a higher severity in the former group. The total levels of AMM in serum samples were higher for the ACI patients than for the CCI patients (3.7 (1.4–6.3) and 1.1 (1.0–1.6) μM, respectively; p = 0.0003). The qualitative composition of the SFS was also altered. We discovered significant associations between gut microbial taxa levels and metabolite concentrations in blood serum as well as in feces in each of the ACI and the CCI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Aromatic microbial metabolite profiles in the gut and the serum are interlinked and reflect a disruption of the gut microbial community in critically ill patients.","Chernevskaya, Ekaterina; Beloborodova, Natalia; Klimenko, Natalia; Pautova, Alisa; Shilkin, Dmitrii; Gusarov, Vitaliy; Tyakht, Alexander",Crit Care,70,29

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, cross-sectional study including 659 outpatients with migraine diagnosed by headache specialists. The participants were asked about the impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache-related disability, headache days, headache intensity, stress, physical activity, hospital access and their work and home lives. For headache-related disability, the total Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score and part A and B scores were analysed. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify the clinical predictors of changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors related to new-onset headache during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Finally, 606 migraine patients (73 M/533 F; age, 45.2 ± 12.0 years) were included in the study, excluding those with incomplete data. Increased stress, substantial concern about COVID-19 and negative impacts of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life were reported in 56.8 %, 55.1 and 45.0 % of the participants, respectively. The total MIDAS and A and B scores did not significantly change after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. New-onset headache, which was observed in 95 patients (15.7 %), was associated with younger age and worsened mood and sleep in the logistic regression analysis. The multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis of changes in the total MIDAS score before and during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic identified worsened sleep, increased acute medication use, increased stress, medication shortages, comorbidities, the absence of an aura and new-onset headache were determinants of an increased total MIDAS score during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre study, clinical factors relevant to headache-related disability, such as new-onset headache, stress and sleep disturbances, were identified, highlighting the importance of symptom management in migraine patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our findings suggest that without the application of protection social measures, 56.1% of the Spanish population would contract the disease with a mortality of 0.4%. Assuming that 20% of the population was protected by vaccination by the end of the summer of 2021, it would be expected that 45% of the population would contract the disease and 0.3% of the population would die. However, both of these percentages are significantly lower when social measures were adopted, being the best results when social measures are in place and 40% of contacts traced. Our model shows that if 40% of the population can be vaccinated, even without social control measures, the percentage of people who die or recover from infection would fall from 0.41% and 56.1% to 0.16% and 33.5%, respectively compared with an unvaccinated population. When social control measures were applied in concert with vaccination the percentage of people who die or recover from infection diminishes until 0.10% and 14.5%, after vaccinating 40% of the population. Vaccination alone can be crucial in controlling this disease, but it is necessary to vaccinate a significant part of the population and to back this up with social control measures.","Colomer, Mª Àngels; Margalida, Antoni; Alòs, Francesc; Oliva-Vidal, Pilar; Vilella, Anna; Fraile, Lorenzo",Vaccines (Basel),70,16

So, rapid detection of all respiratory pathogens can facilitate prompt treatment and prevent the deterioration of respiratory disease. Previously published primers and probes of the TaqMan array card (TAC) for respiratory pathogens are not sensitive to Chinese clinical specimens. This study aimed to develop and improve the TAC assay to detect 28 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in a Chinese population. METHODS: To improve the sensitivity, we redesigned the primers and probes, and labeled the probes with minor groove binders. The amplification efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of the primers and probes were determined using target-gene containing standard plasmids. The detection performance of the TAC was evaluated on 754 clinical specimens and the results were compared with those from conventional methods. RESULTS: The performance of the TAC assay was evaluated using 754 clinical throat swab samples and the results were compared with those from gold-standard methods. The sensitivity and specificity were 95.4 and 96.6%, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the TAC was 10 to 100 copies/μL. CONCLUSIONS: TAC is an efficient, accurate, and high-throughput approach to detecting multiple respiratory pathogens simultaneously and is a promising tool for the identification of pathogen outbreaks.","Liu, Keke; Jing, Hongbo; Chen, Ying; Zheng, Xin; Jiang, Hua; Kong, Decong; Zheng, Yvling; Chen, Shuiping; Liu, Peng; Jiang, Yongqiang",BMC Infect Dis,70,32

Here, we present the heretofore cryptic mutational history and spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 from an analysis of thousands of high-quality genomes. We report the likely most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, reconstructed through a novel application and advancement of computational methods initially developed to infer the mutational history of tumor cells in a patient. This progenitor genome differs from genomes of the first coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants, implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise to all the human infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and the USA harbored the progenitor genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting that the progenitor was spreading worldwide months before and after the first reported cases of COVID-19 in China. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots have produced many dominant coronavirus strains, which have spread episodically over time. Fingerprinting based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated North America for most of the pandemic in 2020. There have been multiple replacements of predominant coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia and the continued presence of multiple high-frequency strains in Asia and North America.

ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to identify demographic, work-related and other predictors for clinically significant PTSD, depression, and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK frontline health and social care workers (HSCWs), and to compare rates of distress across different groups of HCSWs working in different roles and settings. MethodsA convenience sample (n=1194) of frontline UK HCSWs completed an online survey during the first wave of the pandemic (27 May - 23 July 2020). Participants worked in UK hospitals, nursing or care homes and other community settings. PTSD was assessed using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ); Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); Anxiety was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). ResultsNearly 58% of respondents met the threshold for clinically significant PTSD, anxiety or depression, and symptom levels were high across occupational groups and settings. Logistic regression analyses found that participants who were concerned about infecting others, who felt they could not talk with their managers, who reported feeling stigmatised and who had not had reliable access to personal protective equipment (PPE) were more likely to meet criteria for a clinically significant mental disorder. Being redeployed during the pandemic, and having had COVID were associated with higher odds for PTSD. Higher household income was associated with reduced odds for a mental disorder. ConclusionsThis study identified predictors of clinically significant distress during COVID-19 and highlights the need for reliable access to PPE and further investigation of barriers to communication between managers and staff.","Greene, Talya; Harju-Seppanen, Jasmine; Adjeniji, Mariam; Steel, Charlotte; Grey, Nick; Brewin, Chris R; Bloomfield, Michael A; Billings, Jo",,70,11

Initially it was necessary to identity the categories of citizens who should be the first to receive the vaccines, on the basis of scientific evidence. On the basis of this information, elderly residents in nursing homes and the staff who care for them should be the highest priority subjects for vaccination. In this context, obtaining informed consent to Covid-19 vaccination presents a considerable challenge, as the advanced age and frequent comorbidities of a significant number of the residents may mean that they are incapable of expressing consent themselves. The legislation of various Western nations substantially agrees on the general principle that those capable of judgement must be asked for their consent for healthcare services, and that even those with psychological weaknesses that limit their full ability to decide must be involved in these decision-making processes.

Twelve recreationally active participants completed eight trials of 90 s of cycling at different pedaling and gearing combinations on an indoor hybrid roller. Power output (PO) was simultaneously calculated via TPS and SRM. The analysis compared the paired 1 s PO and 1 min average PO per trial between devices. Agreement was assessed by correlation, linear regression, inferential statistics, effect size, and Bland-Altman LoA. Reliability was assessed by ICC and CV comparison. TPS showed near-perfect correlation with SRM in 1 s (rs = 0.97, p < 0.001) and 1-min data (rs = 0.99, p < 0.001). Differences in paired 1 s data were statistically significant (p = 0.04), but of a trivial magnitude (d = 0.05). There was no significant main effect for device (F(1,9) = 0.05, p = 0.83, ηp2 = 0.97) in 1 min data and no statistical differences between devices by trial in post hoc analysis (p < 0.01-0.98; d < 0.01-0.93). Bias and LoA were -0.21 ± 16.77 W for the 1 min data. Mean TPS bias ranged from 3.37% to 7.81% of the measured SRM mean PO per trial. Linear regression SEE was 7.55 W for 1 min TPS prediction of SRM. ICC3,1 across trials was 0.96. No statistical difference (p = 0.09-0.11) in TPS CV (3.6-5.0%) and SRM CV (4.3-4.7%).

MAS and associated cytokine storms have been observed in COVID-19 patients exhibiting systemic hyper-inflammation. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family, is elevated in both MAS and COVID-19 patients, and its level is known to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. IL-18 binds its specific receptor IL-1 Receptor 5 (IL-1R5, also known as IL-18 Receptor alpha chain), leading to the recruitment of the co-receptor, IL-1 Receptor 7 (IL-1R7, also known as IL-18 Receptor beta chain). This heterotrimeric complex then initiates downstream signaling, resulting in systemic and local inflammation. Here, we developed a novel humanized monoclonal anti-IL-1R7 antibody to specifically block the activity of IL-18 and its inflammatory signaling. We characterized the function of this antibody in human cell lines, in freshly obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and in human whole blood cultures. We found that the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly suppressed IL-18-mediated NFκB activation, reduced IL-18-stimulated IFNγ and IL-6 production in human cell lines, and reduced IL-18-induced IFNγ, IL-6 and TNFα production in PBMCs. Moreover, the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly inhibited LPS- and Candida albicans-induced IFNγ production in PBMCs, as well as LPS-induced IFNγ production in whole blood cultures. Our data suggest that blocking IL-1R7 could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to specifically modulate IL-18 signaling, and may warrant further investigation into its clinical potential for treating IL-18-mediated diseases, including MAS and COVID-19.","Li, Suzhao; Jiang, Liqiong; Beckmann, Karsten; Højen, Jesper Falkesgaard; Pessara, Ulrich; Powers, Nicholas E.; de Graaf, Dennis M.; Azam, Tania; Lindenberger, Jared; Eisenmesser, Elan Z.; Fischer, Stephan; Dinarello, Charles A.",J Biol Chem,70,16

However, no studies to date have identified the connections through which these symptom domains interact with each other to emerge into a complex and detrimental mental health state, along with the plausible mechanistic variables that may play key roles in maintaining parental stress and depression. The aim of this research is to uncover these interactions in a period where parents experience heightened demands and stress because of the strict social distancing protocols. METHODS: Network analysis is utilized to examine parental stress and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large cross-sectional study (N = 2,868) of parents. Two graphical Gaussian graphical network models were estimated, one in which only parental stress and depression symptoms were included, and another in which several mechanistic variables were added. RESULTS: Expected influence and bridge expected influence revealed that feeling worthless was the most influential node in the symptoms network and bridged the two psychological states. Among the mechanistic variables, worry and rumination was specifically relevant in the depressive cluster of symptoms, and self-criticism was connected to both constructs. CONCLUSION: The study displays that the co-occurrence of parental stress and depression has specific pathways, was manifested through feelings of worthlessness, and has specific patterns of connection to important mechanisms of psychopathology. The results are of utility when aiming to avoid the constellation of co-occurring parental stress and depressive symptoms during the pandemic.","Skjerdingstad, Nora; Johnson, Miriam Sinkerud; Johnson, Sverre Urnes; Hoffart, Asle; Ebrahimi, Omid V.",Eur Psychiatry,70,20

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on medical records of ED visits from a level I pediatric hospital system serving one of the largest metropolitan areas in the southeastern US from January through June 2018–2020. We used multivariate Poisson regression and linear regression to compare professionally identified CAN-related ED visits before and after a COVID-19 public health emergency declaration in 2020, relative to trends over the same period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Although the number of both overall pediatric ED visits and CAN-related ED visits declined, the number of CAN-related ED visits due to neglect from inadequate adult supervision increased by 62 % (p < 0.01). The number of CAN visits per 1,000 pediatric ED visits also increased by 97 % (p < 0.01). Finally, the proportion of CAN-related ED visits due to neglect from inadequate supervision increased by 100 % (p < 0.01).

Hospital reimbursement during the pandemic decreased from $4,982,114 to $2,649,521, -47% (inpatient: $3,505,775 to $2,128,133, -39%; outpatient $1,476,339 to $521,388, -65%) while professional reimbursement decreased from $933,897 to $430,967, -54% when compared to the same time period in 2019. Professional productivity as measured by wRVUs sustained a similar decline from 10478 wRVU to 5386 wRVU, -51%. Modeling sensitivity analyses demonstrated that if a vascular division were able to increase Inpatient and Outpatient revenue, above pre-pandemic levels, by 10%, 5%, or 3%, it would take 9 months, 19 months, or 31 months, respectively, for the hospital to recover pandemic-associated losses. Similarly, professional reimbursement recovery would require 11 months, 20 months, or 36 months for a similar increase in productivity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and lasting impact on the world in terms of lives lost and financial hardships. The financial impact on a vascular surgery division has resulted in losses ranging from 39% to 65% when compared to pre-pandemic period the previous year. Because complete mitigation of losses is not feasible in the short-term, alternative and novel strategies are needed to financially sustain the vascular division and hospital during a prolonged recovery period.","Fang, Zachary B.; Simons, Jessica P.; Judelson, Dejah R.; Arous, Edward J.; Jones, Douglas W.; Steppacher, Robert C.; Schanzer, Andres; Aiello, Francesco A.",J Vasc Surg,70,10

To better understand this climate change and sustainable development goals (SDGs) funding dilemma, there needs to be greater clarity around four climate change investment and finance-related questions that are frequently absent or inadequately addressed in the academic and policy literature. Firstly, what are or should be the boundaries of climate change investment and finance when the problem of climate change becomes impossible to separate from biodiversity, land use management, and other dilemmas related to the broader SDGs? Secondly, how we should define and what constitutes “adequate” financial resources to address the climate change and SDGs dilemmas on the global level? Thirdly, why is it important to close the gap between climate change adaptation and mitigation funding levels? Finally, what role should the private sector and business actors play in terms of climate change investment and finance issues? In addition to achieving greater clarity around these four issue areas, I argue in this article that three questions are likely to shape the future success (or failure) of the global climate change investment and finance architecture.

Many patients become critically ill unexpectedly and have not previously discussed their health-care wishes. Clinicians lack experience with this illness and therefore struggle to predict patient outcomes. MEASURES: Critical care medicine (CCM) providers were surveyed about the effectiveness and efficiency of a pilot intervention. INTERVENTION: Proactive palliative care rounding with CCM providers on COVID-19 intensive care units. OUTCOMES: Fifty-four percent of CCM providers responded to the survey (21/39). CCM providers rated the intervention highly across all domains. CCM providers frequently identified that early palliative involvement was critical to providing families with information and support when separated from their loved ones.

METHODS: Three electronic databases including PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant cohort studies of COVID-19 disease from January 1, 2020, to August 11, 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence rate (PR), risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for both effect measures. Cochrane chi-square test statistic Q, [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] tests were used to measure the presence of heterogeneity. Publication bias and sensitivity of the included studies were also tested. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, a total of 58 studies with 122,191 patients were analyzed. The pooled prevalence rate of mortality among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 18.88%, 95% CI (16.46–21.30), p < 0.001. Highest mortality was found in Europe [PR 26.85%, 95% CI (19.41–34.29), p < 0.001] followed by North America [PR 21.47%, 95% CI (16.27–26.68), p < 0.001] and Asia [PR 14.83%, 95% CI (12.46- 17.21), p < 0.001]. An significant association were found between mortality among COVID-19 infected patients and older age (> 65 years vs. < 65 years) [RR 3.59, 95% CI (1.87–6.90), p < 0.001], gender (male vs. female) [RR 1.63, 95% CI (1.43–1.87), p < 0.001], ICU admitted patients [RR 3.72, 95% CI (2.70–5.13), p < 0.001], obesity [RR 2.18, 95% CI (1.10–4.34), p < 0.05], hypertension [RR 2.08,95% CI (1.79–2.43) p < 0.001], diabetes [RR 1.87, 95% CI (1.23–2.84), p < 0.001], cardiovascular disease [RR 2.51, 95% CI (1.20–5.26), p < 0.05], and cancer [RR 2.31, 95% CI (1.80–2.97), p < 0.001]. In addition, significant association for high risk of mortality were also found for cerebrovascular disease, COPD, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was highest in the European region and older age, gender, ICU patients, patients with comorbidity had a high risk for case fatality. Those findings would help the health care providers to reduce the mortality rate and combat this pandemic to save lives using limited resources.

AMR surveillance systems typically collate data from routine culture and susceptibility testing performed in diagnostic bacteriology laboratories to support healthcare. Limited access to high quality culture and susceptibility testing results in the dearth of AMR surveillance data, typical of many parts of the world where the infectious disease burden and antimicrobial need are high. Culture and susceptibility testing by traditional techniques is also slow, which limits its value in infection management. Here, we outline hurdles to effective resistance surveillance in many low-income settings and encourage an open attitude towards new and evolving technologies that, if adopted, could close resistance surveillance gaps. Emerging advancements in point-of-care testing, laboratory detection of resistance through or without culture, and in data handling, have the potential to generate resistance data from previously unrepresented locales while simultaneously supporting healthcare. Among them are microfluidic, nucleic acid amplification technology and next-generation sequencing approaches. Other low tech or as yet unidentified innovations could also rapidly accelerate AMR surveillance. Parallel advances in data handling further promise to significantly improve AMR surveillance, and new frameworks that can capture, collate and use alternate data formats may need to be developed. We outline the promise and limitations of such technologies, their potential to leapfrog surveillance over currently available, conventional technologies in use today and early steps that health systems could take towards preparing to adopt them.","Okeke, Iruka N; Feasey, Nicholas; Parkhill, Julian; Turner, Paul; Limmathurotsakul, Direk; Georgiou, Pantelis; Holmes, Alison; Peacock, Sharon J",BMJ Glob Health,70,20

General control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) are four kinases that regulate eIF2α phosphorylation. MAIN BODY: In the viral infection process, dsRNA or viral proteins produced by viral proliferation activate different eIF2α kinases, resulting in eIF2α phosphorylation, which hinders ternary tRNA(Met)-GTP-eIF2 complex formation and inhibits host or viral protein synthesis. The stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex aggregates under viral infection stress to form stress granules (SGs), which encapsulate viral RNA and transcription- and translation-related proteins, thereby limiting virus proliferation. However, many viruses have evolved a corresponding escape mechanism to synthesize their own proteins in the event of host protein synthesis shutdown and SG formation caused by eIF2α phosphorylation, and viruses can block the cell replication cycle through the PERK-eIF2α pathway, providing a favorable environment for their own replication. Subsequently, viruses can induce host cell autophagy or apoptosis through the eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes the role of eIF2α in viral infection to provide a reference for studying the interactions between viruses and hosts.","Liu, Yuanzhi; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Jia, Renyong; Liu, Mafeng; Zhu, Dekang; Chen, Shun; Zhang, Shaqiu; Zhao, Xin-Xin; Huang, Juan; Mao, Sai; Ou, Xumin; Gao, Qun; Wang, Yin; Xu, Zhiwen; Chen, Zhengli; Zhu, Ling; Luo, Qihui; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Zhang, Ling; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Xiaoyue",Virol J,70,1

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified for the first time in Hubei, China in December 2019 and produced the COVID-19 pandemic, a devastating disease that led to many complications and deaths. The authorities and the global healthcare system have been alerted regarding the prevention and treatment of this pathology. Even though worldwide quarantine was declared, health care professionals, including pharmacists, have been at the frontline in this war. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the authorities relied on the involvement of the community, hospital, or clinical pharmacists in offering support to the entire population. Also, the authorities implemented measures for emergency authorization of the vaccines, or the drugs used in COVID-19 treatment. In order to facilitate the population’s access to healthcare services, the authorities have established regulations regarding, the extension of prescriptions by pharmacists, working hours, prevention of shortages and price-increase, drive-thru services, etc. However, several countries have taken financial measures to support the pharmacies’ activity. At the same time, pharmaceutical associations elaborated guidelines for the protection of pharmacists and patients alike. Additionally, the pharmacies have come to support the health system and patients by adapting pharmaceutical care to the new needs like preparation and supply of disinfectants, patient care, information, and counseling, especially to COVID-19 patients, as well as the implementation of home drugs-delivery systems. The important roles played by pharmacists were to perform COVID-19 tests and further vaccines, as well as to combat the abundance of misinformation and fake news. The clinical and hospital pharmacy services have also been adapted. Strengthening the role of the pharmacist in the medical team was important for the purpose of providing correct and complete information regarding drugs used in the COVID-19 pathology. In all these activities, pharmacists needed creativity and professionalism, but also the support of pharmacy owners and managers. With this crisis, pharmaceutical care has entered a new phase, demonstrating the ability of pharmacists to be competent and accessible providers of public health.

However, highly pathogenic strains, particularly the recently isolated SARS-CoV2, which causes COVID-19 infection, in about 15% of cases lead to severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, which causes high patient mortality. In addition, a common complication of COVID-19 is the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Why is the novel coronavirus so pathogenic? What new treatments can be proposed to speed up the recovery and subsequent rehabilitation of the organism?

However, there are still no definitive answers to these questions, while the number of the diseased is increasing daily. One of the comprehensive approaches to the treatment of the consequences of the infection is the use of multipotent human mesenchymal stromal cells and products of their secretion (secretome). Acting at several stages of the development of the infection, the components of the secretome can suppress the interaction of the virus with endothelial cells, regulate inflammation, and stimulate lung tissue regeneration, preventing the development of fibrosis.

The results suggested that the provision of data safety assurances may be key in affecting people’s intentions to use contact tracing technology, an effect we found in both samples regardless of whether messages were framed as autonomy-supportive or controlling. Those in high information safety conditions consistently reported higher intended uptake and more positive perceptions of the application than those in low information safety conditions. In Study 2, we also found that perceptions of government legitimacy related positively to intended application uptake, as did political affiliation. In sum, individuals appeared more willing to assent to authority regarding contact tracing insofar as their data safety can be assured.

We also discuss barriers that might prevent xenotransplantation from becoming common practice, such as ethical dilemmas, public concerns on xenotransplantation, and the possible risk of xenozoonosis. Given that the legal definition of decellularized porcine cornea (DPC) lies somewhere between a medical device and a xenotransplant, the preclinical efficacy and clinical trial data using DPC are included. The review finally provides perspectives on the current standpoint of corneal xenotransplantation in the fields of regenerative medicine.","Yoon, Chang Ho; Choi, Hyuk Jin; Kim, Mee Kum",Prog Retin Eye Res,70,1

An Overview of in vitro Evidence,14.103125,8.997132,2020-05-15,"The purpose of this communication is to describe the Brighter Bites produce voucher program, and its implementation and utilization across Brighter Bites families in four cities in the U.S., during the COVID-19 pandemic. The voucher program was implemented over nine weeks starting April 2020, with up to four USD 25 store-specific produce coupons sent bi-weekly to the homes of each participating Brighter Bites family (USD 100 total/family). Measures included type of produce purchased, amount of voucher that was used, number of vouchers distributed and redeemed by families, and a post-program participant satisfaction survey. Descriptive statistics, including count, frequency, and percent, were computed, both overall and stratified by city. During this time, Brighter Bites distributed a total of over 43,982 vouchers to 12,482 low-income families, with a redemption rate of 60% (at least one voucher redeemed) across all cities. During times of crisis, non-profit–for-profit partnerships, such as the one between Brighter Bites and the grocery retail industry, are feasible, and successful in providing produce to families in need.","Haidar, Amier; Markham, Christine; Marshall, Allison; Chuang, Ru-Jye; Spence, Meredith; Boone, Jennifer; Pomeroy, Mike; Dachman, Rich; Davis, Jaimie N.; Sharma, Shreela V.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,70,14

Failing to identify the possible infected people leads to unreported cases of the COVID-19, which results in massive infection among the population and even superinfection events. In this work, we study the impact of the lockdown implemented by three North African countries on reducing the infections in the pandemic’s first wave. Then, we investigate the effect of the unreported cases in the increase of the number of infected people when each country relaxed the population’s mobility in the “Eid” period, resulting in the second wave of the COVID-19. ABSTRACT: In this paper, we study a mathematical model investigating the impact of unreported cases of the COVID-19 in three North African countries: Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco. To understand how the population respects the restriction of population mobility implemented in each country, we use Google and Apple’s mobility reports. These mobility reports help to quantify the effect of the population movement restrictions on the evolution of the active infection cases. We also approximate the number of the population infected unreported, the proportion of those that need hospitalization, and estimate the end of the epidemic wave. Moreover, we use our model to estimate the second wave of the COVID-19 Algeria and Morocco and to project the end of the second wave. Finally, we suggest some additional measures that can be considered to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 and would lead to a second wave of the spread of the virus in these countries.","Djilali, Salih; Benahmadi, Lahbib; Tridane, Abdessamad; Niri, Khadija",Biology (Basel),70,12

Respiratory involvement, the main symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, means that other manifestations, such as neurological, take a back seat, with the consequent delay in diagnosis and treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All COVID-19 patients admitted with neurological symptoms or diagnosed with encephalitis since March 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Zaragoza, Spain. RESULTS: Two patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal PCR and whose clinical picture consisted of neurological alterations compatible with encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiology was negative for bacteria and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 but, given the clinical suspicion of encephalitis due to the latter, antiviral treatment with immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis was started early. Despite this, the evolution was not satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 encephalitis is a recently described clinical entity, whose pathophysiology is still unknown and no treatment with clinical evidence is available to date.","Lozano Gómez, Herminia; Pascual Bielsa, Ana; Abansés Moreno, Paula; Luque Gómez, María Pilar; Matute Guerrero, Almudena; Araiz Burdio, Juan José",Med Clin (Barc),70,16

Seasonality has been reported for many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics. Active respiratory PCR surveillance could also predict seasonal respiratory epidemics to allow for adequate planning of additional infection control measures.","Litwin, Christine M.; Bosley, James G.",Arch Virol,70,1

Exploitation of the toxic properties of nanoparticles to bacteria, viruses, and fungi has increased markedly over recent years. Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and their incorporation into other materials have been of particular interest. The potential of nanoparticles to control the formation of biofilms within the oral cavity, as a function of their antimicrobial, anti-adhesive, and delivery capabilities, is coming under close scrutiny. However, optimum formulation of materials at the nanoscale does require innovative physical and chemical approaches.","Allaker, Robert P.; Yuan, Zhiyu",Nanobiomaterials in Clinical Dentistry,70,8

METHODS: A survey was proposed to six out of nine paediatric EDs in the Emilia Romagna region to evaluate attendance data, distribution by age and gender, triage code score, outcome of clinical course, number of hospitalisations and the distribution of patients by disease. Data were collected during March 2020 and compared with that of March 2019. RESULTS: A drop in paediatric ED attendance of more than 83.8% was observed, with a higher percentage of infants and severe triage scores. The proportion of patients hospitalised was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (p value: <0.001). The effect size for the comparison of proportions of hospitalised patients was 0.379. Looking at the distribution of attendance by type of disease, a significantly different distribution was highlighted (p value: <0.00001, Cramer’s V); there was a greater proportion of patients presenting to paediatric EDs with poisonings (effect size=0.07), psychiatric pathologies (effect size=0.110), head injuries (effect size=0.167) and fever (effect size=0.212). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey suggests that in the first month of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, there has been an increase in delayed attendance and provision of care of potentially severe diseases in paediatric EDs. Hospital and community paediatricians should be aware of this phenomenon and adopt appropriate strategies to prevent this danger, as it may affect children more seriously than COVID-19 itself.","Cella, Andrea; Marchetti, Federico; Iughetti, Lorenzo; Di Biase, Anna Rita; Graziani, Giulia; De Fanti, Alessandro; Valletta, Enrico; Vaienti, Francesca; Vergine, Gianluca; Viola, Laura; Biasucci, Giacomo",BMJ Paediatr Open,70,21
