81,The Effectiveness of Contact Tracing in Emerging Epidemics,2006-12-20,"BACKGROUND: Contact tracing plays an important role in the control of emerging infectious diseases, but little is known yet about its effectiveness. Here we deduce from a generic mathematical model how effectiveness of tracing relates to various aspects of time, such as the course of individual infectivity, the (variability in) time between infection and symptom-based detection, and delays in the tracing process. In addition, the possibility of iteratively tracing of yet asymptomatic infecteds is considered. With these insights we explain why contact tracing was and will be effective for control of smallpox and SARS, only partially effective for foot-and-mouth disease, and likely not effective for influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigate contact tracing in a model of an emerging epidemic that is flexible enough to use for most infections. We consider isolation of symptomatic infecteds as the basic scenario, and express effectiveness as the proportion of contacts that need to be traced for a reproduction ratio smaller than 1. We obtain general results for special cases, which are interpreted with respect to the likely success of tracing for influenza, smallpox, SARS, and foot-and-mouth disease epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) there is no general predictive formula for the proportion to be traced as there is for the proportion to be vaccinated; (2) variability in time to detection is favourable for effective tracing; (3) tracing effectiveness need not be sensitive to the duration of the latent period and tracing delays; (4) iterative tracing primarily improves effectiveness when single-step tracing is on the brink of being effective.","Klinkenberg, Don; Fraser, Christophe; Heesterbeek, Hans",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1762362/,58

5215,The long arm of climate change: societal teleconnections and the future of climate change impacts studies,2015-01-28,"In this proof-of-concept study, we attempt to determine whether the cause-mutation relationship defined by randomness is protein dependent by predicting mutations in H5N1 neuraminidases from influenza A virus, because we have recently conducted several concept-initiated studies on the prediction of mutations in hemagglutinins from influenza A virus. In our concept-initiated studies, we defined the randomness as a cause for mutation, upon which we built a cause-mutation relationship, which is then switched into the classification problem because the occurrence and non-occurrence of mutations can be classified as unity and zero. Thereafter, we used the logistic regression and neural network to solve this classification problem to predict the mutation positions in hemagglutinins, and then used the amino acid mutating probability to predict the would-be-mutated amino acids. As the previous results were promising, we extend this approach to other proteins, such as H5N1 neuraminidase in this study, and further address various issues raised during the development of this approach. The result of this study confirms that we can use this cause-mutation relationship to predict the mutations in H5N1 neuraminidases.","Wu, G.; Yan, S.",Amino Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088166/,58
5529,Securing the food supply chain: understanding complex interdependence through agent-based simulation,2014-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is a type of megacolon induced by deficiency or dysfunction of ganglion cells in the distal intestine and is associated with developmental disorders of the enteric nervous system. To explore the mechanisms of HSCR, we analyzed the RNA-sequencing data of the expansion and the narrow segments of colon tissues separated from children with HSCR. METHODS: RNA-sequencing of the expansion segments and the narrow segments of colon tissues isolated from children with HSCR was performed. After differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the edgeR package in R, functional and pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were carried out using DAVID software. To further screen the key genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analyses were conducted separately using Cytoscape software. RESULTS: A total of 117 DEGs were identified in the expansion segment samples, including 47 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that FOS and DUSP1 were implicated in response to endogenous stimulus. In the PPI network analysis, FOS (degree=20), EGR1 (degree=16), ATF3 (degree=9), NOS1 (degree=8), CCL5 (degree=8), DUSP1 (degree=7), CXCL3 (degree=6), VIP (degree=6), FOSB (degree=5), and NOS2 (degree=4) had higher degrees, which could interact with other genes. In addition, two significant modules (module 1 and module 2) were identified from the PPI network. CONCLUSIONS: Several genes (including FOS, EGR1, ATF3, NOS1, CCL5, DUSP1, CXCL3, VIP, FOSB, and NOS2) might be involved in the development of HSCR through their effect on the nervous system.","Pan, Wei-Kang; Zhang, Ya-Fei; Yu, Hui; Gao, Ya; Zheng, Bai-Jun; Li, Peng; Xie, Chong; Ge, Xin",World J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091079/,58

In the present study, three‐dimensional numerical simulation was carried out to predict unsteady flows around a breathing human and how suspended particulate matter (SPM, diameter∼1 μm) reaches the human nose in inhalation and exhalation. In the calculation, we find out smaller breathing angle and the closer distance between the human nose and pollutant region are effective in the inhalation of SPM.","Shimazaki, Yasuhiro; Okubo, Masaaki; Yamamoto, Toshiaki",AIP Conf Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108767/,58
7310,A model for HIV/AIDS pandemic with optimal control,2015-05-15,"The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the host defense against viral and microbial infection. Exosomes constitute a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be released by almost all cell types. Owing to their capacity to shield the payload from degradation and to evade recognition and subsequent removal by the immune system, exosomes efficiently transport functional components to recipient cells. Accumulating evidence has recently shown that exosomes derived from tumor cells, host cells and even bacteria and parasites mediate the communication between the invader and innate immune cells and thus play an irreplaceable function in the dissemination of pathogens and donor cell-derived molecules, modulating the innate immune responses of the host. In this review, we describe the current understanding of EVs (mainly focusing on exosomes) and summarize and discuss their crucial roles in determining innate immune responses. Additionally, we discuss the potential of using exosomes as biomarkers and cancer vaccines in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","Zhou, Xiaoxue; Xie, Feng; Wang, Lin; Zhang, Long; Zhang, Suping; Fang, Meiyu; Zhou, Fangfang",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109106/,58

Both of these techniques have advantages. The choice between them brings into question our concepts of the degree of coloniality shown by graptoloids. Using a whole colony model. graptoloids can be shown to have sampled the water with variable efficiency. as defined in this paper. Planar forms were relatively inefficient, generally sampling less than 10% of the available water. Inclined forms frequently approached 75% efficiency. Biserial forms and strdight monograptids roulinely exceeded 100%. sampling each unit of water more than once. Rotation of the rhabdosome during movement increased the efficiency of horizontal and inclined forms. It reduced the efficiency of scandent biserials and straight monograptids. These were both advantageous effects. Astogenetic changes in colony size and form would have had a profound effect on feeding efficiency.□Graptoloid, ecology, astogeny","RIGBY, SUSAN",Lethaia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194158/,58
18135,Learning From Clinical Consensus Diagnosis in India to Facilitate Automatic Classification of Dementia: Machine Learning Study,2021-05-10,"Rifampicin (RIF) is one of the most important first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs, and more than 90% of RIF-resistant (RR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates belong to multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. In order to identify specific candidate target proteins as diagnostic markers or drug targets, differential protein expression between drug-sensitive (DS) and drug-resistant (DR) strains remains to be investigated. In the present study, a label-free, quantitative proteomics technique was performed to compare the proteome of DS, RR, MDR, and XDR clinical strains. We found iniC, Rv2141c, folB, and Rv2561 were up-regulated in both RR and MDR strains, while fadE9, espB, espL, esxK, and Rv3175 were down-regulated in the three DR strains when compared to the DS strain. In addition, lprF, mce2R, mce2B, and Rv2627c were specifically expressed in the three DR strains, and 41 proteins were not detected in the DS strain. Functional category showed that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the cell wall and cell processes. When compared to the RR strain, Rv2272, smtB, lpqB, icd1, and folK were up-regulated, while esxK, PPE19, Rv1534, rpmI, ureA, tpx, mpt64, frr, Rv3678c, esxB, esxA, and espL were down-regulated in both MDR and XDR strains. Additionally, nrp, PPE3, mntH, Rv1188, Rv1473, nadB, PPE36, and sseA were specifically expressed in both MDR and XDR strains, whereas 292 proteins were not identified when compared to the RR strain. When compared between MDR and XDR strains, 52 proteins were up-regulated, while 45 proteins were down-regulated in the XDR strain. 316 proteins were especially expressed in the XDR strain, while 92 proteins were especially detected in the MDR strain. Protein interaction networks further revealed the mechanism of their involvement in virulence and drug resistance. Therefore, these differentially expressed proteins are of great significance for exploring effective control strategies of DR-TB.","Ullah, Nadeem; Hao, Ling; Banga Ndzouboukou, Jo-Lewis; Chen, Shiyun; Wu, Yaqi; Li, Longmeng; Borham Mohamed, Eman; Hu, Yangbo; Fan, Xionglin",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157059/,58

21626,Understanding Changes in the Topology and Geometry of Financial Market Correlations during a Market Crash,2021-09-14,"Among the various methods used to improve the sound absorption capability of wood, we focused on delignification in Indonesian momala (Homalium foetidum) and Korean red toon (Toona sinensis). We performed gas permeability, pore size, and porosity analyses and evaluated how the change in the pore structure affects the sound absorption capabilities. Results show that delignification increased the through-pore porosity and improved sound absorption capability in both species. In addition, the air gap in the rear space maximized the sound absorption of momala and the red toon. The noise reduction coefficient (NRC) of delignified momala (90 min) with a 3 cm air gap was 0.359 ± 0.023. This is approximately 154.6% higher than that of untreated momala without an air gap. The NRC of delignificated red toon (90 min) with a 3 cm air gap was 0.324 ± 0.040, an increase of 604.3% over untreated red toon without an air gap.","Jang, Eun-Suk; Kang, Chun-Won",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468009/,58

Many studies have been published on this topic in recent years, which signifies the great interest and attention that this topic inspires in the community, as well as in scientists. Composite photocatalysts based on conducting polymers and metal oxides have emerged as novel and promising photoactive materials. It has been demonstrated that conducting polymers can substantially improve the photocatalytic efficiency of metal oxides owing to their superior photocatalytic activities, high conductivities, and unique electrochemical and optical properties. Consequently, conducting polymer/metal oxide composites exhibit a high photoresponse and possess a higher surface area allowing for visible light absorption, low recombination of charge carriers, and high photocatalytic performance. Herein, we provide an overview of recent advances in the development of conducting polymer/metal oxide composite photocatalysts for organic pollutant degradation and CO(2) conversion through photocatalytic processes.","Tran, Vinh Van; Nu, Truong Thi Vu; Jung, Hong-Ryun; Chang, Mincheol",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470106/,58
21739,Engineering Multigenerational Host-Modulated Microbiota against Soilborne Pathogens in Response to Global Climate Change,2021-09-03,"Several studies have investigated the effect of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) for managing chronic musculoskeletal pain, bringing contrasting results to the forefront. Thus far, however, there has been no synthesis of evidence on the effect of BoNT-A as an adjunctive treatment within a multimodal approach. Hence, Medline via PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library-CENTRAL were searched until November 2020 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of BoNT-A as an adjunctive therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The risk of bias (RoB) and the overall quality of the studies were assessed through RoB 2.0 and the GRADE approach, respectively. Meta-analysis was conducted to analyse the pooled results of the six included RCTs. Four were at a low RoB, while two were at a high RoB. The meta-analysis showed that BoNT-A as an adjunctive therapy did not significantly decrease pain compared to the sole use of traditional treatment (SDM −0.89; 95% CI −1.91; 0.12; p = 0.08). Caution should be used when interpreting such results, since the studies displayed very high heterogeneity (I = 94%, p < 0.001). The overall certainty of the evidence was very low. The data retrieved from this systematic review do not support the use of BoNT-A as an adjunctive therapy in treating chronic musculoskeletal pain.","Battista, Simone; Buzzatti, Luca; Gandolfi, Marialuisa; Finocchi, Cinzia; Falsiroli Maistrello, Luca; Viceconti, Antonello; Giardulli, Benedetto; Testa, Marco",Toxins (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473399/,58
21833,Analysis of the Effect of Emergency Ventilators on the Treatment of Critical Illness Based on Smart Medical Big Data,2021-09-21,"Psychological research is increasingly moving online, where web-based studies allow for data collection at scale. Behavioural researchers are well supported by existing tools for participant recruitment, and for building and running experiments with decent timing. However, not all techniques are portable to the Internet: While eye tracking works in tightly controlled lab conditions, webcam-based eye tracking suffers from high attrition and poorer quality due to basic limitations like webcam availability, poor image quality, and reflections on glasses and the cornea. Here we present MouseView.js, an alternative to eye tracking that can be employed in web-based research. Inspired by the visual system, MouseView.js blurs the display to mimic peripheral vision, but allows participants to move a sharp aperture that is roughly the size of the fovea. Like eye gaze, the aperture can be directed to fixate on stimuli of interest. We validated MouseView.js in an online replication (N = 165) of an established free viewing task (N = 83 existing eye-tracking datasets), and in an in-lab direct comparison with eye tracking in the same participants (﻿N = 50). Mouseview.js proved as reliable as gaze, and produced the same pattern of dwell time results. In addition, dwell time differences from MouseView.js and from eye tracking correlated highly, and related to self-report measures in similar ways. The tool is open-source, implemented in JavaScript, and usable as a standalone library, or within Gorilla, jsPsych, and PsychoJS. In sum, MouseView.js is a freely available instrument for attention-tracking that is both reliable and valid, and that can replace eye tracking in certain web-based psychological experiments.

21983,Use of the DELTA Model to Understand the Food System and Global Nutrition,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Interdisciplinary literature indicates different correlates of social media fatigue (hereinafter: SMF). Some studies show that high levels of anxiety may induce lowered Internet use and lead social media users to withdraw from Internet activities. Since the relationship between anxiety and social media use is complex, it is important to investigate mediating factors that may indirectly contribute to or exacerbate this association. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to verify whether fear of missing out (hereinafter: FoMO) is a potential factor accounting for why anxiety is associated with SMF. PARTICIPANTS, METHODS AND DATA COLLECTION: The research was conducted on a group of 264 adolescents and adults (85% women). The mean age of the respondents was M = 23.76 with SD = 5.98 (range = 14–50 years). The data were collected via online social networking among college students, their family members and friends. The participants answered the Trait Anxiety Scale (TAS), Social Media Fatigue Scale (SMFS), Fear of Missing Out Scale (FoMO), and Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). RESULTS: The outcomes showed that respondents with higher levels of trait anxiety report more intense cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and overall online fatigue. Concurrently, individuals who experience FoMO on the Internet declare being tired of social media use. Moreover, FoMO mediates the association between trait anxiety and all three dimensions of SMF, and its overall result. CONCLUSION: The present research increases our understanding of the possible role of apprehension related to missing out on the anxiety and fatigue connected to engagement in social media. It is possible to assess that trait anxiety might induce higher SMF when individuals experience a general apprehension that others are doing or having things that they do not.","Świątek, Agata H; Szcześniak, Małgorzata; Bielecka, Grażyna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488036/,58
22559,Marketing in Heterozygous Advantage,2007-02-15,"BACKGROUND: In a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of CMV-seropositive HCT recipients, letermovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant CMV infections (CS-CMVi) through 24 weeks post-HCT. We investigated the impact of letermovir prophylaxis on mortality through Week 48 post-HCT. METHODS: Adult CMV-seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA at screening who could initiate treatment by Week 4 post-HCT were eligible. Subjects stratified by high or low CMV disease risk were randomized 2:1 to letermovir dosed at 480 mg/d (240 mg/d if on cyclosporine) or placebo PO or IV through Week 14 post-HCT. Time to all-cause mortality and non-relapse mortality (defined as death due to any reason other than the indication for HCT) through Week 48 post-HCT are presented using Kaplan–Meier (KM) plots censored at study discontinuation for reasons other than death/non-relapse death or upon study completion. Distribution of time to mortality endpoints was tested by stratified log-rank tests using two-sided P-values. RESULTS: This analysis included all 565 patients randomized and treated with ≥1 dose of study drug. Subjects began study drug a median of 9 days post-HCT; 36.5% started post-engraftment. The observed KM event rate for all-cause mortality was lower in the letermovir group (10.6%) than the placebo group (15.5%) at Week 24 post-HCT, and remained lower through Week 48 post-HCT (21.4% vs. 26.2%) (Figure 1). The observed K–M event rate for all-cause mortality in subjects who developed CS-CMVi was also lower in the letermovir group (4.6%) than the placebo group (17.1%) at Week 48 post-HCT. The observed KM event rate for non-relapse mortality was lower in the letermovir group (6.9%) vs. the placebo group (11.2%) at Week 24 post-HCT, and remained lower in the letermovir group (13.9%) than the placebo group (17.5%) through Week 48 post-HCT (Figure 2). CONCLUSION: All-cause and non-relapse mortality were reduced in the letermovir group compared with the placebo group through Week 48 post-HCT (relative risk reduction ~18% and ~21%, respectively). These results are consistent with a clinically meaningful survival benefit for letermovir prophylaxis. DISCLOSURES: J.

25611,DSM in China: In Touch with Evolving Needs in the Specialty Chemicals Market,2005,"The replication of numerous pathogenic viruses depends on host proteases, which therefore emerged as potential antiviral drug targets. In some cases, e.g., for influenza viruses, their function during the viral propagation cycle is relatively well understood, where they cleave and activate viral surface glycoproteins. For other viruses, e.g., Ebola virus, the function of host proteases during replication is still not clear. Host proteases may also contribute to the pathogenicity of virus infection by activating proinflammatory cytokines. For some coronaviruses, human proteases can also serve in a nonproteolytical fashion simply as receptors for virus entry. However, blocking of such protein-protein contacts is challenging, because receptor surfaces are often flat and difficult to address with small molecules. In contrast, many proteases possess well-defined binding pockets. Therefore, they can be considered as well-druggable targets, especially, if they are extracellularly active. The number of their experimental crystal structures is steadily increasing, which is an important prerequisite for a rational structure-based inhibitor design using computational chemistry tools in combination with classical medicinal chemistry approaches. Moreover, host proteases can be considered as stable targets, and their inhibition should prevent rapid resistance developments, which is often observed when addressing viral proteins. Otherwise, the inhibition of host proteases can also affect normal physiological processes leading to a higher probability of side effects and a narrow therapeutic window. Therefore, they should be preferably used in combination therapies with additional antiviral drugs. This strategy should provide a stronger antiviral efficacy, allow to use lower drug doses, and minimize side effects. Despite numerous experimental findings on their antiviral activity, no small-molecule inhibitors of host proteases have been approved for the treatment of virus infections, so far.","Steinmetzer, Torsten; Hardes, Kornelia",Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122247/,58

In plant viruses, the −1 frameshift stimulatory element consists of either (i) a small pseudoknot stabilized by many triple-stranded regions and a triple base pair containing a protonated cytidine at the helical junction, (ii) an unusual apical loop–internal loop interaction in which a stem-loop in the 3(′) untranslated region 4 kb downstream base pairs to a bulged stem-loop at the frameshift site, or (iii) a potential simple stem-loop. Other less well-characterized changes in reading frame occur on plant viral RNAs, including a possible +1 frameshift, and net −1 reading frame changes that do not utilize canonical frameshift signals. All these studies reveal the remarkable ways in which plant viral RNAs interact with ribosomes to precisely control protein expression at the ratios needed to sustain virus replication.","Miller, W.

26113,A Security Culture,2010-03-03,"In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of foodborne diseases worldwide, with viruses now being recognized as a major cause of these illnesses. The most common viruses implicated in foodborne disease are enteric viruses, which are found in the human gastrointestinal tract, excreted in human feces and transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Many different viruses are found in the gastrointestinal tract but not all are recognized as foodborne pathogens. The diseases caused by enteric viruses fall into three main types: gastroenteritis, enterically transmitted hepatitis, and illnesses that can affect other parts of the body such as the eye, the respiratory system and the central nervous system leading to conjunctivitis, poliomyelitis, meningitis and encephalitis. Viral pathogens excreted in human feces include noroviruses, sapoviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), rotaviruses, and astroviruses. Most of these viruses have been associated with foodborne disease outbreaks. Noroviruses and HAV are commonly identified as foodborne causes of gastroenteritis and acute hepatitis, respectively.","Greening, Gail E.; Cannon, Jennifer L.",Viruses in Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122939/,58

A recent problem in this field is the learning of low-dimensional nonlinear manifolds under L0-norm constraints for error terms. Despite significant efforts, no method that consistently treats such features exists. We propose a novel unsupervised outlier detection method, L0-norm Constrained Autoencoders (L0-AE), based on an autoencoder-based detector with L0-norm constraints for error terms. Unlike existing methods, the proposed optimization procedure of L0-AE provably guarantees the convergence of the objective function under a mild condition, while neither the relaxation of the L0-norm constraint nor the linearity of the latent manifold is enforced. Experimental results show that the proposed L0-AE is more robust and accurate than other reconstruction-based methods, as well as conventional methods such as Isolation Forest.","Ishii, Yoshinao; Koide, Satoshi; Hayakawa, Keiichiro",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206274/,58

Stealing the card details to perform online transactions, which is called fraud, has also seen more frequently. Preventive solutions and instant fraud detection methods are widely studied due to critical financial losses in many industries. In this work, a Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) model for the real-time detection of credit card frauds on the streaming Card-Not-Present (CNP) transactions is investigated with the use of different attributes of card transactions. Numerical, hand-crafted numerical, categorical and textual attributes are combined to form a feature vector to be used as a training instance. One of the contributions of this work is to employ transaction aggregation for the categorical values and inclusion of vectors from a character level word embedding model which is trained on the merchant names of the transactions. The other contribution is introducing a new strategy for training dataset generation employing the sliding window approach in a given time frame to adapt to the changes on the trends of fraudulent transactions. In the experiments, the feature engineering strategy and the automated training set generation methodology are evaluated on the real credit card transactions.","Yeşilkanat, Ali; Bayram, Barış; Köroğlu, Bilge; Arslan, Seçil",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256395/,58

34977,It’s not a cold war: competition and cooperation in US–China relations,2020-06-19,"This paper presents a way to improve the boundary shape modeling process in solving boundary value problems in elasticity. The inclusion of NURBS curves into the mathematical formalism of the parametric integral equations system method (PIES) is proposed. The advantages of such an application are widely discussed. Recently, the Bezier curves, mainly the cubic curves (of third-degree), were used. The segments of the boundary shape were modeled by such curves (with ensuring continuity at the connection points). Using NURBS curves, the boundary shape can be modeled with only one curve. So, continuity is automatically ensured. Additionally, the second degree NURBS curve is enough to obtain the shape with high accuracy (better than cubic Bezier curves). The NURBS curve is defined by points, their weights and knots vector. Such parameters significantly improve the shape modification process, which can directly improve e.g. the shape identification process. To examine the impact of modeling accuracy on the final PIES solutions, examples described by the Navier-Lamé equations were used. To improve calculations, the PIES method using NURBS curves was implemented as a computer program. Then, it was decided to verify the accuracy of the obtained solutions. For comparison, the solutions were also obtained using analytical solutions, boundary element method, and PIES method (with the Bezier curves). An improvement in the boundary shape modeling was noticed. It significantly affects the accuracy of solutions. As a result, the consumption of computer resources was reduced, while the process of boundary shape modeling and the accuracy of the obtained results were improved.","Kapturczak, Marta; Zieniuk, Eugeniusz; Kużelewski, Andrzej",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302830/,58

In most studies, increased risk of ill health in women with IDD and health and developmental problems in their children were fully or partially accounted for by socioeconomic and psychosocial hardships. New research has found that pregnant women with IDD tend to have risk factors for pregnancy, birth, and postpartum complications that may contribute to adverse child outcomes. Intervention research is gradually becoming more contextualized. SUMMARY: More studies are needed on multicultural aspects of parenting, programs that could help parents with IDD overcome social and health disadvantages, comprehensive and coordinated service models that start during pregnancy, innovative parent support arrangements, parenting education for teens and young adults with IDD, use of technology, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based programs.","Feldman, Maurice A.; Aunos, Marjorie",Curr Dev Disord Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324308/,58

Object detectors, mainly those which are based on Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) have received great attention from many researchers because they were able to yield remarkable results. However, most of them fail when it comes to detecting overlapping and small objects in images. There are two families of detectors: the first family detects more objects but with imprecise bounding boxes, while those of the second family do the opposite. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by combining the two families, in a way similar to classifier combination. Our solution has been validated through the combination of two famous detectors, Faster R-CNN which detects more objects and YOLO which produces accurate bounding boxes. However, it is more general and it can be applied to other detectors.

37617,Impacts of service robots on service quality,2020-08-07,"BACKGROUND: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a deficiency of the fetal diaphragm resulting in herniation of the abdominal viscera into the thoracic cavity. The best method of respiratory management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is unclear, but high frequency oscillatory ventilation is often used as the initial ventilator mode for severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia. When it becomes impossible to maintain the pre-ductal saturations, the timing of successful switching of the ventilation mode from high frequency oscillatory ventilation to conventional mechanical ventilation remains unclear. Herein, we reported two cases in which airway resistance measurements based on pulmonary function tests were used for making the decision to switch the ventilator mode from high frequency oscillatory ventilation to conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with left isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia. CASE PRESENTATION: Two 0-day-old infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia were admitted to our hospital. In both patients, high frequency oscillatory ventilation was started initially, and the levels of saturation gradually rose within a few hours after birth. After 24 h of high frequency oscillatory ventilation, the level of saturation decreased, and the dissociation of pre-ductal and post-ductal saturation re-occurred. The respiratory-system resistance was 515 and 403 cmH(2)O·kg/L/s, respectively. Because the respiratory-system resistance was elevated, we decided to change the ventilator mode from high frequency oscillatory ventilation to conventional mechanical ventilation. After switching to conventional mechanical ventilation, the patients’ heart rate and saturation increased immediately. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, resistance levels of > 400 cmH(2)O·kg/L/s may indicate high airway resistance and suggest greater alveolar vibration attenuation. When respiratory-system resistance reaches over 400 cmH(2)O·kg/L/s, it may be an optimal time for switching from high frequency oscillatory ventilation to conventional mechanical ventilation.","Kimura, Sasagu; Toyoshima, Katsuaki; Shimokaze, Tomoaki; Hoshino, Rikuo",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7396326/,58

However, forming the question appropriately, and locating and integrating the best solution back to the code can be tricky and time consuming. As a result, several mining systems have been proposed to aid developers in the task of locating reusable snippets and integrating them into their source code. Most of these systems, however, do not model the semantics of the snippets in the context of source code provided. In this work, we propose a snippet mining system, named StackSearch, that extracts semantic information from Stack Overlow posts and recommends useful and in-context snippets to the developer. Using a hybrid language model that combines Tf-Idf and fastText, our system effectively understands the meaning of the given query and retrieves semantically similar posts. Moreover, the results are accompanied with useful metadata using a named entity recognition technique. Upon evaluating our system in a set of common programming queries, in a dataset based on post links, and against a similar tool, we argue that our approach can be useful for recommending ready-to-use snippets to the developer.","Diamantopoulos, Themistoklis; Oikonomou, Nikolaos; Symeonidis, Andreas",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418136/,58

Although we are beginning to talk more and more about health communication, it is, in the common view, still too often identified as a soft skill of the individual professional, and therefore as a minor competence in public health. Fortunately, many of today's public health leaders realize that promoting health and protecting the public require effective public health communication - as emerged clearly during EUPHA2019 conference in Marseille. The essential components of the communication process (channel, source, receiver, and message) are dynamic and change continuously in public health: emergencies follow one another rapidly, and communication channels evolve very quickly in the digital era. The impact, trust, and authority of traditional media are in decline. People are also willing to actively participate and share their views and information, including on health issues, through social networks. This explains the emergence of the new social media (blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok) as a central space for communicating and re-connecting with the public. Websites were mentioned as widely used to convey health messages, like ongoing health campaigns addressed to different groups (e.g. campaign on seasonal influenza vaccination) or during crisis communication (e.g. absolutely up to date is the example of coronavirus disease 2019). This workshop aims to explore the importance of appropriate communication by analysing practical examples of the diversity of communication modalities, language, target audiences and objectives. Furthermore, public health communication, to be effective, requires an integrated approach to engage the relevant stakeholders such as research institutes, health professionals, partner organisations (e.g. private institutions), policymakers, associations (e.g. population representatives, patients' associations, CSOs/NGOs, citizens associations protecting the poor) and individuals. The use of health communication principles is fundamental at all levels, from government organizations and agencies at central and sub-national level to individuals and citizens: public health experts need to advocate policymakers and all stakeholders, who interact with each other determine the health system and its governance and are involved in the decision-making process, to empower the population, that never more than now require to be the principal actor in their own health decision. KEY MESSAGES: Public health communication is an essential component of any effective public health strategy and initiative, yet it is often neglected and under-resourced. Communication in public health is multifaceted: it is required in a diverse range of scenarios; it may target different population groups and engage various institutions and experts.",,Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543501/,58

First, α-methylene-β-hydroxy esters were prepared as precursors of allylic bromides. A reaction involving the generated bromides and sodium selenocyanate was conducted to produce the desired selenocyanates (3a-f). We next prepared cultures of neurons from 7-day-old mice (n = 36). H(2)O(2) (10(−5) M) was added into the culture flasks as an oxidative stress inducer, alone or combined with one of each designed compounds. (PhSe)(2) was used as a positive control. It was carried out assessment of lipid (thiobarbituric acid reactive species, 4-hydroxy-2′-nonenal, 8-isoprostane), DNA (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine), and protein (carbonyl) modification parameters. Finally, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were also evaluated. Among the compounds, 3b, 3d, and 3f exhibited the most pronounced pattern of antioxidant activity, similar to (PhSe)(2). These novel aromatic selenocyanates could be promising to be tried in most sophisticated in vitro studies or even at the preclinical level.","Frizon, Tiago E.

The implications of this migration on critical praxis—the theory-in-practice of pedagogy—deserve further scrutiny. This paper explores how teacher and student-led educational technology research and development can help rethink online critical praxis. The paper is based on a recent research project at the University of Edinburgh that speculatively explored the potential for automation in teaching, which generated insights into current and future pedagogical practice among both teachers and students. From this project emerged a series of pedagogical positions that were centred around visions of the future of teaching in response to automation: the pedagogical potential of visibility and invisibility online, transparency, and interrogating the hidden curricula of both higher education and educational technology itself. Through the surfacing of these pedagogical positions, this paper explores how critical pedagogy can be built into the broader teacher function and begins to identify the institutional structures that could potentially impede or accelerate that process.","Gallagher, Michael; Breines, Markus; Blaney, Myles",Postdigit Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7594998/,58

On the one hand, because of its pro-inflammatory state, that may aggravate or trigger flares in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). On the other hand, the risk of an immunosuppressive therapy during the active phase SARS-coV-2 infection that may lead to catastrophic outcomes. We report a case of a 24-year-old female newly diagnosed with SLE during COVID-19 pandemic who developed COVID-19 infection during her induction treatment for lupus nephritis. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old Nepali female, with no past medical history of note, presented to her regional hospital with a history of flu-like symptoms few days ago, peripheral oedema, acute kidney injury with proteinuria and hypertension. Further investigations showed a high titre of double-stranded DNA antibodies, anti-cardiolipin IgM and B2 microglobulin positive and low C3. She also developed a haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia during her admission. She received pulsed steroid therapy and was started on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for a probable lupus nephritis awaiting the results of biopsy, which showed later a lupus nephritis Class IV-G with active lesions. She then developed symptoms of COVID-19 infection and had a positive PCR leading to an interruption of her induction therapy. She was recruited to the RECOVERY trial on the lopinavir-ritonavir arm and made a good recovery. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: It is well known that viruses can trigger or aggravate auto-immune response in patients predisposed genetically. However, the role of SARS-coV-2 is not elucidated yet. The EULAR COVID-19 registry showed that rheumatoid arthritis and SLE were the most prevalent rheumatic diseases, and there was an increased risk in those who are on moderate to high dose corticosteroids. In patients with SLE and COVID-19 infection, it is agreed by all the national and international rheumatology societies to interrupt their immunosuppressive therapy until the symptoms resolve, especially those with renal involvement or an active disease. Which is the case in our patient. Luckily, she resumed her MMF a month later after a negative PCR and her renal function has continued to improve. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: Lupus nephritis is a major risk factor for overall morbidity and mortality in SLE. It requires an early immunosuppressive treatment to induce remission. Randomized clinical trials showed that MMF is at least equally effective as cyclophosphamide in inducing remission and that it has been associated with a reduced risk of infection and amenorrhea. It seems to be a suitable alternative in women of childbearing age. In patients with concomitant COVID-19 disease, immunosuppressive therapy should be paused until the symptoms improve.","Dahou, Selma; Leach, Tim; Bostock, Kathryn; Louden, Jonathan; Raj, Jonathan; Ghedia, Shivan",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607360/,58

We explored antibiotic utilization before, during and after the COVID-19 surge in Michigan. METHODS: Cross-sectional study at an 877-bed hospital in Detroit, Michigan from January 2019 through May 2020. Measures: Count of COVID-19 hospital admissions by day. Monthly antibiotic utilization for formulary agents used to treat pneumonia were measured using monthly days of therapy (DOT) per 1000 patient days present and the National Health Care Safety Network Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR). Descriptive analysis was utilized. RESULTS: The first COVID-19 case was detected March 11, 2020 and peaked in early April (Figure 1). Antibiotic utilization is demonstrated in Figure 2. The COVID-19 peak was associated with increased use of multiple antibiotics; notably, DOT per 1000 days present for ceftriaxone, cefepime and doxycycline were 85.43, 79.42 and 71.56, respectively in April. The institutional all-antibacterial SAAR was significantly reduced in May at 0.96, p=0.0022, after the COVID-19 surge. Figure 1 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We observed increased utilization of multiple antibiotics during the COVID-19 surge, and reduction in the all-antibacterial SAAR after the surge.

Our objective was to compare serum concentration of a panel of adipocytokines between obese and non-obese individuals and identify any distinct patterns correlating with insulin sensitivity in obesity. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional study among obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m(2), n=62) and non-obese (BMI <25 kg/m(2), n=32) individuals to compare circulating levels of the adipokines, such as adiponectin and resistin in conjunction with the measurement of the levels of inflammatory cytokines including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α using Luminex multiplex immunoassay with drop array technology. Correlations between circulating adipocytokine levels and those of multiple well-established markers of insulin resistance including homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index were also established. RESULTS: CRP, IL-8, MCP-1, and TNF-α levels were higher in obese than non-obese individuals; the CRP and IL-8 differences were statistically significant. CRP correlated significantly with markers of insulin resistance (fasting plasma insulin, HOMA-IR, and QUICKI), and adiponectin correlated with HOMA-β in obese individuals. We divided the group of obese individuals on the basis of HOMA-IR levels into insulin-resistant (IR; HOMA-IR ≥2.5) and insulin-sensitive (IS; HOMA-IR <2.5) groups; and 43 out of 62 participants were IR despite comparable BMIs. An overall proinflammatory profile was compared between IR and IS obese, though the values were higher in IR obese but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: Obesity is associated with a general inflammatory milieu and a crosstalk between adipocytokines and insulin resistance is complex as well as multifactorial.","Sachan, Astha; Singh, Archna; Shukla, Sakshi; Aggarwal, Sandeep; Mir, Ishfaq; Yadav, Rakhee",J Obes Metab Syndr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7789018/,58

Recently, mobile phone location datasets have been suggested for mining activity patterns because of their utility and large sample sizes. Although recently machine learning-based models seem to perform well in activity purpose inference using mobile phone location data, most of these models work as black boxes. To address these challenges, this study proposes a flexible white box method to mine human activity chains from large-scale mobile phone location data by integrating both the spatial and temporal features of daily activities with varying weights. We find that the frequency distribution of major activity chain patterns agrees well with the patterns derived based on a travel survey of Shenzhen and a state-of-the-art method. Moreover, a dataset covering over 16.5% of the city population can yield a reasonable outcome of the major activity patterns. The contributions of this study not only lie in offering an effective approach to mining daily activity chains from mobile phone location data but also involve investigating the impact of different data conditions on the model performance, which make using big trajectory data more practical for domain experts.","Yin, Ling; Lin, Nan; Zhao, Zhiyuan",Cities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809620/,58

Nevertheless, conflicts and contradictions always exist between parent and subsidiary enterprises; if they are in different countries, these conflicts can become especially problematic. Internal control systems for subsidiary supervision and management seem to be particularly important when aiming to align subsidiaries’ decisions with parent enterprises’ strategic intentions, and such systems undoubtedly involve numerous criteria/dimensions. An effective tool is urgently needed to clarify the relevant issues and discern the cause-and-effect relationships among them in these conflicts. Traditional statistical approaches cannot fully explain these situations due to the complexity and invisibility of the criteria/dimensions; thus, the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST), with its superior data exploration ability and impreciseness tolerance, can be considered to adequately address the complexities. Motivated by efficient integrated systems, aggregating multiple dissimilar systems’ outputs and converting them into a consensus result can be useful for realizing outstanding performances. Based on this concept, we insert selected criteria/dimensions via FRST into DEMATEL to identify and analyze the dependency and feedback relations among variables of parent/subsidiary gaps and conflicts. The results present the improvement priorities based on their magnitude of impact, in the following order: organizational control structure, business and financial information system management, major financial management, business strategy management, construction of a management system, and integrated audit management.

45563,Circular Agreements—Exploring the Role of Agreements and Deals as a Political Tool for a Circular Economy,2021-02-09,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most economically important viral diseases that can affect livestock. In the last 70 years, use of an inactivated whole antigen vaccine has contributed to the eradication of disease from many developed nations. However, recent outbreaks in Europe and Eastern Asia demonstrated that infection can spread as wildfire causing economic and social devastation. Therefore, it is essential to develop new control strategies that could confer early protection and rapidly stop disease spread. Live attenuated vaccines (LAV) are one of the best choices to obtain a strong early and long-lasting protection against viral diseases. In proof of concept studies, we previously demonstrated that “synonymous codon deoptimization” could be applied to the P1 capsid coding region of the viral genome to derive attenuated FMDV serotype A12 strains. Here, we demonstrate that a similar approach can be extended to the highly conserved non-structural P2 and P3 coding regions, providing a backbone for multiple serotype FMDV LAV development. Engineered codon deoptimized P2, P3 or P2, and P3 combined regions were included into the A(24)Cruzeiro infectious clone optimized for vaccine production, resulting in viable progeny that exhibited different degrees of attenuation in cell culture, in mice, and in the natural host (swine). Derived strains were thoroughly characterized in vitro and in vivo. Our work demonstrates that overall, the entire FMDV genome tolerates codon deoptimization, highlighting the potential of using this technology to derive novel improved LAV candidates.","Diaz-San Segundo, Fayna; Medina, Gisselle N.; Spinard, Edward; Kloc, Anna; Ramirez-Medina, Elizabeth; Azzinaro, Paul; Mueller, Steffen; Rieder, Elizabeth; de los Santos, Teresa",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7861043/,58

The empirical section of the paper is organised around three aspects of the Labour campaign narrative: its promise to provide a national ‘alternative’, its mobilisation of Corbyn as simultaneously an individual and an icon, and its use of rallies and social media as alternative stages from which to project its meanings. It identifies the material conditioning, coding and counter-coding, narrativisation and counter-narrativisation of key events, issues, and figures, demonstrating how the substantive contestation of the campaign occurred within a consensual formal grammar that constrained symbolic action and often produced consequences unintended by cultural workers themselves. It, therefore, demonstrates how culture retained a relative autonomy in influencing meaning outcomes in part due to its formal semiotic logic. It introduces the notion of ‘code-rerouting’ to cultural sociology’s stock of conceptual tools and highlights how failure to conform to the structuring norms of civil rituals, such as presenting oneself to public scrutiny during a campaign, or failure to project coherence between surface and depth, individual and icon, past and present, or between private and public can prove fatal to performative felicity.","Morgan, Marcus",Am J Cult Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7882464/,58
46005,Digital Government and Sustainable Development,2021-02-20,"[Image: see text] The COVID-19 outbreak has exposed the world’s preparation to fight against unknown/unexplored infectious and life-threatening pathogens. The unavailability of vaccines, slow or sometimes unreliable real-time virus/bacteria detection techniques, insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE), and a shortage of ventilators and many other transportation equipments have further raised serious concerns. Material research has been playing a pivotal role in developing antimicrobial agents for water treatment and photodynamic therapy, fast and ultrasensitive biosensors for virus/biomarkers detection, as well as for relevant biomedical and environmental applications. It has been noticed that these research efforts nowadays primarily focus on the nanomaterials-based platforms owing to their simplicity, reliability, and feasibility. In particular, nanostructured fluorescent materials have shown key potential due to their fascinating optical and unique properties at the nanoscale to combat against a COVID-19 kind of pandemic. Keeping these points in mind, this review attempts to give a perspective on the four key fluorescent materials of different families, including carbon dots, metal nanoclusters, aggregation-induced-emission luminogens, and MXenes, which possess great potential for the development of ultrasensitive biosensors and infective antimicrobial agents to fight against various infections/diseases.

46903,Preface of Special Issue on Social Networks Analysis and Mining,2021-03-15,"BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication in orthopedics and trauma surgery. A potential increase in PJI diagnoses, especially in combination with psychological comorbidities may become a significant challenge for healthcare stakeholders. So far, the prevalence for Germany is unknown, which makes it difficult to estimate future treatment demand or to predict developments that can be influenced by adapting prevention and treatment measures. OBJECTIVES: The present study provides a detailed overview of the epidemiology of periprosthetic joint infections and psychological comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dataset provided by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) consisting of annual, Germany-wide ICD-10 diagnosis codes from 2009 through 2019 was analyzed. Incidences of the code “T84.5—Infection and inflammatory reaction due to joint arthroplasty” were quantified, and a detailed breakdown of this data by age group and gender was performed. Prevalence rates of secondary diagnoses of the ICD-10 chapter F were determined. RESULTS: PJI diagnoses have been steadily increasing since 2009. The incidence declined in 2018. In 2019, 16,174 cases were registered, corresponding to a prevalence of 23.8/100,000 population. A trend towards more diagnoses in elderly patients became evident. Twenty-five percent of all patients had a secondary diagnosis regarding mental and behavioural disorders. The number of patients with psychological comorbidities doubled in the last decade. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines on prevention strategies as well as psychological support services should be implemented in trauma surgery.","Walter, Nike; Rupp, Markus; Hinterberger, Thilo; Alt, Volker",Orthopade,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7942820/,58

For these children and youth, any stability they may have experienced since entering care has been disrupted and their contact with parents limited. A sudden shift to virtual only contact meant both parents and caregivers were in need of support to navigate these changes. This study reports on the rapid development and implementation of an eLearning and structured practice guide for visitation supervisors to help them facilitate virtual visits that promote parent-caregiver collaboration in support of the child. Over a four month period, April to August 2020, 140 people registered for the Supportive Virtual Family Time training. Of these participants, 101 (72%) completed a post-training survey which included an evaluation of the eLearning and assessment of the feasibility of implementing the model. Overall, participants were satisfied with the training content and delivery, agreed the training helped them develop new skills for interacting with parents and caregivers, and planned to start using the model right away. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic, there is likely continued need for virtual family time and training and support for supervisors who facilitate these interactions. It is critical these supports are timely, easily accessible, and include practice guidelines and resources that help practitioners facilitate and maintain youths’ critical attachments to their families.

Demographics, hospital and ICU length of stay, duration of ECMO therapy, days on mechanical ventilation, fluid balance, need for decompressive laparotomy, amount of blood products, prognostic scores (CCI (Charlson Comorbidity Index), SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), RESP(Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction), SAVE (Survival after Veno-Arterial ECMO)), and the total known length of survival were assessed. Results: A total of n = 495 patients underwent ECMO. Eight patients with acute pancreatitis received ECLS (seven veno-venous, one veno-arterial). Five (71%) required decompressive laparotomy as salvage therapy due to abdominal hypertension. Two patients with acute pancreatitis (25%) survived to hospital discharge. The overall median length of survival was 22 days. Survivors required less fluid in the first 72 h of ECMO support and showed lower values for all prognostic scores. Conclusion: ECLS can be performed as a rescue therapy in patients with pancreatitis and secondary ARDS, but nevertheless mortality remains still high. Thus, this last-resort therapy may be best suited for patients with fewer pre-existing comorbidities and no other organ failure.","Schmandt, Mathias; Glowka, Tim R.; Kreyer, Stefan; Muders, Thomas; Muenster, Stefan; Theuerkauf, Nils Ulrich; Kalff, Jörg C.; Putensen, Christian; Schewe, Jens-Christian; Ehrentraut, Stefan Felix",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7958117/,58

47111,Challenges and Opportunities in Renewable Energy Developments,2020-08-12,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with a poor prognosis and a dismal survival rate. Oncolytic virus (OV) is an anticancer approach that utilizes replication-competent viruses to preferentially infect and kill tumor cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), one such OV, is already in several phase I clinical trials against different malignancies. VSV-based recombinant viruses are effective OVs against a majority of tested PDAC cell lines. However, some PDAC cell lines are resistant to VSV. This review discusses multiple mechanisms responsible for the resistance of some PDACs to VSV-based OV therapy, as well multiple rational approaches to enhance permissiveness of PDACs to VSV and expand the spectrum of PDACs responsive to VSV-based oncolytic virotherapy. ABSTRACT: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating malignancy with poor prognosis and a dismal survival rate, expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Oncolytic virus (OV) is an anticancer approach that utilizes replication-competent viruses to preferentially infect and kill tumor cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), one such OV, is already in several phase I clinical trials against different malignancies. VSV-based recombinant viruses are effective OVs against a majority of tested PDAC cell lines. However, some PDAC cell lines are resistant to VSV. Upregulated type I IFN signaling and constitutive expression of a subset of interferon-simulated genes (ISGs) play a major role in such resistance, while other mechanisms, such as inefficient viral attachment and resistance to VSV-mediated apoptosis, also play a role in some PDACs. Several alternative approaches have been shown to break the resistance of PDACs to VSV without compromising VSV oncoselectivity, including (i) combinations of VSV with JAK1/2 inhibitors (such as ruxolitinib); (ii) triple combinations of VSV with ruxolitinib and polycations improving both VSV replication and attachment; (iii) combinations of VSV with chemotherapeutic drugs (such as paclitaxel) arresting cells in the G2/M phase; (iv) arming VSV with p53 transgenes; (v) directed evolution approach producing more effective OVs. The latter study demonstrated impressive long-term genomic stability of complex VSV recombinants encoding large transgenes, supporting further clinical development of VSV as safe therapeutics for PDAC.","Holbrook, Molly C.; Goad, Dakota W.; Grdzelishvili, Valery Z.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7963195/,58

The fieldwork was conducted during a period of institutionalisation of democratic practices within the UK House of Commons Select Committee system. Whilst these democratic processes, notably elections to chair positions have widely been praised for improving the standing of the select committee system by moving the power of appointment away from party whips, the dynamics of gender in these changes, such as in elections and performing leadership, makes for a timely investigation and highlights some intricate power relations. The chapter then explores how citizenship is performed in the informal spaces of the House of Commons: in practices of time management, the domestic committees of the House of Commons and journalist relationships. Finally, the chapter explores how gender is performed in place of the lack of a job description and in the context of a lack of a gender lens to online and offline accountabilities.","Miller, Cherry M.",Gendering the Everyday in the UK House of Commons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971652/,58

The epilogue to the volume considers how linguistic diversity might be preserved or encouraged in the future. Chinese is one of the most diverse languages use in Macau, but there are internal and external pressures to adopt Putonghua as a standardised variety of Chinese. While there appears to be no immediate end to the dominance of Cantonese within the territory, other varieties (most notably Hokkien) may continue to find the number of using diminished in the future. While there are strong local commitments to learning as using English as a tertiary medium of instruction, there are also recognisable ways in which English’s dominance in universities is eroding. Finally, Portuguese has been endangered within the territory for nearly a hundred years and there is little reason to expect that government commitments to Portuguese will eventually prevent the loss of the variety.","Moody, Andrew J.",Macau&#x02019;s Languages in Society and Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971741/,58

However, in order to satisfy the service requirements of the User Equipments (UEs) applications, Radio Resource Management (RRM) mechanisms implemented in evolved NodeB (eNB) need to use efficient techniques to overcome limitations such as bandwidth scarcity, path loss, and channel fading. Therefore, this paper proposes a new channel-aware scheduling algorithm. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to improve the cell edge throughput if compared to other algorithms.

Three CenterNet models with various backbones were implemented, namely, ResNet-18, DLA-34, and Hourglass. A fruit dataset with four classes and 1,690 images was established for this research project. By comparing those models, followed the experimental results, the deep learning-based model with DLA-34 was selected as the final model to detect fruits from digital images, the performance is excellent. In this paper, the contribution is that we deploy a model based on CenterNet for visual object detection to resolve the problem of fruit detection. Meanwhile, there are 1,690 images distributed in four classes. Throughout evaluating the performance of the model, we eventually affirm the CenterNet based on DLA-34 to detect multiclass fruits from our images.

Let L be the maximum Euclidean length of the segments in E and h be the minimum distance between two consecutive segments in E. The running time of our algorithm is [Formula: see text] . Currently, the running time of finding the exact shortest path for this problem is exponential. Thus, most practical algorithms of this problem are approximations. Among these practical algorithms, placing discrete points, named Steiner points, on every segment in E, then constructing a graph to find an approximate path between s and t, is most widely used in practice. However, using Steiner points will cause the running time of this approach to always depend on a polynomial function of the term [Formula: see text] , which is not a close optimal solution. Differently, in this paper, we solve the problem directly in a continuous environment, without using Steiner points, in terms of the running time depending on a logarithmic function of the term [Formula: see text] , which we call a close optimal solution.","Tran, Nguyet; Dinneen, Michael J.",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971841/,58

These efforts had an important impact on media and were mainly concern with the pandemic recovery phase. When confinement ends, recovery phase must be accurate planned at a local level. Health System (HS) capacity, specially ICUs and plants capacity and availability, would remain the key stone in this pandemic life cycle phase. This Chapter describes: First the important of the action plans design by local level, while a unique decision-making center is considered by country; Second, a management tool based on a ICUs and plants capacity model to estimate ICUs and plants saturation, and with these results, set new local and temporal confinement measures. The tool allows a dynamic analysis to estimate maximum Ro saturation scenarios; Third, a practical management tools to tackle the deconfinement strategy design problem. A proper control system to follow the course of action, especially in a scenario with unprecedent uncertainty, is developed. In all cases, it is remarked the importance of R (the pandemic basic and effective reproductive number), first as a variable to monitor and control the pandemic, to ensure its decline; second as a target to score risks associated to start certain activities over, after confinement. Reducing the potential increase in the value of R, when any type of activity is re-opening, guides the strategy. One common objective in these initiatives: Applying asset management principles to accelerate as much as possible socioeconomic normalization with a strict control over HS relapses risk.","Márquez, Adolfo Crespo",14th WCEAM Proceedings,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972119/,58

We used formal logical and heuristic research methods to solve the problem of component and factor analysis of ICTPLR, including classification and typology, induction and deduction, proof, comparison, analysis and synthesis. As a result, we substantiated that it is advisable to group ICTPLR indicators in the context of the following components: social, economic, software and hardware, and consumer. We proposed to analyze ICTPLR of an enterprise or a region in relation to two aspects of assessment: the first is the digitalization level of the labor activity of economic entities; the second is the level of knowledge and competence of employees in the field of information and communications technologies (ICT). Inconsistency between these two aspects can lead to excessive ICT provision and inefficient digitalization costs. Insufficient level of ICT provision or other imbalances negatively affect the productivity of employees, which requires corrective management decisions. A formula for calculating the dynamic labor productivity determined by the influence of ICTPLR is proposed. The study substantiated that the increase in ICTPLR, which is not accompanied by outstripping growth in revenue from the sale of goods, works, services or corresponding decrease in the number of employees, leads to decrease in labor productivity.","Panshin, Ilya V.; Yares, Olga B.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972265/,58

48595,Association of Sociodemographic Factors with the Evolution of COVID 19 Infections: Ecuadorian Case Study,2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic refractory constipation show colon dysmotility, including impaired coordination of descending colon-sigmoid colon-rectum-anal sphincter motor functions; this may involve slow colonic transit and colo-anal dyssynergia. Impaired neuronal communication between the sacral defecation center and the distal colon may be causative. In addition, patients with lumbosacral neurological conditions (with lower back pain) may not be able to evoke an effective defecation reflex. AIMS: To evaluate if a single therapeutic session of sacral low-level laser therapy (LLLT) would affect the autonomic activity in patients with chronic constipation as revealed by changes in heart rate variability, and to report a multi-session treatment case study. METHODS: In 41 patients with chronic constipation, one session of LLLT was executed, using red LED light at a wavelength of 660 nm for 10 minutes and infrared LED light at wavelength of 840 nm for 10 minutes followed by infrared laser light with wavelength of 825 nm for 20 minutes, while measuring the electrocardiogram. One patient received this treatment 8x over 3 weeks. RESULTS: The lumbar-sacral light array treatment showed a significant decrease in parasympathetic activity (RSA & RMSSD) whereas pure sacral laser light treatment showed a significant increase in parasympathetic activity (RSA & RMSSD) as well as a reduction in sympathetic activity (Baevsky’s stress index: SI) (table). A single session of LLLT was also executed during HRCM in 8 patients with some but not all showing evoked colonic motility. Before COVID-19 shutdown, one patient was successfully treated. With a history of chronic constipation without ability to have spontaneous bowel movements for 5 years, symptoms improved from 13 to 8 (on a 20 scale) and quality of life improved from 1.5 to 2.5 (on a 0–4 scale) after 8 sessions. Sympathetic reactivity from supine to standing markedly reduced, from highly elevated measured as the Baevsky index from 55 to 153 s(-2) it improved from 42 to 75 s(-2) upon standing after 4 sessions. Parasympathetic reactivity did not change. CONCLUSIONS: A single session of sacral LLLT markedly affected autonomic nervous activity reflected in changes in HRV. The LLLT is likely affecting the sacral defecation center through peripheral nerves entering and exiting the spinal cord including the dorsal root ganglia. LLLT treatment of a patient with inability to generate spontaneous bowel movements, resulted in ability to have complete evacuations associated with marked reduction in sympathetic reactivity during the supine-standing test, after 4 LLLT sessions.

Systems theory constructs effective models for the analysis of complex systems since this comprehensive theory is capable of providing links between the problems and dynamics of systems. Particularly, for the complex and challenging environments, the solutions to the problems can be managed more effectively based on a systems approach. Neurological diseases concern the brain which has a complex structure and dynamics. Being equipped with the accurate medical knowledge plays a critical role in tackling these neurological problems. The interconnected relationships require a carefully-characterized transdisciplinary approach integrating systems conduct and mathematical modelling. Effective solutions lie in cognitive status, namely awareness and a satisfactory level of health knowledge. Within this framework, this study aims at revealing the lack of required general and medical health knowledge on neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s, dementia, Parkinson’s, stroke, epilepsy and migraine) among individuals. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted on 381 respondents, through which awareness on medical knowledge and general health knowledge were assessed for each disease. The following approaches (methods) were applied: firstly, rule-based decision tree algorithm was applied since its structure enables the interpretation of the data and works effectively with feature computations. Subsequently, statistical analyses were performed. The decision tree analyses and statistical analyses reveal parallel results with one another, which demonstrate that when compared with the knowledge of elder people, the knowledge of young population is limited in general and medical health knowledge. Compared with previous works, no related work exists in the literature where a transdisciplinary approach with these proposed methods are used. The experimental results demonstrate the significant difference between medical knowledge and general health knowledge among individuals depending on different attributes. The study attempts to reveal a new approach for dealing with diseases, developing positive attitudes besides establishing effective long-term behavioural patterns and strategies based on required knowledge and mindfulness.","Karaca, Yeliz; Altuntaş, Elgiz Yılmaz",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978603/,58

The COVID-19 pandemic, which started as a public health emergency, rapidly transformed into an economic crisis the world had not witnessed in over a century. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic was a source of systematic risk, which filled global stock markets with uncertainty and resulted in big moves of share prices. Using the event study methodology that significantly utilised secondary data collection and analysis, the chapter examined the impacts of COVID-19 on tourism-related stocks. Vicissitudes in stock value were used as a signature mark for the impacts. It was observed that the news of the COVID-19 outbreak and measures put in place to curb its spread dampened the stock markets and led to declines in tourism-related stock prices. The measures included travel bans, bans on mass gatherings, as well as the closure of hotels and restaurants. Tourism firms and those in their value chain became the worst performers on global stock markets with some losing up to 80% of their value within a 2-week period. This translated into billions of dollars in lost value. Governments responded to these losses by issuing stimulus and rescue packages for distressed industries. These led to notable recoveries by some firms, although most in the tourism industry remained negative. The chapter recommends an additional rescue package for the tourism industry that must be timed with visible signs that the pandemic is under control.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980026/,58

Instead of uttering aphorisms to approach this subject, we attempt to create digitized statecraft since we know that we are not pundits.

49488,Artificial Intelligence Against COVID-19: A Meta-analysis of Current Research,2020-07-29,"Brazil experienced a dramatic see-saw in relations with Africa in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. Booming ties in diplomacy, development cooperation and trade saw Brazil established as a major partner for the continent under the leadership of Lula’s PT administration. Subsequent governments increasingly dismantled many of the policies supporting this boom. However, this collapse, and what it signifies about Brazil’s Africa relations, is still little understood, and more widely, there are few detailed case studies of this trend. This chapter tackles both gaps with a study of Brazil-Tanzania, which mirrored the wider boom and bust. Its analysis demonstrates the degree to which the spread of ties beyond lusophone countries was state-initiated, with diplomacy playing a central role, but then implemented by companies who shaped what occurred ‘on the ground’. This created a weakness in Brazil-Africa relations, given Brazil’s presidential system and its influence over foreign policy priorities and development cooperation spending. Additionally, the chapter introduces the concept of naivety amongst Brazilian actors, as a misreading of Tanzanian politics prevented infrastructure companies from establishing projects. However, the chapter concludes by arguing that any understanding of Brazil-Africa must appreciate the crucial role of African agency. As demonstrated here by Tanzanian politicians and government officials, countries on the continent fundamentally shape the processes, activities and successes of Brazilian involvement.","Dye, Barnaby Joseph",Brazil-Africa Relations in the 21st Century,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980757/,58
49502,COVID-19 Diagnostics from the Chest X-Ray Image Using Corner-Based Weber Local Descriptor,2020-07-29,"In this chapter the author, an audiovisual producer and lecturer of cultural and media studies, shares elements of the reflexive journey from Jamaica’s Public Service Broadcasting to Commercial Broadcasting eras, and on to the emergent Cultural Economy era. She argues that in the emerging cultural economies of the Global South, the production and trade of screen-based content are central to development positioning and geostrategic planning for nations like Jamaica and Ghana. The author presents #decolonization2point0 (d2k) as a cultural economy methodology for nations of the Global South that seeks to “personify” the cultural economy process through culturization rather than “disembody” it through marketization. Audiovisual production and trade in Jamaica and Ghana are presented as “metaphors of transformation” and as case studies to test the application of the South Star Policy Model she proposes for cultural economy policy development in the Global South. This model focuses on sustainable development objectives rather than exploitative and extractive intentions to guide planning for cultural and creative economy growth. It encourages a fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of the processes to integrate cultural economy thinking into development planning, in countries of the Global South with an emphasis on growing the audiovisual sector, particularly in Jamaica.","Hickling Gordon, Deborah",Cultural Economy and Television in Jamaica and Ghana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980815/,58
49519,Stacking Deep Learning for Early COVID-19 Vision Diagnosis,2020-07-29,"This study deals with ethical aspects of decision-making in the context of future industrial systems such as depicted by the Industry 4.0 principles. These systems involve a great number of interacting elements, with more or less autonomy. In this sense, ethics may become an important mean to ensure a long-term viable joint integration of humans and artificial elements in future industrial systems merged into the society. Two complementary views can be thus identified to integrate ethics in such future industrial systems. The first view conventionally defines ethics as a non-negotiable static set of conditions and rules to be met by the considered systems throughout their lifecycle. The second view assumes that ethics can be seen as a performance factor to which a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is associated and which can, therefore, be more or less directly measured and lead to improvement through time. Starting from an overall definition of the concept of ethics, its conventional vision and its specifications regarding future industrial systems, these two views are exposed and discussed, leading to the establishment of some properties for the definition of a generic framework to handle ethics throughout decision-making processes. Concluding remarks and prospects are finally presented.","Berrah, Lamia; Trentesaux, Damien","Service Oriented, Holonic and Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems for Industry of the Future",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980841/,58

A Viewpoint from an Environmental NGO Perspective,2020-06-13,"This work presents a model for reviewing the risks of institutions teaching cybersecurity. The work is based on efforts in this direction at Regis University and Adams 12 Five Star Schools in Colorado. These two institutions are described in a comparative case study reviewing the following four aspects of addressing risk: policy, adjudication, infrastructure protection, and curricular boundaries. The model is presented in a generalizable framework to facilitate risk analysis across the education of children in public schools, university level education, and professional development programs. This framework is not intended to supplement a traditional threat analysis program and not replace it. In addition to the specialized risks addressed here, institutions teaching cybersecurity are often perceived as potential targets for adversaries because of the schools as a pipeline to cyber defense activities, and because institutions teaching cybersecurity are part of societal long-term cyber defense strategies that confront criminal, nation state, and activist threats.","Moore, Erik; Likarish, Daniel; Bastian, Bobbie; Brooks, Michael",Information Security Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980917/,58

The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID-19 is an international pandemic. Big Data analytics tools must handle and analyse the massive amount of big medical data, generated daily, quickly due to the fact that time is very significant issue in healthcare applications. In addition, several deep learning algorithms are used along with big data analysis processes to help in detecting COVID-19 outbreaks and predicting their worldwide spread. Many researchers developed their models to diagnosis COVID-19 using Computed Tomography (CT) or X-ray imaging. This chapter presents a detailed discussion of Deep Learning and Big Data Analytics effects in containment of the disease. In addition, an H2O’s Deep-Learning-inspired model based on Big Data analytics (DLBD-COV) is proposed for early diagnosis of COVID-19 cases using CT or X-ray images. The proposed diagnosis model is build based on the machine learning framework (H2O) for scalable processing. The Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used and their classification results are compared. The experimental results emphasize the superiority of DLBD-COV when using H(2)O framework for scalable COVID19 classification. The results obtained, using a dataset with thousands of real data and images, show encouraging performance using the automated feature extraction of deep learning techniques used in DLBD-COV.","Elghamrawy, Sally",Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Against COVID-19: Innovation Vision and Approach,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980963/,58

We have concentrated on the actual and potential uses of official statistics, taking a teleological approach in our assessment. Usage and users form one of three pillars underpinning official statistics, along with methodological quality and trustworthiness. We reach five broad conclusions and we propose that the kinds of statistics covered by the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics are considered as public statistics, to be produced not only by the national statistical offices but also by other organisations which, crucially, share and can demonstrate commitment to the principles.

This cannot realistically be achieved without further digitalisation. This chapter identifies the principal tensions and opportunities that impact the inevitable and ongoing digitalisation process that is underway in the maritime transportation sector. The chapter also identifies the trends of development at large and those associated with the key stakeholders that are involved in global maritime operations. The digital trends emerging in shipping companies, ports with its actors, authorities and associations, and movements that are being made by diverse digital solution providers, within and outside the maritime domain are also identified. The discussion takes the point of view that shipping is a global phenomenon enabled by ship movements creating a global network of sea transport facilitated by ports. Achieving higher levels of collaboration through digitalisation requires that tools and systems are interoperable by adopting harmonised open standards. It requires the use of standardised formats and standardised interfaces for communication, building upon commonly agreed definitions of phenomena and processes associated with port call operations. The chapter closes with a brief discussion on the emergence of “smart” ports and “smart” ships, which rely heavily of digitalisation, collaboration and the continuous sharing of and access to relevant data.","Lind, Mikael; Ward, Robert; Bergmann, Michael; Haraldson, Sandra; Zerem, Almir; Hoffmann, Jan; Eklund, Erik",Maritime Informatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981481/,58

It targets quantified constraints over background theories such as (non)linear integer, reals and floating-point arithmetic, bit-vectors, and their combinations. Unlike previous approaches for quantifier instantiation in these domains which rely on theory-specific strategies, the new approach can be applied to any (combined) theory, when provided with a grammar for instantiation terms for all sorts in the theory. We implement syntax-guided instantiation in the SMT solver CVC4, leveraging its support for enumerative SyGuS. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility of the approach, showing that it is competitive with or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art solvers on a range of background theories.","Niemetz, Aina; Preiner, Mathias; Reynolds, Andrew; Barrett, Clark; Tinelli, Cesare",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984542/,58
50096,Industrial Symbiosis for Circular Economy: A Possible Scenario in Norway,2020-12-19,"Concurrent accesses to databases are typically encapsulated in transactions in order to enable isolation from other concurrent computations and resilience to failures. Modern databases provide transactions with various semantics corresponding to different trade-offs between consistency and availability. Since a weaker consistency model provides better performance, an important issue is investigating the weakest level of consistency needed by a given program (to satisfy its specification). As a way of dealing with this issue, we investigate the problem of checking whether a given program has the same set of behaviors when replacing a consistency model with a weaker one. This property known as robustness generally implies that any specification of the program is preserved when weakening the consistency. We focus on the robustness problem for consistency models which are weaker than standard serializability, namely, causal consistency, prefix consistency, and snapshot isolation. We show that checking robustness between these models is polynomial time reducible to a state reachability problem under serializability. We use this reduction to also derive a pragmatic proof technique based on Lipton’s reduction theory that allows to prove programs robust. We have applied our techniques to several challenging applications drawn from the literature of distributed systems and databases.","Beillahi, Sidi Mohamed; Bouajjani, Ahmed; Enea, Constantin",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984544/,58

In over 30 years since, there have been dramatic advances in satellite, networking and ground system technologies, solutions, and services, the scope of which go well beyond what can be addressed in this Handbook. The modest objective of this chapter is to provide key insights into the evolution of satellite networks and associated ground systems that today serve all global market sectors. It identifies applications for which the transformative potential of electronically steerable phased arrays (described in chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-36308-6_30) is poised to displace mechanically steered parabolic antennas as large-scale, small satellite constellations are launched. The net result will be an expansion of global satellite markets and diversification of ground systems, as VSATs and flat panel, phased array solutions supplement each other to fuel the expansion. The world of small satellite constellations in LEO and MEO orbits will extend the reach of satellite communications, particularly in underserved portions of the world. By eliminating mechanical steering, flat panel antennas with electronic tracking will open up new addressable mobility markets through lower cost and compact packaging, whether for airborne, maritime, train, or land vehicle applications. This is not a matter of ground satellite systems being replaced, but supplemented in a very significant way.","Slekys, Arunas G.; Safavi-Naeini, Safieddin (Ali)",Handbook of Small Satellites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990675/,58

To states delineating their outer continental shelves, an extended maritime area implies not only prospects of wealth and enlarged sovereign rights, but also increased responsibilities over those areas. A reasonable next step, in line with the original research plan, is to scrutinize a particular state’s legal and institutional framework in place for the management of the maritime spaces under national jurisdiction.

However, these treatments may display moderate to severe side effects caused by their low temporal or spatial resolution. In this sense, photonic nanomedicine therapies have been arising as an alternative to traditional cancer treatments since they display more control of temporal and spatial resolution, thereby yielding fewer side effects. In this work, we reviewed the challenge of current cancer treatments, using the PubMed and Web of Science database, focusing on the advances of three prominent therapies approached by photonic nanomedicine: (i) photothermal therapy; (ii) photodynamic therapy; (iii) photoresponsive drug delivery systems. These photonic nanomedicines act on the cancer cells through different mechanisms, such as hyperthermic effect and delivery of chemotherapeutics and species that cause oxidative stress. Furthermore, we covered the recent advances in materials science applied in photonic nanomedicine, highlighting the main classes of materials used in each therapy, their applications in the context of cancer treatment, as well as their advantages, limitations, and future perspectives.

50985,Can addressing inequality unleash economic growth?,2021-03-30,"Worldwide, the prevalence of allergies in young children, but also vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and in newborns is rising. Vitamin D modulates the development and activity of the immune system and a low vitamin D status during pregnancy and in early life might be associated with an increased risk to develop an allergy during early childhood. This review studies the effects of vitamin D during gestation and early life, on allergy susceptibility in infants. The bioactive form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D, inhibits maturation and results in immature dendritic cells that cause a decreased differentiation of naive T cells into effector T cells. Nevertheless, the development of regulatory T cells and the production of interleukin-10 was increased. Consequently, a more tolerogenic immune response developed against antigens. Secondly, binding of 1,25(OH)2D to epithelial cells induces the expression of tight junction proteins resulting in enhanced epithelial barrier function. Thirdly, 1,25(OH)2D increased the expression of anti-microbial peptides by epithelial cells that also promoted the defense mechanism against pathogens, by preventing an invasive penetration of pathogens. Immune intervention by vitamin D supplementation can mitigate the disease burden from asthma and allergy. In conclusion, our review indicates that a sufficient vitamin D status during gestation and early life can lower the susceptibility to develop an allergy in infants although there remains a need for more causal evidence.","Briceno Noriega, Daniela; Savelkoul, Huub F.

This has exacerbated pre-existing barriers in access to gastroenterology (GI) care across Nova Scotia (NS) for patients and primary healthcare providers (PHCPs). In response, a provincial PHCP-GI consultative service (GUT LINK) was implemented at a single tertiary care center with the goal of supporting PHCPs in the management of non-urgent GI referral conditions. AIMS: To implement and evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and early effectiveness of the GUT LINK PHCP-GI consultation service. METHODS: This is an ongoing prospective observational cohort study. All referrals received through the EMR-based referral and triage management system between May and November 2020 that were deemed to be amenable to management within primary care with specialist support were returned to the PHCP with the suggestion to arrange a GUT LINK telephone consultation. GUT LINK appointments were scheduled through an administrative support telephone line with the PHCP and a GI specialist. A post-consultation e-questionnaire was distributed to PHCPs who consented to participate. Feasibility (number of and indication for referrals, PHCP participation rates), acceptability and appropriateness (satisfaction, future use, likelihood to recommend) metrics and outcomes (case resolution, re-referrals, proportion requiring endoscopic investigations) were recorded. Patient charts were reviewed to determine whether the patient ultimately required GI speciality care. Analyses were descriptive and expressed as frequencies, means (+/-SD), medians (+/-SE), and proportions (%). RESULTS: A total of 45 GUT LINK consultations were completed between May and November 2020. Of these, 20% required GI specialist care and 80% have remained within primary care, with a median follow-up of 101 (+/-9.1) days. The indications for GUT LINK consultation included lower GI symptoms (64%), abnormal imaging or investigations (17%), and upper GI symptoms (19%). To date, 21 PHCP agreed to be contacted for the post-consultation survey and 10 have been completed. All PHCPs reported that GUT LINK consultation was easy to access, while 90% found the advice helpful and 80% reported that that it resolved the issue. Following the GUT LINK appointment, 80% felt they would not need to refer their patient to GI. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of GUT LINK was acceptable, feasible, and improved access to specialist support for management of undifferentiated GI symptoms. Future research will focus on comprehensive stakeholder engagement in order to design, implement, and evaluate GUT LINK PHCP care pathways.

These may incorporate holistic themes including function, mood, and quality of life. People living with frailty have poorer outcomes from even short hospital stays. They benefit from person-centred, goal-directed care over protocol-driven pathway approaches. This could be improved by monitoring attainment of health outcome goals. METHODS: A systematic review for older people’s health outcome goals in emergency care was conducted using narrative synthesis. A qualitative study based on grounded theory expanded the outcome framework to include people living with frailty. People with cognitive and communication barriers were included in semi-structured interviews. Discussions focussed on the events and outcomes sought from emergency care. RESULTS: Older people’s health outcome goals for emergency care were classified as efficient and comprehensive care, sensitivity towards vulnerability, and person-centred informed care. The importance of understanding individual perceptions was explicit. Research generally recruited based on age rather than physiological and functional state, and did not assess for impact of frailty on healthcare perceptions. The interview study was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial results showed a predominance of person-centred and holistic care themes among health outcome goals. Participants’ most common goal for emergency care was relief of symptoms: people often had pain. Participants mostly had severe frailty and wanted their mobility to be assessed, with goals of recovering their functional baseline. While participants had confidence in healthcare professionals and were generally willing to “do as we are told to feel better”, they expected to undergo at least basic tests in order to receive a working diagnosis for their problem. People wanted to understand their illness and for explanations to be communicated to their relatives. Next steps Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for this range of emergency care outcomes are being identified for field-testing in acute settings.","van Oppen, J",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989605/,58

Traditional imaging techniques such as ultrasound (US) and sestamibi scintigraphy (MIBI) and newer techniques such as parathyroid four-dimension computed tomography (4D-CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are available for the clinician to detect the diseased gland(s) in the preoperative workup. Invasive parathyroid venous sampling may be useful in certain circumstances such as persistent or recurrent PHPT. We review the diagnostic performance of these imaging modalities in preoperative localization and discuss the advantages and weaknesses of these techniques. US and MIBI are established techniques commonly utilized as first-line modalities. 4D-CT has excellent diagnostic performance and is increasingly performed in first-line setting and as an adjunct to US and MIBI. PET and MRI are emerging adjunct modalities when localization has been equivocal or failed. Since no evidence-based guidelines are yet available for the optimal imaging strategy, clinicians should be familiar with the range and advancement of these techniques.

Data were analysed thematically guided by the most significant stories. While the fisherfolk perceived waste as useless and a nuisance, the experts saw it as a nuisance and/or resource. The fisherfolk did not sort their waste in line with best practices, nor were they willing to pay for waste collection services, citing poverty as the main reason. While most fisherfolk disposed of their waste into bins as approved, others did so onto the street, into the drains, lagoon, and sea. While the fisherfolk were aware that indiscriminate waste disposal led to diseases such as malaria and cholera, their perceptions of the effect of the same on aquatic resources were mixed. The fisherfolk's conception and perception of waste led to attitudes, behaviours, and practices that polluted the environment (air, land, and water resources), resulting in public health challenges, a threat to navigation, fish population, and other biodiversity, which were inimical to livelihoods and sustainable development. The government and municipal authority should collaborate with the experts in environmental health, water and sanitation, fisheries and aquatic sciences, and traditional authorities to sensitise the fisherfolk on the sustainability implications of unapproved solid waste disposal practices to change their attitude for the better. They should also provide more waste disposal infrastructure and enforce the laws to ensure compliance with best practice for sustainable development. The study supports the compatibility and mutuality between Sustainable Development (SDG) 6 on water, sanitation, and hygiene and SDG 14 regarding sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources.","Mensah, Justice",J Environ Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062165/,58

This closed loop quality improvement project looked at epistaxis admissions, and whether patients could be safely managed on an ambulatory basis with unilateral intranasal packing, through the implementation of a new epistaxis pathway. METHOD: Two prospective cycles at a District General Hospital. First cycle: three-month period (October-December 2018); recorded all patients admitted with epistaxis and the percentage with intranasal packing; criteria for discharge with unilateral intranasal packing created (including normal observations, normal clotting/haemoglobin, only on aspirin, safe home environment). Second cycle (after implementation of new pathway): two months (December 2019 and January 2020); recorded all patients admitted with epistaxis or discharged with unilateral intranasal packing; patient feedback obtained. RESULTS: First cycle: 31 epistaxis admissions; 12 patients met discharge criteria; average length of stay was 1.4 days. Second cycle: 22 epistaxis admissions; 4 admissions were avoided; 2 admissions were unnecessary according to new pathway; no patient-reported issues with pack at home. CONCLUSIONS: Successful creation and initial implementation of pathway with no adverse outcomes. Approximately £1380 of savings through avoided admissions. Pathway expanded and successfully used during COVID-19 to include patients on anticoagulation as suitable for discharge with intranasal packing.","Vasanthan, R; Massoumi, A; Forde, M; Corbridge, O; Sood, S",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135788/,58

METHOD: A retrospective analysis at a single UK MTC. We included all patients undergoing emergency/urgent T&O surgery. Data collected included anatomical injury site, mechanism of injury, operative procedure, anaesthesia, theatre time, complications, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 159 operations were performed on 142 patients in April 2019, and 110 operations on 106 patients in April 2020 (national lockdown). This led to a decrease of 30% due to reduced numbers from RTAs and sport-related injuries. Volumes of hip fractures and injuries from low-energy falls remained the same. Operative total theatre time increased by a mean of 14 minutes, and complications and mortality were not significantly changed. The incidence of COVID-19 in the patients tested was 8.5%, which matched the population incidence at the time. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic trauma services must be maintained during a national lockdown. There is no decrease in the volume of patients sustaining falls, including hip fractures. Mean operating time only increases by 14 minutes with the wearing of PPE. This should be part of future planning of any pandemics or national lockdowns.","Donovan, R; Tilston, T; Frostick, R; Chesser, T",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135860/,58
53773,What Is the Relation between Circular Economy and Sustainability? Answers from Frontrunner Companies Engaged with Circular Economy Practices,2021-06-02,"Change is constant, as nothing stays the same. Consider the words of the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, “Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them—that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.” Some changes are the result of biology and the passage of time, within the natural cycle or order of things. Others are self-generated, under our own control and resulting from willful efforts, or dependent upon encounters with significant others—family, friends, colleagues, and others close to us. Still, other changes occur because of circumstance or fate, a proverbial ""date with destiny"" and often beyond what we feel is our control. Whether it is our personal life or occupational, like metalcasting, this change can facilitate transition and transformation. I have coined the term metalmorphasis and this lecture as reflection of how to embrace change, recognize the opportunities presented and utilize it as a vehicle for new beginnings. This is not just philosophical but also a look how we as metallurgist and metalcasters apply and control input variables (time, temperature, pressure, chemical reactions, etc.) to transform metals and create metalmorphasis.","Prucha, Thomas E.",Inter Metalcast,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8158087/,58

53911,"Adam Phillips: On Wanting to Change: Penguin, 2021, 160 pp., ISBN: 978-0241291771",2021-06-07,"ABSTRACT: New digital technologies possess the potential to transform entrepreneurial processes, such as how entrepreneurs pursue opportunities and access funding and how they learn. How entrepreneurs learn may be transformed as digital technologies provide new spaces for learning, such as online communities. Online communities can gather thousands of participants and provide entrepreneurs with new opportunities for learning that are not limited by time, space, or social class. Yet, we know little about how entrepreneurs take advantage of the new digital opportunities of learning. To remedy this, we studied a large online community of entrepreneurs on Reddit (r/startups), where we qualitatively analyzed the top-voted 100 threads from 2018 to 2019 (10,277 comments in total). By drawing on coactive vicarious learning, a theory that describes how learning is socially constructed through discursive interactions, we outline how entrepreneurial learning is socially constructed through conversations, which are taking place in different micro-learning contexts. Through identifying distinct entrepreneurial learning conversations, we build new theory on entrepreneurial learning in online communities. Our theorizing contributes to (1) the growing research on how entrepreneurial learning is socially constructed in communities, (2) the current debate on knowledge creation in online communities, and (3) the knowledge on how coactive vicarious learning unfolds in communities. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: When entrepreneurs go online to learn, new research shows how online communities provide entrepreneurs with diverse learning spaces for developing ideas, learning new skills, and coping with the uncertainties of being an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs increasingly use social media for doing business, but can they also use it to learn about doing business? In this article, we investigate this question by studying an online community of entrepreneurs on Reddit called r/startups, in which entrepreneurs exchange experiences and help each other with questions and issues. We show that entrepreneurial learning is taking place in five forms of learning conversations, which are situated in four learning contexts that differ from each other, from a classroom with a student–teacher dynamic, a collab space where entrepreneurs collect ideas and develop new skills and knowledge, a club context in which they challenge each other, and a care context in which they can bring their fears and uncertainties. Our findings show how entrepreneurship practitioners can make use of online communities, encouraging teaching and policy to pay more attention to how entrepreneurs work digitally.","Schou, Peter Kalum; Bucher, Eliane; Waldkirch, Matthias",Small Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169431/,58

The homestead food production intervention, implemented by Helen Keller International, began in mid-2015 and ended in December 2018. METHODS: We use four data sources: 1) baseline data (all women and their youngest child, March-May 2015); 2) surveillance data (every two months - all children 6–18m and a rotating random third of women and children 19–37m, September 2015-August 2019); 3) endline data (all women and children 6–23m, September 2019-February 2020); 4) phone survey during the COVID-19 lockdown (a random two-thirds of women, May-June 2020). We calculated dietary diversity for women (MDDW-10) and children (WHO IYCF). Our analysis included 24,931 observations of 2,701 women and 17,445 observations of 2,162 children (6–37m). We estimate the impact of the intervention on dietary diversity using multi-level regression, controlling for clustering by settlement and repeated measures. RESULTS: Dietary diversity scores and the proportion of women and children classified as consuming adequate diets varied greatly over the year, peaking in May/June with 5.3 food groups for women (out of ten) and 3.8 food groups for children (out of seven). Over all program years, intervention women had 1.8 higher odds of consuming an adequate diet compared to control women (p < 0.001). However, this benefit varied from 1.3 in the first year of the intervention (p = 0.015) to 2.3 in the last year (p < 0.001), before falling to around 1.9 in the post-intervention years (p < 0.001). We saw a nearly identical pattern in children. Dietary improvement was driven through incremental increases in nearly all food groups. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention successfully increased dietary diversity in women and children, and these impacts persisted after the project closed, including during the COVID-19 lockdown period. FUNDING SOURCES: The German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) is the primary funder for the FAARM trial. The U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) supported the design of the surveillance system.","Waid, Jillian; Wendt, Amanda; Gabrysch, Sabine",Curr Dev Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8181503/,58

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown led to an emphasis on outpatient care, fewer presentations to hospital for non-COVID-19-related illnesses, changes in work practices and a reduction in air pollution. Our aim was to determine the impact of these changes on hospital admissions with acute IBD flares. METHODS: The hospital in-patient enquiry (HIPE) department provided records of all patients admitted with acute IBD flares during the first Irish lockdown from March to May 2020 and for the corresponding period in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Electronic patient records were used to assess patient demographics, biochemical markers, imaging, medication use and outcome. RESULTS: 101 patients were admitted with an acute IBD flare. This was a marked reduction when compared to the corresponding period in the previous three years (p<0.0001). Despite the rates of admission decreasing in this period, rates of colectomy were significantly increased (p<0.0001). (Table 1). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a significant decrease in hospital admissions for acute IBD flares during the first wave of the pandemic. We postulate that changes in environmental triggers of IBD such as working from home and reduced stress levels in addition to reduced air pollution may account for this reduction. The increased rate of colectomy likely reflects a more severe presentation of IBD and patients’ reluctance to attend the hospital at an early stage in their disease flare as well as non-adherence to prescribed IBD therapies due to a perceived COVID-19-related risk.","Hazel, K; Glynn, E; Boland, K; O’Toole, A",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194571/,58

However, no study has evaluated whether the actual implementation of life-sustaining treatment has decreased after the enforcement of this law. This study aimed to compare the provision of patient consent before and after the enforcement of this law among cancer patients who visited a tertiary university hospital's emergency room to understand the effects of this law on the clinical care of cancer patients. METHODS: This retrospective single cohort study included advanced cancer patients aged over 19 years who visited the emergency room of a tertiary university hospital. The two study periods were as follows: from February 2017 to January 2018 (before) and from May 2018 to April 2019 (after). The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay. The consent rates to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The length of hospital stay decreased after the law was enforced from 4 to 2 days (p = 0.001). The rates of direct transfers to secondary hospitals and nursing hospitals increased from 8.2 to 21.2% (p = 0.001) and from 1.0 to 9.7%, respectively (p < 0.001). The consent rate for admission to the ICU decreased from 6.7 to 2.3% (p = 0.032). For CPR and CRRT, the consent rates decreased from 1.0 to 0.0% and from 13.9 to 8.8%, respectively, but the differences were not significant (p = 0.226 and p = 0.109, respectively). CONCLUSION: After the enforcement of the Life Extension Medical Decision law, the length of stay in the tertiary university hospital decreased in patients who established their life-sustaining treatment plans in the emergency room. Moreover, the rate of consent for ICU admission decreased.","Chung, Yu Jin; Park, Incheol; Cho, Junho; Beom, Jin Ho; Lee, Ji Eun",BMC Med Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8210737/,58

However, the disadvantages inherent to the Haber–Bosch process, such as high energy consumption and high emissions, cannot be ignored. Therefore, developing a green nitrogen fixation process has always been a research hotspot. Among the various technologies, plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation technology is very promising due to its small scale, mild reaction conditions, and flexible parameters.

The developed miniature sensing platform can detect the substrate peptides for tyrosine kinases, such as c-Src, Hck and Her2, in a low sample volume (1–2 μL). The developed sensing platform exhibited a high reproducibility for repetitive measurement with an RSD (relative standard deviation) of 6.6%. The developed sensing platform can detect the Hck and Her2 in a linear range of 1–200 U/mL with the detection limit of 1 U/mL. The sensing platform was also effective in assessing the specificity and efficacies of the inhibitors for protein tyrosine kinases. This is demonstrated by the detection of significant inhibition of Hck (~88.1%, but not Her2) by the Src inhibitor 1, an inhibitor for Src family kinases, as well as the significant inhibition of Her2 (~91%, but not Hck) by CP-724714 through the platform.

56241,Multi-criteria decision-making leveraged by text analytics and interviews with strategists,2021-07-28,"Human uveitis is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by ocular inflammation with the involvement of uveitogenic Th1 and Th17 responses. In experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), the animal model for human uveitis, both responses are proven to be critical in disease development. Therefore, targeting both Th1 and Th17 cells has therapeutic implication for disease resolution. IL-27 is a multifunctional cytokine that can either promote or inhibit T cell responses and is implicated in both autoimmune and infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to characterize the role of IL-27/IL-27R signaling in regulating uveitogenic Th1/Th17 responses in EAU. By immunizing IL-27Rα(−/−) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates for EAU, we demonstrated that IL-27 signaling deficiency exacerbated EAU with severe ocular inflammation and impairment of visual function. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the eye-infiltrating Th1 and Th17 cells in IL-27Rα(−/−) EAU mice compared to WT. Their retinal antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses were also significantly increased, as represented by the elevation of their signature cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-17A, respectively. We also observed the upregulation of another pathogenic cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), from effector T cells in IL-27Rα(−/−) EAU mice. Mechanistic studies confirmed that IL-27 inhibited GM-CSF production from Th17 cells. In addition, the induction of IL-10 producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells was impaired in IL-27Rα(−/−) EAU mice. These results identified that IL-27 signaling plays a suppressive role in EAU by regulating multiple CD4(+) cell subsets, including the effector Th1 and Th17 cells and the regulatory Tr1 cells. Our findings provide new insights for therapeutic potential in controlling uveitis by enhancing IL-27 signaling.","Wu, Sihan; Ma, Rui; Zhong, Yajie; Chen, Zilin; Zhou, Hongyan; Zhou, Minyi; Chong, Waipo; Chen, Jun",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8305313/,58

It sets the objective of making such assessments more holistic and horizontal in nature because future CASE mobility applications will include many technologies and service concepts as an integrated whole serving specific mobility objective. Traditional evaluation methodologies will therefore have to be modified to account for this situation, and to this end, the paper focuses on assessing and adapting such “traditional” methodologies. It draws from the experience gained in Greece in the last decade when a substantial number of ITS applications were implemented and assessed, especially in the second largest urban area of the country, the city of Thessaloniki (part of the EU’s European Network of Living Labs). Four basic methodologies are selected: the use of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), focused interviews, the CMME (CASE Mobility Matrix Evaluation), and the use of safety audits before and after the CASE mobility application. For the first three, the paper suggests specific indicators and/or content. It also gives an example of the use of CMME based on a use case from Thessaloniki. The contents and recommendations of this paper provide a better understanding of the emerging situation as regards CASE mobility applications and point to the need for establishing a timely and comprehensive CASE mobility evaluation framework at both national and European levels, for future implementations.","Giannopoulos, Athanasios Thanos",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310699/,58

A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Covariance-based structural equation modeling was employed to assess the hypothesized relationships between the variables. The findings revealed that reputation, performance, and affect influenced customer retention in insurance sector. Positive affect had greater impact on customer retention in comparison to other constructs. Further, customer inertia was an important moderating influence on the negative affect for health insurance policy customer retention. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first of its kind that attempts to investigate customer inertia in the health insurance sector in an emerging market context, i.e., India. Customer inertia has not been much studied in light of company reputation, performance, and positive and negative affect in the health insurance milieu. The research findings may help health insurance companies understand the importance of reputation, performance, customer retention, and inertia while marketing insurance services.","Kautish, Pradeep; Khare, Arpita; Sharma, Rajesh",J Market Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417621/,58

In this study, healthy Japanese participants performed three-step tasks. First, participants made nine subjective evaluations of haptic stimuli using five-point semantic differential scales (e.g., regarding stickiness, scored from 1 (not sticky) to 5 (sticky)). Second, the participants carried out learning and recognition tasks for associative pairs of new (meaningless) word forms in their first language (Japanese) and haptic stimulus (H condition), and performed learning and recognition tasks for new (meaningless) word forms only (W condition). The order of conditions was counterbalanced among participants. Third, participants performed free recall tasks. The results of the recognition tasks showed that the proportions and response times of the W condition were better and faster, respectively, than those of the H condition. Furthermore, preference of haptic features negatively correlated with free recall scores of the H condition; however, there was no significant difference between the free recall scores of the H and W conditions. Our results suggest that new word forms were learned better than associative pairs of new word forms and haptic stimuli in a single day of learning. Furthermore, the free recall performance of word forms associated with haptic features could also be affected by their subjective evaluation (preference).","Yang, Yutao; Yan, Yan; Ando, Misa; Liu, Xinyi; Kambara, Toshimune",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314365/,58

Various research groups have proposed different image processing and machine learning techniques to classify gastrointestinal tract diseases in recent years. Traditional image processing algorithms and a data augmentation technique are combined with an adjusted pretrained deep convolutional neural network to classify diseases in the gastrointestinal tract from wireless endoscopy images in this research. We take advantage of pretrained models VGG16, ResNet-18, and GoogLeNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with adjusted fully connected and output layers. The proposed models are validated with a dataset consisting of 6702 images of 8 classes. The VGG16 model achieved the highest results with 96.33% accuracy, 96.37% recall, 96.5% precision, and 96.5% F1-measure.

Therefore, the goal to achieve in this study is to evaluate using a mixed method strategy the behaviors happening in the application of the technical–tactical means performed in the transition play of professional basketball in Spain. An ad hoc observation tool made of 11 criteria and 83 exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories (E/ME) has been designed and validated by means of data quality and generalizability analyses. Indexes obtained show high reliability and validity allowing the proposed actions to be recorded (correlation coefficients are above 0.95 and generalizability coefficients are above 0.90 in all cases). A total number of 128 situations corresponding to eight games of Unicaja de Málaga in the Endesa League in the 18/19 season were observed with the Hoisan software. The analysis of the relationships among behaviors was performed using the polar coordinates technique where the one-on-one initiation, outside the zone, has been used as focal behavior. The estimation of the functions representing the vectors has also been performed to model the best fit that estimates, starting from a focal category, the relationship among this focal behavior and the rest of the mating behaviors for possible future observations. The results show significant relationships between the selected focal behavior and the mating behaviors, showing indications of behaviors allowing tactical interpretation of the game and the definition of intervention programs to improve the performance of the team.","Pastrana-Brincones, José Luis; Troyano-Gallegos, Belén; Morillo-Baro, Juan Pablo; López de Vinuesa-Piote, Raimundo; Vázquez-Diz, Juan Antonio; Reigal-Garrido, Rafael E.; Hernández-Mendo, Antonio; Morales-Sánchez, Verónica",Front Sports Act Living,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496450/,58

However, due to the presence of various complications, the survival rate of patients undergoing ECMO remains low. Among the complications, the neurologic morbidity significantly associated with venoarterial and venovenous ECMO has received increasing attention. Generally, failure to recognize neurologic injury in time is reportedly associated with poor outcomes in patients on ECMO. Currently, multimodal monitoring is increasingly utilized in patients with devastating neurologic injuries and has been advocated as an important approach for early diagnosis. Here, we highlight the prevalence and outcomes, risk factors, current monitoring technologies, prevention, and treatment of neurologic complications in adult patients on ECMO. We believe that an improved understanding of neurologic complications presumably offers promising therapeutic solutions to prevent and treat neurologic morbidity.","Zhang, Hongling; Xu, Jiqian; Yang, Xiaobo; Zou, Xiaojing; Shu, Huaqing; Liu, Zhengdong; Shang, You",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8513760/,58

63336,"The pandemic is being used as a screen to privatise, fragment, and weaken the NHS.",2020-08-06,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can transport various cargoes through membranes of live cells. Since the first generations of CPPs suffered from insufficient cell and tissue selectivity, stability against proteases, and escape from endosomes, a new generation of peptides, with optimized properties, was developed. These are either derived from natural sources or created through the combination of multivalent structures. The second method allows achieving high internalization efficiency, high cell and tissue selectivity, and release from endosomes via hybrid structures, combining sequences for endosomal release, homing sequences, and sequences for activation at the target tissue and for local delivery of cargoes. CPPs with innate tumor selectivity include azurin, crotamine, maurocalcine, lycosin-I, buffalo cathelicidin, and peptide CB5005. Some of them can penetrate the membranes of live cells and influence intracellular signaling pathways, thereby exerting cytotoxic effects against tumor cells. To obtain multilayer penetration and stabilization against proteolytic degradation, as well as for better handling, CPPs are often conjugated to nanoparticles. A special problem for tumor treatment is the efficiency of drug transport through three-dimensional cell cultures. Therefore, the capability of CPPs to deliver the drug even to the innermost tissues is of crucial importance. Notably, the ability of certain CPPs to penetrate barriers such as skin, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and cornea or conjunctiva of eyes enabled the replacement of dangerous and painful injections with soothing sprays, creams, and drops. However, it is difficult to rank the efficacy of CPPs because transport efficiency and tissue selectivity depend not only on the CPP itself but also on the target tissue or organ, as well as on the cargo and method of CPP-cargo coupling. Therefore, the present review describes some examples of new-generation CPPs and aims to provide advice on how to find or create the right CPP for a given task.","Reissmann, Siegmund; Filatova, Margarita P",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/psc.3300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615648/,58

Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for potentially relevant records. Extracted data was summarised by study, country, and region. We included one prospective cohort study and 18 case-control studies (N=15,233) from 12 countries in regions where the majority of the population is white-skinned (Americas, Europe, and Oceania). Eighteen of the 19 studies reported effect estimates suggesting an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and/or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) among outdoor workers. Only 11 studies found a significantly increased risk and many had imprecise estimates. There was a significantly increased risk of BCC and SCC in individual studies in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Western Europe, and Southern Europe but not across regions or countries. Overall, 95% of studies reported higher risks among outdoor workers, although the increases in risk were statistically significant in just over half of studies. Well-designed and sufficiently powered occupational case-control and cohort studies with adequate adjustment for confounding factors and other risk factors are required to provide more accurate risk estimates for occupational KC.","Loney, T; Paulo, M S; Modenese, A; Gobba, F; Tenkate, T; Whiteman, D C; Green, A C; John, S M",The British journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320481/,58

Host recognition of influenza A virus (IAV) infection relies on pattern-recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) for the activation of innate-immune responses. Here, we show that following a physiological low dose of IAV infection, viral sensing by either TLR7 or RIG-I induces a proinflammatory program that promotes viral replication. Transfer of bronchoalveolar lavage from infected wild-type mice into the airway of mice deficient in TLR7 and RIG-I pathways was sufficient to restore viral replication efficiency. Comparison of IAV-infected cells revealed that inflammatory mediators elicited by TLR7 and RIG-I signaling recruit viral target cells to the airway, thereby enhancing viral load within the respiratory tract. Our data suggest that IAV uses physiological levels of inflammatory responses for its replicative advantage and highlight the complex interplay between viruses and the host innate-immune responses.","Pang, Iris K; Pillai, Padmini S; Iwasaki, Akiko",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1303275110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23918369/,58

Despite extensive supervision literature, including literature reviews, the processes through which supervision training interventions produce their effects, for whom and under what circumstances is not clearly delineated. The purpose of this study is to explain the effect of contextual factors on the underpinning mechanisms of supervision training outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We propose to examine supervision training interventions across the health and human services workforce using realist methods. Pawson's five stages for undertaking a realist synthesis will be followed: (1) clarifying the scope of the review; (2) determining the search strategy; (3) study selection; (4) extracting data and (5) synthesising the evidence and drawing conclusions. Extracted data will include study characteristics, characteristics of participant cohort, intervention type, contextual factors, underlying mechanisms and supervision training outcomes. Patterns in context-mechanism-outcome configurations will be identified. Initial programme theories will be developed based on a comprehensive search of the literature, which will include key terms relating to supervision and training. The search strategy will involve: (1) electronic database searching using Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Social Services Abstracts, Educational Resources Information Center, PsycINFO and Australian Public Affairs Information Service and (2) hand and citation searching. We will also contact authors where necessary and discuss identified literature among the project team with extensive expertise in supervision training. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The realist synthesis will propose an evidence-informed theory of supervision training interventions (ie, what interventions work for whom and why). The findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presentations and through discussions with relevant organisations and stakeholders. The research will be used by educators to develop evidenced-based supervision training interventions. It will also help workplace supervisors to better understand what types of supervision training might work most optimally for them and their colleagues. Other researchers could use the synthesis findings to guide future supervision research.

As a top candidate, DLX5 exhibits a notable bifurcate re-configuration of its bivalent promoter in cancer. Specifically, DLX5 maintains a bivalent state in normal tissues; its promoter is hypermethylation, leading to DLX5 transcriptional silencing in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). In stark contrast, DLX5 promoter gains active histone marks and becomes transcriptionally activated in ESCC, which is directly mediated by SOX2. Functionally, silencing of DLX5 substantially inhibits SCC viability both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DLX5 cooperates with TP63 in regulating ∼2000 enhancers and promoters, which converge on activating cancer-promoting pathways. Together, our data establish a novel and strong SCC-promoting factor and elucidate a new epigenomic mechanism - bifurcate chromatin re-configuration - during cancer development.","Huang, Yongsheng; Yang, Qian; Zheng, Yueyuan; Lin, Lehang; Xu, Xin; Xu, Xiu-E; Silva, Tiago C; Hazawa, Masaharu; Peng, Li; Cao, Haotian; Ding, Yanbing; Lu, Daning; Berman, Benjamin P; Xu, Li-Yan; Li, En-Min; Yin, Dong",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370013/,58

PDAC patients with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) are more likely to carry germline PVs but there is no consensus main gene involved in FPC. We performed a systematic review of publications from PubMed and Scopus reporting PVs in patients with FPC, sporadic pancreatic cancer (SPC) and unselected cohorts of PDAC patients undergoing genetic testing and calculated a cumulative prevalence of PVs for each gene evaluated across these three groups of patients. When available, variants in the selected publications were reclassified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classification system and used for prevalence calculations if classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. We observed an increased prevalence of PVs in FPC compared to SPC or unselected PDAC patients for most of the 41 genes reported. The genes with the highest prevalence of carriers of PVs in FPC were ATM, BRCA2, and CDKN2A. BRCA2 and ATM showed the highest prevalence of PVs in both SPC and unselected PDAC cohorts. Several genes with the highest prevalence of PVs are involved in breast and ovarian cancer suggesting strong overlap with underlying genetics in these disorders but no single gene was predominant.

72607,Leveraging pathogen sequence and contact tracing data to enhance vaccine trials in emerging epidemics.,2021-05-20,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been tested as therapy for several brain disorders and as a means to modulate cortical excitability and brain plasticity. Cortical effects of VNS, manifesting as vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs), are thought to arise from activation of ascending cholinergic and noradrenergic systems. However, it is unknown whether those effects are modulated by brain state at the time of stimulation. In 2 freely behaving macaque monkeys, we delivered short trains of 5 pulses to the left cervical vagus nerve at different frequencies (5-300 Hz) while recording local field potentials (LFPs) from sites in contralateral prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas. Brain states were inferred from spectral components of LFPs and the presence of overt movement: active awake, resting awake, REM sleep and NREM sleep. VNS elicited VEPs in all sampled cortical areas. VEPs comprised early (<70 ms), intermediate (70-250 ms) and late (>250 ms) components. The magnitude of the intermediate and late components was largest during NREM sleep and smallest during wakefulness, whereas that of the early component was not modulated by brain state. VEPs during NREM were larger for stimuli delivered at the depolarized phase of ongoing delta oscillations. Higher pulsing frequencies generated larger VEPs. These short VNS trains did not affect brain state transitions during wakefulness or sleep. Our findings suggest that ongoing brain state modulates the evoked effects of VNS on cortical activity. This has implications for the role of ongoing cortical activity and brain state in shaping cortical responses to peripheral stimuli, for the modulation of vagal interoceptive signaling by cortical activity, and for the dose calibration of VNS therapies.","Rembado, Irene; Song, Weiguo; Su, David K; Levari, Ariel; Shupe, Larry E; Perlmutter, Steve; Fetz, Eberhard; Zanos, Stavros",Cerebral cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhab158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151377/,58

73672,Beyond Contact Tracing: Community-Based Early Detection for Ebola Response.,2016,"Eye contact constitutes a strong communicative signal in human interactions and has been shown to modulate various cognitive processes and states. However, little is known about its impact on gaze-mediated attentional orienting in the context of its interplay with strategic top-down control. Here, we aimed at investigating how the social component of eye contact interacts with the top-down strategic control. To this end, we designed a gaze cuing paradigm with the iCub humanoid robot, in which iCub either established eye contact with the participants before averting its gaze or avoided their eyes. Across four experiments, we manipulated gaze cue validity to either elicit strategic top-down inhibitory activity (25% validity) or to allow for relaxing the control mechanisms (50% validity). Also, we manipulated the stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA) to examine the dynamics of the top-down modulatory effects. Our results showed that eye contact influenced the gaze cuing effect when the strategic control was not required, by prolonging the prioritized processing of the gazed-at locations. Thus, the effect was observed only when the measurement was taken after a sufficient amount of time (1,000 ms SOA). However, when inhibitory control was necessary (25% validity), the social component was not potent enough to exert influence over the gaze cuing effect independently. Overall, we propose that strategic top-down control is the primary driving force over the gaze cuing effect and that the social aspect plays a modulatory effect by prolonging prioritized processing of gazed-at locations.

75753,A Comprehensive Multicomponent Neurosurgical Course with use of Virtual Reality: Modernizing the Medical Classroom.,2020-11-18,"Background The endovascular therapy for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is currently accepted as a second-line treatment for patients who have failed or those in whom systemic anticoagulation is contraindicated or in a subgroup of patients presenting with rapid neurologic deterioration. A number of different mechanical and pharmacologic endovascular strategies have been reported, either as separate or combined approaches. These new catheters and aspiration systems have a high power and vacuum capacity, which carries a risk of anemization of the patient and hypovolemic shock, being necessitating the transfusion of the patient. Material and methods Because of the problems that donor blood transfusion can bring, we describe the use of a Sorin Xtra® Autotransfusion System (ATS). This complete autologous blood recovery system was designed for use in procedures where medium- to high-volume blood loss occurs, such as major surgeries. We have adapted it to recover all the blood aspirated during the mechanical thrombectomy procedures of the dural cerebral venous sinuses, since they are procedures that can cause a significant loss of blood. One advantage to this is the patient receives his or her own blood instead of donor blood, so there is no risk of contracting outside diseases or transfusion reactions. Conclusions This technical note describes a novel and previously unpublished technical approach to CVST that can be immediately applied to clinical practice. It also raises awareness among the interventional neuroradiologist and anesthesiologist communities about novel, potentially lifesaving endovascular treatments in patients with extensive CVST.","Castaño, C; Cubells, C; Remollo, S; García-Sort, M R; Terceño, M","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019917720908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28732458/,58

Through advances in percutaneous interventional techniques and technologies and improvements in patient selection, current percutaneous coronary intervention may allow appropriate patients to benefit safely from revascularization procedures that might not have been offered in the past. The burgeoning interest in these procedures in some respects reflects an evolutionary step within the field of percutaneous coronary intervention. However, because of the clinical complexity of many of these patients and procedures, it is critical to develop dedicated specialists within interventional cardiology who are trained with the cognitive and technical skills to select these patients appropriately and to perform these procedures safely. Preprocedural issues such as multidisciplinary risk and treatment assessments are highly relevant to the successful treatment of these patients, and knowledge gaps and future directions to improve outcomes in this emerging area are discussed. Ultimately, an evolution of contemporary interventional cardiology is necessary to treat the increasingly higher-risk patients with whom we are confronted.","Kirtane, Ajay J; Doshi, Darshan; Leon, Martin B; Lasala, John M; Ohman, E Magnus; O'Neill, William W; Shroff, Adhir; Cohen, Mauricio G; Palacios, Igor F; Beohar, Nirat; Uriel, Nir; Kapur, Navin K; Karmpaliotis, Dimitri; Lombardi, William; Dangas, George D; Parikh, Manish A; Stone, Gregg W; Moses, Jeffrey W",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.116.022061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27482004/,58

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SIL) is a recent advance in minimally invasive surgical techniques. This study aimed to compare SIL right colectomy with conventional laparoscopy (CL) used to treat patients with colon cancer. METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of data from the authors' prospectively collected colorectal surgery database. Between August 2009 and November 2010, 159 patients who underwent primary laparoscopic right colectomy at the Samsung Medical Center were recruited to participate in this study. Of these, 66 patients underwent SIL colectomy. RESULTS The SIL and CL right colectomy groups did not differ significantly in terms of general characteristics including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American society of anesthesiology (ASA) score, previous abdominal operation, and diagnosis. The two groups also did not differ significantly in terms of perioperative complications (9.1 vs. 15.1 %, p = 0.335). Oncologic resection was similar in the two groups. The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 24 for SIL and 27 for CL right colectomy (p = 0.068). Tumor size, disease stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and proximal and distal resection margins did not differ significantly between the two groups. The mean follow-up period was 24.5 for the SIL group and 26.4 months for the CL group (p = 0.098), with six recurrences in the SIL group (9.1 %) and three recurrences in the CL group (3.2 %) (p = 0.120). One death occurred in the CL group. Disease-free survival at 24 months did not differ significantly between the two groups (89.7 vs. 96.3 %, p = 0.120). CONCLUSION The findings show that SIL right colectomy for colon cancer is safe and can provide resection and oncologic outcomes equal to those of conventional laparoscopic right colectomy.","Yun, Jung-A; Yun, Seong Hyeon; Park, Yoon Ah; Cho, Yong Beom; Kim, Hee Cheol; Lee, Woo Yong; Chun, Ho-Kyung",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2722-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23319285/,58

Using a thematic analysis of 18 in-depth interviews with public librarians, this study investigates common practices and challenges experienced while developing programs for older adults. This analysis is augmented by an environmental scan of older-adult programming offered in member libraries of the Canadian Urban Library Council (CULC). Results indicate that public librarians leverage community partnerships and staff training to develop programs that foster digital, financial, language, and health literacy and create opportunities for both intergenerational and peer social connection. At the same time, they face challenges related to limited space, budgets, and staff capacity, difficulty meeting the extensive and often conflicting interests of various groups within the library, and marketing programming to older adults. Findings indicate that public libraries may be key players in mitigating challenges often associated with having an aging population, and indeed highlight the many benefits of valuing and providing services to this population.","Baluk, Kaitlin Wynia; Griffin, Meridith; Gillett, James",Canadian journal on aging = La revue canadienne du vieillissement,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0714980820000367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103639/,58

We performed a literature search on 10 May 2020 of Medline/PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and major journals with specific COVID-19 sections. Articles eligible for inclusion contained the topic of education in surgery in the context of COVID-19. Specific questions we aimed to answer were: Is there any difference in surgical education from pre-COVID-19 to now? How does technology assist us in teaching? Can we better harness technology to augment resident training? Two-hundred and twenty-six articles were identified, 21 relevant for our aim: 14 case studies, three survey analyses, three reviews and one commentary. The collapse of the traditional educational system due to social distancing caused a fragmentation of knowledge, a reduced acquisition of skills and a decreased employment of surgical trainees. These problems can be partially overcome by using new technologies and arranging 2-weeks rotation shifts, alternating clinical activities with learning. While medical care will remain largely based on the interaction with patients, students' adaptability to innovation will be a characteristic of post-COVID classes.","Arezzo, Alberto; Vignali, Andrea; Ammirati, Carlo Alberto; Brodie, Ronit; Mintz, Yoav",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2020.1845210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241969/,58

We previously generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from dermal fibroblasts derived from the DFU patients, location-matched skin of diabetic patients and normal healthy donors and re-differentiated them into fibroblasts. To assess the epigenetic microRNA (miR) regulated changes triggered by cellular reprogramming, we performed miRs expression profiling. We found let-7c, miR-26b-5p, -29c-3p, -148a-3p, -196a-5p, -199b-5p and -374a-5p suppressed in iPSC-derived fibroblasts in vitro and in 3D dermis-like self-assembly tissue, whereas their corresponding targets involved in cellular migration were upregulated. Moreover, targets involved in organization of extracellular matrix were induced after fibroblast reprogramming. PLAT gene, the crucial fibrinolysis factor, was upregulated in iPSC-derived fibroblasts and was confirmed as a direct target of miR-196a-5p. miR-197-3p and miR-331-3p were found upregulated specifically in iPSC-derived diabetic fibroblasts, while their targets CAV1 and CDKN3 were suppressed. CAV1, an important negative regulator of wound healing, was confirmed as a direct miR-197-3p target. Together, our findings demonstrate that iPSC reprogramming is an effective approach for erasing the diabetic non-healing miR-mediated epigenetic signature and promoting a pro-healing cellular phenotype.","Pastar, Irena; Marjanovic, Jelena; Liang, Liang; Stone, Rivka C; Kashpur, Olga; Jozic, Ivan; Head, Cheyanne R; Smith, Avi; Gerami-Naini, Behzad; Garlick, Jonathan A; Tomic-Canic, Marjana",Experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114688/,58
85185,How can I refocus on my career after the pandemic?,2021-05-17,"Early treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has improved survival of children perinatally infected with HIV into adolescence. This population is at risk of long term complications related to HIV infection, particularly chronic respiratory disease. Limited data on chest imaging findings in HIV-infected adolescents, suggest that the predominant disease is of small and large airways: predominantly bronchiolitis obliterans or bronchiectasis. Single cases of emphysema have been reported. Lung fibrosis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, post tuberculous apical fibrocystic changes and malignancies do not feature in this population. Chest radiograph (CXR) is easily accessible and widely used, especially in resource limited settings, such as sub Saharan Africa, where the greatest burden of HIV disease occurs. Lung ultrasound has been described for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children, pulmonary oedema and interstitial lung disease [1-3]. The use of this modality in chronic respiratory disease in adolescents where the predominant finding is small airway disease and bronchiectasis has however not been described. CXR is useful to evaluate structural/post infective changes, parenchymal opacification and nodules, hyperinflation or extensive bronchiectasis. CXR however, is inadequate for diagnosing small airway disease, for which high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is the modality of choice. Where available, low dose HRCT should be used early in the course of symptomatic disease in adolescents and for follow up in children who are non responsive to treatment or clinically deteriorating. This article provides a pictorial review of the spectrum of CXR and HRCT imaging findings of chronic pulmonary disease in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents on cART and guidelines for imaging.","du Plessis, Anne-Marie; Andronikou, Savvas; Zar, Heather J",Paediatric respiratory reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2020.06.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139219/,58

STUDY DESIGN The pharmacy database at St Louis Children's Hospital was retrospectively queried to identify infants who (a) were born <28 weeks gestation between 2012 and 2014, (b) received dopamine and (c) had blood pressure measurements from an umbilical arterial catheter. A control group was constructed from contemporaneous infants who did not receive dopamine. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) at baseline, 1 h and 3 h after initiating dopamine were obtained for each dopamine-exposed infant. MABP measurements at matched time points were obtained in the control group. RESULT Sixty-nine dopamine-treated and 45 control infants were included. Mean ΔMABP at 3 h was 4.5±6.3 mm of Hg for treated infants vs 1±2.9 for the control. Median dopamine starting dose was 2.5 μg kg(-1) min(-1). Dopamine-treated infants were less mature and of lower birth weight while also more likely to be intubated at 72 h, diagnosed with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and to die. Failure to respond to dopamine was associated with greater likelihood of developing IVH (odds ratio (OR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-42.3), while a strong response (ΔMABP>10 mm Hg) was associated with a reduction in risk of IVH (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.01-0.8). CONCLUSION Low-moderate dose dopamine administration results in modest blood pressure improvements. A lack of response to dopamine is associated with a greater risk of IVH, whereas a strong response is associated with a decreased risk. Further research into underlying mechanisms and management strategies is needed.","Vesoulis, Z A; Ters, N E; Foster, A; Trivedi, S B; Liao, S M; Mathur, A M",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,https://doi.org/10.1038/jp.2016.5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26890555/,58

The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of intralesional injection of RTX in the healing of pemphigus lesions, with lower doses and probable better safety profile than intravenous RTX. Eleven Pemphigus patients with recalcitrant lesions received two intralesional injections of biosimilar RTX, 5mg / cm2. During six months follow-up, Pemphigus Disease Area Index, the patients' satisfaction, quality of life, the disease activity, the number and size of lesions, the anti-desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and 3 antibodies and the count of CD4 and CD19 cells were assessed. All patients were in partial remission on therapy. The absolute count of CD19+ B cells showed a statistically significant decline (P=0.006). The percentage of CD4+T lymphocytes increased 2 weeks after injection and decreased to the baseline two weeks later (P=0.01). The average number and size of lesions decreased. The concentration of anti- Dsg 3 antibody decreased insignificantly during the study. The severe pain during the injection was considered as the main complication. At the end of the study, two patients were in complete remission on therapy, and the other nine remained in ""partial remission on therapy"". Few side effects resulting from intralesional injection of RTX and enhanced quality of life of the patients were considered as the valuable achievements of this study. The results showed that although a low dose of RTX leads to a significant decrease of CD19+ B lymphocytes, it did not show parallel clinical effectiveness. This article is protected by copyright.

Recent research seems to raise doubts about whether this requirement is generally fulfilled. Often, replicability of results is defined as repeating a statistically significant result. However, since significance may not imply scientific relevance, dual-criterion study designs that take both aspects into account have been proposed and investigated during the last decade. Originally developed for proof-of-concept trials, the design could be appropriate for phase III trials as well. In fact, a dual-criterion design has been requested for COVID-19 vaccine applications by major health authorities. In this article, replicability of dual-criterion designs is investigated. It turns out that the probability to replicate a significant and relevant result can become as low as 0.5.

However, little information exists regarding the optimal size of the jejunal pouch after total gastrectomy. METHODS The study was designed as a single-center randomized trial in which the results of double-tract reconstruction with pouches of two different sizes were compared, i.e., short and long pouch double tract (SPDT and LPDT, respectively). We conducted a clinical assessment with standard questionnaire after surgery. The amount of residual food in the jejunal pouch was determined by endoscopy. RESULTS No demographic differences were noted between the two groups. The eating capacity per meal was higher in the SPDT group than in the LPDT group. The postoperative weight loss 24 months after surgery was lower in SPDT group than that in the LPDT group. Although the incidence of early dumping symptoms was higher in the SPDT group, no difference was noted in the other postprandial abdominal symptoms between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that the optimal pouch should be relatively short, as a short pouch improves the eating capacity per meal and the weight loss ratio to the preoperative value.","Tsujimoto, Hironori; Sakamoto, Naoko; Ichikura, Takashi; Hiraki, Shuichi; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Kumano, Isao; Matsumoto, Yusuke; Yoshida, Kazumichi; Ono, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Junji; Hase, Kazuo",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1641-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21785918/,58

The calves were all born on-farm, transferred to pens soon after birth, and fed with ""gold' colostrum. The hygiene, biosecurity and ventilation in the pens were poor. Of the 15 calves, 11 died or were euthanised and four calves, ≤48-hour-old, that became acutely ill later in the outbreak were treated with cefquinome, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, and recovered. Clinical findings: The affected calves presented with acute recumbency, lethargy, tachypnoea, tachycardia, increased lung sounds, inability to stand or feed, and dehydration without pyrexia. Pathological findings: Gross findings in a calf that died naturally included fibrinous pleuropneumonia, marked oedematous expansion of the interlobular septa, especially in the ventral lung lobes, fibrinous polyserositis and fibrinous polyarthritis. A second calf that was euthanised had strikingly similar lung lesions. Histologically, the pulmonary interlobular septa of both calves were prominently expanded by oedema, dilated lymphatics and the infiltration of numerous neutrophils and macrophages interspersed with small Gram-negative rod bacteria. Likewise, the visceral pleura showed fibrinopurulent inflammation with numerous small Gram-negative rods. Microbiological findings: Microbial culture and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry identified Bibersteinia trehalosi in the lung, stifle joint and peritoneal cavity of the first calf and lung of the second. Diagnosis: B. trehalosi acute fibrinous pleuropneumonia and septicaemia. Clinical relevance: This is the first report of the clinical findings and histological lesions of B. trehalosi pleuropneumonia and septicaemia in calves in New Zealand. The pathogen is isolated with increasing frequency from cases of bovine respiratory disease in dairy cows, feedlot cattle and calves in the United Kingdom and North America.

Thus, ideal in vitro models for examining cellular responses to respiratory pathogens polarize, forming apical and basolateral surfaces. One such model is differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). However, this system requires lung tissue samples, expertise isolating and culturing epithelial cells from tissue, and time to generate an air-liquid interface culture. Calu-3 cells, derived from a human bronchial adenocarcinoma, are an alternative model for examining the response of proximal airway epithelial cells to respiratory insult, pharmacological compounds, and bacterial and viral pathogens, including influenza virus, rhinovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Recently, we demonstrated that Calu-3 cells are susceptible to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in a manner consistent with NHBE. Here, we detail the establishment of a polarized, liquid-covered culture (LCC) of Calu-3 cells, focusing on the technical details of growing and culturing Calu-3 cells, maintaining cells that have been cultured into LCC, and we present the method for performing respiratory virus infection of polarized Calu-3 cells. To consistently obtain polarized Calu-3 LCC, Calu-3 cells must be carefully subcultured before culturing in Transwell inserts. Calu-3 monolayer cultures should remain below 90% confluence, should be subcultured fewer than 10 times from frozen stock, and should regularly be supplied with fresh medium. Once cultured in Transwells, Calu-3 LCC must be handled with care. Irregular media changes and mechanical or physical disruption of the cell layers or plates negatively impact polarization for several hours or days. Polarization is monitored by evaluating trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and is verified by evaluating the passive equilibration of sodium fluorescein between the apical and basolateral compartments . Once TEER plateaus at or above 1,000 Ω×cm(2), Calu-3 LCC are ready to use to examine cellular responses to respiratory pathogens.","Harcourt, Jennifer L; Haynes, Lia M",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/50157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23426201/,58

SETTING The survey was sent to and completed by site representatives of each ETC. PARTICIPANTS The survey was sent to all 55 ETCs; 47 (85%) responded. RESULTS Of the 47 responding ETCs, there are 84 isolation beds available for adults and 91 for children; of these pediatric beds, 35 (38%) are in children's hospitals. In total, the simultaneous capacity of the 47 reporting ETCs is 121 beds. On the basis of the current US census, there are 0.38 beds per million population.

Low absorption of oral administered TFB may cause elevated concentrations in the feces discharged from the salmon into the benthic environment. The polychaete Capitella sp. are often dominant in such habitats and consume organic waste deposited on the sediment. In the present study, Capitella sp. were exposed to doses of TFB in salmon feed of 1, 2 and 4 g TFB kg-1 (0 g TFB kg-1 in control group) over an experimental period of 32 days. Cumulative mortality was 12%-15% in both treatment groups with 1 and 2 g TFB kg-1 and reached 27% in the group with 4 g TFB kg-1. Only the highest dose (4 g TFB kg-1) negatively affected feed intake, growth and respiration of the polychaetes while food conversion efficiency was not affected. At the end of the experiment, the concentrations of TFB in the Capitella sp. were high, in the range of 9.24-10.32 μg g-1 for the three treatment groups. It was suggested that a maximum level of absorption rate was reached, also for the lowest dose. High concentrations of TFB in the Capitella sp. might pose a risk to crustaceans that forage for polychaetes in the vicinity of fish farms. We conclude that the effects of TFB on Capitella sp. may therefore primarily be to the predators rather than the Capitella sp.","Fang, Jinghui; Samuelsen, Ole B; Strand, Øivind; Hansen, Pia Kupka; Jansen, Henrice",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888609/,58

I argue that loneliness is a relevant issue for bioethicists for three main reasons: it causes ill-health; particularly in the age of Covid-19, it is becoming prominent on the clinical and public health agenda, affecting millions worldwide; and it engenders several ethical and philosophical questions as a social determinant of health with a rich conceptual background. In what follows I first review the link between loneliness and ill-health and argue that it should concern bioethicists because of this link. I also demonstrate how pertinent the issue of loneliness is being considered nowadays, and mark this as another reason for bioethicists to become engaged. I then move on to define loneliness and its various forms, drawing from modern and contemporary philosophers. The way we choose to cope with the pandemic of loneliness depends in part on its theoretical underpinnings, as well as its empirical scope. Theory thus combines with empirical data in order to devise and implement a rational public health policy, necessitating the kind of interdisciplinary approach that is the bedrock of bioethics. I conclude by suggesting future areas of research and recommendations.","Lederman, Zohar",Bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829525/,58

Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials.","Barrett, Jordan R; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Dold, Christina; Ewer, Katie J; Folegatti, Pedro M; Gilbride, Ciaran; Halkerston, Rachel; Hill, Jennifer; Jenkin, Daniel; Stockdale, Lisa; Verheul, Marije K; Aley, Parvinder K; Angus, Brian; Bellamy, Duncan; Berrie, Eleanor; Bibi, Sagida; Bittaye, Mustapha; Carroll, Miles W; Cavell, Breeze; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth A; Edwards, Nick; Flaxman, Amy; Fuskova, Michelle; Gorringe, Andrew; Hallis, Bassam; Kerridge, Simon; Lawrie, Alison M; Linder, Aline; Liu, Xinxue; Madhavan, Meera; Makinson, Rebecca; Mellors, Jack; Minassian, Angela; Moore, Maria; Mujadidi, Yama; Plested, Emma; Poulton, Ian; Ramasamy, Maheshi N; Robinson, Hannah; Rollier, Christine S; Song, Rinn; Snape, Matthew D; Tarrant, Richard; Taylor, Stephen; Thomas, Kelly M; Voysey, Merryn; Watson, Marion E E; Wright, Daniel; Douglas, Alexander D; Green, Catherine M; Hill, Adrian V S; Lambe, Teresa; Gilbert, Sarah; Pollard, Andrew J",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01179-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33335322/,58

OBJECTIVE To synthesise qualitative research exploring the experiences and perspectives of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI), relatives and health professionals concerning goal setting in SCI rehabilitation. METHODS Five electronic databases were searched. A search strategy was constructed with key concepts identified using PICo (Population, phenomena of Interest and Context). Peer reviewed studies complying with the inclusion criteria were selected. Interpretive Description methodology guided analysis and synthesis of the findings. RESULTS The search yielded 427 records. Of 12 full text studies assessed for eligibility, four were included describing goal setting in SCI rehabilitation from the perspective of persons with SCI and health professionals. Persons with SCI described a need for goal setting to be related to their everyday life, whereas the health professionals tended to use the hospital setting as their point of reference. Persons with SCI emphasised the importance of being self-directed and taking an active role in goal setting and rehabilitation. No studies presented the perspective of relatives. CONCLUSIONS This review illuminates the divergence in the understanding of goal setting between persons with SCI and health professionals. Goal setting in SCI rehabilitation often directly reflects physical functioning goals set by the health professionals, which does not prepare persons with SCI for everyday life and emotional issues. There is lack of focus on goals addressing psychosocial components such as family issues and change of roles. A shared process with goal setting relevant to persons with SCI and their everyday life is needed.","Maribo, Thomas; Jensen, Charlotte Maria; Madsen, Louise Sofia; Handberg, Charlotte",Spinal cord,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41393-020-0485-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424174/,58

The purpose of this systematic review is to critically appraise studies that have empirically tested the potential pathways linking health literacy to health behavior. METHODS We performed searches of the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to identify studies that proposed a conceptual framework and empirically tested the proposed mechanism through which health literacy influences certain health behaviors. Twenty eligible studies were included for analysis. KEY RESULTS The 20 studies addressed various health behaviors: chronic disease self-management (n = 8), medication adherence (n = 2), overall health status (n = 4), oral care (n = 1), cancer screening (n = 1), shared decision-making (n = 1), health information sharing (n = 1), physical activity and eating behaviors (n = 1), and emergency department visits (n = 1). Most studies were conducted in the United States (n = 13) and used a cross-sectional design (n = 15). The Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults was commonly used to assess health literacy levels. Selection of variables and their operationalization were informed by a theoretical model in 12 studies. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance status were reported antecedents to health literacy. The most commonly tested mediators were self-efficacy (n = 8) and disease knowledge (n = 4). Fit indices reported in the studies ranged from acceptable to excellent. DISCUSSION Current evidence supports self-efficacy as a mediator between health literacy and health behavior. Further research is needed to identify how health literacy interplays with known psychosocial factors to inform people's use of preventive care services. Future studies should include more disadvantaged populations such as immigrants with high disease burden and those with low health literacy. Theory-based, empirically tested health literacy models can serve as the conceptual basis for developing effective health interventions to improve health behaviors and ultimately decrease the burden of disease in such vulnerable populations.

However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDRCre ). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDRCre mouse brain (as reported by a cre-dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR-expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor α, and β-endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato+ neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR-expressing cells and to characterize their functions. This article is protected by copyright.

METHOD We simulated data from honest and cheating candidates to the UIT and the VT. Honest candidates responded to the UIT and the VT with their real ability level, while cheating candidates responded only to the VT, and different levels of cheating were simulated. We applied hypothesis tests, and obtained type I error and power rates. RESULTS Although we found differences in type I error rates between some of the procedures, all procedures reported quite accurate results with the exception of the Score Test. The power rates obtained point to MSLRT’s superiority in detecting cheating.

136995,Collectively jumping to conclusions: Social information amplifies the tendency to gather insufficient data.,2021-03-18,"OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 2019 patients are currently overwhelming the world's healthcare systems. This article provides practical guidance to front-line physicians forced to make critical rationing decisions. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Medline search for scientific literature, reviews, and guidance documents related to epidemic ICU triage including from professional bodies. STUDY SELECTION Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email. DATA EXTRACTION References and data were based on relevance and author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS We review key challenges of resource-driven triage and data from affected ICUs. We recommend that once available resources are maximally extended, triage is justified utilizing a strategy that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. ""First come, first served"" is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.","Sprung, Charles L; Joynt, Gavin M; Christian, Michael D; Truog, Robert D; Rello, Jordi; Nates, Joseph L",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32697491/,58

Robot technology is an evolution of manual videothoracoscopy introduced to overcome these limitations maintaining the advantages related to low invasiveness. More intuitive movements, greater flexibility and high definition three-dimensional vision are advantages of the robotic approach. Different studies demonstrate that robotic lobectomy and segmentectomy are feasible and safe with long term outcome similar to that of open/VATS approaches, however no randomised comparison are available and benefits in terms of quality of life (QOL) and pain need to be demonstrated yet. Several different robotic techniques are currently employed and differ for number of robotic arms (three versus four), the use of CO2 insufflation, timing of utility incision and the port positioning. The four arms robotic approach with anterior utility incision is the technique described by the authors. Indications to perform robotic lung resections may be more extensive than those of traditional videothoracoscpic approach and includes patients with locally advanced disease after chemotherapy or those requiring anatomical segmentectomy. Learning curve of vats and robotic lung resection is similar. High capital and running costs are the most important disadvantages.

Few studies have focused on outcomes in long lesions. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Orchid® DCBs in long lesions over 1 year of follow-up. METHODS This study is a multicentre cohort and real-world study. The patients had lesions longer than or equal to 150 mm of the femoropopliteal artery and were revascularized with DCBs. The primary endpoints were primary patency, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months and major adverse events (all-cause death and major target limb amputation). The secondary endpoints were the changes in Rutherford classification and the ankle brachial index (ABI). RESULTS One hundred fifteen lesions in 109 patients (mean age 67 ± 11 years, male proportion 71.6%) were included in this study. The mean lesion length was 252.3 ± 55.4 mm, and 78.3% of the lesions were chronic total occlusion (CTO). Primary patency by Kaplan-Meier estimation was 98.1% at 6 months and 82.1% at 12 months. The rate of freedom from TLR by Kaplan-Meier estimation was 88.4% through 12 months. There were no procedure- or device-related deaths through 12 months. The rate of all-cause death was 2.8%. Cox regression analysis suggested that renal failure and critical limb ischaemia (CLI) were statistically significant predictors of the primary patency endpoint.

Full BW was recorded before (d -2, -1, and 0) treatment application and at the end of experiment (d 20, 21, and 22) for ADG calculation. Daily DMI was recorded from d 1 to 21. Blood samples were collected on d 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21. During the initial 7 d of feedlot receiving, hay and total DMI were reduced (P ≤ 0.03) in TRANS vs. CON and MEL and similar between CON and MEL (P ≥ 0.26), whereas concentrate DMI did not differ (P = 0.16) among treatments. Mean ADG was reduced (P ≤ 0.03) in TRANS vs. MEL and CON but similar (P = 0.82) between MEL and CON. Moreover, TRANS had reduced G:F vs. CON (P = 0.01) and MEL (P = 0.05), whereas G:F was similar (P = 0.39) between CON and MEL. Serum NEFA concentrations were greater (P < 0.01) for TRANS and MEL vs. CON on d 1. Plasma haptoglobin concentrations were greater (P ≤ 0.03) for TRANS vs. CON and MEL on d 5 and greater (P ≤ 0.03) for CON vs. TRANS on d 10. Plasma ceruloplasmin concentrations were greater (P ≤ 0.04) for TRANS vs. CON on d 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14, greater (P ≤ 0.03) for TRANS vs. MEL on d 5 and 7, and also greater (P = 0.05) for MEL vs. CON on d 3. In conclusion, meloxicam administration to feeder steers modulated the haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin responses and prevented the performance losses caused by long-distance transportation.","Guarnieri Filho, T A; Cooke, R F; Cappellozza, B I; Reis, M M; Marques, R S; Bohnert, D W",Journal of animal science,https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2014-7783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25023798/,58

148364,Dynamic estimation of future obsolete laptop flows and embedded critical raw materials: The case study of Greece.,2021-07-26,"Pulse wave attenuation characteristics reflect compliance and resistance properties of the vessel wall as well as initial pulse generation factors. Recently, it has become possible to measure and map the retinal vessel wall pulse wave amplitudes. Predictable pulse wave amplitude distribution may allow inferences to be made concerning vascular compliance and resistance. Twenty-eight eyes from sixteen subjects (8 male and 8 female) were examined using modified retinal photoplethysmography with simultaneous ophthalmodynamometry. This allowed the assessment of vessel wall pulsation amplitudes under a dynamic range of intraocular pressures. Pulse amplitudes were calculated using harmonic regression analysis. The pulse wave attenuation was measured under different ranges of ophthalmodynamometric force (ODF) as a function of distance along the vessel (VDist), which in turn was calculated in disc diameters (DD) from the center of the optic disc. A linear mixed-effects model with randomized slopes and intercepts was used to estimate the correlations between the logarithmically transformed harmonic regression wave amplitude (HRWa) and the Fourier trigonometric coefficients with the predictors (VDist and ODF). The retinal venous harmonic regression wave attenuation (coefficient value±standard error) -0.40±0.065/DD, (p-value < 0.00001, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.27), which was approximately twice that of the arterial -0.17±0.048/DD, (p-value < 0.0004, 95% CI = -0.27 to -0.08). There was a positive correlation between attenuation of the harmonic regression wave and ophthalmodynamometric force in both vascular systems. The attenuation of all but the sine coefficient of the second Fourier harmonic (bn2) achieved statistical significance in the correlation with VDist. The cosine coefficient of the first Fourier harmonic an1 was the only coefficient to achieve statistical significance in the correlation with the predictors VDist and ODF in both vascular systems. The an1 coefficient value in the correlation with VDist was -3.79±0.78 and -1.269±0.37 (p < 0.0006), while this coefficient value in the correlation with ODF was 0.026±0.0099 and 0.009±0.04 (p < 0.01) in both the retinal veins and arteries respectively. The predictable attenuation characteristics in normal subjects suggest that this technique may allow the non-invasive quantification of retinal vascular compliance and other hemodynamic parameters.","Abdul-Rahman, Anmar; Morgan, William; Yu, Dao-Yi",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379837/,58

Our objective was to compare pediatric hospitalization safety events during the pandemic versus previous years. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study of hospitalizations in the Pediatric Health Information System, we compared Pediatric Quality Indicator (PDI) rates from March 15 to May 31, 2017-2019 (pre-COVID-19), with those from March 15 to May 31, 2020 (during COVID-19). Generalized linear mixed-effects models with adjustment for patient characteristics (eg, diagnosis, clinical severity) were used. RESULTS There were 399 113 discharges pre-COVID-19 and 88 140 during COVID-19. Unadjusted PDI rates were higher during versus pre-COVID-19 for overall PDIs (6.39 vs 5.05; P < .001). In adjusted analyses, odds of postoperative sepsis were higher during COVID-19 versus pre-COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio 1.28 [95% confidence interval 1.04-1.56]). The remainder of the PDIs did not have increased adjusted odds during compared with pre-COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative sepsis rates increased among children hospitalized during COVID-19. Efforts are needed to improve safety of postoperative care for hospitalized children.","Masonbrink, Abbey R; Harris, Mitch; Hall, Matt; Kaiser, Sunitha; Hogan, Alexander H; Parikh, Kavita; Clark, Nicholas A; Rangel, Shawn",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2020-004937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958441/,58
149564,Collection of SARS-CoV-2 Virus from the Air of a Clinic Within a University Student Health Care Center and Analyses of the Viral Genomic Sequence.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVES This study was designed as a narrative systematic literature review of medical specialist trainees' perspectives of the assessment messages they receive in the context of clinical performance assessments. The aim of the study was to determine if trainees value the information they receive through the formats designed to promote their development and, if not, the reasons for this. METHODS The authors searched the ERIC, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases for articles published up to 16 June 2018 that present original data on trainees' perspectives of the assessment messages they receive in the context of work-based assessments (WBAs) and in-training assessments (ITAs) used within their training programmes. All authors screened 938 abstracts and 139 full-text articles were assessed after this. Descriptions of quantitative data and thematic analysis of qualitative data were used to present the opinions of trainees. RESULTS Thirty-three articles met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six articles (79%) described trainees' perspectives in the context of WBA and the remaining articles referred to ITA formats. Wide-ranging opinions were reported. The analysis categorised these into three themes: trainees value developmental assessment messages; trainees become disengaged when assessment messages are not developmental, and trainees' views depend on the environment, the assessor and themselves. Some trainees reported that the assessment messages were valuable and provided input on their performance to guide their development, but many disagreed. In particular, the trainee's own level of engagement with the assessments influenced his or her perspectives on the messages received. CONCLUSIONS Trainees do not universally perceive that clinical performance assessments provide them with the valuable developmental input on their performance they were designed to do. Factors related to the environment, the assessor and themselves influence their perspectives.","Scarff, Catherine E; Bearman, Margaret; Chiavaroli, Neville; Trumble, Steve",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.13775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30672012/,58

The objective of this observational study was to assess if lung function remained impaired at 16 to 19 years of age in those who had received postnatal corticosteroids and whether the trajectory of lung function with increasing age differed between those who had and had not received corticosteroids. One hundred and fifty-nine children born prior to 29 weeks of gestational age had comprehensive lung function measurements; 49 had received postnatal dexamethasone. Lung function outcomes were compared between those who had and had not received postnatal dexamethasone after adjustment for neonatal factors. Forced expiratory flow at 75%, 50%, 25% and 25-75% of the expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow and forced vital capacity and lung volumes (total lung capacity and residual volume) were assessed. The majority of results were significantly lower in those who received dexamethasone (between 0.61 to 0.78 standard deviations). Lung function reduced as the number of courses of dexamethasone increased. Between 11 and 14 years and 16 to 19 years, lung function improved in the unexposed group, but forced expiratory flow at 75% of the expired vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second deteriorated in those who had received postnatal corticosteroids (p = 0.0006). These results suggest that prematurely born young people who received postnatal corticosteroids may be at risk of premature onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Harris, Christopher; Bisquera, Alessandra; Zivanovic, Sanja; Lunt, Alan; Calvert, Sandy; Marlow, Neil; Peacock, Janet L; Greenough, Anne",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764779/,58
151579,Using social networks to deduce whether residents or dispersers spread parasites in a lizard population.,2011,"Key DNA transactions, such as genome replication and transcription, rely on the speedy translocation of specialized protein complexes along a double-stranded, right-handed helical template. Physical tethering of these molecular machines during translocation, in conjunction with their internal architectural features, generates DNA topological strain in the form of template supercoiling. It is known that the build-up of transient excessive supercoiling poses severe threats to genome function and stability and that highly specialized enzymes-the topoisomerases (TOP)-have evolved to mitigate these threats. Furthermore, due to their intracellular abundance and fast supercoil relaxation rates, it is generally assumed that these enzymes are sufficient in coping with genome-wide bursts of excessive supercoiling. However, the recent discoveries of chromatin architectural factors that play important accessory functions have cast reasonable doubts on this concept. Here, we reviewed the background of these new findings and described emerging models of how these accessory factors contribute to supercoil homeostasis. We focused on DNA replication and the generation of positive (+) supercoiling in front of replisomes, where two accessory factors-GapR and HMGA2-from pro- and eukaryotic cells, respectively, appear to play important roles as sinks for excessive (+) supercoiling by employing a combination of supercoil constrainment and activation of topoisomerases. Looking forward, we expect that additional factors will be identified in the future as part of an expanding cellular repertoire to cope with bursts of topological strain. Furthermore, identifying antagonists that target these accessory factors and work synergistically with clinically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors could become an interesting novel strategy, leading to improved treatment outcomes.","Ahmed, Syed Moiz; Dröge, Peter",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599919/,58

Surgical reintervention is associated with increased complication rates. The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in recurrent varicose veins of the SSV and to compare this technique with surgical reintervention. METHODS All case files of patients treated for SSV varicosities between May 2006 and October 2008 were evaluated and recurrences were selected. Demographics, duplex findings, clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathological classification, perioperative and follow-up data were all registered. Additionally, a questionnaire focusing on patient satisfaction was taken. RESULTS Two hundred and eighty-one patients were treated for varicosities of the SSV, of which 42 were for recurrences. Twenty-six of these were treated with EVLA, all under local anaesthesia, and 16 were surgically treated. Most surgically treated patients were treated under regional anaesthesia (88%). Technical success was achieved in 94% of surgically treated patients and in all EVLA-treated patients. Complications in both groups were mostly minor and self-limiting. Sural nerve neuralgia appeared to be more frequent in the surgically treated group (20% versus 9%). After correction for length of follow-up, the incidence of rerecurrences was not statistically significant between groups. CONCLUSION EVLA is feasible in patients with recurrent varicose veins of the SSV with possibly a lower incidence of sural nerve injury. Patient satisfaction is high for both treatment modalities. Studies with larger samples are indicated to confirm these observations.","van Groenendael, L; Flinkenflögel, L; van der Vliet, J A; Roovers, E A; van Sterkenburg, S M M; Reijnen, M M P J",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1258/phleb.2009.009044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20483865/,58

Approximately 90% of hypertension cases are classified as essential hypertension, where the precise cause is unknown. Hypertension is associated with inflammation; however, whether inflammation is a cause or effect of hypertension is not well understood. The purpose of this review is to describe evidence from human and animal studies that inflammation leads to the development of hypertension, as well as the evidence for involvement of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction--both thought to be key steps in the development of hypertension. Other potential proinflammatory conditions that contribute to hypertension-such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, aging, and elevated aldosterone--are also discussed. Finally, we consider the potential benefit of anti-inflammatory drugs and statins for antihypertensive therapy. The evidence reviewed suggests that inflammation can lead to the development of hypertension and that oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are involved in the inflammatory cascade. Aging and aldosterone may also both be involved in inflammation and hypertension. Hence, in the absence of serious side effects, anti-inflammatory drugs could potentially be used to treat hypertension in the future.","Dinh, Quynh N; Drummond, Grant R; Sobey, Christopher G; Chrissobolis, Sophocles",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/406960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25136585/,58

AIM To share our experience of photographic triage during the first three months of COVID-19 lockdown, lessons learned and recommendations. DESIGN Prospective data collection over 3 months. RESULTS 220 photographic referrals were received, swelling (30%) and dental trauma (27%) were the commonest presenting complaints. 57% of referrals were not seen, 23% were seen semi-urgently and 20% booked for outpatient review. Of those seen, 7 children were seen elsewhere and 44 were seen face-to-face at AHCH, with 8 being admitted. CONCLUSION Photographic triage reduced physical encounters, and proved useful in training junior staff, assessment of new patient referrals and non-resident on-calls.

As a model pathogen, SeV has been extensively studied to define the basic biochemical and molecular biologic properties of the paramyxoviruses. In addition, SeV-infected host cells were widely employed to uncover the mechanism of innate immune response. To identify proteins involved in the SeV infection process or the SeV-induced innate immune response process, system-wide evaluations of SeV-host interactions have been performed. cDNA microarray, siRNA screening and phosphoproteomic analysis suggested that multiple signaling pathways are involved in SeV infection process. Here, to study SeV-host interaction, a global quantitative proteomic analysis was performed on SeV-infected HEK 293T cells. A total of 4699 host proteins were quantified, with 742 proteins being differentially regulated. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that regulated proteins were mainly involved in ""interferon type I (IFN-I) signaling pathway"" and ""defense response to virus,"" suggesting that these processes play roles in SeV infection. Further RNAi-based functional studies indicated that the regulated proteins, tripartite motif (TRIM24) and TRIM27, affect SeV-induced IFN-I production.

162004,Climate change. What drives climate flip-flops?,2009,"A diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) is difficult to make on the basis of any single laboratory test result. Accurate diagnosis of MM generally results from a number of costly and invasive laboratory tests and medical procedures. The aim of this work is to find a new, highly specific and sensitive method for MM diagnosis. Serum samples were tested in groups representing MM (n = 54) and non-MM (n = 108). These included a subgroup of 17 plasma cell dyscrasias, a subgroup of 17 reactive plasmacytosis, 5 B cell lymphomas, and 7 other tumors with osseus metastasis, as well as 62 healthy donors as controls. Bioinformatic calculations associated with MM were performed. The decision algorithm, with a panel of three biomarkers, correctly identified 24 of 24 (100%) MM samples and 46 of 49 (93.88%) non-MM samples in the training set. During the masked test for the discriminatory model, 26 of 30 MM patients (sensitivity, 86.67%) were precisely recognized, and all 34 normal donors were successfully classified; patients with reactive plasmacytosis were also correctly classified into the non-MM group, and 11 of the other patients were incorrectly classified as MM. The results suggested that proteomic fingerprint technology combining magnetic beads with MALDI-TOF-MS has the potential for identifying individuals with MM. The biomarker classification model was suitable for preliminary assessment of MM and could potentially serve as a useful tool for MM diagnosis and differentiation diagnosis.","Wang, Qing-Tao; Li, Yong-Zhe; Liang, Yu-Fang; Hu, Chao-Jun; Zhai, Yu-Hua; Zhao, Guan-Fei; Zhang, Jian; Li, Ning; Ni, An-Ping; Chen, Wen-Ming; Xu, Yang",Anatomical record,https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.20871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19301277/,58

Administration of soluble ACE2 protein acting as a decoy to bind to SARS-CoV-2 should limit viral uptake mediated by binding to membrane-bound full-length ACE2, and further therapeutic benefit should result from ensuring enzymatic ACE2 activity to affected organs in patients with COVID-19. METHODS A short variant of human soluble ACE2 protein consisting of 618 amino acids (hACE2 1-618) was generated and fused with an albumin binding domain (ABD) using an artificial gene encoding ABDCon, with improved albumin binding affinity. Human kidney organoids were used for infectivity studies of SARS-CoV-2 in a BSL-3 facility to examine the neutralizing effect of these novel ACE2 variants. RESULTS Whereas plasma ACE2 activity of the naked ACE2 1-618 and ACE2 1-740 lasted about 8 hours, the ACE2 1-618-ABD resulted in substantial activity at 96 hours, and it was still biologically active 3 days after injection. Human kidney organoids express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and when infected with SARS-CoV-2, our modified long-acting ACE2 variant neutralized infection. CONCLUSIONS This novel ACE2 1-618-ABD can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in human kidney organoids, and its prolonged duration of action should ensure improved efficacy to prevent viral escape and dosing convenience.","Wysocki, Jan; Ye, Minghao; Hassler, Luise; Gupta, Ashwani Kumar; Wang, Yuguo; Nicoleascu, Vlad; Randall, Glenn; Wertheim, Jason A; Batlle, Daniel",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020101537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33526471/,58
162313,Up to the Challenge Electric Industry Success,2021,"INTRODUCTION There are limited treatment options for postinfectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD). Olfactory training has recently been used in clinical practice, but no medical treatment is widely accepted. Although there is weak evidence for their value, some physicians use oral corticosteroids as first-line treatment. The aim of this study was to compare combined oral methylprednisolone and olfactory training with olfactory training alone in the management of PIOD. METHODS This prospective cohort study included 131 patients with PIOD over a 2-year period before the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy-eight patients who were treated with oral methylprednisolone and olfactory training (group A) were compared with 53 patients who were treated with olfactory training only (group B). Olfactory function was evaluated with ""Sniffin' Sticks"" at baseline and 2, 8, and 16 weeks after initial assessment. Patients who improved after steroid treatment underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the paranasal sinuses, skin prick tests, lung spirometry, and sputum eosinophil assessment. RESULTS Oral steroids improved 19.23% of patients (n = 15) of group A. History, clinical evaluation, imaging, and laboratory tests identified an inflammatory background in half of them (n = 8). The remaining 7 had no findings of nasal inflammation, and all had a short history of olfactory dysfunction. Both groups significantly improved in olfactory testing results at the end of the olfactory training scheme without significant difference between them. CONCLUSIONS The percentage of improved patients after oral methylprednisolone was relatively low to suggest it as first-line treatment. Half of the improved patients had an underlying upper airway inflammatory condition not related to the infection that caused the acute loss of olfactory function.","Genetzaki, Sotiria; Tsakiropoulou, Evangelia; Nikolaidis, Vasilios; Markou, Konstantinos; Konstantinidis, Iordanis",ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107478/,58

This concept emerged several years ago and is being adopted by a rapidly-growing number of educational institutions around the globe. In recent years, the boost of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), together with the advances in big data analysis, has unfolded novel perspectives to enhance personalized education in numerous dimensions. By taking advantage of AI/ML methods, the educational platform precisely acquires the student's characteristics. This is done, in part, by observing the past experiences as well as analyzing the available big data through exploring the learners' features and similarities. It can, for example, recommend the most appropriate content among numerous accessible ones, advise a well-designed long-term curriculum, connect appropriate learners by suggestion, accurate performance evaluation, and the like. Still, several aspects of AI-based personalized education remain unexplored. These include, among others, compensating for the adverse effects of the absence of peers, creating and maintaining motivations for learning, increasing diversity, removing the biases induced by the data and algorithms, and the like. In this paper, while providing a brief review of state-of-the-art research, we investigate the challenges of AI/ML-based personalized education and discuss potential solutions.","Maghsudi, Setareh; Lan, Andrew; Xu, Jie; Schaar, Mihaela van der",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10074v1.pdf,58
164631,A Machine Learning Approach to Identifying Delirium from Electronic Health Records,2021-09-14,"Introduction: Impaired balance-regulation after stroke put patients and therapists at risk for injury during rehabilitation. Body-weight-support systems (BWSSs) minimize this risk and allow patients to safely practice balance activities during therapy. Treadmill based balance perturbation systems with BWSSs are known to improve balance in patients with age or disease related impairments. However, these stationary systems are unable accommodate complex exercises requiring more freedom of movement. Objective: To evaluate the impact of a new balance perturbation module, which is directly integrated to a track-mounted BWSS, has on patient balance after acute stroke. Design: Unblinded quasi-randomized controlled pilot study. Setting: Rehabilitation centered long-term acute care hospital. Participants: Stroke rehabilitation inpatients with an admission Berg Balance Scale (BBS) assessment score of 21/56 or greater. Interventions: BWSS and BWSS with perturbation (BWSS-P) training was incorporated into participants regular treatment. While both groups conducted the same balance and gait activities during their treatment sessions, the BWSS-P sessions included lateral and anterior/posterior resistive or assistive balance perturbations. Main outcome measures: BBS and Activities-Specific Balance-Confidence (ABC) assessments were the main outcome measure collected. Institutional BBS data from fiscal-year 2018, prior to installation of the track mounted BWSS, was used as a historical standard-of-care (SOC) baseline. Results: Improved post-intervention BBS and ABC assessment scores showed all participants benefited from therapy (p[≤]0.0438). The BBS percent-change of the BWSS-P [mean(SD)n] [66.95%(43.78%)14] and BWSS control [53.29%(24.13%)15] were greater than the SOC group [28.31%(17.25%)30] (p[≤]0.0178), with no difference between BWSS groups (p=0.6669); ABC percent score-changes were also similar (p[≥]0.8036). Conclusions: BWSS groups demonstrated similar BBS and ABC score improvements, indicating balance perturbations are not detrimental to post-acute stroke rehabilitation and are safe to use. This data provides strong rationale for conducting a larger follow-up study to further assess if this new perturbation system provides additional benefit to stroke patient balance during rehabilitation.

Methods- The study was conducted during 3rd week of January 2021. Among 3550 HCWs, 979 subjects were selected by stratified random sampling and grouped into high risk and low risk category based on job setting. Demographic details and clinical information regarding previous history of COVID 19 were collected at the time of SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing. Results: From 979 subjects, the data with respect to 940 health care workers were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detected in 19.1% of HCWs. Seroprevalence among high risk group was 20.3% and that in low risk group was 7.4% [p=0.005]. In high-risk group, seropositivity was noted in 30.54 % of nurses, 19% hospital attenders, 18.9% resident doctors and 6.4% consultant doctors. In those with past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, seropositivity was 75.4%. In those who were COVID positive during July2020, 33.3% were still IgG reactive. Interpretation and conclusion- The study reported 19.1% SARS CoV-2 IgG reactivity among health care workers in our hospital. Seropositivity was significantly higher in high risk group compared to low risk group. Antibody decay kinetics in our study is comparable to that in published literature. Infection control challenges in hybrid hospitals account for higher seropositivity in this study compared to overall seroprevalence among HCWs in Kerala.","S J, J.; Beegum, S.; Gopakumar, G.; G, B.; S, C.; Sasidharan, S.; Tonio, A.; REGHUKUMAR, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.19.21260792v1?rss=1,58
165337,Opening the Conversation: The Development of a Faculty-Facing Module on Teaching Students With Dyslexia,2021,"Human adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) is used as a gene-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1. Yet, its primary receptor portfolio remains controversial, potentially including sialic acid, CAR, integrins, and CD46. We and others have shown that Ad26 can use CD46, but these observations were questioned by the inability to co-crystallize Ad26 fiber with CD46. Recent work demonstrated that Ad26 binds CD46 with its hexon protein rather than its fiber. We examined the functional consequences of Ad26 for infection in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression of human CD46 on Chinese hamster ovary cells increased Ad26 infection significantly. Deletion of the complement control protein domains CCP1 or CCP2 or the serine-threonine-proline (STP) region of CD46 reduced infection. Comparing wild type and sialic acid-deficient CHO cells, we show that the usage of CD46 is independent of its sialylation status. Ad26 transduction was increased in CD46 transgenic mice after intramuscular (IM) injection, but not after intranasal (IN) administration. Ad26 transduction was 10-fold lower than Ad5 after intratumoral (IT) injection of CD46-expressing tumors. Ad26 transduction of liver was 1000-fold lower than Ad5 after intravenous (IV) injection. These data demonstrate the use of CD46 by Ad26 under certain situations, but also show that the receptor has little consequence by other routes of administration. Finally, IV injection of high doses of Ad26 into CD46 mice induced release of liver enzymes in the bloodstream and reduced white blood cell counts, but did not induce thrombocytopenia. This suggests that Ad26 virions do not induce direct clotting side effects seen during COVID-19 vaccination with this serotype of adenovirus. IMPORTANCE Human species D Ad26 is being pursued as a low seroprevalence vector for oncolytic virotherapy and gene-based vaccination against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. However, there is debate in the literature about its tropism and receptor utilization, which directly influence its efficiency for certain applications. This work was aimed at determining which receptor(s) this virus uses for infection, and its role in virus biology, vaccine efficacy, and importantly, in vaccine safety.","Hemsath, Jack R.; Liaci, A.

Tobacco use is known to be detrimental to lung and immune function, thus suppressing the body's ability to combat infections including the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. This study was intended at surveying the stress, tobacco consumption patterns, and the coping behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: Seven hundred and twenty-nine current tobacco users aged 18 years and above participated in the questionnaire study on stress due to COVID-19, tobacco consumption patterns during lockdown, years of tobacco use, prior quit attempts, thoughts of quitting currently, and means of purchasing and coping behavior. The data were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The average Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence score was 6, and males had higher scores than females. 68.4% of tobacco users reported increased use, 5.07% decreased use, and 26.4% no change in tobacco use during the lockdown. Causes for increased tobacco use were stress (62.1%), being alone and restrictions in movement (21.6%), and boredom (16.3%), while the fear of contracting COVID infection and becoming severely ill has motivated few (31.6%) to decrease tobacco use. 50.9% wanted to quit, the thought of quitting tobacco was more among men (54%) as compared to women and was higher among smokers as compared to smokeless tobacco users. Conclusion: Tobacco users appear to be affected by stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with majority of them increasing the consumption.","Sujatha, S.; Shwetha, V.; Vaishnavi, P.; Sreekanth, P.; Nagi, R.",Journal of Head &amp; Neck Physicians and Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4103/jhnps.jhnps_61_20,58

Considering the environmental and economic factors in urban logistics, this paper conducts comprehensive design and optimization research on the network nodes and passages of urban underground logistics and proposes a relatively complete framework for a sustainable underground logistics network. A hybrid method is proposed, which includes the set cover model used to perform the first location of urban underground logistics nodes, the fuzzy clustering method applied to classify the located logistics nodes into the first-level and second-level nodes considering the congestion in different urban areas of the city and a mixed integer programming model proposed to optimize and design the underground logistics passage to find optimal passage parameters at every underground logistics node. Based on the above hybrid method, a sustainable underground logistics network framework including all-levels logistics nodes and passages is formed, with a subdistrict of Nanjing as a case study. The discussion of results shows that this underground logistics network framework proposal is very effective in reducing logistics time cost, exhaust emission and congestion cost. It provides support for decisions in the design and development of urban sustainable underground logistics networks.","Wei, Hairui Li Anlin Jia Nana",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12219147,58

167418,Comparing two sentiment analysis approaches by understand the hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccine based on Twitter data in two cultures,2021,"An increasing number of proteins have been demonstrated in recent years to adopt multiple three-dimensional folds with different functions. These metamorphic proteins are characterized by having two or more folds with significant differences in their secondary structure, where each fold is stabilized by a distinct local environment. So far, about 90 metamorphic proteins have been identified in the Protein Databank (PDB), but we and others hypothesize that a far greater number of metamorphic proteins remain undiscovered. In this work, we introduce a computational model to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only knowledge of the sequence. In this model, secondary structure prediction programs are used to calculate diversity indices, which are measures of uncertainty in predicted secondary structure at each position in the sequence; these are then used to assign protein sequences as likely to be metamorphic vs. monomorphic (i.e. having just one-fold). We constructed a reference dataset to train our classification method, which includes a novel compilation of 140 likely-monomorphic proteins, and a set of 201 metamorphic proteins taken from the literature. Our model is able to classify proteins as metamorphic vs. monomorphic with a Matthews correlation coefficient of ∼0.4 and true positive / true negative rates of ∼65% / 80%, suggesting that it is possible to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only sequence information. Statement of Significance This paper introduces the diversity index as a descriptor to distinguish metamorphic proteins, which possess multiple stable folds, from monomorphic proteins that possess only one fold. The diversity index is designed to measure uncertainty in computationally predicted secondary structure, which we hypothesize is elevated for metamorphic proteins. We tested our hypothesis by training a binary classifier using the diversity index and an annotated dataset of metamorphic and monomorphic proteins, and found an optimal Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.4, supporting the hypothesis and demonstrating for the first time that it is possible to predict metamorphic behavior in proteins using only sequence information. The sequence-based classifier has broader applicability compared to methods that rely on making comparison to experimentally measured structures.","Chen, N.; Das, M.; LiWang, A.; Wang, L.-P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967935,58

Rapid and precise identification of cases and tracing of transmission chains is critical to end outbreaks and to inform prevention measures. Methods: We combined conventional surveillance with Influenza A virus (IAV) genome sequencing to identify and contain a large IAV outbreak in a metropolitan healthcare system. A total of 381 individuals, including 91 inpatients and 290 health care workers (HCWs), were included in the investigation. Results: During a 12-day period in early 2019, infection preventionists identified 89 HCWs and 18 inpatients as cases of influenza-like illness (ILI), using an amended definition, without the requirement for fever. Sequencing of IAV genomes from available nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens identified 66 individuals infected with a nearly identical strain of influenza A H1N1 (43 HCWs, 17 inpatients, and 6 with unspecified affiliation). All HCWs infected with the outbreak strain had received the seasonal influenza virus vaccination. Characterization of five representative outbreak viral isolates did not show antigenic drift. In conjunction with IAV genome sequencing, mining of electronic records pinpointed the origin of the outbreak as a single patient and a few interactions in the emergency department that occurred one day prior to the index ILI cluster. Conclusions: We used precision surveillance to identify and control a large nosocomial IAV outbreak, mapping the source of the outbreak to a single patient rather than HCWs as initially assumed based on conventional epidemiology. These findings have important ramifications for more effective prevention strategies to curb nosocomial respiratory virus outbreaks.","Javaid, W.; Ehni, J.; Gonzalez-Reiche, A. S.; Carreno, J.

These are called vulnerable groups and pregnant women are one of them. Summary: Pregnant women were thought to be not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first wave, but recent observations from the second wave which harbors the mutated versions of novel coronavirus, said to be more virulent and lethal, suggests that pregnant women are not only vulnerable to catching the infection but they can show severe clinical outcomes. Also case fatalities, preterm births are also high among COVID-19 infected pregnant women.

167843,COVID-19 Lung Image Classification Based on Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine,2021,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, can be isolated and cultured in tracheal organ cultures (TOCs), embryonated eggs and cell cultures. TOCs and embryonated eggs are commonly used for viral isolation but use of these is laborious and expensive. Cell cultures have been used only with IBV strains that have previously been adapted to grow under laboratory conditions, and not for primary isolation. Previous studies using the coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) have suggested that foetal bovine serum (FBS), a common component of cell culture media, can inhibit the adsorption of coronaviruses onto the host cell membrane receptors. In the present study, the replication of IBV in primary chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cell cultures and the Leghorn hepatocellular carcinoma (LMH) cell line was examined using two different cell culture media, one containing FBS and the other containing yeast extract (YE). A reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was used to quantify viral RNA copies in cell lysates. The highest concentrations of viral genomes were observed when the cell culture medium did not contain FBS. Examination of the infectivity of virus grown in CEK cell cultures was examined by titration in embryonated chicken eggs, demonstrating that the cell lysate from CEK cell cultures in medium without FBS contained a higher median embryo infectious dose (EID50) than that from CEK cell cultures in medium containing FBS. These results suggest that improved replication of IBV in cell cultures can be achieved by the omission of FBS from the cell culture medium. This may enhance the potential for production of vaccines in cell culture and facilitate the isolation of emergent IBV strains in cell cultures.","Quinteros, José A.; Browning, Glenn F.; Noormohammadi, Amir H.; Stevenson, Mark A.; Coppo, Mauricio J.

These droplets can come from the mucus (mouth and nose) or conjunctiva (eyes), having a diameter between 5 to 10 micrometers. As a consequence of it, there is high contagion rate presented by this virus, making essential that health personnel in contact with these patients wear highly specialized protective equipment, this has led to a shortage of these products worldwide. This paper presents the design, development and validation of a health personnel protection system which consists of a diving mask, an adapter made in 3D printing (additive manufacturing) and a bidirectional High Efficiency Particulate Air filter. Protocols for cleaning, sterilization and management of the device components are also presented.

We investigate the impacts of the oil price war on global crude oil markets. By doing so, we use the daily futures and spot prices in three major crude oil markets – West Texas Intermediate, European Brent, and Oman – to perform a systematic analysis of the impacts of the oil price war on them. The event study method, a well-established analytical tool to measure the impacts of a given event on markets, is used in this study. The results indicate that information leakage plays an important role in the impacts of the price war. The outbreak of and truce following the price war have asymmetrical impacts on the markets;negative impacts generated by information leakage during the outbreak are generally more durable than the positive ones it generated during the truce. Furthermore, the magnitude of the impacts on futures markets is negatively correlated with the time-to-maturity of futures. Finally, negative crude oil prices affect West Texas Intermediate crude oil markets the most. Our findings generally show that market participants could perceive and assimilate market changes and adjust their expectations, which restrained the impacts that should have occurred within the oil price war. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ma, R.

The nature of this global crisis has meant that these processes remain under-systematized. The aim of this study, which uses an exploratory design and mixed-methods analysis, is to contribute to describing the changes in human resource management practices and processes that resulted from this pandemic and to present the outlook of human resource managers for the future. One hundred and thirty-six Portuguese companies participated in the study, with the answers provided by their human resource managers. Results show that the main changes have occurred in the processes of work and safety, training, work organization, recruitment and selection, induction and onboarding, and communication. The profiles that emerged showed an association between the level of change and size of the organization. There was an increase in the use of teleworking and layoffs, and a positive assessment of the organizations’ level of preparation and adaptation to this crisis. Human resource managers reported that the most evident changes in the future will be associated with the use of technology, teleworking, and work organization. These findings are of the upmost importance, as human resource managers are essential pillars in the adjustment of the organizations to this pandemic situation.","Gonçalves, Sónia P.; Santos, Joana Vieira dos Silva Isabel S.; Veloso, Ana Brandão Catarina Moura Rita",Administrative Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/admsci11030069,58
168414,Review of polish spas using thermal waters in balneotherapy and healing purposes,2021,"Purpose of this report: The purpose of this rapid communication is to illustrate the effectiveness of different vaccination regimes for controlling the number of severe and critical COVID-19 cases in the city of Aschaffenburg, Germany. Our results show that, despite numerous vaccinations in the past, further vaccinations are necessary to immunize the population and to keep the number of severe and critical cases low in the coming months. Considering that not all people can or want to receive vaccination, we compare different age-specific vaccination approaches. Applied Methods: We use the agent-based epidemiological simulator Covasim for discussing the impact of different vaccination strategies. We calibrate it to reproduce the historical course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Aschaffenburg, Germany; for this, we model and integrate numerous public health interventions imposed on the local population. As for some of the political actions rigorous quantification is currently not available, we fit those unknown (free) model parameters to published data on the measured epidemiological dynamics. Then we calculate the state of immunization of the population, gained through infections and vaccinations, at any time in the past, including models for time-dependent immunity decay that have been made available in Covasim. Finally, we define and compare scenar-ios of different vaccination regimes, especially with regard to vaccinating adolescents and providing booster vaccinations to the elderly. Key message: Without further vaccinations, we expect a strong increase in severe and critical cases. In order to restrict their growth our simulations suggest that in all considered cases vaccinations of unvaccinated people is more effective than booster vaccinations for already fully vaccinated people. This applies even to vaccinations of young people who are not themselves at high risk of developing severe or critical illness. We attribute this observation to the fact that immunization of adolescents indirectly protects vulnerable age groups by preventing the spread of the virus more ef-fectively than further immunizing other age groups. This indicates that with the pandemic ongoing, strategies focussed on minimizing individual health risks by vaccinations may no longer coincide with those needed to minimize the num-ber of severe and critical cases.","Krebs, T.; von Jouanne-Diedrich, H.; Moeckel, M.

168727,Banking System of Russia in Context of Spread of Coronavirus Pandemic,2021,"Objective: Our study aimed to investigate the effects of the pandemic on human behavior and stroke management by comparing hospital admissions made due to stroke during the pandemic period with the same period of the previous year. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted on patients with stroke admitted to our hospital between April 1st, 2020, and May 31st, 2020, and April 1st, 2019, and May 31st, 2019. Strokes were divided into three subgroups: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischemic attack (TIA). The total number of strokes, stroke subtypes, vascular risk factors, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, presence of large vessel occlusion, thrombolytic therapy use, intensive care unit requirement, and in-hospital mortality values were compared for both periods. Results: A total of 133 patients, 75 males, 58 females, 44 during the pandemic period and 89 in the previous year, were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 71.29 +/- 13.12 years. During the pandemic period, compared with the same period one year ago, there was a 50% decrease in the number of strokes, a 44% decrease in the number of ischemic strokes, a 62.5% decrease in the number of intracranial hemorrhages, and an 87.5% decrease in the number of TIA. During the pandemic period, the rate of patients who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy, the rate of patients with large vessel occlusion, the inhospital mortality rate, and the mean NIHSS scores were found to be significantly higher during the pandemic, but the rate of patients who had a minor stroke was significantly lower.

169366,Organic Growth Theory for Corporate Sustainability,2020,"Background. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a neuroimaging technique that can be used to noninvasively map brain temperature (i.e., thermometry) over a large brain volume. To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range. Methods. Healthy participants aged 23-46 years (N=18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points, ~12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (TCRE) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of TCRE values. Results. The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2{degrees}C, with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time (F(1, 1591)=37.0, p < 0.0001) and for brain region (F(46, 1591)=2.66, p<0.0001). The time*brain region interaction was not significant (F(46, 1591)=0.80, p=0.83)). Participants' TCRE was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 - 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); 30 ROIs had a COVrep < 2.0%. Conclusions. Brain temperature demonstrated subtle regional variations that were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring pathological brain temperature changes when other modalities are unrevealing. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain TCRE, as well as the threshold above which TCRE is likely pathological.","Sharma, A.; Nenert, R.; Mueller, C.; Maudsley, A.; Younger, J.; Szaflarski, J.

In organizations, voting can occur to elect members of the committee or to choose the roles of candidates. At present, in this era of technological advancement, the voting process became a major issue in order to avoid vulnerabilities like missing votes, multiple voting, and miscount in an election. The manual or semi-automated systems of voting are quite a time consuming, inefficient and unfortunately lack security. Moreover, for COVID-19, physical manual vote taking has become colossal. In this paper, a secure android based mobile voting system named 'mVote' is developed for conducting vote at different institutes and organizations during and post-pandemic situation. The usability and usefulness of the 'mVote' mobile application were evaluated through the System Usability Scale (SUS) which was replicated with 75 participants. The findings of the evaluation study showed that the developed 'mVote' application is usable and will help different organizations and institutes to improve the voting experience during and post-pandemic situation.","Khan, S.

169581,Is It All about Efficiency? Exploring Students’ Conceptualizations of Sustainability in an Introductory Energy Course,2021,"This special issue expands the scope of a panel presentation at the Society for Research into Higher Education Annual Conference 2019 and makes two identified contributions to the field. First, drawing from existing literature, this introductory paper proposes three categorisations of employability as: outcomes approach, process approach and conceptual approaches. This moves beyond normative conceptualisation of employability from mostly the outcomes approach. The applicability of the categorisation is further enumerated by the diversity of contributions in this special issue that highlights (a) the complexity in the field and (b) the interrelatedness of the categories. Second, the special issue puts together a rarely combined collection of global perspectives on conceptualisations of employability, and insights from research on little studied groups in Western and non‐Western contexts (the UK, Portugal, Australia, the Indo‐Pacific Region, Germany, Kenya and Kazakhstan). The papers, therefore, illustrate the need to widen our scope of understanding employability beyond current dominant perspectives. The broadening that is required in employability discourses is further needed in view of unprecedented disruption brought on higher education during the COVID‐19 pandemic. This suggests the need to rethink our conceptualisations of employability amidst uncertainty and potential disruption to the future of work.

169694,Importance of satellite observations for high-resolution mapping of near-surface NO2 by machine learning,2021,"Background Many people who have self-harmed prefer informal sources of support, or support from those with lived experience. However, little is known about whether peer support improves outcomes for people who have self-harmed, and what might be the risks of peer support interventions in non-clinical settings. Objectives The aims of this review are to examine the effectiveness, acceptability and potential risks of peer support for self-harm, and how these risks might be mitigated. Methods We searched two bibliographic databases and grey literature for papers published since 2000. We included peer support for self-harm that occurred in voluntary sector organisations, providing one-to-one or group support, or via moderated online peer support forums. We excluded peer support within clinical settings, peer support provided by relatives or friends who self-harm, or peer support from unmoderated online forums. Quality appraisal was conducted on included papers, and study findings were summarised using a narrative synthesis. Results Ten papers met the inclusion criteria for this review, and most (n=8) were conducted in the United Kingdom. Eight of the papers focused on peer support that was delivered through online mediums and two examined face-to-face self-harm recovery/support groups. Limited conclusions about the effectiveness of peer support interventions for self-harm can be made, as we found no studies comparing this to other treatments or a control group. Peer support for self-harm was found to be acceptable and was viewed as having a range of benefits including a reduction of loneliness, a sense of community and empowerment, improvements in interpersonal skills, and access to information and support. The most commonly perceived risk associated with peer support for self-harm was the potential for triggering self-harm. Other potential risks identified were being re-traumatised by listening to other peoples stories, not having the knowledge or skills to help others, and misunderstandings or disagreements with other peers/group members. Conclusions Our findings highlighted a range of benefits of being part of a group with very specific shared experiences. This justifies investment in the provision of such resources, supported by safeguards to mitigate the potential risks from peer support interventions. Suggestions include organisations using professional facilitators for groups, including trigger warnings for online forums, and providing regular supervision and training so that peers are prepared and feel confident to support vulnerable people whilst maintaining their own emotional health.","Abou Seif, N.; John-Baptiste Bastien, R.; Wang, B.; Davies, J.; Isaksen, M.; Ball, E.; Pitman, A.; Rowe, S.

170121,Digital Consumers in the Foodservices Market,2021,"Disinfection strategies are commonly applied to inactivate pathogenic viruses in water, food, air, and on surfaces to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Determining how quickly viruses are inactivated to mitigate health risks is not always feasible due to biosafety restrictions or difficulties with virus culturability. Therefore, methods that would rapidly predict kinetics of virus inactivation by UV254 would be valuable, particularly for emerging and difficult-to-culture viruses. We conducted a rapid systematic literature review to collect high-quality inactivation rate constants for a wide range of viruses. Using these data and basic virus information (e.g., genome sequence attributes), we developed and evaluated four different model classes, including linear and non-linear approaches, to find the top performing prediction model. For both the (+) ssRNA and dsDNA virus types, multiple linear regressions were the top performing model classes. In both cases, the cross-validated root mean squared relative prediction errors were similar to those associated with experimental rate constants. We tested the models by predicting and measuring inactivation rate constants for two viruses that were not identified in our systematic review, including a (+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus and a dsDNA marine bacteriophage; the predicted rate constants were within 7% and 71% of the experimental rate constants, respectively. Finally, we applied our models to predict the UV254 rate constants of several viruses for which high-quality UV254 inactivation data are not available. Our models will be valuable for predicting inactivation kinetics of emerging or difficult-to-culture viruses.","Rockey, Nicole C.; Henderson, James B.; Chin, Kaitlyn; Raskin, Lutgarde; Wigginton, Krista R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.355479,58

But after the pandemic is over, the economy is expected to quickly recover and continue its further growth. In this article, the author intends to explore how well these expectations are justified and which industry sectors could contribute to Iceland's economic growth. The analysis shows that the country's current key export sectors (tourism, seafood production and aluminum industry) have a limited growth potential, mainly related to the ongoing development of aquaculture. The paper also considers key economic projects, linked to utilization of Iceland's resource and innovative potential. The abundance of cheap renewable energy enables the country to develop new energy-intensive projects (silicon smelters and data centers), as well as to consider the possibility to directly transmit electricity to the UK (project IceLink). These initiatives could significantly contribute to the future economic growth, although the Icelandic energy industry is not limitless. However, the biggest economic growth is expected in innovative industry sectors.

Yet, such studies are hindered by imperfect viral detection. To address this issue, we used a community occupancy model – refashioned for the hierarchical nature of molecular-detection methods – to account for failed detection when examining how individual-level host traits affect herpesvirus richness in eight species of wild bats. We then used model predictions to examine the role of host sex and species identity on viral diversity at the levels of host individual, population, and community. Results demonstrate that cPCR and viral sequencing failed to perfectly detect viral presence. Nevertheless, model estimates correcting for imperfect detection show that reproductively active bats, especially reproductively active females, have significantly higher viral richness, and host sex and species identity interact to affect viral richness. Further, host sex significantly affects viral turnover across host populations, as females host more heterogeneous viral communities than do males. Results suggest models of viral ecology benefit from integration of multi-scale host factors, with implications for bat conservation and epidemiology. Furthermore, by accounting for imperfect detection in laboratory assays, we demonstrate how statistical models developed for other purposes hold promising possibilities for molecular and epidemiological applications.","Sjodin, Anna R.; Anthony, Simon J.; Willig, Michael R.; Tingley, Morgan W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.178798,58
171162,Papua New Guinea in 2020: China rising and Bougainville independence,2021,"Tourism is counted as one of the most sensitive sectors to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. By the first quarter of 2020, it brought the foreign visitors' travels to a sudden and unexpected halt. This has negatively affected the tourism sector. Due to the perishable nature of the tourism industry products, many researchers are calling for urgent development and implementation of a rescue plan that will help in predicting the future number of foreign visitors. In this paper, we proposed an approach to modeling and forecasting a tourism time-series data that have both trend and seasonality. This approach is a combination of the Fourier series and artificial neural network methods to capture the seasonality and trend components in data. We applied this method to the monthly foreign visitors to Turkey dataset. We studied the data for the periods before, and during the COVID-19 pandemic. To account for uncertainties in the model prediction during the COVID-19 pandemic, we employed the Monte Carlo simulation method. We run 100 Monte Carlo simulations within ±2σ from the model curve. The mean of these 100 Monte Carlo simulation paths is computed and used for presenting the Monte Carlo forecast result values of the data. To test the feasibility of this approach, we compared the model predictions with some other existing models in the literature. In each case, the model has demonstrated a decent prediction and outperformed the benchmarked models. The proposed model produces a statistically good fit and acceptable result that can be used to forecast other tourism-related attributes. © 2021 IEEE.","Danbatta, S.

171477,Intelligent Channel Allocation for Age of Information Optimization in Internet of Medical Things,2021,"Costimulatory and coinhibitory mechanisms appear to be involved throughout immune responses to control their specificity and level. Many mechanisms operate;therefore, various theoretical models should be considered complementary rather than competing. One such coinhibitory model, pictured in 1971, involves the crosslinking of antigen receptors with inhibitory Fc receptors by antigen/antibody complexes. This model was prompted by observations that the Fc portion of antibody was required for potent suppression of immune responses by antibody. The signal via the antigen receptor wakes up T or B cells, providing specificity, while costimulators and coinhibitors stimulate or inhibit these awoken cells. The recent observations that administration of monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in early COVID-19 patients inhibits the induction of clinically damaging autoimmune antibodies suggest they may provide negative Fc signals that are blocked in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the reduced ability of SARS-CoV-2 antigen to localize to germinal centres in COVID-19 patients also suggests a block in binding of the Fc of antibody bound to antigen on FcγRIIb of follicular dendritic cells. The distinction between self and foreign is made not only at the beginning of immune responses but also throughout, and involves multiple mechanisms and models. There are past beginnings (history of models) and current and future beginnings for solving serious clinical problems (such as COVID-19) and different types of models used for understanding the complexities of fundamental immunology.","Sinclair, N.

Finding real-time data to correctly quantify this impact is very significant but not as straightforward. Nevertheless, an analysis of the power demand profiles provides insight into the overall economic trends. To accurately assess the change in energy consumption patterns, in this work we employ a multi-layer feed-forward neural network that calculates an estimation of the aggregated power demand in the north of Italy, (i.e, in one of the European areas that were most affected by the pandemics) in the absence of the COVID-19 emergency. After assessing the forecasting model reliability, we compare the estimation with the ground truth data to quantify the variation in power consumption. Moreover, we correlate this variation with the change in mobility behaviors during the lockdown period by employing the Google mobility report data. From this unexpected and unprecedented situation, we obtain some intuition regarding the power system macro-structure and its relation with the overall people's mobility.","Scarabaggio, Paolo; Scala, Massimo La; Carli, Raffaele; Dotoli, Mariagrazia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15654v1.pdf,58
172347,"Capacity Maintenance During Global Disruptions: Security, resilience and incentives matter",2020,"Some viruses use phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) to mark membranes used for genome replication or virion assembly. PIP-binding motifs of cellular proteins do not exist in viral proteins. Molecular-docking simulations revealed a putative site of PIP binding to poliovirus (PV) 3C protein that was validated using NMR spectroscopy. The PIP-binding site was located on a highly dynamic α-helix that also functions in RNA binding. Broad PIP-binding activity was observed in solution using a fluorescence polarization assay or in the context of a lipid bilayer using an on-chip, fluorescence assay. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 3C protein-membrane interface revealed PIP clustering and perhaps PIP-dependent conformations. PIP clustering was mediated by interaction with residues that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone. We conclude that 3C binding to membranes will be determined by PIP abundance. We suggest that the duality of function observed for 3C may extend to RNA-binding proteins of other viruses. Highlights A viral PIP-binding site identified, validated and characterized PIP-binding site overlaps the known RNA-binding site PIP-binding site clusters PIPs and perhaps regulates conformation and function Duality of PIP- and RNA-binding sites may extend to other viruses In Brief The absence of conventional PIP-binding domains in viral proteins suggests unique structural solutions to this problem.

Multicellular eukaryotes have therefore evolved a range of extrinsic and cell-autonomous mechanisms for restraining proliferation of aneuploid cells, including activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, accumulating evidence indicates that a subset of aneuploid cells can escape p53-mediated growth restriction and continue proliferating in vitro. Here we show that such aneuploid cell lines display a robust modal karyotype and low frequency of chromosomal aberrations despite ongoing chromosome instability. Indeed, while these aneuploid cells are able to survive for extended periods in vitro, their chromosomally unstable progeny remain subject to p53-induced senescence and growth restriction, leading to subsequent elimination from the aneuploid pool. This mechanism helps maintain low levels of heterogeneity in aneuploid populations and may prevent detrimental evolutionary processes such as cancer progression and development of drug resistance.","Giam, Maybelline; Wong, Cheng Kit; Low, Jun Siong; Sinelli, Matteo; Dreesen, Oliver; Rancati, Giulia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/818112,58

Who can tell whether a bright future awaits us or a doomed one? More importantly, who can arrange it to be the way we would like it to be? In 1993, the computer scientist and science-fiction author Vernor Vinge wrote: Within 30 years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended. Is such progress avoidable? If not to be avoided, can events be guided so that we may survive? (Vinge, 1993, p. 11) Remarkably enough, those 30 years will elapse within the next two years. However, Vinge’s forecast has already been shown to be inspired by fiction rather than science. More recent expert opinion has shifted the coming of super-intelligence to decades, even centuries to come (Müller, and Bostrom, 2016). Thus, the claim concerning the end of “the human era” due to this particular agent of the human future—technology—deemed by many as the decisive one, may not be so urgent and, given other existential threats like global warming or nuclear war, perhaps not exclusive either. So long as “the human era” lasts, there is still a chance for humanity to focus on the most important issue—the issue of control—in order to keep super-intelligence and humanity compatible (Russell, 2019).","Višňovský, Emil",Human Affairs,https://doi.org/10.1515/humaff-2021-0001,58

Purpose To explore the perceptions and experiences of nursing students whose clinical rotations were abruptly interrupted by COVID-19’s initial surge in the United States. Methods This qualitative study was conducted at a midwestern, academic medical center to elicit senior nursing students’ experiences. An online survey was administered with eight open-ended questions asking about: initial impressions of the pandemic;experiences of being a senior nursing student;sources of stress and coping mechanisms;preparing to work as a registered nurse;and views on the nursing profession. Results Among the 26 students who completed the survey, the majority were female (92%), aged 28 ∓ 4.1 years. A total of 18 subcategories emerged with four main themes identified as: a) breakdown of normal systems, b) feeling alone and the inability to escape, c) protective factors/adaptability, and d) role identify and formation. Conclusions Findings indicate students implemented a variety of strategies while adapting to the abrupt interruption of in-person clinical rotations, mandated restrictions, and social unrest.

But lacking of available testing kits lead us to develop automatic detection system to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Since, most COVID-19 patients suffer the lung infection, chest X-ray can be used to be an effective imaging technique to detect COVID-19. Because of the limited number of COVID-19 chest X-ray images, it is efficient to use deep transfer learning that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition task to domain-specific task. In this work, we aim to develop a deep transfer learning based detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using imageNet pre-trained VGG-16 deep CNN model. We develop six binary classifiers for different chest X-ray image data and then integrate all the classifiers to produce a final classifier to predict COVID-19 from non COVID-19 cases (normal and other disease). To evaluate all the models, we have collected COVID-19 chest X-ray images from two open source GitHub repository and others chest X-ray images from RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset. The experimental result shows the capability of our final classifier in the detection of COVID-19 by evaluating it with an independent testset. It also shows that our classifier achieved a high accuracy of 93% (with sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 94%, precision of 100% and F1-Score of 93%) in the detection of COVID-19 X-ray images from normal and other disease. © 2021 ACM.","Al Mehedi Hasan, M.; Shin, J.; Parvin, F.","11th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Technology, ICBET 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3460238.3460249,58

A major problem faced in the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the inefficiency and scarcity of medical tests. The use of computed tomography (CT) has shown promise in the evaluation of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. The analysis of the CT examination is complex and requires the effort of a specialist, which can lead to diagnostic errors. The use of CAD systems can minimize the problems generated by the analysis of CTs by specialists. This article presents a methodology for diagnosing COVID-19 using a trainable resource extractor using CNN and multiple classifiers. First, the quality of the images was improved using histogram equalization and CLAHE. Then, a basic CNN is used to extract resources from 708 CTs, 312 with COVID-19, and 396 Non-COVID-19. After the extracted data, we used multiple classifiers for classification in COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19. The results show an accuracy of 97.88%, recall of 97.77%, the precision of 97.94%, F-score of 0.978, AUC of 0.977, and kappa index of 0.957.

Thus, this work presents a proposal for reducing the emissions, fuel cost, and respiratory disease hospitalizations using environmental cost accounting principles to produce biodiesel production from waste frying oil. In our methodology, we conducted surveys, and collected waste cooking oil samples from local households and restaurants in São Paulo city, Brazil. Then, we produced biodiesel using these samples. Data on air pollutants were collected and correlated with the number of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases and their costs. Our results indicate that 330,000 respiratory disease hospitalizations were recorded in São Paulo city between 2009 and 2018, and the total cost for the Brazilian government reached US $117 million. Improving the city air quality by switching from fossil fuels to biodiesel could reduce the annual number of hospitalizations to 9880 and cost US $3.518 million, because the amount of pollutants emitted from burning fossil fuels was positively correlated with the number of respiratory disease hospitalizations and their costs. Moreover, the emission rates of particulate matter with particles less than 10 and 2.5 µm in diameter exceeded the World Health Organization limits throughout the study period. Using the survey data, we estimated that the average monthly quantity of waste cooking oil was 9794.6 m3, which could generate 9191.2 m3 of biodiesel and produce 239,713 t CO2 of carbon credits. Environmental cost accounting revealed that it would be possible to achieve an annual profit of approximately US $300 million from the sale of excess biodiesel, carbon credits, and glycerine, and fuel acquisition savings which could improve the image of São Paulo city and quality of life of its residents. Thus, we present this as a way to reduce cost and hospitalizations, and increase the number of available hospital beds for other diseases, such as COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors.

174314,Guest editorial,2021,"Background: Several risk factors for severe COVID-19 have been identified1. An important question is whether in addition to these generic risk factors, patients with a potentially altered immune response, either by disease (inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs)) or use of immunomodulatory agents (IA), carry a higher or lower risk of severe COVID-19. In addition, several other potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 have been suggested, such as vitamin D status and specific medication (NSAIDs, ACE-inhibitors)2. Objectives: To identify risk factors for severe COVID-19, requiring hospitalization, in patients with IRDs. Methods: Multicenter, unmatched nested case control study in four rheumatology centers in the Netherlands. Cases are IRD patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 between March 1st 2020 and May 31st 2020. Control patients are IRD patients not hospitalized for COVID-19 within this period and were included in a 1:4 ratio. Patient-, disease-and treatment characteristics were extracted (still ongoing) from electronic patient files, and a questionnaire was used to collect additional data (e.g. on behavioral aspects). Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression, corrected for confounders. Results: 77 cases and 198 controls were included. 26 case patients died as a result of COVID-19, 14 were admitted to the ICU. Crude ORs for female sex, age, BMI and presence of one or more comorbidities were 0.46 (95% CI 0.27-0.29), 1.1 (95%CI 1.0-1.1), 1.0 (95%CI 0.98-1.1) and 3.0 (95%CI 1.7-5.2) respectively. Table 1 displays corrected OR, highlighted when OR <0.5/≥2.0. Corrected ORs were not significantly increased for any IRD, but a trend for gout was present. Use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) shows a protective effect, while use of other csDMARDs than methotrexate or HCQ leads to a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Trends were present for increased risk for rituximab (RTX), glucocorticoids and ACE inhibitors, and protective effect for IL-6R blockers. Conclusion: The outcomes of this study are in agreement with other research regarding risk of severe COVID-19 related to IRDs and use of IA1. The suggested increased risk of severe COVID-19 in RTX use is of concern and should be monitored closely. Strengths of this study include low bias due to behavioral effects as only cases early in the pandemic were included, completeness of the determinants of interest and ultimately, it provides answers to a relevant and urgent question.","Opdam, M.; Benoy, S.; Verhoef, L.

174359,Multi-stage COVID-19 Epidemic Modeling Based on PSO and SEIR,2021,"Recent developments on extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing multiple virus particles challenge the rigid definition of non-enveloped viruses. However, how non-enveloped viruses hijack cell machinery to promote non-lytic release in EVs, and their functional roles, remain to be clarified. Here we used Bluetongue virus (BTV) as a model of a non-enveloped arthropod-borne virus and observed that the majority of viruses are released in EVs, both in vitro and in the blood of infected animals. Based on the cellular proteins detected in these EVs, and use of inhibitors targeting the cellular degradation process, we demonstrated that these extracellular vesicles are derived from secretory lysosomes, in which the acidic pH is neutralized upon the infection. Moreover, we report that secreted EVs are more efficient than free-viruses for initiating infections, but that they trigger super-infection exclusion that only free-viruses can overcome. Author summary Recent discoveries of non-enveloped virus secreted in EVs opened the door to new developments in our understanding of the transmission and pathogenicity of these viruses. In particular, how these viruses hijack the host cellular secretion machinery, and the role of these EVs compared with free-virus particles remained to be explored. Here, we tackled these two aspects, by studying BTV, an emerging arthropod-borne virus causing epidemics worldwide. We showed that this virus is mainly released in EVs, in vivo and in the blood of infected animals, and that inhibition of the cell degradation machinery decreases the release of infectious EVs, but not free-virus particles. We found that BTV must neutralize the pH of lysosomes, which are important organelles of the cell degradation machinery, for efficient virus release in EVs. Our results highlight unique features for a virus released in EVs, explaining how BTV transits in lysosomes without being degraded. Interestingly, we observed that EVs are more infectious than free-virus particles, but only free-viruses are able to overcome the super-infection exclusion, which is a common cellular defense mechanism. In conclusion, our study stresses the dual role played by both forms, free and vesicular, in the virus life cycle.","Labadie, Thomas; Roy, Polly",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.146357,58

175233,Climate change will drive novel cross-species viral transmission,2021-04-19,"For those concerned with the future of forests, the COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously offered cause for great concern, and renewed hope. On one hand, the pandemic is occurring at a time when forests are already under unprecedented pressures from climate change, amplifying concerns about unsustainable forest extraction in the name of economic recovery. On the other hand, however, the crisis has helped to gather momentum around the notion of a “green recovery,” including setting aside additional land for forest conservation. Drawing insights from past and ongoing research in India, we highlight an issue that exemplifies the tension between these two poles: the role of forests as social safety nets for rural communities in developing countries. It is well established that forests can provide critical resources for rural livelihoods, especially in times of crisis, and preliminary reports suggest that these resources have become even more important in the context of India's COVID lockdowns, and mass return migration from urban to rural areas. As the second wave of the pandemic continues to unfold in India, we highlight some key research priorities, including: 1) understanding how and to what extent forest-dependent communities and industries are changing their use of wood- and non-wood resources in the context of return migration and economic stress;2) tracking shifts in forest cover, structure, and composition that may result from increased extractive pressures;3) assessing the role of institutions, whether local, national, or international, in mediating these outcomes. Drawing on these observations, we suggest some key principles for integrating forest-based livelihoods into “green recovery,” founded on principles that articulate forests as complex and integrated social-ecological systems, prioritize equity, and build on past learnings of community-based forest management.","Saxena, Alark Dutta Anwesha Fischer Harry W.; Keleman Saxena, Alder Jantz Patrick",Forest Policy and Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102550,58

Challenges of remote studies, which are not usually relevant in the face-to-face learning environment, are now emerging. This leads to new learning experiences that open opportunities to develop the competencies needed by engineering professionals. This article analysis challenges and benefits of remote learning at three Baltics States universities with focus on influence to the development of personal, social and learning to learn competence. The theoretical basis of the research is formed by self-directed learning findings, focusing on students' purposefulness and responsibility for learning. The empirical part is based on a survey of engineering students from the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies, the Vytautas Magnus University and the Estonian University of Life Sciences on the challenges and benefits of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that almost a quarter of the respondents prefer remote studies, which are mainly based on the principles of self-directed learning. Main challenges in the context of personal competence are difficulty focusing or paying attention to remote studies, and also motivation/desire to complete assignments, in the context of social competence - communication with the teacher but learning to learn competence - digital skills to use distance learning platforms and tools and also the problem of availability of information on remote studies.

Methods: In this study, there are 3 treatment cohorts defined by disease status after transplant with different primary outcomes of interest. Cohort 1 includes AML/MDS pts. with morphological relapse after transplant;cohort 2 pts with minimal residual (MRD) and cohort 3 pts with no evidence of disease. As of June 2020, 54 pts have enrolled. Herein, we report the interim analyses of 22 pts treated in cohort 3 and received SGI-110 as post-transplant maintenance while in remission. Other cohorts' results will be reported separately. The maintenance cohort includes high risk AML/MDS pts aged 18-75. High risk MDS is defined as having (1) poor or very poor cytogenetics by revised-IPSS or (2) monosomal karyotype or (3) bone marrow blast count > 5% before transplant;high risk AML as (1) adverse risk group by European LeukemiaNet (ELN) or (2) presence of MRD or active disease at transplant. Therapy-related AML/MDS is included. Pts. are excluded in the presence of (1) active acute graft versus host disease (GvHD), (2) uncontrolled systemic infection, or (3) concurrent use of systemic immune suppressive other than calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus. The study intervention includes SGI-110 given as 30 mg/m2/day subcutaneously for 5 consecutive days every 28 days until completion of 12 cycles, disease relapse, or experience of unacceptable toxicity. SGI-110 is initiated between 42 to 100 days following allo-SCT if there is adequate engraftment with absolute neutrophil count >/= 1.0 x 109 /L;platelet >/= 50 x 109 /L and no documented evidence of relapse. Treatment delays up to 70 days and dose reductions are allowed per protocol. The primary endpoint for this cohort is relapse-free survival (RFS) time defined as either time to disease progression or death whichever happened first. The maximum planned sample size is 40. Results: As of June 2020, 22 pts were enrolled;M/F, 12/10, median age, 62 (range 18 to74). Of 11 AML pts., ELN risk category was adverse in 8, intermediate in 2 and favorable in 1. Of 11 MDS pts, 6 had poor/very poor and 4 good and 1 intermediate risk cytogenetic abnormalities by revised-IPSS. Of 22, 6 were in complete remission with count recovery at transplant. Median time to initiation of first cycle of maintenance with SGI-110 was 59.5 days (range, 43 to 114 days). So far, 14 pts of 22 were taken off the study;6 due to disease relapse, 4 completed planned 12 cycles of treatment, 1 lost insurance, 1 withdrew the consent, 1 had travel issues due to COVID19 pandemic and 1 had pulmonary complications unrelated to study drug. Currently, 8 remain to be on the study. Median number of treatment cycles administered have been 4 (range, 1 to 12). Of 22, 7 pts. required the SGI-110 dose to be reduced down to 20 mg/m2/dayX5 days and 1 patient to 20 mg/m2/dayX3 days to be able to continue the treatment. At a median follow-up of 13.1 months for survivors (n=17), RFS and overall survival at 1-year was 66.3% (95% confidence interval (CI)=42% to 82.3%) and 88.9% (95%CI=61.8 to 92.2%) respectively (Figure) During the study, 353 AEs observed with 125 cycles of SGI-110 treatments. Of 353, 287 (81.3%) were attributable to SGI-110 and 133 of 287 (46.3%) were grade 3 or higher in severity. Most of the grade 3 or higher AEs were related with bone marrow suppression;71 (25%) thrombocytopenia, 64 (22%) neutropenia, 67 (23%) leukopenia and 8 (2%) anemia. Of 22 pts, 15 had grade 4 neutropenia at least once and 8 pts grade 4 thrombocytopenia. There was 18 episodes of infectious AEs and 11 of 18 were grade 3-4. There were no gra e 5 AEs observed attributable to study drug. Conclusion: SGI-110 led to frequent grade 3-4 BM suppression in high risk AML/MDS pts when given as maintenance therapy after allo-SCT. However, bone marrow suppression was not associated with increased risk of infection and it was temporary with count recovery. The efficacy of SGI-110 has been promising with 1-year RFS of 66.3%.

It is a highly contagious flu that can spread from human to human without revealing any symptoms. For being so contagious, detecting patients with it and isolating them has become the primary concern for healthcare professionals. This study presented an alternative way to identify COVID-19 patients by doing an automatic examination of chest X-rays of the patients. To develop such an efficient system, six pre-trained deep learning models were used. Those models were: VGG16, InceptionV3, Xception, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, and EfficientNetB4. Those models were developed on two open-source datasets that have chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Among the models, EfficientNetB4 achieved better performances on both datasets with 96% and 97% of accuracies. The empirical results were also exemplary. This type of automated system can help us fight this dangerous virus outbreak. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.","Reza, A. W.; Hasan, M.

The present investigation is based on three objectives: to assess the conditions “before” and “during” the combat and the expected consequences “after” the outbreak, by having as reference the Portuguese case;to offer a framework of the input factors to crisis management in the pandemic context;and to contribute to the crisis management literature, in the public sector from a perspective of collaborative and multi-level governance. This research is inductive and follows a quantitative approach, with the proposal and testing of a crisis management COVID-19 structural model. The Portuguese case presented in this paper suggests a robust and valid crisis management model. This model may be well translated for other countries with cultural proximity to the Portuguese culture, for instance, Portuguese speaking countries such as Brazil, or geographical proximity to Portugal such as, for instance, Spain. The authors, nevertheless, advise readers to exert some restraint on the extrapolation of the results, as governance systems and traditions can vary a good deal from country to country. Future studies should focus on the importance of coordination as one of the most important areas in crisis management, narrowing the scope of analysis from the broad, macro understanding of the research problem presented on this paper.","Ireneu de Oliveira, Mendes Sandra Patrícia Marques Pereira Subtil Inês",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208715,58

We estimate the viral dynamics using viral copy number at first detection combined with considerations arising from aerosol transmission. We take into account the recent findings that infected vaccinated adults may have live viral loads at the same level as infected unvaccinated adults. Our estimates suggest that twice weekly testing, which was adequate for the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be insufficient on its own to contain the spread of the Delta variant of concern. We exclude consideration of contact tracing since the rapidity of the onset of viral titre in the case of the Delta variant suggests that unless contact tracing and quarantine are performed very rapidly (ie. much less than a day), these mitigations will be of minimal impact in reducing transmission. These crude estimates do not take into account heterogeneity of susceptibility, social activity, and compliance, nor do they include the additional reduction in transmission that could be achieved by masking and social distancing. In the setting of a large public university, these considerations suggest that risk-targeted testing of vaccinated students, staff and faculty combined with surveillance testing of all unvaccinated individuals is the most efficient way to reduce transmission of COVID-19.","Elbanna, A.; Goldenfeld, N.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.01.21262806v1?rss=1,58
176430,Adversity or Opportunity? Exploring the Effect of COVID-19 on Ghana’s Informal Economy,2021,"The first step of cellular entry for the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) occurs through the binding of its envelope protein (Env) with the plasma membrane receptor CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 on susceptible cells, primarily CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Although there is considerable knowledge of the molecular interactions between Env and host cell receptors that lead to successful fusion, the precise way in which HIV-1 receptors redistribute to sites of virus binding at the nanoscale remains unknown. Here, we quantitatively examine changes in the nanoscale organisation of CD4 on the surface of CD4+ T cells following HIV-1 binding. Using single-molecule super-resolution imaging, we show that CD4 molecules are distributed mostly as either individual molecules or small clusters of up to 4 molecules. Following virus binding, we observe a local 3-to-10-fold increase in cluster diameter and molecule number for virus-associated CD4 clusters. Moreover, a similar but smaller magnitude reorganisation of CD4 was also observed with recombinant gp120. For the first time, our results quantify the nanoscale CD4 reorganisation triggered by HIV-1 on host cells. Our quantitative approach provides a robust methodology for characterising the nanoscale organisation of plasma membrane receptors in general with the potential to link spatial organisation to function.","Yuan, Yue; Jacobs, Caron; Garcia, Isabel Llorente; Pereira, Pedro M.; Lawrence, Scott P.; Laine, Romain F.; Marsh, Mark; Henriques, Ricardo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.05.425371,58
177642,Can AI emulate soft skills? The future of work in the balance,2021,"Perioperative nurses are key personnel in managing safety risk and preventing patient harm. With significant nursing shortages, there is a critical need to train and recruit nurses to this complex area. Limited curricular exposure, clinical opportunities, and perioperative instruction in undergraduate nursing programs have led to a decline in nurses seeking perioperative positions and an increased staff turnover. The specific aim of this exploratory quantitative study was to determine if perioperative nursing educational activities, particularly simulation, influence student interest in pursuing perioperative nursing careers. Students in two different nursing tracks, on campuses in two different states, and at various points in their nursing education participated in a perioperative simulation. Due to COVID-19 challenges, this in-person simulation was converted to a virtual simulation mid-way through the academic term, and therefore, approximately one half of students completed the simulation in-person while the other half completed the simulation in a virtual format. Post-simulation evaluation of data from students was conducted. Thirty-nine percent of students indicated that the simulation and perioperative education increased their interest in pursuing intraoperative nursing. There was no statistically significant difference in interest in pursuing perioperative nursing between the virtual or in-person simulations. In all student groups, students with an interest in perioperative nursing prior to simulation averaged only nine percent. Both in-person and virtual simulation show promise for increasing knowledge of and interest in perioperative nursing in baccalaureate nursing students. As nursing programs continue to struggle with clinical placement opportunities and limitations on in-person activities, robust in-person or virtual simulation experiences may positively influence students toward a future in perioperative nursing.","Jessen, Team Leader Jennifer Smith Team Members Christine Iwansky Kristy Moreland Nicola Palmer LeaAnn",Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2021.06.055,58
177694,A Look into COVID-19 Vaccination Debate on Twitter,2021,"Background. Hardstyle kettlebell training is characterised by the ballistic two-handed kettlebell swing with outcomes believed to be strongly influenced by swing proficiency. This study examines the effect of four months hardstyle kettlebell training on the force profile of the two-handed kettlebell swing, and peak ground reaction force during a kettlebell deadlift in older adults. These data will help inform healthcare providers and coaches about the use and prescription of kettlebell exercises with older adults. Methods. Five males and five females <70 years of age who participated in the BELL trial were recruited. Two-handed hardstyle swings were performed with 8-16 kg, and deadlifts with 8-32 kg. Ground reaction force (GRF) was obtained from a floor-mounted force platform. Force-time curves (FTCs), peak force, forward force relative to vertical force, rate of force development (RFD), and swing cadence were investigated. Results were compared with the same data variables collected from the participants in an exploratory pre-intervention study, conducted approximately seven months before the present study. Participants completed approximately 90 kettlebell training sessions during a four-month training intervention. Results. Participants used kettlebells to perform 3779 {+/-} 802 swings, 923 {+/-} 251 cleans, 825 {+/-} 309 snatches and 744 {+/-} 178 deadlifts during group-training sessions. Peak ground reaction force during kettlebell swings did not significantly change with any kettlebell weight. There was a significant 3% increase in the magnitude of forward force during 8 kg swings, and a significant 3% decrease in forward force during 16 kg swings. There were large significant improvements in swing cadence with a mean increase of three swings per minute and a small non-significant increase in RFD. Change in kettlebell swing force-time curve profiles were small. Change in peak ground reaction force during deadlifts were moderate to large. All participants increased in grip strength following training, with the magnitude of change greater than the minimum clinically important difference for seven participants. All participants had significant increases in multiple secondary outcomes. Conclusion. Group-based and online kettlebell training is likely to be ineffective for improving the force profile of the hardstyle kettlebell swing in older adults. Insufficiently active older adults engaged in high-volume kettlebell training performed 3-5 times weekly, can however expect to see clinically meaningful improvements in health-related physical fitness irrespective of swing proficiency, and have increased confidence with heavy lifting tasks. Results of this study suggest that beyond safe and competent performance, striving to optimise hardstyle swing technique may provide no additional benefit to clinical outcomes in older adults.","Meigh, N.

Prolonged mechanical ventilation causes a tracheotomy need in some of those patients. The study aimed to assess the possible benefits of tracheotomy in patients with COVID-19 and its effect on clinical outcomes. Material and Method: Six patients with COVID-19 who underwent an open tracheotomy in our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Its effect on the prognosis, the effectiveness of the safety precautions, and personnel protective equipment (PPE) utilization during the tracheotomy procedures was evaluated. Results: Mean intubation period before a tracheotomy was 21 days (range,14-28). All patients were male with a mean age of 62. Five of them died postoperatively. One patient was discharged and decannulated. None of the airway team members were infected after the procedures. Conclusion: Tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients is a safe procedure when appropriate PPE measures are taken.

CRISPR/Cas systems have the capabilities to be optimized for this purpose. There is a broad diversity among Cas12a nucleases with immense detection capability, but only a few have been purified and studied biochemically. Here we present the investigation of 22 Cas12a orthologs, with a focus on their cis- and trans-cleavage activity, and thermal stability in combination with non-canonical crRNAs. We noticed that some non-canonical crRNA:Cas12a effector complexes outperformed its corresponding wild-type crRNA:Cas12a complex in trans-cleavage assays. In particular, TsCas12a, ErCas12a, and ArCas12a showed an increase in thermal stability in binary complex compared to its wild-type structure and apo form. Moreover, Cas12a was observed to have the ability to recruit segments of truncated crRNAs providing insights into crRNA:Cas12a catalytic complex with potential for further applications. We also discovered that ErCas12a, BsCas12a, BoCas12a, and TsCas12a possess robust trans-cleavage activity with a shorter PAM sequence requirement. Finally, we applied these effector complexes to discriminately detect SARS-CoV-2 and its B.1.1.7 lineage in clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva samples, and tracheal aspirates.

We aim to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on work-related (WR) satisfaction and fatigue among OP in Latin America. Methods:We conducted an international cross-sectional online survey of OP practicing in Latin America. The survey was administered in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests. Results: In August 2020, 704 OP from 20 Latin American countries completed the survey (77% of 913 who started the survey). Table outlines baseline characteristics. Higher frequency of WR fatigue (67% vs. 58%, p=0.010) and exhaustion (81% vs. 70%, p=0.001) were reported by OP who cared for patients with COVID-19, compared to OP who cared for patients without COVID-19. Providers that observed delays in referrals to radiation (p=0.002) and surgery (p=0.04) reported WR fatigue at higher rates than their counterparts. Higher exhaustion (p=0.016) and dissatisfaction (p=0.046) were reported by OP who lacked access to supportive services, as social work. A significantly higher proportion of women reported WR fatigue (72% vs. 56%, p=0.003) and exhaustion (86% vs. 68%, p=0.001), when compared to men. Women were more likely than men to endorse higher current levels of fatigue when compared to pre-COVID-19 (61% vs. 46%, p=0.0001). To reduce stress, women were more likely than men to cut the time spent watching the news (p=0.002). Both genders declined research collaborations and speaking opportunities. Conclusions: Fatigue and dissatisfaction with work-life were prevalent among OP in Latin America. Higher rates of WR fatigue were seen in women, OP caring for patients with COVID-19, and OP with patients who experienced cancer care delays.

However, most of those compartmental models used a classical ordinary differential equations (ODEs) system based formalism that came with the tacit assumption the time spent in each compartment does not depend of the time already spent in it. To overcome this ""memoryless"" issue, a widely used workaround is to artificially increase and chain the number of compartments of an unique reality (e.g. many compartments for infected individuals). It allows for a greater heterogeneity and thus be closer to the observed situation, at the cost of rendering the whole model more difficult to apprehend and parametrize. We propose here an alternative formalism based on a partial differential equations (PDEs) system instead of ordinary differential equations, which provides naturally a memory structure for each compartment, and thus allows to keep a restrained number of compartments. We use such a model applied to the French situation, accounting for vaccinal and natural immunity. The results seem to indicate that the vaccination rate is not enough to ensure the end of the epidemic, but, above all, highlight a huge uncertainty attributable to the age-structured contact matrix.","Reyne, B.; Richard, Q.; Nous, C.; Selinger, C.; Sofonea, M.

Every year approximately three million pilgrims travel from all over the world to perform Hajj in Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The high population density of pilgrims in confined settings throughout the Hajj rituals can facilitate infectious disease transmission among the pilgrims and their contacts. Infected pilgrims may enter Mecca without being detected and potentially transmit the disease to other pilgrims. Upon returning home, infected international pilgrims may introduce the disease into their home countries, causing a further spread of the disease. Computational modeling and simulation of social mixing and disease transmission between pilgrims can enhance the prevention of potential epidemics. Computational epidemic models can help public health authorities predict the risk of disease outbreaks and implement necessary intervention measures before or during the Hajj season. In this study, we proposed a conceptual agent-based simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling to simulate disease transmission during the Hajj season from the arrival of the international pilgrims to their departure. The epidemic forecasting system provides a simulation of the phases and rituals of Hajj following their actual sequence to capture and assess the impact of each stage in the Hajj on the disease dynamics. The proposed framework can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the different public health interventions that can be implemented during the Hajj, including size restriction and screening at entry points.","Sultanah Mohammed, Alshammari Mohammed Hassan Ba-Aoum Nofe Ateq Alganmi Allinjawi Arwa AbdulAziz",Information,https://doi.org/10.3390/info12080325,58

We evaluated effects of endogenous itaconate and exogenous itaconate, dimethyl-, and 4-octyl-itaconate on host responses to influenza A virus infection. Infection induced ACOD1 (the enzyme catalyzing itaconate synthesis) mRNA in monocytes and macrophages, which correlated with viral replication and was abrogated by itaconate treatment. Pulmonary inflammation and weight loss were greater in Acod1-/- than wild-type mice, and ectopic synthesis of itaconate in human epithelial cells reduced infection-induced inflammation. The compounds induced different recruitment programs in infected human macrophages, and transcriptome profiling revealed that they reversed infection-triggered interferon responses and modulated inflammation in cell lines, PBMC, and lung tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMC revealed that infection induced ACOD1 exclusively in monocytes, whereas treatment silenced IFN-responses in monocytes, lymphocytes, and NK cells. Viral replication did not increase under treatment despite the dramatically repressed IFN responses, but 4-octyl itaconate inhibited viral transcription in PBMC.

The study adopted a two-phase research design, with an initial online questionnaire (n = 52) followed by semi-structured interviews (n = 16) to gain a rich and holistic understanding of students’ experiences. Our findings indicate that: (1) locating a suitable location to attend online classes and sharing problems with classmates were the two most frequently self-regulatory learning strategies employed by students;(2) students experienced some enjoyment attending online classes but experienced increased pressure and time commitment to complete assigned work;(3) students found online learning to lack a sense of community, making it challenging to interact with classmates. The findings suggest teachers need to incorporate various synchronous and asynchronous collaborative activities, and they need to increase their own and students’ presence online to motivate and facilitate effective teaching and learning.","Lucas, Kohnke Zou Di Zhang Ruofei",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137111,58

Design/methodology/approach Through a critical review of the literature and qualitative interviews with third sector support workers, the authors explore the impacts that Universal Credit has on women, especially those in abusive partnerships. Findings Current welfare processes reinforce patriarchal assumptions and are indicative of the structural abuse of women. This has increased during the lockdowns imposed to tackle COVID-19. Practical implications Changes are needed in the ways in which welfare benefits are disbursed. Gendered structural abuses should be explicitly considered when working with women who experience domestic violence and abuse. Originality/value This paper argues that there needs to be a wider a recognition of gender power relations and the concept of structural abuse in policy formation and implementation.","Parker, J.; Veasey, K.",Journal of Adult Protection,https://doi.org/10.1108/jap-05-2021-0018,58
179715,"The revelations of Revelation: The book that fits, even when it does not",2021,"Study shows that mask-wearing is a critical factor in stopping the COVID-19 transmission. By the time of this article, most US states have mandated face masking in public space. Therefore, real-time face mask detection becomes an essential application to prevent the spread of the pandemic. This study will present a face mask detection system that can detect and monitor mask-wearing from camera feeds and alert when there is a violation. The face mask detection algorithm uses Haar cascade classifier (HCC) to find facial features from the camera feed and then utilizes it to detect the mask-wearing status. The detection system runs on a PYNQ-Z2 all-programmable SoC platform, where it will pipeline the camera feed through the FPGA unit and carry out the face mask detection algorithm in the ARM core. Potential delays are analyzed, and efforts are made to reduce them to achieve real-time detection. The experiment result shows that the presented system achieves a real-time 45fps 720p Video output, with a face mask detection response of 0.13s. © 2021 IEEE.","Fang, T.; Huang, X.; Saniie, J.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Electro Information Technology, EIT 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/eit51626.2021.9491842,58
179717,A Role of Emerging Technologies in the Design of Novel Framework for COVID-19 Data Analysis and Decision Support System,2022,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) evolve rapidly, and employees perceive ICTs as both resources and demands. Based on the job-demands-resources model, we develop an ICT demands-resources model to analyze how employees’ perceptions of ICTs impact burnout, work-family balance and job satisfaction. Three surveys of employees were conducted: two before and one during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that employees perceive ICTs more strongly as resources than as demands. However, while ICT demands have a strong negative impact, ICT resources have no (before COVID-19) or only a weak (during COVID-19) positive impact on burnout and work-family balance. Mediation analyses indicate that work-family balance mitigates the negative effects of ICT demands on burnout. Higher burnout levels reduce job satisfaction. Qualitative survey responses allow for additional implications regarding how to improve work-related ICT use. Overall, findings imply that companies and employees need to focus more on ICT demands than on ICT resource management.","Ninaus, Katharina Diehl Sandra Terlutter Ralf",Journal of Business Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.08.007,58

We defined immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant and non-pregnant women during acute and convalescent COVID-19 up to 258 days post symptom onset, quantifying 217 immunological parameters. Additionally, matched maternal and cord blood were collected from COVID-19 convalescent pregnancies. Although serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 were similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women, cellular immune analyses revealed marked differences in key NK cell and unconventional T cell responses during COVID-19 in pregnant women. While NK cells, {gamma}{delta} T cells and MAIT cells displayed pre-activated phenotypes in healthy pregnant women when compared to non-pregnant age-matched women, activation profiles of these pre-activated NK and unconventional T cells remained unchanged at acute and convalescent COVID-19 in pregnancy. Conversely, activation dynamics of NK and unconventional T cells were prototypical in non-pregnant women in COVID-19. In contrast, activation of {beta} CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, T follicular helper cells and antibody-secreting cells was similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Elevated levels of IL-1{beta}, IFN-{gamma}, IL-8, IL-18 and IL-33 were also found in pregnant women in their healthy state, and these cytokine levels remained elevated during acute and convalescent COVID-19.

MOOC platforms offer various advantages over traditional education. Still, it is inevitable that there still remain significant challenges that hamper the development and popularity of MOOCs. Interactions and collaborated learning remain as vital weaknesses. In this paper, we are interested in improving MOOC interactions by investigating learners' experience with current popular MOOC platforms starting with a survey. We also conducted a task analysis on three popular MOOC platforms, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Canvas, to analyze whether and how they include key interaction functions. We found that learner-instructor and teamwork interaction affect users' experience most. Based on our findings, we propose a set of comprehensive guidelines, called IN-MOOC, to facilitate interpersonal interactions on MOOC platforms. In summary, IN-MOOC provides comprehensive and hierarchical guidelines to improve users' experience via enhancing interpersonal interaction on MOOC platforms. © 2021 ACM.","Wang, J.; Shen, H.; Chen, C.; Ritter, F.",5th Asian CHI Symposium 2021,https://doi.org/10.1145/3429360.3468223,58

Evidence from the South China Sea Dispute,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic impact all public spheres of city inhabitants' lives, also changed the conditions of traveling by public transport, especially in the field of personal passenger safety. The introduced limits on people in public transport vehicles and the need to maintain social distancing or cover the mouth and nose in a public transport vehicle - for various reasons - have been met with different understanding by users. The question then arose: are passengers actually complying with the rules of the pandemic when traveling by tram or bus? The paper attempts to assess the behavior of passengers, based on the opinions of people who observe these behaviors in their daily work, driving public transport vehicles. For this purpose, a survey was carried out among bus and tram drivers of the main public transport operator in Krakow. On the basis of 334 fulfilled questionnaires, it was found that - according to the drivers - passengers often quite freely approach the limits of people in vehicles, and often do not respect the social distancing, especially when alighting and boarding. However, what is optimistic, the drivers highly assessed their own safety when performing their official duties - which is extremely important in the context of ensuring the continuity of public transport during a pandemic. Only 10% of drivers considered that the current solutions to protect passengers (and drivers themselves) are sufficient, therefore they called for an increase in the scope of protective measures: an increase in the number of public transport courses (to keep existing passengers), the obligatory use of protective masks (instead of ineffective loosely obligation to cover the face and nose), or the introduction of closed driver cabins in buses (as in trams). The obtained research results are of a cognitive nature, they can be a supplement to the travel studies at this specific time. They can also provide support in taking action in the case of a return of the Covid-19 pandemic or similar incidents in the future. © 2021 Warsaw University of Technology.

Abdominal thrusts, back blows, and chest compressions are traditional interventions; however, suction-based airway clearance devices (anti-choking devices, ACDs) have recently been marketed as an alternative. Of note, there is limited published evidence regarding their efficacy and safety. Our research has two aims: 1) To investigate what situational and patient factors are frequently identified, and which are associated with relief of the FBAO, and survival, in individuals with a FBAO treated with an ACD; and 2) To describe the experience of individuals who have used ACDs in response to a FBAO and identify facilitators and barriers to the use of ACDs compared to traditional interventions. Methods and analysis: All ACD case reports collected a priori by manufacturers will be analyzed up to July 1st, 2021. Following, a prospective database will be developed using an online reporting system to capture future ACD use from July 1st, 2021 to Dec 31st, 2023. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize cases, 58 outcomes, and adverse events. Where possible, bivariable and multivariable analysis will be employed to assess for predictors of outcomes (relief of FBAO, survival, and survival with good neurological function). Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of ACD users to describe in detail their experience using the device. Themes from these interviews will be assessed using the Theoretical Domains Framework.

The virus has currently posed a global threat to the human population and demands the urgent need for sensitive and effective methods of diagnosis. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently used as a gold standard technique for detecting and quantifying the transcript of viral ribonucleic acid. Yet many factors are essential for successful COVID-19 diagnosis, including sample sources, amount of viral load, isolation of ribonucleic acid, and the selection of the molecular targets. Although broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and sputum sample contain a high viral load with a high diagnostic value, they cannot be collected from mild to asymptomatic cases, therefore nasopharyngeal swab is considered better and is collected in all cases that contain a viral load significantly, whereas the use of blood and faecal specimens needs further examination with respect to systemic infection and viral shedding. Furthermore, rapid diagnostic test, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based testing, chest computerized tomography (CT) scans, matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), reverse transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), point of care (POC) testing and genexpert recently tool may help with COVID-19 diagnosis.

Statistics of daily confirmed cases and deaths in New York State have been growing and declining amid changing policies and environmental factors. Based on the county-level COVID-19 cases and environmental factors in the state from March to December 2020, this study investigates spatiotemporal clustering patterns using spatial autocorrelation and space-time scan analysis. Environmental factors influencing the COVID-19 spread were analyzed based on the Geodetector model. Infection clusters first appeared in southern New York State and then moved to the central western parts as the epidemic developed. The statistical results of space-time scan analysis are consistent with those of spatial autocorrelation analysis. The analysis results of Geodetector showed that both temperature and population density were strong indications of the monthly incidence of COVID-19, especially in March and April 2020. There is a trend of increasing interactions between various risk factors.

These studies often present participants with news content that varies on relevant dimensions (e.g., true v. false, politically consistent v. inconsistent, etc.) and ask participants to make judgments (e.g., accuracy) or choices (e.g., whether they would share it on social media). This guide is intended to help researchers navigate the unique challenges that come with this type of research. Principle among these issues is that the nature of news content that is being spread on social media (whether it is false, misleading, or true) is a moving target that reflects current affairs in the context of interest. Steps are required if one wishes to present stimuli that allow generalization from the study to the real-world phenomenon of online misinformation. Furthermore, the selection of content to include can be highly consequential for the study's outcome, and researcher biases can easily result in biases in a stimulus set. As such, we advocate for pretesting materials and, to this end, report our own pretest of 224 recent true and false news headlines, both relating to U.S. political issues and the COVID-19 pandemic. These headlines may be of use in the short term, but, more importantly, the pretest is intended to serve as an example of best practices in a quickly evolving area of research.","Pennycook, G.; Binnendyk, J.; Newton, C.; Rand, D.

Low friction coefficient of the patterned tool would generate less heat in the tool-work interface and improve the tool life. This paper studies the effect of texturing on the cutting performance in ultra-precision machining of WC with a nano-polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool. Orthogonal cutting experiments were conducted to verify the cutting performance of the textured diamond tool in machining of WC. The linear patterns parallel and perpendicular to the cutting direction were fabricated on the rake face of the nano-PCD tool by using the focused ion beam process. The experimental result showed that the friction coefficient of the perpendicular patterned tool decreased by 10%. WC surface machined with the patterned tool and non-patterned tool was also analyzed and compared.

LNPs are also the carriers in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. While these applications have demonstrated that LNPs effectively deliver nucleic acids to hepatic and muscle cells, it is unclear if LNPs could be used for delivery of siRNA to neural cells, which are notoriously challenging delivery targets. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if LNPs could efficiently deliver siRNA to neurons. Because of their potential utility in either applications in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, we used both cortical neurons and sensory neurons. We prepared siRNA-LNPs using C12-200, a benchmark ionizable cationic lipidoid along with helper lipids. We demonstrated using dynamic light scattering that the inclusion of both siRNA and PEG-lipid provided a stabilizing effect to the LNP particle diameters and polydispersity indices by minimizing aggregation. We found that siRNA-LNPs were safely tolerated by primary dorsal root ganglion neurons. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Cy5 siRNA delivered via LNPs into rat primary cortical neurons showed uptake levels similar to Lipofectamine RNAiMAX—the gold standard commercial transfection agent. However, LNPs demonstrated a superior safety profile whereas the Lipofectamine-mediated uptake was concomitant with significant toxicity. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the uptake of LNP-delivered Cy5 siRNA in a human cortical neuron cell line. Overall, our results suggest that LNPs are a viable platform that can be optimized for delivery of therapeutic siRNAs to neural cells.

Underlying low-grade inflammation (LGI) has been theorized as one of its pathophysiological mechanisms. We aimed to investigate a possible relationship between PCS and an increase in inflammation markers, in a sex-stratified analysis. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS Mild cases of COVID-19 according to the WHO classification followed-up in a Primary Care Center, were included. We collected epidemiological data (age, sex, body mass index -BMI-, smoking, and comorbidities -Charlson index-), variables of the acute COVID-19 episode, and data at 3 months of follow-up (clinical manifestations and inflammatory markers). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels were analyzed. Low-grade inflammation (LGI) was defined as serum CRP between >0.3 and <1.0 mg/dL. Five composite indices were built combining the upper ranges of 4 markers. Bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regression and general linear models) were performed, stratified by sex. RESULTS We analyzed 121 subjects with mild COVID-19 (56.2% women; mean age 46 years). The most common symptom in the acute episode was fever (60.3%), while it was fatigue in PCS (42.8%). Prevalence of PCS was 35.8% in women and 20.8% in men (p = 0.07). In women, after controlling for age, BMI, smoking, and comorbidities, the D1, D3, and D4 indices were consistently associated with PCS, with ORs of 5.14 (95% CI, 1.6-16.4), 4.20 (95% CI, 1.3- 13.3), and 4.12 (95% CI, 1.3-13.1), respectively; in patients with post-COVID anosmia and ageusia, neutrophils were significantly elevated (3.43 {+/-} 0.3 vs 2.58 {+/-} 0.1; p = 0.014, and 3.89 {+/-}0.3 vs 2.59 {+/-} 0.1; p = 0.002, respectively), after adjusting for confounders. In men, the D2 and D5 indices were associated with PCS, with adjusted ORs of 10.1 (95% CI, 1.2- 85) and 17.5 (95% CI, 2-153), respectively; furthermore, serum CRP in the LGI range was associated with PCS [adjusted OR=12.9 (95% CI, 1.3-121)], and in post-COVID persistent fatigue, the neutrophil count was significantly elevated (4.68 {+/-} 0.6 vs 3.37 {+/-} 0.1; p = 0.041), after controlling for confounders. CONCLUSIONS Consistent associations among PCS, anosmia, ageusia, and fatigue, with slight -but significant- elevated levels of inflammatory markers, have been observed. The neutrophil count was the most frequently involved marker. Sex-stratified analyses showed relevant differences between women and men concerning PCS and serum inflammatory markers.","MAAMAR, M.; ARTIME, A.; PARIENTE RODRIGO, E.; FIERRO, P.; RUIZ, Y.; GUTIERREZ, S.; GONZALEZ SANTAMARIA, R.; BUSTAMANTE, E.; PINEDO, G.; RODRIGUEZ, B.; PENA IRUN, A.; GOMEZ GUTIERREZ, M.

182368,A Proposed Model for Prediction of COVID-19 Depend on K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier:Iraq Case Study,2021,"Background: Patiromer (PAT) is a sodium-free, non-absorbed potassium (K+) binder (KB) approved for the treatment of hyperkalemia (HK). HK is common in older pts with cardiorenal comorbidities and often leads to increased Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU). Here we aim to describe electrolyte-related HRU in Veterans with HK who initiated PAT or discontinued RAAS inhibitor (RAASi DC) therapy and were not receiving a KB (1/1/2016−8/30/2018). Methods: Using retrospective, observational data, pts utilizing the hospital or ED during the 6 months (mos) prior to the index date were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 mos post-index. The index date was the date of PAT initiation or the date of RAASi DC in pts not receiving a KB (RAASi DC/no KB). All pts had a baseline serum K+ ≥5.1mEq/L and HF, DM, or non-dialysis CKD. Pts with continuous exposure (CE) to PAT and those who did not restart RAASi were analyzed. Results: 288 and 26,543 pts were included in the PAT and RAASi DC/no KB groups, respectively. Following CE to PAT at 1, 3, and 6 mos post-index, no electrolyte related ED or hospital utilization was observed. In the RAASi DC group, 2-5% of pts reutilized the ED or hospital within 6 mos (Figure). Conclusion: Of the pts who experienced an electrolyte-related hospitalization or ED visit within the 6 mos prior to PAT dispensing, no pts reutilized these services in the following 6 mos. Given the limited number of PAT users, additional investigation is warranted. Disclosure: C.P.

182387,Restaurant Reservation System: Allocating Customers with Space Management Under the Impact of COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: The protective effect of previous infection versus vaccination is poorly studied. Among a clinical laboratory that has been conducting routine workforce screening since the beginning of the pandemic, we aimed to assess the relative risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 naive, previously infected, or vaccinated. Methods: Using an electronic laboratory information system, employees were divided into three groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2 naive and unvaccinated, (2) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) vaccinated. Person-days were measured from the date of the employee first test and truncated at the end of the observation period. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as two positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in a 30-day period. Individuals with fewer than 14 days of follow up were excluded. Incidence estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson Exact equation. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used as a measure of association between groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Results: We identified 4313, 254 and 739 employee records for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median age of employees was 29.0 years (interquartile range: 23.6, 39.9). During the observation period, 254, 0, and 4 infections were identified among groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Group 1 had an incidence of 25.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 22.8-29.3). Group 2 had an incidence of 0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0-5.0). Group 3 had an incidence of 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.04-4.2). The IRR of reinfection among those with previous infection compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive was 0 (95% CI: 0-0.19). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive was 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.16). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to prior SARS-CoV-2 was 0 (95% CI: 0-4.98). Conclusion: Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 were associated with decreased risk for infection or re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a routinely screened workforce. The was no difference in the infection incidence between vaccinated individuals and individuals with previous infection. Further research is needed to determine whether our results are consistent with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Kojima, N.; Roshani, A.; Brobeck, M.; Baca, A.; Klausner, J.

In order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the Russian Federation, there was a lockdown during the period from 30 March to 11 May 2020 when many people worked remotely. Nitrogen dioxide is reliable indicator of the intensity of anthropogenic activity. The main instruments which carry out long-term monitoring of the gas total column are spectrometers OMI and TROPOMI which are installed on Aura and Sentinel-5 satellites respectively. The highest anomalies of the gas concentration were found in Moscow, Moscow region and Saint Petersburg. Abrupt decrease of NO2 content related to COVID-19 was observed in 2020. The significant reduction of the atmospheric NO2 was caused by the decrease in economic activity on the territory of Russia. Nevertheless, the period of COVID-19 lockdown in April-May 2020 did not cause significant decline in atmospheric NO2 in Moscow or Saint Petersburg as it was observed in China. © 2021 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Social isolation has increased, particularly amongst vulnerable individuals with a fragile support network, as is the case with young people who have left care. The aim of the present research was to identify socio-educational proposals and interventions implemented during the pandemic pertaining to leisure as a form of promoting social inclusion of these young people. To this end, a qualitative study was carried out in which twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with young people who had left care system, in addition to fifteen interviews with professionals working with this group when delivering socio-educational interventions. Discourse analysis revealed that isolation due to the health crisis had greater repercussions in normalised settings in which leisure activity was reduced with this increasing risk of social inclusion amongst these young people. Proposals and experiences emerging from this setting provide evidence that socio-educational interventions targeting leisure facilitate social inclusion. In this sense, future lines of research are suggested to optimise the outcomes of socio-educational interventions within this group.","Díaz-Esterri, Jorge De-Juanas Ángel Goig-Martínez Rosa García-Castilla Francisco Javier",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13168851,58

186797,Social confinement and mesoscopic localization of epidemics on networks.,2020-03-12,"The last three decades have seen an alarming number of high-profile outbreaks of new viruses and other pathogens, many of them emerging from wildlife. Recent outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza, and others highlight emerging zoonotic diseases as one of the key threats to global health. Similar emerging diseases have been reported in wildlife populations, resulting in mass mortalities, population declines, and even extinctions. In this paper, we highlight three examples of emerging pathogens: Nipah and Hendra virus, which emerged in Malaysia and Australia in the 1990s respectively, with recent outbreaks caused by similar viruses in India in 2000 and Bangladesh in 2004; West Nile virus, which emerged in the New World in 1999; and amphibian chytridiomycosis, which has emerged globally as a threat to amphibian populations and a major cause of amphibian population declines. We discuss a new, conservation medicine approach to emerging diseases that integrates veterinary, medical, ecologic, and other sciences in interdisciplinary teams. These teams investigate the causes of emergence, analyze the underlying drivers, and attempt to define common rules governing emergence for human, wildlife, and plant EIDs. The ultimate goal is a risk analysis that allows us to predict future emergence of known and unknown pathogens.","Daszak, Peter; Tabor, Gary M; Kilpatrick, A Marm; Epstein, Jon; Plowright, Raina",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15604464/,58

When applied to leucocytes extracted from the blood samples, the standard method of DNA extraction gave good correlation with agar gel immunodiffusion, but a method in which 5 microliters of blood was the starting material was unreliable. Selection of the primers was important, and differences in results were observed when the PCR method was applied to blood samples from different geographic areas. The sensitivity varied from 50% to 90%, depending on the primer set applied to the gag gene of proviral nucleic acid. This variation was based on geographic origin of the cattle, suggesting an influence of viral strain. In some areas, more than 1 primer may needed to optimize results.","Marsolais, G; Dubuc, R; Bergeron, J; Morrey, J D; Kelly, E J; Jackson, M K","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7948198/,58

Cats from which sera were obtained were categorized by sex, age, breed, and disease status, and variations in mean antibody titers for different sub-classifications within each category were analyzed by computerized statistical analysis. As expected, higher mean antibody titers were recorded for cats with feline infectious peritonitis, and for cats with a recent history of possible coronavirus exposure. However, an unexpected inverse relationship between coronavirus antibody titer and age was also found. Certain cattery-oriented pure breeds appeared to have higher mean antibody titers, because their sample populations contained a higher percentage of younger cats and cats of unknown age-groups which, over-all, had higher mean titers. Taken together, the data substantiated the efficacy of the computer-assisted KELA for routine detection of serum coronavirus antibodies in cats.","Barlough, J E; Jacobson, R H; Sorresso, G P; Lynch, T J; Scott, F W",The Cornell veterinarian,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3015488/,58
199625,How to overcome lockdown: selective isolation versus contact tracing,2020,"Platypnoea-Orthodeoxia syndrome (POS) is the presence of postural hypoxaemia along with breathlessness in recumbent position. It is an uncommon syndrome with elusive pathophysiologic mechanisms. We observed POS in patients of moderate COVID-19 who required hospital admission to our indoor facility and oxygen supplementation when saturation was documented in sitting and supine positions for evaluation of platypnea. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted an observational, cross sectional, retrospective analysis of pulse oximetry readings of patients with stage 2 COVID-19 admitted in ward during the period from 15th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. The difference in the peripheral oxygen saturation in sitting and supine positions, documented as a routine standard of care, especially in patients with platypnea, was calculated and demographic details and co-morbidities were noted from indoor record forms. RESULTS Of the 53 patients of stage 2 COVID-19 who were included in the study, 15 (28%) had platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome at the time of presentation and 18(33.9%) patients with platypnoea had ≥ 3% desaturation in sitting position as compared to supine position. Rest of the 20 (37.7%) patients had neither platypnoea nor orthodeoxia. All the patients presenting with platypnoea-orthodeoxia required oxygen therapy during the course of treatment. Amongst the 33 patients who were hypoxic and required oxygen supplementation, 15 patients (45.4%) had oxygen saturation of ≥94% in the supine position at presentation. CONCLUSION Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome is common in patients with stage 2 COVID 19 infection who require oxygen therapy. POS can be easily documented by using pulse oximeter without the need of any specialised equipment. Hence, we propose that documentation of POS at the time of admission in primary health care or resource depleted settings would help in successful triage of the patients needing oxygen therapy. We also propose that oxygen saturation in sitting position be documented as far as possible. Further clinical studies are necessary to validate this observation.","Athavale, Tanya; Athavale, Amita; Khatri, Vijay; Makhija, Dimple; Mortale, Maya; Jaggi, Surabhi; Nadkar, Milind; Deshmukh, Hemant",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472781/,58
200037,"In Search of Hope and Healing: Guideposts for Whole-Hearted Living, Loving, and Teaching after Loss",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced access to in-person mental health services, and a shift to virtual platforms. Youth may be uniquely impacted by physical distancing requirements during the pandemic, including limited socialization opportunities, closures of educational institutions, a lack of meaningful extracurricular activities and adverse implications on key developmental milestones. Due to the potential impact of COVID-19 on youth well-being, the need to rapidly transform services to be accessible, and the potential risks associated with this rapid transformation, it is imperative that youth continue to be engaged in research and service development. Young people's perspectives, strengths and skills need to be considered to effectively adapt the delivery of mental health services. Continuing to center youth engagement in mental health research throughout the pandemic can ensure research questions, programs, and services align with the needs and preferences of youth. In this commentary, we pose three recommendations for conducting youth-engaged mental health research during the pandemic, including adapting youth engagement strategies when rapid decisions must be made, the use of tools for virtual engagement, and suggestions for evaluating youth engagement practices. These strategies and principles may be applicable to other scenarios where rapid research or system transformation would benefit from youth engagement, such as time-limited child research by trainees (e.g., dissertations) or natural disasters.","Allemang, Brooke; Cullen, Olivia; Schraeder, Kyleigh; Pintson, Karina; Dimitropoulos, Gina",Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953764/,58

The fact that influenza viruses and coronaviruses appeared seasonally, prevailing in the winter and declining in the summer, was illustrated. It was discussed that ultraviolet light in the environment can contribute to the control of the spread of the virus. A study was cited to suggest that particulate matter contributes to increased infection mortality, and that it increases in summer in some regions, countering the health effects of humidity and temperature. Data generated by online electronic tools was compared with surveillance reports generated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The epidemic began stronger in northern hemisphere countries during the northern winter. (Evidence that the epidemic intensified during the southern winter is not disputed.) The incidence declined in the northern hemisphere during the summer, except for the U.S., where cases doubled.

DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Participants were included after taking part in an online quality improvement COVID-19 course for Norwegian GPs in April 2020. The participants reported whether internal and external measures were in place: COVID-19 sign on entrance, updated home page, access to video consultations and/or electronic written consultations, home office solutions, separate working teams, preparedness for home visits, isolation rooms, knowledge on decontamination, access to sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 clinics. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred GP offices were included. The mean number of general practitioners per office was 5.63. RESULTS: More than 80% of practices had the following preparedness measures: COVID-19 sign on entrance, updated home page, COVID-19 clinic in the municipality, video and written electronic consultations, knowledge on how to use PPE, and home office solutions for general practitioners. Less than 50% had both PPE and knowledge of decontamination. Lack of PPE was reported by 37%, and 34% reported neither sufficient PPE nor a dedicated COVID-19 clinic. 15% reported that they had an isolation room, but not enough PPE. There were no geographical differences. CONCLUSIONS: Norwegian GPs in this study implemented many quality improvements to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the largest potentials for improvement seem to be securing sufficient supply of PPE and establishing an isolation room at their practices.","Alsnes, Ingvild Vatten; Munkvik, Morten; Flanders, W Dana; Øyane, Nicolas",,,58

They underwent heart transplantation for ischaemic and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, respectively. After evaluation of donor hearts, we cryopreserved and stored two pulmonary valves for clinical application and one aortic valve for research. Light microscopy of myocardium, mitral valve and aortic and pulmonary arterial wall and RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test of myocardium, mitral and tricuspid valve and aortic wall for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Presence of ACE2 in tissues was assessed with immunostaining. Light microscopy revealed a mild eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, whereas enlarged cardiomyocytes with irregular nucleus and some with cytoplasmic vacuoles in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy heart. Aortic and pulmonary wall were histologically normal. Immunostaining revealed diffuse presence of ACE2 in the myocardium of the heart with eosinophilic myocarditis, but only discrete presence in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart. The RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test showed no presence of the virus in tested tissues. Despite eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, no viral traces were found in the myocardium and valve tissues. However, ACE2 was present diffusely in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart. SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the cardiac tissues of these COVID-19 asymptomatic heart donors. In our opinion, clinical application of the valves from these donors presents negligible risk for coronavirus transmission. Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty regarding the risk of virus transmission with the human tissue transplantation, we would not release in any case the pulmonary valve recovered from the eosinophilic myocarditis heart. In contrast, we may consider the release of the pulmonary valve from the dilated cardiomyopathy heart only for a life-threatening situation when no other similar allograft were available.","Jashari, R; Van Esbroeck, M; Vanhaebost, J; Micalessi, I; Kerschen, A; Mastrobuoni, S",Cell tissue bank,,58

At the end of 2020, it confirms its higher daily rise of new COVID 19. This paper suggests to use the autoregressive conditional Poisson (ACP) models, also known as integer-valued GARCH (briefly: INGARCH) models which belong to the observation driven models (ODMs) category to model the count daily new confirmed cases of ""COVID 19"" in Egypt. We compare between the robust and the non-robust estimators for the Poisson INARCH(1) model as a simple class of the INGARCH (p, q) models by simulations.

206191,Measures for Ensuring Sustainability during the Current Spreading of Coronaviruses in the Czech Republic,2021,"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still developing worldwide. The prognosis of the disease will become worse and mortality will be even higher when it is combined with cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, COVID-19 is highly infectious and requires strict isolation measures. For acute coronary syndromes (ACS), a common cardiovascular disease, infection may aggravate the occurrence and development of ACS, making the management of more difficult. It will be an enormous challenge for clinical practice to deal with ACS in this setting of COVID-19.Aim to reduce the mortality of ACS patients during the epidemic of COVID-19 by standardizing procedures as much as possible.Pubmed and other relevant databases were searched to retrieve articles on COVID-19 and articles on ACS management strategies during previous influenza epidemics. The data was described and synthesized to summarize the diagnosis and management strategy of ACS, the preparation of catheter laboratory, and the protection of the medical staff in the context of COVID-19. Ethical approval is not required in this study, because it is a review with no recourse to patient identifiable information.Standardized diagnosis and treatment advice can help reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients with ACS. In the absence of contraindications, the third generation of thrombolytic drugs should be the first choice for thrombolytic treatment in the isolation ward. For patients who have to receive PCI, this article provides detailed protective measures to avoid nosocomial infection.","Liang, Xi-Ying; Shang, Yao-Sheng; Bai, Nan; Zhong, Peng-Yu; Zhang, Wen-Jiao; Wang, Zhi-Lu",Medicine (Baltimore),,58

206909,European Labour Market in Pandemic Reality,2020,"Containment measures implemented by some countries to suppress the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a slowdown of the epidemic characterized by time series of daily infections plateauing over extended periods of time. We prove that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) dynamics. In traditional analyses of the critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic, however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such non-trivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model. We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model. We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the outbreak is a non-monotonic function of the initial number of infected individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics with non-trivial initial conditions. Far from heard immunity, fluctuations are much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing time series may be particularly challenging.","Radicchi, Filippo; Bianconi, Ginestra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15034v1.pdf,58

Due to its magnitude and impact on global health, this health crisis exposes several shortcomings in their health systems and emphasizes their shortcomings and deficiencies. These deficiencies have quickly affected the most frail citizens, such as older people. The first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Belgium has quickly shown that nursing homes were not prepared for these kinds of crises. The nature, speed and extent gave rise to an accelerated and more extensive collaboration between various nursing homes and Ghent University Hospital. Before this crisis, the level of integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals was mostly limited. But setting up a strong collaboration model and integrated care between nursing homes and hospitals enables the nursing homes to manage this specific and complex care in their own environment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This case study shows that integrated care is possible and that both the hospital and the nursing homes benefit from such a system. Investments in people, resources, training and guidance concerning transitional care and knowledge exchange between hospitals and nursing homes, are necessary to guarantee a more efficient and robust approach to (pandemic) crises in nursing homes.","Deschacht, Martha; Malfait, Simon; Eeckloo, Kristof",Int J Older People Nurs,,58

As a typical example, mass gathering events, such as sporting events, are gradually becoming more common, thanks to the measures taken to contain COVID-19. Some pilot studies have been launched at governments' initiative to investigate the risk of infection without measures such as face masks and physical distancing at mass gathering events, but the ethics of these studies should be carefully considered. On the other hand, it is still beneficial to implement infection control measures at mass gathering events and, in parallel, to estimate the risk of infection with measures in place, especially under a lack of vaccination progress or the spread of mutant strains possibly resistant to vaccines. To help improve compliance with measures taken by spectators and organizers and to ensure their effectiveness, we have conducted quantitative evaluations of the implementation of such measures by monitoring CO2 concentrations, assessing the proportion of people wearing face masks and analysing human flow at the event. This approach allows us to share our observations with stakeholders and participants, enabling us to protect the culture of mass gathering events, minimise the risk of infection, and restore a sense of well-being in daily life.","Murakami, M; Yasutaka, T; Onishi, M; Naito, W; Shinohara, N; Okuda, T; Fujii, K; Katayama, K; Imoto, S",QJM,,58

Altogether, 981 proteins were identified, of which 124 protein abundances were decreased and 79 were increased. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the altered proteins were related to structure (n = 10), mechanical properties (n = 13), chaperone (n = 15), antibacterial (n = 12), and antioxidant (n = 3). Alterations in abundances of structural proteins, possibly resulting from the disintegration of these complexes, were observed in this study, suggesting a loss in fibrous structure. Several proteins involved in mechanical strength (n = 10), elasticity (n = 3), and chaperone were decreased in abundances, which indicated that deficits in these proteins might affect the CEVM mechanical properties.

Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging is an emerging molecular MRI technique that can detect various metabolites and proteins in vivo. However, the role of CEST imaging for TSC-associated epilepsy has not been assessed. Here, we aim to investigate the feasibility of applying CEST imaging to TSC-associated epilepsy, optimize the CEST acquisition parameters, and provide an analysis method for exploring the dominant molecular contributors to the CEST signal measured. Nine TSC epilepsy patients were scanned on a 3-T MRI system. The CEST saturation frequencies were swept from -6 to 6 ppm with 12 different combinations of saturation power (4, 3, 2 and 1 µT) and duration (1000, 700 and 400 ms). Furthermore, a two-stage simulation method based on the seven-pool Bloch-McConnell model was proposed to assess the contribution of each exchangeable pool to the CEST signal in normal-appearing white matter and cortical tubers, which avoided the complexity and uncertainty of full Bloch-McConnell fitting. The results showed that under the optimal saturation duration of 1000 ms, the greatest contrast between tubers and normal tissues occurred around 3, 2.5, 1.75 and 3.5 ppm for B1 of 4, 3, 2 and 1 µT, respectively. At the optimal frequency offsets, the CEST values of tubers were significantly higher than those in the normal brain tissues (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the two-stage analysis suggested that the amine pool played a dominant role in yielding the contrast between cortical tubers and normal tissues. These results indicate that CEST MRI may serve as a potentially useful tool for identifying tubers in TSC, and the two-stage analysis method may provide a route for investigating the molecular contributions to the CEST contrast in biological tissues.","Wen, Qingqing; Wang, Kang; Hsu, Yi-Cheng; Xu, Yan; Sun, Yi; Wu, Dan; Zhang, Yi",NMR Biomed,,58

The multiple regression analyses indicated that managerial role, seniority, female gender and direct contact with a patient were significantly related to the positive attitude on overall or certain dimensions of safety culture. Multivariate analysis also found that dimensions of teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfaction and stress recognition as patient safety culture predicted staff exhaustion. Finally, comparing with the available institutional historic data in 2018, the COVID group scored higher on the working condition dimension of patient safety culture, but lower on the stress recognition dimension. The COVID group also scored higher on exhaustion. In the post-pandemic era, there seems to be an improvement on certain aspect of the patient safety culture among hospital staff, and the improvement is more prevalent for managers. However, exhaustion is also a poignant problem for all employees.

This study analysed English-language Covid-19 tweets mentioning cures, treatments, or vaccines from 1 January 2020 to 8 April 2021, seeking trends and international differences. The results have methodological limitations but show a tendency for countries with a lower human development index score to tweet more about cures, although they were a minor topic for all countries. Vaccines were discussed about as much as treatments until July 2020, when they generated more interest because of developments in Russia. The November 2020 Pfizer-BioNTech preliminary Phase 3 trials results generated an immediate and sustained sharp increase, however, followed by a continuing roughly linear increase in interest for vaccines until at least April 2021. Against this background, national deviations from the average were triggered by country-specific news about cures, treatments or vaccines. Nevertheless, interest in vaccines in all countries increased in parallel to some extent, despite substantial international differences in national regulatory approval and availability.

220671,COVID-19 classification by CCSHNet with deep fusion using transfer learning and discriminant correlation analysis,2021,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive, behavioral and motor symptoms and has a more challenging clinical management and poorer prognosis compared to other forms of dementia. The experience of lockdown leads to negative psychological outcomes for fragile people such as elderly with dementia, particularly for DLB, causing a worsening of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Since an individual's feeling of time passage is strongly related to their cognitive and emotional state, it is conceivable to expect alterations of this construct in people with DLB during such a difficult period. We therefore assessed the subjective experience of the passage of time for present and past time intervals (Subjective Time Questionnaire, STQ) during the lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 22 patients with DLB (17 of which were re-tested in a post-lockdown period) and compared their experience with that of 14 caregivers with similar age. Patients showed a significantly slower perception of present and past time spent under lockdown restrictions. We argue that these alterations might be related to the distinctive features of DLB and their exacerbation recorded by the patients' caregivers during the period of lockdown, though our results show that the patients' experience of time passage in a post-lockdown period remained similarly slow. Overall, we show an impairment of the subjective perception of time passage in DLB tested during the COVID-19 lockdown.

They have rightfully prioritised reducing the spread of the virus through social distancing interventions. However, shuttered business and widespread restrictions on travel and mobility have led to an economic collapse with increasing uncertainty of how quickly recovery will be achieved. METHODS: The authors carried out a review of publicly available information on the economic intervention's countries have put in place to ameliorate the impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: The strategies and scale of economic interventions have been broad, ranging from 2.5% to a reported 50% of Gross Domestic Product. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions and restart economies in different ways. There is therefore evolving, real-world data that should be used dynamically by governments and policymakers. The strategies on restarting the economy must be balanced against the uncertainty of a possible second wave of COVID-19. A nuanced approach to easing restrictions needs to take into account not only immediate risk to life but longer-term risks of widening inequalities and falling life expectancy.","Danielli, Shaun; Patria, Raman; Donnelly, Patrice; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",J. public health (Oxf),,58

From January 20 to May 5, 43 cases of donation were carried out in our hospital, and the utilization rate of liver, kidney, heart, lung, and pancreas donations was more than 90%. Forty-one cases of liver transplantation and 84 cases of kidney transplantation were performed. No graft loss or recipient death occurred within one month after kidney transplantation, and one patient (2.4%) died after liver transplantation. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay compared with that during the same period in the previous three years. More importantly, COVID-19 infection did not occur among healthcare providers, donors, patients, or their accompanying families in our center.

226204,The religious vision of nature in the light of Laudato Si’: An interreligious reading between Islam and Christianity,2020,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, which was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases in more than 25 countries from 2002 to 2003. Given the significant morbidity and mortality rate, the current pandemic poses a danger to all of humanity, prompting us to understand the activity of SARS-CoV-2 at the atomic level. Experimental studies have revealed that spike proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) before entering the cell for replication. However, the binding affinities reported by different groups seem to contradict each other. Wrapp et al. (Science 2020, 367, 1260-1263) showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 peptidase domain (ACE2-PD) more strongly than does SARS-CoV, and this fact may be associated with a greater severity of the new virus. However, Walls et al. (Cell 2020, 181, 281-292) reported that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher binding affinity, but the difference between the two variants is relatively small. To understand the binding mechnism and experimental results, we investigated how the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-RBD) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-RBD) interacts with a human ACE2-PD using molecular modeling. We applied a coarse-grained model to calculate the dissociation constant and found that SARS-CoV-2 displays a 2-fold higher binding affinity. Using steered all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, like a coarse-grained simulation, SARS-CoV-2-RBD was associated with ACE2-PD more strongly than was SARS-CoV-RBD, as evidenced by a higher rupture force and larger pulling work. We show that the binding affinity of both viruses to ACE2 is driven by electrostatic interactions.","Nguyen, Hoang Linh; Lan, Pham Dang; Thai, Nguyen Quoc; Nissley, Daniel A; O039,; Brien, Edward P; Li, Mai Suan",J Phys Chem B,,58

230805,"Animal by-products collagen and derived peptide, as important components of innovative sustainable food systems-a comprehensive review",2021,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect life in the United States, the important role of nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors (such as wearing a face mask) in reducing the risk of infection has become clear. During the pandemic, researchers have observed the rapid proliferation of misinformed or inconsistent narratives about COVID-19. There is growing evidence that such misinformed narratives are associated with various forms of undesirable behavior (eg, burning down cell towers). Furthermore, individuals' adherence to recommended COVID-19 preventive guidelines has been inconsistent, and such mandates have engendered opposition and controversy. Recent research suggests the possibility that trust in science and scientists may be an important thread to weave throughout these seemingly disparate components of the modern public health landscape. Thus, this paper describes the protocol for a randomized trial of a brief, digital intervention designed to increase trust in science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine whether exposure to a curated infographic can increase trust in science, reduce the believability of misinformed narratives, and increase the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors. METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comprising 2 parallel groups. A sample of 1000 adults aged &#8805;18 years who are representative of the population of the United States by gender, race and ethnicity, and age will be randomly assigned (via a 1:1 allocation) to an intervention or a placebo-control arm. The intervention will be a digital infographic with content based on principles of trust in science, developed by a health communications expert. The intervention will then be both pretested and pilot-tested to determine its viability. Study outcomes will include trust in science, a COVID-19 narrative belief latent profile membership, and the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors, which will be controlled by 8 theoretically selected covariates. RESULTS: This study was funded in August 2020, approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board on September 15, 2020, and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 misinformation prophylaxis is crucial. This proposed experiment investigates the impact of a brief yet actionable intervention that can be easily disseminated to increase individuals' trust in science, with the intention of affecting misinformation believability and, consequently, preventive behavioral intentions.

METHODS: A structured 27-item online survey was sent via social media messaging to obstetricians and pediatricians from public, academic, and private sectors in Jordan between March 23-30, 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to represent numbers and percentages of participants' responses to survey items. RESULTS: A total of 147 physicians participated (107 obstetricians, 40 pediatricians). Participants were well informed about the symptoms, diagnosis, modes of transmission, and methods of prevention. Participants had variable perceptions about COVID-19 risk during pregnancy, including potential vertical transmission, preferred route of delivery, and safety of breastfeeding. Most participants felt that pregnant women should be prioritized for testing and medical care provision. CONCLUSION: While evidence-based strategies to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in pregnant women and newborns are evolving, healthcare providers showed excellent knowledge of the infection and were vigilant regarding its complications for mothers and newborns. To ensure safe pregnancy, physicians must keep informed of developing guidance on best and safest prenatal and perinatal health services.

237855,Comparing machine learning algorithms for predicting ICU admission and mortality in COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Repetitive minor amputations carry the concomitant risks of multiple surgical procedures, major amputations have physical and economical major drawbacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a distinct number of minor amputations predicting a major amputation in the same leg and to determine risk factors for major amputation in multiple minor amputations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review including 429 patients with 534 index minor amputations between 07/1984 and 06/2019 was conducted. Patient demographics and clinical data including number and level of re-amputations were extracted from medical records and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: 290 legs (54.3%) had one or multiple re-amputations after index minor amputation. 89 (16.7%) legs needed major amputation during follow up. Major amputation was performed at a mean of 32.5 (range 0 - 275.2) months after index minor amputation. No particular re-amputation demonstrated statistically significant elevated odds ratio (a.) to be a major amputation compared to the preceding amputation and (b.) to lead to a major amputation at any point during follow up. Stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed minor re-amputation within 90 days (HR 3.8, 95% CI 2.0-7.3, p <0.001) as the only risk factor for major amputation if at least one re-amputation had to be performed. CONCLUSIONS: There is no distinct number of prior minor amputations in one leg that would justify a major amputation on its own. If a re-amputation has to be done, the timepoint needs to be considered as re-amputations within 90 days carry a fourfold risk for major amputation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective comparative study (Level III).","Berli, Martin C; Rancic, Zoran; Schöni, Madlaina; Götschi, Tobias; Schenk, Pascal; Kabelitz, Method; Böni, Thomas; Waibel, Felix W A",Arch. orthop. trauma surg,,58

However, nothing has been shown to reliably and completely maintain alveolar dimensions. We advocate a biologically driven and anatomically based approach for reconstruction of the socket. There are various socket manipulations that we have found to predictably prepare a site for dental implant. The combination of graft construct design and socket management maximizes graft success for any practitioner. Each socket should be treated individually, and products or methods used that are coincident with the complexity of the defect in question.","Spagnoli, Daniel B; Niquette, Christopher C",Oral Maxillofac Surg Clin North Am,,58

We randomly extracted 16,154 Tweets mentioning cannabis and 4,670 Tweets mentioning opioids from the COVID-19 Tweet corpora for our analysis. The cannabis related Tweets created by 6,144 users were disseminated to 280,042,783 users and retweeted 11 times the number of original messages while opioid-related Tweets created by 3,412 users were disseminated to smaller number of users. The opioids Twitter network showed more cohesive online group activities and a cleaner online environment with less disinformation. The cannabis Twitter network showed a less desirable online environment with more disinformation (false information to mislead the public) and stakeholders lacking strong science knowledge. Application of SNA to Tweets provides insights for future online-based drug abuse research during the outbreak.","Yoon, Sunmoo; Odlum, Michelle; Broadwell, Peter; Davis, Nicole; Cho, Hwayoug; Deng, Nanyi; Patrao, Maria; Schauer, Deborah; Bales, Michael E; Alcantara, Carmela",Stud Health Technol Inform,,58

Measures that were taken by governments (such as home confinement) to control the spread of COVID-19 may have affected levels of PA and SB. This cross-sectional study among South American adults during the first months of COVID-19 aims to (i) compare sitting time (ST), screen exposure, moderate PA (MPA), vigorous PA (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) before and during lockdown to sociodemographic correlates and (ii) to assess the impact of lockdown on combinations of groups reporting meeting/not-meeting PA recommendations and engaging/not-engaging excessive ST (&#8805;7 h/day). Bivariate associations, effect sizes, and multivariable linear regressions were used. Adults from Argentina (n = 575) and Chile (n = 730) completed an online survey with questions regarding demographics, lifestyle factors, and chronic diseases. Mean reductions of 42.7 and 22.0 min./day were shown in MPA and VPA, respectively; while increases of 212.4 and 164.3 min./day were observed in screen and ST, respectively. Those who met PA recommendations and spent <7 h/day of ST experienced greatest changes, reporting greater than 3 h/day higher ST and more than 1.5 h/day lower MVPA. Findings from the present study suggest that efforts to promote PA to South American adults during and after COVID-19 restrictions are needed.","Sadarangani, Kabir P; De Roia, Gabriela F; Lobo, Pablo; Chavez, Robinson; Meyer, Jacob; Cristi-Montero, Carlos; Martinez-Gomez, David; Ferrari, Gerson; Schuch, Felipe B; Gil-Salmerón, Alejandro; Solmi, Marco; Veronese, Nicola; Alzahrani, Hosam; Grabovac, Igor; Caperchione, Cristina M; Tully, Mark A; Smith, Lee",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,58

Objective: This is a systematic review and metanalysis designed to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine with or without the addition of azithromycin on the QTc of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were reviewed. A random effect model meta-analysis was used, and I-square was used to assess the heterogeneity. The prespecified endpoints were ΔQTc, QTc prolongation &gt;500 ms and ΔQTc &gt;60 ms. Results: A total of 18 studies and 7179 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The use of hydroxychloroquine with or without the addition of azithromycin was associated with increased QTc when used as part of the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The combination therapy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin was also associated with statistically significant increases in QTc. Moreover, the use of hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or the combination of the two was associated with increased numbers of patients that developed QTc prolongation &gt;500 ms. Conclusion: This systematic review and metanalysis revealed that the use of hydroxychloroquine alone or in conjunction with azithromycin was linked to an increase in the QTc interval of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that received these agents.","Arfaras-Melainis, Angelos Tzoumas Andreas Kokkinidis Damianos G.; Salgado Guerrero, Maria Varrias Dimitrios Xu Xiaobo Cerna Luis Avendano Ricardo Kemal Cameron Palaiodimos Leonidas Faillace Robert T.",Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,,58

METHODS: We carried out public involvement and pilot testing in 315 volunteers to improve usability. Feedback was obtained through online discussions, questionnaires, observations and interviews of people who tried the test at home. This informed the design of a nationally representative survey of adults in England using two LFIAs (LFIA1 and LFIA2) which were sent to 10,600 and 3,800 participants, respectively, who provided further feedback. RESULTS: Public involvement and pilot testing showed high levels of acceptability, but limitations with the usability of kits. Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results. In the national study, 99.3% (8,693/8,754) of LFIA1 and 98.4% (2,911/2,957) of LFIA2 respondents attempted the test and 97.5% and 97.8% of respondents completed it, respectively. Most found the instructions easy to understand, but some reported difficulties using the pipette (LFIA1: 17.7%) and applying the blood drop to the cassette (LFIA2: 31.3%). Most respondents obtained a valid result (LFIA1: 91.5%; LFIA2: 94.4%). Overall there was substantial concordance between participant and clinician interpreted results (kappa: LFIA1 0.72; LFIA2 0.89). CONCLUSION: Impactful public involvement is feasible in a rapid response setting. Home self-testing with LFIAs can be used with a high degree of acceptability and usability by adults, making them a good option for use in seroprevalence surveys.","Atchison, Christina; Pristerà, Philippa; Cooper, Emily; Papageorgiou, Vasiliki; Redd, Rozlyn; Piggin, Maria; Flower, Barnaby; Fontana, Gianluca; Satkunarajah, Sutha; Ashrafian, Hutan; Lawrence-Jones, Anna; Naar, Lenny; Chigwende, Jennifer; Gibbard, Steve; Riley, Steven; Darzi, Ara; Elliott, Paul; Ashby, Deborah; Barclay, Wendy; Cooke, Graham S; Ward, Helen",Clin. infect. dis,,58

An LSTM-based time series forecasting framework and machine learning-based framework are proposed for forecasting the endemic infectious diseases in real time. With recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, cholera, and COVID 2019, a question is being raised on our alertness as well as preparedness toward controlling the spread of these pandemics. Accurate and reliable prediction occurrences of these diseases are compulsory for the health personals to enable timely response in handling these outbreaks. The diversities of the communities make it more complex along with the humongous data generated due to the convergence of SMAC technologies. The data generated due to this complex network is nonlinear and non-stationary. Processing of this data requires an effort from a multidimensional perspective. The current work proposed the utilization of machine learning and deep learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques for the assessment of time series forecasting of casualties in case of cholera outbreak that happened recently in Yemen. The feasibility of these two techniques is probed using performance evaluation metrics. The core objective of using these two techniques is in considering nonlinear and non-stationary behavior. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Pandey, M.

The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of patients with type A acute aortic syndromes (AAS) diagnosed with COVID-19 in the perioperative period. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data between March and August 2020 from 20 participating cardiac surgery centers in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Among 122 patients who underwent emergency surgical repair for type A AAS at the participating centers, 3 patients (2.5%) tested positive for COVID-19 in the preoperative screeing, and 4 cases turned to be positive in the postoperative period having been operated on an unknown COVID-19 status. Another patient was diagnosed of COVID-19 disease based on radiological features. These eight patients had increased postoperative complications, including respiratory failure, longer ventilation times, and Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) stay and increased mortality when compared with COVID-19 negative patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 disease in the perioperative period of type A AAS poses a challenge. Despite the increasing morbidity and mortality associated with the virus, the prognosis of the aortic disease is poorer and emergency surgery should not be contraindicated based on the COVID-19 diagnosis alone.","Lopez-Marco, Ana; Harky, Amer; Malvindi, Pietro G; Verdichizzo, Danilo; McPherson, Iain; Roman, Marius; Oo, Aung; Ohri, Sunil",J Card Surg,,58

This study examined the influence of estrogen on VE during lower-extremity exercise with group III/IV activation. Females completed two identical visits in follicular and ovulatory menstrual phases. Nine participants (age 25 ± 4 years) performed three minutes of baseline steady-state cycle ergometry and then group III/IV afferents were further activated with proximal thigh cuffs inflated to 20, 60, and 100 mmHg (randomized) for two minutes and five minutes of cycling between each occlusion. Metaboreflex was isolated by post-exercise circulatory occlusion. Ventilation was measured continuously and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded for each stage. During rest and exercise, VE (p < 0.001) and tidal volume (VT) (p = 0.033) were higher in the follicular than ovulatory phase. Minute ventilation, VT, and respiratory rate (RR) with ergoreflex and metaboreflex activation were similar across phases.

249239,COVID-19 chest radiography employing via Deep Convolutional Stacked Autoencoders,2020,"RATIONALE: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, repetitive stereotyped behaviors, and cognitive impairments. Curcumin has been indicated to be neuroprotective against neurological and psychological disorders. However, the role of curcumin in autistic phenotypes remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: In the current study, we evaluated the effects of neonatal curcumin treatment on behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBRT+ltpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model of autism. METHODS: C57BL/6J (C57) and BTBR mouse pups were treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or curcumin (20 mg/kg) from postnatal day 6 (P6) to P8. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) were evaluated on P8, and neurogenesis was measured on P24 by immunofluorescence. A battery of behavioral tests was carried out when the mice were 8 weeks of age. RESULTS: Neonatal curcumin treatment improved autism-related symptoms in BTBR mice, enhancing sociability, reducing repetitive behaviors, and ameliorating cognitive impairments. Furthermore, the suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBR mice was greatly rescued after neonatal curcumin treatment, leading to an increase in neurogenic processes and an increase in NPC proliferation concomitant with an expansion of the NPC pool on P8, and NPC differentiation towards the neuronal lineage was promoted in the DG of BTBR mice on P24. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neonatal curcumin treatment elicits a therapeutic response through the restoration of hippocampal neurogenesis in BTBR mice and thus may represent a promising novel pharmacological strategy for ASD treatment.","Zhong, Hongyu; Xiao, Rui; Ruan, Ruotong; Liu, Hui; Li, Xin; Cai, Yun; Zhao, Jinghui; Fan, Xiaotang",Psychopharmacology,,58

We aimed to report ceiling of care and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) decisions and their association with demographic and clinical characteristics as well as outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective, observational study conducted between 5th March and 7th May 2020 of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Ceiling of care and CPR decisions were documented using the Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment (ReSPECT) process. Unadjusted and multivariable regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with ceiling of care decisions and death during hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 485 patients were included, of whom 409 (84·3%) had a documented ceiling of care; level one for 208 (50·9%), level two for 75 (18·3%) and level three for 126 (30·8%). CPR decisions were documented for 451 (93·0%) of whom 336 (74·5%) were 'not for resuscitation'. Advanced age, frailty, White-European ethnicity, a diagnosis of any co-morbidity and receipt of cardiovascular medications were associated with ceiling of care decisions. In a multivariable model only advanced age (odds 0·89, 0·86-0·93 p < 0·001), frailty (odds 0·48, 0·38-0·60, p < 0·001) and the cumulative number of co-morbidities (odds 0·72, 0·52-1·0, p = 0·048) were independently associated. Death during hospitalisation was independently associated with age, frailty and requirement for level two or three care. CONCLUSION: Ceiling of care decisions were made for the majority of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, broadly in line with known predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19, but with a focus on co-morbidities suggesting ICU admission might not be a reliable end-point for observational studies where advanced care planning is routine.","Straw, Sam; McGinlay, Melanie; Drozd, Michael; Slater, Thomas A; Cowley, Alice; Kamalathasan, Stephe; Maxwell, Nicholas; Bird, Rory A; Koshy, Aaron O; Prica, Milos; Patel, Peysh A; Relton, Samuel D; Gierula, John; Cubbon, Richard M; Kearney, Mark T; Witte, Klaus K",BMC Palliat Care,,58
249640,Mapping the environmental aspect of kernel product system in complex supply chains of the West Africa cashew industry,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has potentially caused indirect harm to patients with other conditions via reduced access to health care services. We aimed to describe the impact of the initial wave of the pandemic on admissions, care quality, and outcomes in patients with acute stroke in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Registry-based cohort study of patients with acute stroke admitted to hospital in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020, and equivalent periods in the 3 prior years. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen hospitals provided data for a study cohort of 184 017 patients. During the lockdown period (March 23 to April 30), there was a 12% reduction (6923 versus 7902) in the number of admissions compared with the same period in the 3 previous years. Admissions fell more for ischemic than hemorrhagic stroke, for older patients, and for patients with less severe strokes. Quality of care was preserved for all measures and in some domains improved during lockdown (direct access to stroke unit care, 1-hour brain imaging, and swallow screening). Although there was no change in the proportion of patients discharged with good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, &#8804;2; 48% versus 48%), 7-day inpatient case fatality increased from 6.9% to 9.4% (P<0.001) and was 22.0% in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (adjusted rate ratio, 1.41 [1.11-1.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that the true incidence of acute stroke did not change markedly during the pandemic, hospital avoidance may have created a cohort of untreated stroke patients at risk of poorer outcomes or recurrent events. Unanticipated improvements in stroke care quality should be used as an opportunity for quality improvement and to learn about how to develop resilient health care systems.","Douiri, Abdel; Muruet, Walter; Bhalla, Ajay; James, Martin; Paley, Lizz; Stanley, Kaili; Rudd, Anthony G; Wolfe, Charles D A; Bray, Benjamin D",Stroke,,58

The health system in Germany had to adapt in the shortest possible time. Reproductive medicine was greatly affected already early during the pandemia: many university based IVF-units were closed by order of the health ministries to gather human resources for treating potential patients infected by COVID-19. Many private centers reduced the number of patients or stopped treating patients altogether due to the fact that information on the potentially harmful effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy or gametes was sparce.

250346,Blockchain Technology in Current Agricultural Systems: From Techniques to Applications,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to the birth of videoconference multidisciplinary teams, which are now commonplace. This remote way of deciding care demands a new set of rules to ensure the quality of the complex decisions that are made for the patient group needing multidisciplinary care. Videoconference multidisciplinary teams bring with them novel forms of distraction that are under-appreciated and can impair decision-making. METHOD: A practical checklist was generated as applied to videoconference multidisciplinary teams using the principles of human factors awareness and recognition. RESULTS: Some of the strategies that should be adopted to minimise errors arising from human factors are: information technology support, a suitable environment to dial in, a global checklist employed prior to the videoconference, visible participants, avoiding distractions from other sources (e.g. e-mail, mobile phone), a videoconference sign-out and rapid dissemination of the outcomes sheet. CONCLUSION: This article presents a framework that uses human factors principles applied in this setting, which will contribute to enhanced patient safety, team working and a reduction in medical errors.","Kerawala, C; Riva, F; Paleri, V",J Laryngol Otol,,58

However, the dynamic changes in the clinical symptoms and prognosis of COVID-19 patients remain unknown. According to the onset time of initial clinical symptoms, 843 COVID-19 patients admitted between Jan 22 and Feb 14, 2020 were divided into three groups: group A (Jan 21 to Jan 25, n = 324), group B (Jan 26 to Jan 31, n = 358) and group C (Feb 1 to Feb 10, n = 161). Data on the demographics, symptoms, first laboratory results, treatments and outcomes (within 12 days of hospitalization) were collected. The results showed that the median duration from symptom onset to admission shortened over time (13, 10 and 5 days, respectively, p < 0.05). Fewer patients had fever symptoms and bilateral pneumonia in group C than in the group A and B. Laboratory results showed that white blood cell, neutrophil, and platelet counts, lactic acid and D-dimer levels were lower, while lymphocyte, CD3, and CD8 counts were higher in group C. In addition, group C had more mild-moderate cases and fewer severe cases than the other two groups. More importantly, the incidence of complications (18.5%, 14.2% and 11.2%, respectively, p < 0.05) and all-cause mortality (11.7%, 8.4%, and 5.6%, respectively, p < 0.05) decreased over time.

Improved prognosis was found at a later stage.","Wang, Menglong; Zhang, Jishou; Ye, Di; Wang, Zhen; Liu, Jianfang; He, Hua; Shen, Bo; Luo, Zhen; Ye, Jing; Xu, Yao; Zhao, Mengmeng; Liu, Mingxiao; Zhang, Pingan; Gu, Jian; Pan, Wei; Liu, Menglin; Li, Dan; Wan, Jun",Clin Chim Acta,,58
251249,Sustainable smartphone-based healthcare systems: A systems engineering approach to assess the efficacy of respiratory monitoring apps,2020,"PURPOSE: Oral chemotherapy challenges providers' abilities to safely monitor patients' symptoms, adherence, and financial toxicity. COVID-19 has increased the urgency of caring for patients remotely. Collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) has demonstrated efficacy for patients on intravenous chemotherapy, but limited data support their use in oral chemotherapy. We undertook a pilot project to assess the feasibility of implementing an ePRO system for patients starting oral chemotherapy at our cancer center, which includes both an academic site and a community site. METHODS: Patients initiating oral chemotherapy were asked to participate. A five-question tool was built in REDCap. Concerning responses triggered outreach within one business day. The primary outcome was time to first symptom assessment. For comparison, we used a historical cohort of patients who had been prescribed oral chemotherapies by providers in the same disease groups at the cancer center. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 62 (40%) patients completed ePRO assessments. Fifty historical charts were reviewed. Time to first symptom assessment was 7 days (IQR, 4-14 days) in the historical group compared with 3 days (IQR, 2-4 days) in the ePRO group. Time to clinical action was 14 days (7-35 days) in the historical group compared with 8 days (4-19 days) in the ePRO group. No statistically significant differences were detected in 30-day emergency department visit or hospitalization (12% for both groups) or 90-day emergency department visit or hospitalization rates (historical 28% and ePRO 20%). CONCLUSION: An ePRO tool monitoring patient concerns about adherence, cost, and toxicities for patients with new oral chemotherapy regimens is feasible and improves time to symptom assessment. Further investigation is needed to improve patient engagement with ePROs and evaluate the long-term impacts for patients on oral chemotherapy.","Doolin, Jim W; Berry, Jonathan L; Forbath, Natalia S; Tocci, Noah X; Dechen, Tenzin; Li, Stephanie; Hartwell, Rebekah A; Espiritu, Jennifer K; Roberts, Daniel A; Zerillo, Jessica A; Shea, Meghan",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,58

252146,A Basic Issue of Labor Law in Japanese Telework Environment – Focusing on Reviewing Telework Guidelines –,2020,"Policy questions are often framed in popular discussion as situations where pulling the right levers will get the economy and society back on track after shocks and crises. This approach ignores how systems interact and how their systemic properties shape socioeconomic outcomes, leading to an over-emphasis on a limited set of characteristics, notably efficiency. We argue that this emphasis on efficiency in the operation, management and outcomes of various economic and social systems is not a conscious collective choice, but rather the response of the whole system to the incentives that individual components face. This has brought much of the world to rely upon complex, nested, and interconnected systems to deliver goods and services around the globe. While this approach has many benefits, the Covid-19 crisis shows how it has also reduced the resilience of key systems to shocks, and allowed failures to cascade from one system to others. This paper reviews the impact of COVID-19 on socioeconomic systems, discusses the notion of resilience, and provides specific recommendations on both integrating resilience analytics for recovery from the current crisis as well as on building resilient infrastructure to address future systemic challenges.","Hynes, William; Trump, Benjamin; Love, Patrick; Linkov, Igor",Environ Syst Decis,,58

This paper provides statistical analysis of the air quality data monitored by the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) during the first 10 months of 2020, comparing the different stages of the preventive measures. Ground monitoring data is compared with satellite images and mobility indicators. The study shows a drastic decrease during lockdown in the concentration of the gaseous pollutants analysed (NO2, SO2, CO, and C6H6) that aligns with the results reported in other international cities and metropolitan areas. However, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) averaged concentrations followed a markedly different trend from the gaseous pollutants, indicating a larger influence from natural events (sand and dust storms) and other anthropogenic sources. The ozone (O3) levels increased during the lockdown, showing the complexity of O3 formation. The end of lockdown led to an increase of the mobility and the air pollution; however, air pollutant concentrations remained in lower levels than during the same period of 2019. The results in this study show the large impact of human activities on the quality of air and present an opportunity for policymakers and decision-makers to design stimulus packages to overcome the economic slow-down, with strategies to accelerate the transition to resilient, low-emission economies and societies more connected to the nature that protect human health and the environment.

During an urgent crisis, rapidly identifying potential new treatments requires global and cross-discipline cooperation, together with an enhanced open-access research model to distribute new ideas and leads. Herein, we introduce an application of a deep neural network based drug screening method, validating it using a docking algorithm on approved drugs for drug repurposing efforts, and extending the screen to a large library of 750,000 compounds for de novo drug discovery effort. The results of large library screens are incorporated into an open-access web interface to allow researchers from diverse fields to target molecules of interest. Our combined approach allows for both the identification of existing drugs that may be able to be repurposed and de novo design of ACE2-regulatory compounds. Through these efforts we demonstrate the utility of a new machine learning algorithm for drug discovery, SSnet, that can function as a tool to triage large molecular libraries to identify classes of molecules with possible efficacy.","Karki, Nischal; Verma, Niraj; Trozzi, Francesco; Tao, Peng; Kraka, Elfi; Zoltowski, Brian",Int. j. mol. sci.

255017,Managing Complex Crises,2020,"Corneal transplantation (CT) is the most frequent type of solid organ transplant (SOT) performed worldwide. Unfortunately, immunological rejection is the primary cause of graft failure for CT and therefore advances in immune regulation to induce tolerance remains an unmet medical need. Recently, our work and others in pre-clinical studies found that cyclophosphamide (Cy) administered after (""post-transplant,"" PTCy) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), i.e., liquid transplants is effective for graft vs. host disease prophylaxis and enhances overall survival. Importantly, within the past 10 years, PTCy has been widely adopted for clinical HSCT and the results at many centers have been extremely encouraging. The present studies found that Cy can be effectively employed to prolong the survival of SOT, specifically mouse corneal allografts. The results demonstrated that the timing of PTCy administration is critical for these CT and distinct from the kinetics employed following allogeneic HSCT. PTCy was observed to interfere with neovascularization, a process critically associated with immune rejection of corneal tissue that ensues following the loss of ocular ""immune privilege."" PTCy has the potential to delete or directly suppress allo-reactive T cells and treatment here was shown to diminish T cell rejection responses. These PTCy doses were observed to spare significant levels of CD4+ FoxP3+ (Tregs) which were found to be functional and could readily receive stimulating signals leading to their in vivo expansion via TNFRSF25 and CD25 agonists. In total, we posit future studies can take advantage of Cy based platforms to generate combinatorial strategies for long-term tolerance induction.","Lightbourn, Casey O; Wolf, Dietlinde; Copsel, Sabrina N; Wang, Ying; Pfeiffer, Brent J; Barreras, Henry; Bader, Cameron S; Komanduri, Krishna V; Perez, Victor L; Levy, Robert B",Front Immunol,,58

DATA SOURCES: A literature search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct was made up to June 29, 2020. RESULTS: Analysis of 15 articles (318 COVID-19 patients) revealed that although many patients presented with the typical multisystem inflammatory syndrome in pediatrics, Kawasaki-like features as fever (82.4%), polymorphous maculopapular exanthema (63.7%), oral mucosal changes (58.1%), conjunctival injections (56.0%), edematous extremities (40.7%), and cervical lymphadenopathy (28.5%), atypical gastrointestinal (79.4%) and neurocognitive symptoms (31.8%) were also common. They had elevated serum lactic acid dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, troponin I levels, and lymphopenia. Nearly 77.0% developed hypotension, and 68.1% went into shock, while 41.1% had acute kidney injury.

The research model proposed in the study successfully explained the process in which individuals commit to hygienic behaviors, prioritize local restaurants, and engage in conscious consumption under the threat of COVID-19. The proposed model can be utilized in examining consumer behaviors in the hospitality industry, especially in the COVID-19 era.","Kim, Jiyoung; Yang, Kiseol; Min, Jihye; White, Brechey",International journal of consumer studies,,58

258612,Where mitigation and migration meet,2020,"The new coronavirus has caused more than 1 million deaths and continues to spread rapidly. This virus targets the lungs, causing respiratory distress which can be mild or severe. The X-ray or computed tomography (CT) images of lungs can reveal whether the patient is infected with COVID-19 or not. Many researchers are trying to improve COVID-19 detection using artificial intelligence. In this paper, relying on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we propose a Semi-supervised Classification using Limited Labelled Data (SCLLD) for automated COVID-19 detection. Our motivation is to develop learning method which can cope with scenarios that preparing labelled data is time consuming or expensive. We further improved the detection accuracy of the proposed method by applying Sobel edge detection. The GAN discriminator output is a probability value which is used for classification in this work. The proposed system is trained using 10,000 CT scans collected from Omid hospital. Also, we validate our system using the public dataset. The proposed method is compared with other state of the art supervised methods such as Gaussian processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a COVID-19 semi-supervised detection method is presented. Our method is capable of learning from a mixture of limited labelled and unlabelled data where supervised learners fail due to lack of sufficient amount of labelled data. Our semi-supervised training method significantly outperforms the supervised training of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in case labelled training data is scarce. Our method has achieved an accuracy of 99.60%, sensitivity of 99.39%, and specificity of 99.80% where CNN (trained supervised) has achieved an accuracy of 69.87%, sensitivity of 94%, and specificity of 46.40%.","Alizadehsani, Roohallah; Sharifrazi, Danial; Izadi, Navid Hoseini; Joloudari, Javad Hassannataj; Shoeibi, Afshin; Gorriz, Juan M.; Hussain, Sadiq; Arco, Juan E.; Sani, Zahra Alizadeh; Khozeimeh, Fahime; Khosravi, Abbas; Nahavandi, Saeid; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Acharya, U Rajendra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06388v1.pdf,58

Laboratory tests, including raised inflammatory markers, D-dimer, troponin and a coagulopathy, were consistent with PIMS-TS. Our patient required transfer to the paediatric intensive care unit; an echocardiography revealed left ventricular dysfunction. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (Igs), corticosteroids and aspirin, with full resolution of clinical symptoms. A follow-up echocardiogram 1 month after discharge was unremarkable.Three SARS-CoV-2 PCRs on respiratory samples, taken over the initial 4-day period, were negative, as was a SARS-CoV-2 PCR on faeces 1 month after presentation; titres of IgG were clearly elevated. The negative PCRs in the presence of elevated titres of IgG suggest that the inflammatory syndrome might have developed in a late phase of COVID-19 infection when the virus was no longer detectable in the upper airway.","Makiello, Phoebe; Svirpliene, Sima; Finlay, Lisa; McKnight, Jean",BMJ case reports,,58

METHODS: A rapid, systematic review was conducted to elucidate existing safety planning strategies used during public health emergencies. These were supplemented with strategies from an expert panel. A survey of IPV survivors and service providers gauged the helpfulness of each strategy during COVID-19. RESULTS: Together, the systematic review and expert panel yielded 26 conceptually distinct strategies, which were evaluated by 111 IPV survivors and providers. Of these, 19 (69%) were 'highly recommended', 3 (12%) were 'somewhat recommended' and 6 (23%) were not recommended for use during the COVID-19 pandemic because they might make the violence worse. CONCLUSIONS: Safety planning needs have changed owing to the effect of COVID-19 on IPV incidence, service provision and risk factors, as well as policies restricting freedom of movement. These results will be used to modify an existing IPV safety planning mobile application for use during COVID-19 and future public health emergencies.","Metheny, N; Perri, M; Velonis, A; Kamalanathan, J; Hassan, M; Buhariwala, P; Du Mont, J; Mason, R; O039,; Campo, P",Public Health,,58

Herein we describe the outcomes of off-label intravenous use of Sarilumab in severe SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. Methods: 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia received intravenous Sarilumab; pulmonary function improvement or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate in medical wards, live discharge rate in ICU treated patients and safety profile were recorded. Sarilumab 400 mg was administered intravenously on day 1, with eventual additional infusion based on clinical judgement, and patients were followed for at least 14 days, unless previously discharged or dead. Findings: Of the 53 SARS-CoV-2pos patients receiving Sarilumab, 39(73·6%) were treated in medical wards [66·7% with a single infusion; median PaO2/FiO2:146(IQR:120-212)] while 14(26·4%) in ICU [92·6% with a second infusion; median PaO2/FiO2: 112(IQR:100-141.5)].Within the medical wards, 7(17·9%) required ICU admission, 4 of whom were re-admitted to the ward within 5-8 days. At 19 days median follow-up, 89·7% of medical inpatients significantly improved (46·1% after 24 h, 61·5% after 3 days), 70·6% were discharged from the hospital and 85·7% no longer needed oxygen therapy. Within patients receiving Sarilumab in ICU, 64·2% were discharged from ICU to the ward and 35·8% were still alive at the last follow-up. Overall mortality rate was 5·7%. Interpretation: IL-6R inhibition appears to be a potential treatment strategy for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and intravenous Sarilumab seems a promising treatment approach showing, in the short term, an important clinical outcome and good safety.","Gremese, Elisa; Cingolani, Antonella; Bosello, Silvia Laura; Alivernini, Stefano; Tolusso, Barbara; Perniola, Simone; Landi, Francesco; Pompili, Maurizio; Murri, Rita; Santoliquido, Angelo; Garcovich, Matteo; Sali, Michela; De Pascale, Gennaro; Gabrielli, Maurizio; Biscetti, Federico; Montalto, Massimo; Tosoni, Alberto; Gambassi, Giovanni; Rapaccini, Gian Ludovico; Iaconelli, Amerigo; Zileri Del Verme, Lorenzo; Petricca, Luca; Fedele, Anna Laura; Lizzio, Marco Maria; Tamburrini, Enrica; Natalello, Gerlando; Gigante, Laura; Bruno, Dario; Verardi, Lucrezia; Taddei, Eleonora; Calabrese, Angelo; Lombardi, Francesco; Bernabei, Roberto; Cauda, Roberto; Franceschi, Francesco; Landolfi, Raffaele; Richeldi, Luca; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Fantoni, Massimo; Antonelli, Massimo; Gasbarrini, Antonio",EClinicalMedicine,,58

The study included 6720 parents recruited through schools, patient organizations and social media platforms (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the UK (n = 508), Sweden (n = 1436), Spain (n = 1491), Belgium (n = 508), the Netherlands (n = 324), Germany (n = 1662) and Italy (n = 794). Many parents reported negative effects of homeschooling for themselves and their child, and many found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools. In most countries, contact with teachers was limited, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing homeschooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some negative experiences were more common in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, differences between countries and between families with and without a mental health condition were generally small, indicating that many parents across countries reported negative experiences. Some parents also reported positive experiences of homeschooling. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures may be less effective than other interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during additional waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","Thorell, Lisa B; Skoglund, Charlotte; de la Peña, Almudena Giménez; Baeyens, Dieter; Fuermaier, Anselm B M; Groom, Madeleine J; Mammarella, Irene C; van der Oord, Saskia; van den Hoofdakker, Barbara J; Luman, Marjolein; de Miranda, Débora Marques; Siu, Angela F Y; Steinmayr, Ricarda; Idrees, Iman; Soares, Lorrayne Stephane; Sörlin, Matilda; Luque, Juan Luis; Moscardino, Ughetta M; Roch, Maja; Crisci, Giulia; Christiansen, Hanna",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,,58

266165,Metode Talfiq Manhaji Mui Dalam Fatwa,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that has been prescribed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection. To assist in clinician decision-making, several clinical laboratories have developed and validated measurement procedures in-house based on HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS to measure the mass concentration of hydroxychloroquine in different biological fluids. In these cases, laboratories produce their calibration materials but rarely estimate the measurement uncertainty of their assigned values. Thus, we aimed to show how this uncertainty can be calculated, using the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibrators in blood-hemolysate-based matrix as an example. METHODS: A bottom-up approach was used to estimate the uncertainty related to the values assigned to end-user calibration materials prepared in-house. First, a specification of the measurand and a measurement equation were proposed. Then, different sources of uncertainty related to the preparation of hydroxychloroquine calibration materials were identified and quantified. Afterwards, the combined uncertainty was calculated using the law for the propagation of uncertainty resulting in the final expanded uncertainty. RESULTS: In this study, the most significant source of uncertainty was that associated with the hydroxychloroquine's reference material mass obtained via balance, while the smallest contribution was from the uncertainty associated with the hydroxychloroquine reference material purity. CONCLUSIONS: A simple procedure to estimate the measurement uncertainty of values assigned to calibration materials is presented here, which would be easy to implement in clinical laboratories. Also, it could be put into practice for other pharmacological quantities measured by in-house HPLC or HPLC-MS/MS procedures commonly used in clinical laboratories.","Rigo-Bonnin, Raúl; Canalias, Francesca",Clin Biochem,,58

Patients with rheumatic disease may have higher levels of anxiety due to their disease characteristics and medications. The web-based platforms are widely used sources for gaining medical information. YouTube presents a wide range of medical information, but there are concerns on its quality. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the quality of the YouTube videos about COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases link. METHOD: This is a descriptive study. A total of 360 videos listed by the YouTube search engine (www.youtube.com) in response to six search terms were evaluated. The Global Quality Scale (GQS) was performed to evaluate video quality. Three groups were formed according to GQS scores: high quality, moderate quality, and low quality. Video parameters were compared between these groups. RESULTS: After the exclusion criteria, 46 videos were reviewed. Of the videos, 41.4% (n = 19) were of high-quality group, 21.7% (n = 10) were moderate-quality group, and 36.9% (n = 17) were of low-quality group. Significant difference was detected between the quality groups in terms of views per day (p = 0.004). No significant difference was detected in comments per day (p = 0.139) and like ratio (p = 0.232).

267888,Using Deep Learning Model for Adapting and Managing COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis,2021,"The epidemic threshold of a social system is the ratio of infection and recovery rate above which a disease spreading in it becomes an epidemic. In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. vaccines), the only way to control a given disease is to move this threshold by non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing, past the epidemic threshold corresponding to the disease, thereby tipping the system from epidemic into a non-epidemic regime. Modeling the disease as a spreading process on a social graph, social distancing can be modeled by removing some of the graphs links. It has been conjectured that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the resulting graph corresponds to the systems epidemic threshold. Here we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to study those link removals that do well at reducing the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The MCMC method generates samples from the relative canonical network ensemble with a defined expectation value of $\lambda_{max}$. We call this the""well-controlling network ensemble""(WCNE) and compare its structure to randomly thinned networks with the same link density. We observe that networks in the WCNE tend to be more homogeneous in the degree distribution and use this insight to define two ad-hoc removal strategies, which also substantially reduce the largest eigenvalue. A targeted removal of 80\% of links can be as effective as a random removal of 90\%, leaving individuals with twice as many contacts.","Ansari, Sara; Anvari, Mehrnaz; Pfeffer, Oskar; Molkenthin, Nora; Hellmann, Frank; Heitzig, Jobst; Kurths, Juergen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09997v2.pdf,58

Meanwhile, A number of recent approaches based on the application of Willems' fundamental lemma for data-driven controller design from input/output measurements are very promising for deterministic LTI systems. This paper addresses the key noise-free assumption, and extends these data-driven control schemes to adaptive building control with measured process noise and unknown measurement noise via a robust bilevel formulation, whose upper level ensures robustness and whose lower level guarantees prediction quality. Corresponding numerical improvements and an active excitation mechanism are proposed to enable a computationally efficient reliable operation.

The data of 136 nurses who had provided direct care to COVID-19 patients from 5 September to 26 September 2020 were collected online. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors influencing STS. Participants experienced moderate levels of STS. The regression model of Model 1 was statistically significant (F = 6.21, p < 0.001), and the significant factors influencing STS were the duration of care for patients with COVID-19 for more than 30 days (ß = 0.28, p < 0.001) and working in an undesignated COVID-19 hospital (ß = 0.21, p = 0.038).

This systematic review summarises the early literature on clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital, and evaluates the quality of evidence produced during the initial stages of the pandemic. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched for studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with Covid-19 of any age were included. Data on clinical characteristics were independently extracted by two review authors. Study design specific critical appraisal tools were used to evaluate included studies: the Newcastle Ottawa scale for cohort and cross sectional studies, Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for case series and the Cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. RESULTS: The search yielded 78 studies presenting data on 77,443 people. Most studies (82%) were conducted in China. No studies included patients from low- and middle-income countries. The overall quality of included studies was low to moderate, and the majority of studies did not include a control group. Fever and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms early in the pandemic. Laboratory and imaging findings were diverse with lymphocytopenia and ground glass opacities the most common findings respectively. Clinical data in children and vulnerable populations were limited. CONCLUSIONS: The early Covid-19 literature had moderate to high risk of bias and presented several methodological issues. Early clinical characterisation studies should aim to include different at-risk populations, including patients in non-hospital settings. Pandemic preparedness requires collection tools to ensure observational studies are methodologically robust and will help produce high-quality data early on in the pandemic to guide clinical practice and public health policy.

268883,A Smart Tendon Hammer System for Remote Neurological Examination,2021,"Like other African countries, high-stake testing in Nigeria has suffered significant setbacks due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Computerised Adaptive Tests (CAT) is a paradigm shift in the educational assessment that ensures accuracy in ability placements. A survey design was employed to describe the psychometric characteristics of a simulated 3-parameter logistic IRT model designs to support off-site assessments. This simulation protocol involved generating examinee and item pool data, specifying the item selection algorithm and specifying CAT administration rules for execution with SimulCAT. Findings revealed that the fixed-length test guarantees a higher testing precision with an observed systematic error less than zero, a CMAE ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 and RMSE being consistent around 0.2. Findings also revealed that the fixed-length test had a higher item exposure rate which can be handled by falling back on the item selection methods that rely less on the a-parameter. Also, item redundancy was lesser for the fixed-length test compared to the variable-length test. Conclusions are for the fixed-length test option for high-stakes assessment in Nigeria.","Ogunjimi, Mayowa O.; Ayanwale, Musa A.; Oladele, Jumoke I.; Daramola, Dorcas S.; Jimoh, Idris M.; Owolabi, Henry O.",Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,,58
269166,Multi-stakeholder perspective of courier service quality in B2C e-commerce,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Public discussion and health-care systems worldwide have been focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. Does it have an impact on cancer care today? MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PRIO (""Prevention and Integrative Oncology"") Working Group (German Cancer Society) has initiated an online survey for physicians, medical staff and patients on April 16, 2020. Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires. The survey is ongoing. We present the first data. RESULTS: A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life. A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted. Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients. Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients. Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves. CONCLUSION: There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management. After only a few weeks, human resources are limited. They will be the most important key for further health-care services for patients with cancer and other chronic diseases.","Büntzel, Jens; Klein, Michael; Keinki, Christian; Walter, Stefanie; Büntzel, Judith; Hübner, Jutta",J. cancer res. clin. oncol,,58

Beyond Precision-Driven Visualizations,2020-08-25,"Bioactive peptides produced from natural sources are considered as strategic target for drug discovery. Hyperglycemia caused protein glycation alters the structure of many tissues that impairs their functions and lead complications diseases in human body. This study investigated the bioactive peptides produced from red and brown Lens culinaris that might inhibit protein glycation to prevent diabetic complications. In this study, red and brown Lens culinaris protein hydrolysates were prepared by tryptic digestion, using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (g/g), at 37°C, 12 hr then peptide fractions <3 kDa were filtered by using ultrafiltration membranes. Protective ability against protein glycation, DPPH radical scavenging, and anti-proliferative activities (on HepG2, MCF-7, and PC3 cell lines) of peptide fractions were assayed in vitro. Results showed that glycation was inhibited by peptides from 28.1% to 68.3% in different test model. PC3 cell line was more sensitive to the peptides which showed strong anticancer activity with lower IC50 (0.96 mg/ml). Peptide fractions were sequenced by HPLC-MS-MS. Twenty eight novel peptides sequences was identified. In silico study, two peptides could be developed as a potential bioactive peptides exhibited antiglycation, antioxidant, and antiproliferative activities. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Peptides are becoming an emerging source of medications with the development of new technologies. We have selected Lens Culinaris as one of the rich sources of proteins to explore novel bioactive peptides encapsulated in its seeds. Peptides fractions demonstrated protective ability against protein glycation, strong antioxidant potential, and promising antiproliferative activity. We have identified 28 novel peptides and molecular docking study revealed that some peptides showed strong binding potential to insulin receptor and ACE. Thus, these peptides might be used to manage diabetes complication as well as COVID-19 disease due to their interaction with ACE. However, those peptides needs to be further studied as a potential new drug.","Kuerban, Abudukadeer; Al-Malki, Abdulrahman L; Kumosani, Taha A; Sheikh, Ryan A; Al-Abbasi, Fahad Ahmed M; Alshubaily, Fawzia A; Omar Abulnaja, Khalid; Salama Moselhy, Said",J Food Biochem,,58
269728,COVRAID: COVID-19 Rapid Artificial Intelligence Based Detection,2021,"This paper proposes a very simple deterministic mathematical model, which, by using a power-law, is a \emph{non-integer power model} (or \emph{fractional power model (FPM)}). Such a model, in non-integer power of time, namely $t^m$ up to constants, enables representing at each day, with a good precision, the totality of the contaminated individuals. Despite being enriched with knowledge through an internal structure based on a geometric sequence""with variable ratio"", the model (in its non-integer representation) has only three parameters, among which the non-integer power, $m$, that determines on its own, according to its value, an aggravation or an improvement of the viral spreading. Its simplicity comes from the power-law, $t^m$, which simply expresses the singular dynamics of the operator of non-integer differentiation or integration, of high parametric compactness, that governs diffusion phenomena and, as shown in this paper, the spreading phenomena by contamination. The proposed model is indeed validated with the official data of Ministry of Health on the COVID-19 spreading. Used in prediction, it well enables justifying the choice of a lockdown, without which the spreading would have highly worsened. The comparison of this model in $t^m$ with two known models having the same number of parameters, well shows that its representativity of the real data is better or more general. Finally, in a more fundamental context and particularly in terms of complexity and simplicity, a self-filtering action enables showing the compatibility between the \emph{internal complexity} that the internal structure and its stochastic behavior present, and the \emph{global simplicity} that the model in $t^m$ offers in a deterministic manner: it is true that the non-integer power of a power-law is well a marker of complexity.","Oustaloup, Alain; Levron, Franccois; Victor, St'ephane; Dugard, Luc",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13471v1.pdf,58
269877,Coronavirus Discourse of Uncertainty in the Guise of Reassurance: We Stand Together Only When We Do Not Stand Apart,2021,"Some cancers are related to atherosclerotic diseases; therefore, these two types of disease may share some antibody biomarkers in common. To investigate this, a first screening of sera was performed from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or acute ischemic stroke (AIS) for serological identification of antigens using recombinant cDNA expression cloning (SEREX). The amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA) method, which incorporates glutathione donor beads and anti-human IgG acceptor beads, was used to evaluate serum antibody levels. SEREX screening identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein 1 (LRPAP1) as a target antigen of serum IgG antibodies in the sera of patients with ESCC or AIS. Antigens, including recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fused LRPAP1 protein, were prepared to examine serum antibody levels. AlphaLISA revealed significantly higher antibody levels against the LRPAP1 protein in patients with solid cancers such as ESCC and colorectal carcinoma and some atherosclerosis-related diseases such as AIS and diabetes mellitus compared with healthy donors. Correlation analysis revealed that the elevated serum antibody levels against LRPAP1 were associated with smoking, a well-known risk factor for both cancer and atherosclerosis. Serum LRPAP1 antibody is therefore a common marker for the early diagnosis of some cancers and atherosclerotic diseases and may reflect diseases caused by habitual smoking.","Sumazaki, Makoto; Shimada, Hideaki; Ito, Masaaki; Shiratori, Fumiaki; Kobayashi, Eiichi; Yoshida, Yoichi; Adachi, Akihiko; Matsutani, Tomoo; Iwadate, Yasuo; Mine, Seiichiro; Machida, Toshio; Kamitsukasa, Ikuo; Mori, Masahiro; Sugimoto, Kazuo; Uzawa, Akiyuki; Kuwabara, Satoshi; Kobayashi, Yoshio; Ohno, Mikiko; Nishi, Eiichiro; Maezawa, Yoshiro; Takemoto, Minoru; Yokote, Koutaro; Takizawa, Hirotaka; Kashiwado, Koichi; Shin, Hideo; Kishimoto, Takashi; Matsushita, Kazuyuki; Kobayashi, Sohei; Nakamura, Rika; Shinmen, Natsuko; Kuroda, Hideyuki; Zhang, Xiao-Meng; Wang, Hao; Goto, Ken-Ichiro; Hiwasa, Takaki",Cancer sci,,58

Furthermore, Twitter is a tool allowing us to understand the focus of people regarding a topic of interest. OBJECTIVE: To provide health policy-makers with insights concerning key topics of interest in the Twitter community regarding Covid-19, and to support information search and health communication. METHOD: A total of 28.5M tweets have been retrieved, of which 6.9M tweets included hashtags. The data was analyzed using data science and natural language processing libraries. Qualitative analysis was performed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 907k different hashtags were used. Of these, only 1192 hashtags were used more than 1000 times. The qualitative analysis resulted in 13 themes. The top three themes regarding the number of hashtags used were related to Covid-19, identifying information, interventions, and geographical tagging. We explored the relationship between themes and showed how health practitioners can understand the communication in relation to specific topics expressed as hashtags (e.g., #stayhome). CONCLUSIONS: The results provide first insights for policy-makers and health practitioners to identify relevant tweets and to choose appropriate hashtags for health communication. The results also show that only with a limited number of Tweets (10 per day) health organizations could have been among the top users.","Petersen, Kai; Gerken, Jan M",Health policy,,58
271420,Towards Performance Clarity of Edge Video Analytics,2021-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Shielding of high-risk groups from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been suggested as a realistic alternative to severe movement restrictions during the COVID-19 epidemic in low-income countries. The intervention entails the establishment of 'green zones' for high-risk persons to live in, either within their homes or in communal structures, in a safe and dignified manner, for extended periods of time during the epidemic. To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan. METHODS: We purposively sampled participants from six communities, illustrative of urban, rural and forcibly-displaced settings. In-depth telephone interviews were held with 59 members of households with one or more members at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Follow-up interviews were held with 30 community members after movement restrictions were eased across the country. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a two-stage deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Most participants were aware that some people are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes but were unaware of the concept of shielding. Most participants found shielding acceptable and consistent with cultural inclinations to respect elders and protect the vulnerable. However, extra-household shielding arrangements were mostly seen as socially unacceptable. Participants reported feasibility concerns related to the reduced socialisation of shielded persons and loss of income for shielding families. The acceptability and feasibility of shielding strategies were reduced after movement restrictions were eased, as participants reported lower perception of risk in their communities and increased pressure to comply with social commitments outside the house. CONCLUSION: Shielding is generally acceptable in the study communities. Acceptability is influenced by feasibility, and by contextual changes in the epidemic and associated policy response. The promotion of shielding should capitalise on the cultural and moral sense of duty towards elders and vulnerable groups. Communities and households should be provided with practical guidance to implement feasible shielding options. Households must be socially, psychologically and financially supported to adopt and sustain shielding effectively.","Abdelmagid, Nada; Ahmed, Salma A E; Nurelhuda, Nazik; Zainalabdeen, Israa; Ahmed, Aljaile; Fadlallah, Mahmoud Ali; Dahab, Maysoon",BMC Public Health,,58

272340,Ultra-narrow multi-band polarization-insensitive plasmonic perfect absorber for sensing,2020,"Correlated activation of cortical neurons often occurs in the brain and repetitive correlated neuronal firing could cause long-term modifications of synaptic efficacy and intrinsic excitability. We found that repetitive optogenetic activation of neuronal populations in the mouse cortex caused enhancement of optogenetically evoked firing of local coactivated neurons as well as distant cortical neurons in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. This global enhancement of evoked responses required coactivation of a sufficiently large population of neurons either within one cortical area or distributed in several areas. Enhancement of neuronal firing was saturable after repeated episodes of coactivation, diminished by inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, and accompanied by elevated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, all consistent with activity-induced synaptic potentiation. Chemogenetic inhibition of neuronal activity of the thalamus decreased the enhancement effect, suggesting thalamic involvement. Thus, correlated excitation of large neuronal populations leads to global enhancement of neuronal excitability.","Zhang, Deng; Yan, Xingjian; She, Liang; Wen, Yunqing; Poo, Mu-Ming",Proc. Natl. Acad.

277903,Guest editorial,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which spread throughout the world. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most dangerous complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. To date, no specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines have been proven efficacious. Ventilatory support is still a significant challenge for physicians facing COVID-19. The mechanisms underlying hypoxemia in those patients are not fully understood, but a new physiopathology model has been proposed. Oxygen therapy should be delivered to patients with mild to moderate hypoxemia. More severe patients could benefit from other treatments (high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilation or intubation, and invasive ventilation). Given the rapid evolution of COVID-19, there has been a paucity of the high-quality data that typically inform clinical practice guidelines from professional societies, and a worldwide consensus is still lacking. This chapter aims to illustrate the potentials of ventilatory support as therapeutic options for adult and pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia.","Leone, Paolo Maria; Siciliano, Matteo; Simonetti, Jacopo; Lopez, Angelena; Zaman, Tanzira; Varone, Francesco; Richeldi, Luca",Adv Exp Med Biol,,58

279571,Individual differences in susceptibility to false memories for COVID-19 fake news,2020,"The immune system is tightly regulated by the activity of stimulatory and inhibitory immune receptors. This immune homeostasis is usually disturbed during chronic viral infection. Using publicly available transcriptomic datasets, we conducted an in-silico analyses to evaluate the expression pattern of 38 selected immunoinhibitory receptors (IRs) associated with different myeloid and lymphoid immune cells during COVID-19 infection. Our analyses revealed a pattern of overall upregulation of IRs mRNA during SARS-CoV-2 infection. A large number of IRs expressed on both lymphoid and myeloid cells were upregulated in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPs), while lymphoid associated IRs were specifically upregulated in autopsies, reflecting severe, terminal stage, COVID-19 disease. Eight genes (BTLA, LAG3, FCGR2B, PDCD1, CEACAM1, CTLA4, CD72, and SIGLEC7), shared by NPs and autopsies, were more expressed in autopsies and were directly correlated with viral levels. Single-cell data from blood and bronchioalveolar samples also reflected the observed association between IRs upregulation and disease severity. Moreover, compared to SARS-CoV-1, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections, the number and intensities of upregulated IRs were higher in SARS-CoV-2 infections. In conclusion, the immunopathology and severity of COVID-19 could be attributed to dysregulation of different immune inhibitors. Targeting one or more of these immune inhibitors could represent an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of COVID-19 early and late immune dysregulations.","Sharif-Askari, Narjes Saheb; Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh Saheb; Mdkhana, Bushra; Al Heialy, Saba; Alsafar, Habiba S; Hamoudi, Rifat; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",,,58

Here, to meet this urgent demand, we report a homogeneous immunoassay to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This serological assay, called SATiN, is based on a tri-part Nanoluciferase (tNLuc) approach, in which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and protein G, fused respectively to two different tNLuc tags, are used as antibody probes. Target engagement of the probes allows reconstitution of a functional luciferase in the presence of the third tNLuc component. The assay is performed directly in the liquid phase of patient sera and enables rapid, quantitative and low-cost detection. We show that SATiN has a similar sensitivity to ELISA, and its readouts are consistent with various neutralizing antibody assays. This proof-of-principle study suggests potential applications in diagnostics, as well as disease and vaccination management.","Yao, Zhong; Drecun, Luka; Aboualizadeh, Farzaneh; Kim, Sun Jin; Li, Zhijie; Wood, Heidi; Valcourt, Emelissa J; Manguiat, Kathy; Plenderleith, Simon; Yip, Lily; Li, Xinliu; Zhong, Zoe; Yue, Feng Yun; Closas, Tatiana; Snider, Jamie; Tomic, Jelena; Drews, Steven J; Drebot, Michael A; McGeer, Allison; Ostrowski, Mario; Mubareka, Samira; Rini, James M; Owen, Shawn; Stagljar, Igor",Nat Commun,,58

Communicating with patients or their families during such dire times is very important especially when the patient or family members have unrealistic expectations. Herein, we have highlighted practical suggestions which if applied can prevent unnecessary draining encounters with patients and families;for example, incorporating ancillary staff such as palliative and pastoral care into the care team. We have also proposed a new concept of ‘physician optimism’. Based on this concept, the physician can be classified as a pessimist or an optimist with realistic or unrealistic expectations and communicate to patients with or without requisite empathy. To ensure the best outcomes, we conclude that physicians must be realistic optimists who always communicate with empathy. Unrealistic optimism, no matter how well-intentioned, is deceiving to patients and their families will never allow a culture of trust.","Salabei, Joshua K.; Fishman, Troy J.; Schwartz, Steven J.; Peters, Okonoboh Iyer Uma G.",Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives,,58

281326,Deciphering Small Business Community Disaster Support using Machine Learning (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused unprecedented challenges within medical centers, revealing inequities embedded in the medical community and exposing fragile social support systems. While faculty and staff faced extraordinary demands in workplace duties, personal responsibilities also increased. The goal of this study was to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal and professional activities of faculty and staff in order to illuminate current challenges and explore solutions. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured group interviews involved faculty and staff at four affiliate sites within the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado, School of Medicine. Focus groups addressed the impact of COVID-19 on (1) Changes to roles and responsibilities at work and at home, (2) Resources utilized to manage these changes and, (3) Potential strategies for how the Department could assist faculty and staff. Thematic analysis was conducted using an inductive method at the semantic level to form themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of focus group transcripts revealed themes of: (1) Challenges and disparities experienced during the pandemic, (2) Disproportionate impact on women personally and professionally, (3) Institutional factors that contributed to wellness and burnout, and (4) Solutions and strategies to support faculty and staff. Within each of these themes were multiple subthemes including increased professional and personal demands, concern for personal safety, a sense of internal guilt, financial uncertainty, missed professional opportunities, and a negative impact on mentoring. Solutions were offered and included an emphasis on addressing preexisting inequities, the importance of community, and workplace flexibility. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic created burdens for already challenged faculty and staff in both their personal and professional lives. Swift action and advocacy by academic institutions is needed to support the lives and careers of our colleagues now and in the future.","Gottenborg, Emily; Yu, Amy; Naderi, Roxana; Keniston, Angela; McBeth, Lauren; Morrison, Katherine; Schwartz, David; Burden, Marisha",BMC Health Serv Res,,58

Countrywide MTCT of HIV is estimated to be > 10,000 annually. Aims of present study are to find out the prevalence of HIV and correlates of HIV transmission among children given birth by HIV infected mother through systematic review along with meta-analysis. METHODS: All avaiable articles are retrieved using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, EMBASE, Google Scholar and PUBMED following guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) are applied to critically reviewing the selected articles. STATA 13.0 is used to preparation of forest plot for Meta-analysis. For assessment of heterogeneity and publication biases I2 statistics along with Begg and Mazumdar's test and Egger's tests are used. Odds ratio (OR) along with forest plots have been showing with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: All together 10 studies including 1537 pairs of mothers and new births are assessed in present meta-analysis. Present analysis revealed the prevalence of HIV due to MTCT in India as 8.76% (95% CI; 5.76, 12.31). Analysis of subgroups exhibit a higher pooled prevalence in eastern region of India, 10.83% (95% CI: 5.9, 17.81) and lower in in Western region in India, 6.37% (95% CI: 4.65, 8.49). Status of MTCT before and after initiation of universal ART are 10.23% (95% CI 6.61, 14.55) and 7.93% (95% CI 4.18, 12.76) respectively. Associated factors with MTCT of HIV include absence of maternal prevention of MTCT intervention, OR = 10.82 (95% CI: 5.28, 22.17), lacking in administration of infant ARV (antiretroviral), OR = 8.21 (95% CI: 4.82, 14.0) and absence of medical facility during childbirth OR = 3.73 (95% CI: 1.67, 8.33). CONCLUSIONS: In India, pooled HIV prevalence of MTCT as high as 8.78% (95% CI; 5.76, 12.31) among babies born to infected mothers warrants urgent need of focused intervention for providing ART (PMTCT intervention), ensuring proper infant ARV prophylaxis, and avoiding delivery without proper medical facility to pregnant women with HIV for reduction of occurrence in HIV transmission from mothers to children.","Bhatta, Mihir; Dutta, Nalok; Nandi, Srijita; Dutta, Shanta; Saha, Malay Kumar",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,58

METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies were measured at three time points during the 30-week follow-up. COVID-19-specific symptoms were assessed with standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: 95% of the participants mounted an IgG response with only modest decline after week 12. IgG-type antibodies were still detectable in almost 90% of the subjects at 30 weeks. IgA and IgM responses were less robust and antibody titers decreased more rapidly. At 30 weeks, only 25% still had detectable IgA-type and none had IgM-type antibodies. Higher age and higher disease severity were independently associated with higher IgG antibody levels, albeit with wide variations. CONCLUSION: Serological immune responses after COVID-19 show considerable inter-individual variability, but show an association with increasing age and higher severity of disease. IgG-type anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain positive in 90% of the individuals 30 weeks after onset of symptoms.","Glück, Vivian; Grobecker, Sonja; Tydykov, Leonid; Salzberger, Bernd; Glück, Thomas; Weidlich, Tanja; Bertok, Manuela; Gottwald, Christine; Wenzel, Jürgen J; Gessner, André; Schmidt, Barbara; Peterhoff, David",Infection,,58

288346,Analysis of COVID-19 impact using data visualization,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the provision of maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly altered to limit transmission of the virus. Many hospitals limited face-to-face appointments to only the pregnant woman and restricted the number of support people present during labour, birth, and postnatal visits to one person. How these restrictions were experienced by partners and support persons of childbearing women are unknown. AIM: To explore the experiences of partners and support persons of women receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A two-phased qualitative study including an online survey and interviews. Analysis was undertaken using content analysis. FINDINGS: Partners and support persons experienced a sense of 'missing out' from the pregnancy and maternity care experience because of changes in the provision of care during the pandemic. They reported feelings of isolation, psychological distress, and reduced bonding time with babies. Conflicting information and processes within and across maternity services contributed to feelings of uncertainty and a perceived reduction in the quality of care. Partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions on maternity wards, however they also perceived these to be of benefit to women. DISCUSSION: Many partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions in maternity services during the pandemic; strategies to ensure their active involvement in maternity care are needed. CONCLUSION: This study offers insights from the unique perspective of partners and support people of women receiving maternity care during the pandemic. Policies and processes that exclude partners and support persons need to be reconsidered.","Vasilevski, Vidanka; Sweet, Linda; Bradfield, Zoe; Wilson, Alyce N; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Homer, Caroline S E; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wynter, Karen",Women and birth (Online),,58

Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human feces and its passage to sewage system is an emerging concern for public health. Pieces of evidence of the occurrence of viral RNA in feces and municipal wastewater (sewage) systems have not only warned reinforcing the treatment facilities but also suggest that these systems can be monitored to get epidemiological data for checking trend of COVID-19 infection in the community. This review summarizes the occurrence and persistence of novel coronavirus in sewage with an emphasis on the possible water environment contamination. Monitoring of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) via sewage-based epidemiology could deliver promising information regarding rate of infection providing a valid and complementary tool for tracking and diagnosing COVID-19 across communities. Tracking the sewage systems could act as an early warning tool for alerting the public health authorities for necessary actions. Given the impracticality of testing every citizen with limited diagnostic resources, it is imperative that sewage-based epidemiology can be tested as an early warning system. The need for the development of robust sampling strategies and subsequent detection methodologies and challenges for developing countries are also discussed.","Panchal, Deepak; Prakash, Om; Bobde, Prakash; Pal, Sukdeb",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,58

Infection is associated with the development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity, which can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but, to our knowledge, the nature and quality of the memory B cells that would be required to produce antibodies upon reinfection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87 individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We find that titres of IgM and IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 decrease significantly over this time period, with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. By contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remains unchanged at 6.2 months after infection. Memory B cells display clonal turnover after 6.2 months, and the antibodies that they express have greater somatic hypermutation, resistance to RBD mutations and increased potency, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Immunofluorescence and PCR analyses of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals at 4 months after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) revealed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14 individuals. We conclude that the memory B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1.3 and 6.2 months after infection in a manner that is consistent with antigen persistence.","Gaebler, Christian; Wang, Zijun; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Muecksch, Frauke; Finkin, Shlomo; Tokuyama, Minami; Cho, Alice; Jankovic, Mila; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Cipolla, Melissa; Viant, Charlotte; Barnes, Christopher O; Bram, Yaron; Breton, Gaëlle; Hägglöf, Thomas; Mendoza, Pilar; Hurley, Arlene; Turroja, Martina; Gordon, Kristie; Millard, Katrina G; Ramos, Victor; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Jha, Divya; Tankelevich, Michael; Martinez-Delgado, Gustavo; Yee, Jim; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Unson-O039,; Brien, Cecille; Shimeliovich, Irina; Robbiani, Davide F; Zhao, Zhen; Gazumyan, Anna; Schwartz, Robert E; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Mehandru, Saurabh; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature,,58

We demonstrate that, when the confining external potential is designed to produce an approximate 1/r 2 density profile, the particles crystallize into highly ordered structures featuring spiral crystalline lines. Despite the strong inhomogeneity of the observed configurations, most of them are characterized by small density of topological defects, typical of conformal crystals, and the net topological charge induced by the simply-connected geometry of the system is concentrated near the cluster center. These crystals are shown to be robust with respect to thermal fluctuations up to a certain threshold temperature, above which the net charge is progressively redistributed from the center to the rest of the system and the topological order is lost. The crystals are also resilient to the shear stress produced by a small nonuniform azimuthal force field, rotating as a rigid body (RB). For larger forces, topological defects proliferate and the RB rotation gives place to plastic flow.","Silva, Fillipe C O; Menezes, Raí M; Cabral, Leonardo R E; de Souza Silva, Clécio C",J Phys Condens Matter,,58
295508,The digital marketing capabilities gap,2020,"The aim of this paper is twofold. First, black hole algorithm (BHA) is proposed as a new training algorithm for feedforward neural networks (FNNs), since most traditional and metaheuristic algorithms for training FNNs suffer from the problem of slow coverage and getting stuck at local optima. BHA provides a reliable alternative to address these drawbacks. Second, complementary learning components and Levy flight random walk are introduced into BHA to result in a novel optimization algorithm (BHACRW) for the purpose of improving the FNNs' accuracy by finding optimal weights and biases. Four benchmark functions are first used to evaluate BHACRW's performance in numerical optimization problems. Later, the classification performance of the suggested models, using BHA and BHACRW for training FNN, is evaluated against seven various benchmark datasets: iris, wine, blood, liver disorders, seeds, Statlog (Heart), balance scale. Experimental result demonstrates that the BHACRW performs better in terms of mean square error (MSE) and accuracy of training FNN, compared to standard BHA and eight well-known metaheuristic algorithms: whale optimization algorithm (WOA), biogeography-based optimizer (BBO), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), genetic algorithm (GA), cuckoo search (CS), multiverse optimizer (MVO), symbiotic organisms search (SOS), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Moreover, we examined the classification performance of the suggested approach on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene expression as a coronavirus receptor, which has been overexpressed in human rhinovirus-infected nasal tissue. Results demonstrate that BHACRW-FNN achieves the highest accuracy on the dataset compared to other classifiers.","Pashaei, Elham; Pashaei, Elnaz",Arab J Sci Eng,,58

298219,Environmental Policy in the Bolsonaro Government: The Response of Environmentalists in the Legislative Arena,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mineworkers in South Africa experience a triple burden of disease due to their distinct work experience. Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.","Naidoo, Rajen N; Jeebhay, Mohamed F",Curr Opin Pulm Med,,58

In clinical medicine, mild thrombocytopenia, combined with lymphopenia in a patient with signs and symptoms of an infectious disease, raises the suspicion of a viral infection. This phenomenon is classically attributed to platelet consumption due to inflammation-induced coagulation, sequestration from the circulation by phagocytosis and hypersplenism, and impaired platelet production due to defective megakaryopoiesis or cytokine-induced myelosuppression. All these mechanisms, while plausible and supported by substantial evidence, regard platelets as passive bystanders during viral infection. However, platelets are increasingly recognized as active players in the (antiviral) immune response and have been shown to interact with cells of the innate and adaptive immune system as well as directly with viruses. These findings can be of interest both for understanding the pathogenesis of viral infectious diseases and predicting outcome. In this review, we will summarize and discuss the literature currently available on various mechanisms within the relationship between thrombocytopenia and virus infections.","Raadsen, Matthijs; Du Toit, Justin; Langerak, Thomas; van Bussel, Bas; van Gorp, Eric; Goeijenbier, Marco",,,58

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study during March 22-May 4, 2020 of all staff and residents at a 780-bed SNF in San Francisco, California. METHODS: Contact tracing and symptom screening guided targeted testing of staff and residents; respiratory specimens were also collected through serial point prevalence surveys (PPS) in units with confirmed cases. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2; whole genome sequencing (WGS) characterized viral isolate lineages and relatedness. Infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions included restricting from work any staff who had close contact to a confirmed case; restricting movements between units; implementing surgical face masking facility-wide; and recommended PPE (isolation gown, gloves, N95 respirator and eye protection) for clinical interactions in units with confirmed cases. RESULTS: Of 725 staff and residents tested through targeted testing and serial PPS, twenty-one (3%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive; sixteen (76%) staff and 5 (24%) residents. Fifteen (71%) were linked to a single unit. Targeted testing identified 17 (81%) cases; PPS identified 4 (19%). Most (71%) cases were identified prior to IPC intervention. WGS was performed on SARS-CoV-2 isolates from four staff and four residents; five were of Santa Clara County lineage and the three others were distinct lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Early implementation of targeted testing, serial PPS, and multimodal IPC interventions limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the SNF.","Karmarkar, Ellora; Blanco, Irin; Amornkul, Pauli; DuBois, Amie; Deng, Xianding; Moonan, Patrick K; Rubenstein, Beth L; Miller, David A; Kennedy, Idamae; Yu, Jennifer; Dauterman, Justin; Ongpin, Melissa; Hathaway, Wilmie; Hoo, Lisa; Trammell, Stephanie; Ememu, Ejovwoke; Yu, Guixia; Khwaja, Zenith; Lu, Wendy; Talai, Nawzaneen; Jain, Seema; Louie, Janice; Philip, Susan; Federman, Scot; Masinde, Godfred; Wadford, Debra A; Bobba, Naveena; Stoltey, Julie; Smith, Adrian; Epson, Erin; Chiu, Charles; Bennett, Ayanna; Vasquez, Amber M; Williams, Troy",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,58

302346,Any time and place? Digital emotional support for digital natives,2020,"The study engages Alain Badiou’s philosophical concept of ‘immanent exception’ to establish the special potential embedded in African Christianity for engendering human universal (Umuntu). It argues that African Christian experiences inform their interpretations of Jesus Christ as the answer to all human existential concerns. This approach forces them to ‘exceed’ in the locations and spaces of their imaginations of suffering by embracing ambivalent localizations (through a constant oscillation between local and un-local) in search to transcend, not escape, in thought and practice their negative realities. Thus, they transcend unitary Christian boundaries and integrates critical elements of African spiritual systems to build human universal within the paradigmatic universal humanity of Jesus. The study underlines that grasping African Christianity through immanent exception could contribute to empowering not only African Christians, but also world Christians to seek new ways of becoming human universal for global struggle against death dealing forces such as COVID-19. The study concludes by calling for the need to engage how World Christianity in its particularities is shaping life today and how local churches are participating in constructing what it means to be part of God’s mission to build a human universal in active search for global justice.","Kaunda, Chammah J.",Expos.

302836,Towards Natural Language Interfaces for Data Visualization: A Survey,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the COVID-19 disease, has resulted in a global pandemic. Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus has infected millions of people, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands and resulted in incalculable social and economic damage. Understanding the infectivity and transmission dynamics of the virus is essential for understanding how best to reduce mortality whilst ensuring minimal social restrictions to the lives of the general population. Anecdotal evidence is available, but detailed studies have not yet revealed whether infection with the virus results in immunity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to use mathematical modelling to investigate the reinfection frequency of COVID-19. METHODS: We have used the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) framework and random processing based on empirical SARS-CoV-2 infection and fatality data from different regions to calculate the number of reinfections that would be expected to occur if no immunity to the disease occurred. RESULTS: Our model predicts that cases of reinfection should have been observed by now if primary SARS-CoV-2 infection did not protect from subsequent exposure in the short term, however, no such cases have been documented. CONCLUSIONS: This work concludes that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus provides short-term immunity to reinfection and therefore provides a useful insight for serological testing strategies, lockdown easing and vaccine design.","McMahon, Andrew; Robb, Nicole C",,,58

304278,COVID-19 Future Forecasting Using Supervised Machine Learning Models,2020,"IMPORTANCE: Among COVID-19 cases, especially the (frail) elderly show a high number of severe infections, hospital admissions, complications, and death. The highest mortality is found between 80 and 89 years old. Why do these patients have a higher risk of severe COVID-19? In this narrative review we address potential mechanisms regarding viral transmission, physical reserve and the immune system, increasing the severity of this infection in elderly patients. OBSERVATIONS: First, the spread of COVID-19 may be enhanced in elderly patients. Viral shedding may be increased, and early identification may be complicated due to atypical disease presentation and limited testing capacity. Applying hygiene and quarantine measures, especially in patients with cognitive disorders including dementia, can be challenging. Additionally, elderly patients have a decreased cardiorespiratory reserve and are more likely to have co-morbidity including atherosclerosis, rendering them more susceptible to complications. The aging innate and adaptive immune system is weakened, while there is a pro-inflammatory tendency. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the immune system on cytokine production and T-cells, further seem to aggravate this pro-inflammatory tendency, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity, increasing disease severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The combination of all factors mentioned above contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 in the older patient. While larger studies of COVID-19 in elderly patients are needed, understanding the factors increasing disease severity may improve care and preventative measures to protect the elderly patient at risk for (severe) COVID-19 in the future.","Smorenberg, Annemieke; Peters, Edgar Jg; van Daele, Paul LA; Nossent, Esther J; Muller, Majon",Eur. j. intern. med,,58

POCNAT aims to realize the rapid, simple and automatic detection of nucleic acid. Thanks to the development of manufacturing technology, electronic information technology, artificial intelligence technology, and biological information technology in recent years, the development of the POCNAT device has led to significant advancement. Instead of the normal nucleic acid detection methods used in the laboratory, some novel experimental carriers have been applied, such as chips, cartridges and papers. The application of these experimental carriers has realized the automation and integration of nucleic acid detection. The entire process of nucleic acid detection is normally divided into three steps (nucleic acid extraction, target amplification and signal detection). All of the reagents required by the process can be pre-stored on these experimental carriers, without unnecessary manual operation. Furthermore, all of the processes are carried out in this experimental carrier, with the assistance of a specific control device. Although they are complicated to manufacture and precise in design, their application provides a significant step forwards in nucleic acid detection and realizes the integration of nucleic acid detection. This technology has great potential in the field of point-of-care molecular diagnostics in the future. This paper focuses on the relevant content of these experimental carriers.","Xu, Yuyue Wang Tao Chen Zhu Jin Lian Wu Zuozhong Yan Jinqu Zhao Xiaoni Cai Lei Deng Yan Guo Yuan Li Song He Nongyue",Chinese Chemical Letters,,58

307005,A broadband integrated time series (BITS) for longitudinal analyses of the digital divide,2021,"The term grazing is generally described as the repetitive and nonplanned consumption of small amounts of food, not in response to hunger/satiety sensations. The present study aims to identify and critically review studies examining the frequency of grazing in both clinical and community samples, as well as, to investigate its relationship with eating disorder psychopathology, Loss of Control eating (LOC), psychological impairment, and weight-related variables. This systematic review followed the PRISMA recommendations for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis. A total of 138 articles were initially retrieved from the database search. In the end, 18 articles were considered for this systematic review. The results were separated in Grazing and Grazing-like behavior (picking and nibbling). Results of studies of grazing-like behaviors displays that, in these studies, the results are sometimes inconsistent and controversial. On the other hand, studies of Grazing behavior showed more consistent results. These results show that the use of different definitions across the literature makes it difficult to establish comparisons across studies. In this literature review, the studies selected used five different definitions of grazing and five different instruments to assess this eating behavior which reinforces the requirement for standardized definition and evaluation. More, the studies hereby revised suggested that LOC eating was considered in association with grazing, being significantly associated with higher levels of psychopathology and psychological impairment. In accordance, a growing body of research argues that LOC eating was a stronger predictor of eating disorder psychopathology than the amounts of food consumed. Furthermore, the results found by studies show an advance to literature with an accordance about LOC, supported by evidences in studies of this review.","Teodoro, Marília Consolini; Conceição, Eva M; de Lourdes, Marta; Alves, Jéssika Rodrigues; Neufeld, Carmem Beatriz",Appetite,,58

307314,An Efficient Approach For COVID-19 Using Machine Learning Techniques (preprint),2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on the associations between the renin-angiotensin system, hypertension, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2) infection. A brief prelude on the current state of affairs with COVID-19 is given. In addition to an overview of ACE2, Ang II, and Ang (1-7), this review presents a brief statement on hypertension, including the function of enzymes involved in the control of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and other malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: There is currently no data in support of the concerns raised with the use of ACEIs/ARBs. Many researchers have voiced concerns that the use of ACEIs and ARBs may increase tissue ACE2 levels. These researchers therefore recommend that individuals on ACEIs/ARB's medications withhold such antihypertensive drugs, unless advised by their physicians to do so. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors as the port of entry to human hosts. ACE2 and ACE are different enzymes and ACE inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2. Therefore, the use of ARB's or ACEIs should not be discontinued if an individual is infected by SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression and COVID-19.","Gathiram, Premjith; Mackraj, Irene; Moodley, Jagidesa",Curr Hypertens Rep,,58
307714,Bayesian Beta-Binomial Prevalence Estimation Using an Imperfect Test,2020-09-11,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-a new coronavirus that has led to a worldwide pandemic1-has a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein that is absent in other group-2B coronaviruses2. To explore whether the furin cleavage site contributes to infection and pathogenesis in this virus, we generated a mutant SARS-CoV-2 that lacks the furin cleavage site (&#916;PRRA). Here we report that replicates of &#916;PRRA SARS-CoV-2 had faster kinetics, improved fitness in Vero E6 cells and reduced spike protein processing, as compared to parental SARS-CoV-2. However, the &#916;PRRA mutant had reduced replication in a human respiratory cell line and was attenuated in both hamster and K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Despite reduced disease, the &#916;PRRA mutant conferred protection against rechallenge with the parental SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, the neutralization values of sera from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 were lower against the &#916;PRRA mutant than against parental SARS-CoV-2, probably owing to an increased ratio of particles to plaque-forming units in infections with the former. Together, our results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site in infection with SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the importance of this site for evaluating the neutralization activities of antibodies.","Johnson, Bryan A; Xie, Xuping; Bailey, Adam L; Kalveram, Birte; Lokugamage, Kumari G; Muruato, Antonio; Zou, Jing; Zhang, Xianwen; Juelich, Terry; Smith, Jennifer K; Zhang, Lihong; Bopp, Nathen; Schindewolf, Craig; Vu, Michelle; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Winkler, Emma S; Swetnam, Daniele; Plante, Jessica A; Aguilar, Patricia; Plante, Kenneth S; Popov, Vsevolod; Lee, Benhur; Weaver, Scott C; Suthar, Mehul S; Routh, Andrew L; Ren, Ping; Ku, Zhiqiang; An, Zhiqiang; Debbink, Kari; Diamond, Michael S; Shi, Pei-Yong; Freiberg, Alexander N; Menachery, Vineet D",Nature (Lond.),,58

CS had higher age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of testing (1.28 [95% confidence interval, CI = 1.21-1.35]), of positive test (IRR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.96-1.18]) and of hospitalization and death (IRR 1.27 [95% CI = 1.09-1.48] and 1.39 [95%CI = 1.12-1.71], respectively). CS had worse prognosis when diagnosed with COVID-19, particularly those below age 70 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of death 5.03; [95% CI = 2.59-9.75]), while the OR decreased after age 70. The OR of death was higher for CS with a recent diagnosis, that is, <2 years (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.64-5.21), or metastases (OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 0.88-4.93). CS showed the same probability of being infected, despite a slightly higher probability of being tested than the general population. Nevertheless, CS were at higher risk of death once infected.","Mangone, Lucia; Gioia, Francesco; Mancuso, Pamela; Bisceglia, Isabella; Ottone, Marta; Vicentini, Massimo; Pinto, Carmine; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo",Int. j. cancer,,58

312740,Cloud computing based futuristic educational model for virtual learning,2021,"AIMS: In three days at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Copenhagen Emergency Medical Services developed a digital diagnostic device. The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.","Haase, Christoffer Bjerre; Bearman, Margaret; Brodersen, John; Hoeyer, Klaus; Risor, Torsten",Scand J Public Health,,58

Com o objetivo de criar e testar um protocolo de tratamento hormonal que satisfaça esses dois eventos, cinco experimentos foram realizados. O experimento I avaliou a eficácia de um novo protocolo hormonal para a sincronização do estro, sendo realizado durante o período transicional em éguas cujo status reprodutivo era desconhecido. O experimento II foi delineado para determinar o momento ideal para retirada do implante de P4, sendo o implante retirado no dia 7, 8 ou 9 do protocolo de tratamento hormonal. O experimento III testou se a eficiência do protocolo é dependente da fase do ciclo estral da égua e definiu o melhor momento para indução da ovulação. Nos experimentos IV e V as éguas foram submetidas ao protocolo completo de sincronização da onda folicular e indução da ovulação em diferentes fases do ciclo estral ou com status reprodutivo conhecido. A hipótese testada foi de que a sincronização do estro e indução da ovulação, com o uso de implante intravaginal de 1,44g de P4 provoca a supressão do crescimento folicular e através da indução da ovulação, com hCG e GnRH, promove a ovulação dentro de 42 ± 6 horas de no mínimo 75% dos animais. Para isso, os efeitos das prostaglandinas e progestágenos foram avaliados quanto à capacidade de sincronizar a onda de crescimento folicular. Um novo tratamento para induzir a ovulação em tempo fixo foi testado com uma combinação de GnRH e hCG em dois momentos estratégicos (D10 e D12) visando maximizar o número de éguas ovuladas. O protocolo com administração de prostaglandina no D0, D6 e D8 juntamente com a colocação de implante intravaginal de progesterona mantido durante 8 dias (D0 ao D7) demonstrou ser eficaz para suprimir a taxa de crescimento folicularem éguas cíclicas. Nas éguas submetidas a este protocolo as ovulações que ocorreram naturalmente se concentraram entre os dias 10 e 13 do tratamento. Foi testada a eficiência da indução da ovulação no D10 e D12. Na maioria dos animais tratados, o folículo pré-ovulatório foi responsivo à combinação de GnRH e hCG promovendo o sucesso da indução da ovulação. A eficiência do protocolo hormonal testado para sincronização do estro e da ovulação foi de 76,73%, sustentando a hipótese deste estudo.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A sample of 446 frontline nurses participated from March 8 to 19, 2020. A latent profile analysis was performed to identify clusters based on the six subscales of the Chinese version of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index. The differences among the classes and the variables including sociodemographic characteristics, psychological capital and coping style were explored. RESULTS: The level of mental workload indicates that the nurses had high self-evaluations of their performance while under extremely intensive task loads. The following three latent subtypes were identified: 'low workload & low self-evaluation' (8.6%); 'medium workload & medium self-evaluation' (35.3%) and 'high workload & high self-evaluation' (56.1%) (Classes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Nurses with shared accommodations, fewer years of practice, junior professional titles, lower incomes, nonmanagement working positions, lower psychological capital levels and negative coping styles had a higher likelihood of belonging to Class 1. In contrast, senior nurses with higher psychological capital and positive coping styles were more likely to belong to Classes 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the 'low workload & low self-evaluation' subtype suggest that attention should be paid to the work pressure and psychological well-being of junior nurses. Further research on regular training program of public health emergency especially for novices is needed. Personnel management during public health events should be focused on the allocation between novice and senior frontline nurses. IMPACT: This study addresses the level of mental workload of frontline nurses who aid in the most severe area of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and delineates the characteristics of the subtypes of these nurses.","Shan, Yawei; Shang, Jing; Yan, Yan; Lu, Gendi; Hu, Deying; Ye, Xuchun",J Adv Nurs,,58

The host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to play a critical role in disease pathogenesis and clinical manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 not only activates antiviral immune responses, but can also cause uncontrolled inflammatory responses characterized by marked pro-inflammatory cytokine release in patients with severe COVID-19, leading to lymphopenia, lymphocyte dysfunction, and granulocyte and monocyte abnormalities. These SARS-CoV-2-induced immune abnormalities may lead to infections by microorganisms, septic shock, and severe multiple organ dysfunction. Therefore, mechanisms underlying immune abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 must be elucidated to guide clinical management of the disease. Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment. In this review, we discuss the immunopathology of COVID-19, its potential mechanisms, and clinical implications to aid the development of new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.","Yang, Li; Liu, Shasha; Liu, Jinyan; Zhang, Zhixin; Wan, Xiaochun; Huang, Bo; Chen, Youhai; Zhang, Yi",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,58

320901,Using self-organising maps to predict and contain natural disasters and pandemics,2021,"In humans, sleep regulation is tightly linked to social times that assign local time to events, such as school, work, or meals. The impact of these social times, collectively-social time pressure, on sleep has been studied epidemiologically via quantification of the discrepancy between sleep times on workdays and those on work-free days. This discrepancy is known as the social jetlag (SJL). COVID-19-mandated social restrictions (SR) constituted a global intervention by affecting social times worldwide. We launched a Global Chrono Corona Survey (GCCS) that queried sleep-wake times before and during SR (preSR and inSR). 11,431 adults from 40 countries responded between April 4 and May 6, 2020. The final sample consisted of 7517 respondents (68.2% females), who had been 32.7 ± 9.1 (mean ± sd) days under SR. SR led to robust changes: mid-sleep time on workdays and free days was delayed by 50 and 22 min, respectively; sleep duration increased on workdays by 26 min but shortened by 9 min on free days; SJL decreased by ~ 30 min. On workdays inSR, sleep-wake times in most people approached those of their preSR free days. Changes in sleep duration and SJL correlated with inSR-use of alarm clocks and were larger in young adults. The data indicate a massive sleep deficit under pre-pandemic social time pressure, provide insights to the actual sleep need of different age-groups and suggest that tolerable SJL is about 20 min. Relaxed social time pressure promotes more sleep, smaller SJL and reduced use of alarm clocks.","Korman, Maria; Tkachev, Vadim; Reis, Cátia; Komada, Yoko; Kitamura, Shingo; Gubin, Denis; Kumar, Vinod; Roenneberg, Till",Sci Rep,,58

324467,A study of COVID-19 - issues and problems,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused recurring and major outbreaks in multiple human populations around the world. The plethora of clinical presentations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been described extensively, of which olfactory dysfunction (OD) was established as an important and common extrapulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The aim of this protocol is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on peer-reviewed articles which described clinical data of OD in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This research protocol has been prospectively registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42020196202). CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed, as well as Chinese medical databases China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and WANFANG, will be searched using keywords including 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus disease', '2019-nCoV', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'novel coronavirus', 'anosmia', 'hyposmia', 'loss of smell', and 'olfactory dysfunction'. Systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Articles will be screened according to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria to extract studies that include new clinical data investigating the effect of COVID-19 on olfactory dysfunction. Included articles will be reviewed in full; data including patient demographics, clinical characteristics of COVID-19-related OD, methods of olfactory assessment and relevant clinical outcomes will be extracted. Statistical analyses will be performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will aim to collate and synthesise all available clinical evidence regarding COVID-19-related OD as an important neurosensory dysfunction of COVID-19 infection.

325487,"Assessment of the macro-economic impacts of low-carbon road transportation policies in Chongqing, China",2020,"PURPOSE: To report real-world diagnostic performance of chest x-ray (CXR) readings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study we enrolled all patients presenting to the emergency department of a Milan-based university hospital from February 24th to April 8th 2020 who underwent nasopharyngeal swab for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and anteroposterior bedside CXR within 12â¯h. A composite reference standard combining RT-PCR results with phone-call-based anamnesis was obtained. Radiologists were grouped by CXR reading experience (Group-1, >10 years; Group-2, <10 years), diagnostic performance indexes were calculated for each radiologist and for the two groups. RESULTS: Group-1 read 435 CXRs (77.0 % disease prevalence): sensitivity was 89.0 %, specificity 66.0 %, accuracy 83.7 %. Group-2 read 100 CXRs (73.0 % prevalence): sensitivity was 89.0 %, specificity 40.7 %, accuracy 76.0 %. During the first half of the outbreak (195 CXRs, 66.7 % disease prevalence), overall sensitivity was 80.8 %, specificity 67.7 %, accuracy 76.4 %, Group-1 sensitivity being similar to Group-2 (80.6 % versus 81.5 %, respectively) but higher specificity (74.0 % versus 46.7 %) and accuracy (78.4 % versus 69.0 %). During the second half (340 CXRs, 81.8 % prevalence), overall sensitivity increased to 92.8 %, specificity dropped to 53.2 %, accuracy increased to 85.6 %, this pattern mirrored in both groups, with decreased specificity (Group-1, 58.0 %; Group-2, 33.3 %) but increased sensitivity (92.7 % and 93.5 %) and accuracy (86.5 % and 81.0 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world CXR diagnostic performance during the COVID-19 pandemic showed overall high sensitivity with higher specificity for more experienced radiologists. The increase in accuracy over time strengthens CXR role as a first line examination in suspected COVID-19 patients.","Cozzi, Andrea; Schiaffino, Simone; Arpaia, Francesco; Della Pepa, Gianmarco; Tritella, Stefania; Bertolotti, Pietro; Menicagli, Laura; Monaco, Cristian Giuseppe; Carbonaro, Luca Alessandro; Spairani, Riccardo; Babaei Paskeh, Bijan; Sardanelli, Francesco",Eur J Radiol,,58

327851,The International Day of Light in Spain: A three years perspective,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial public health burden and widespread anxiety. The adverse mental health effects caused by COVID-19 may be particularly acute for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the present study, we developed an online survey to investigate how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions to assess multiple facets of how the pandemic has affected individuals with OCD symptoms. Responses were collected from adults with self-identified OCD recruited from OCD-specific forums and websites (n = 252). The majority (76.2 %) of respondents reported that their OCD symptoms had worsened since the outbreak, though there was substantial variability in individual responses. Negative effects of COVID-19 were more strongly linked to contamination and responsibility for harm symptoms than for other symptom dimensions. The self-identified OCD group also reported heightened concerns about COVID-19 compared to a community control sample recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Lastly, many participants reported that the pandemic had interfered with their OCD treatment, yet they remained mostly satisfied with how their treatment providers had handled the crisis. These results highlight the importance of considering how COVID-19 has affected the OCD community, with possible implications for treatment providers.","Wheaton, Michael G; Ward, Haley E; Silber, Alana; McIngvale, Elizabeth; Björgvinsson, Thröstur",J Anxiety Disord,,58
330699,A Survey on Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Fighting Against COVID-19,2020-07-04,"OBJECTIVES: Rapid and accurate diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical during the epidemic. We aim to identify differences in CT imaging and clinical manifestations between pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19, and to develop and validate a diagnostic model for COVID-19 based on radiological semantic and clinical features alone. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 70 COVID-19 and 66 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively recruited from five institutions. Patients were divided into primary (n = 98) and validation (n = 38) cohorts. The chi-square test, Student's t test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test were performed, comparing 1745 lesions and 67 features in the two groups. Three models were constructed using radiological semantic and clinical features through multivariate logistic regression. Diagnostic efficacies of developed models were quantified by receiver operating characteristic curve. Clinical usage was evaluated by decision curve analysis and nomogram. RESULTS: Eighteen radiological semantic features and seventeen clinical features were identified to be significantly different. Besides ground-glass opacities (p = 0.032) and consolidation (p = 0.001) in the lung periphery, the lesion size (1-3 cm) is also significant for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.027). Lung score presents no significant difference (p = 0.417). Three diagnostic models achieved an area under the curve value as high as 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000). The clinical and radiological semantic models provided a better diagnostic performance and more considerable net benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished. A model composed of radiological semantic and clinical features has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ Based on CT imaging and clinical manifestations alone, the pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 can be distinguished. â¢ A diagnostic model for COVID-19 was developed and validated using radiological semantic and clinical features, which had an area under the curve value of 0.986 (95% CI 0.966~1.000) and 0.936 (95% CI 0.866~1.000) in the primary and validation cohorts, respectively.","Chen, Xiaofeng; Tang, Yanyan; Mo, Yongkang; Li, Shengkai; Lin, Daiying; Yang, Zhijian; Yang, Zhiqi; Sun, Hongfu; Qiu, Jinming; Liao, Yuting; Xiao, Jianning; Chen, Xiangguang; Wu, Xianheng; Wu, Renhua; Dai, Zhuozhi",Eur Radiol,,58

336191,Computational Statistics and Machine Learning Techniques for Effective Decision Making on Student’s Employment for Real-Time,2021,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory RNA viruses including influenza virus have been a cause of health and economic hardships. These viruses depend on its host for replication and infection. Influenza virus infection is lethal to the chick embryo. We examined whether a combination of trimethoprim and zinc (Tri-Z), that acts on the host, can reduce the lethal effect of influenza A virus in chick embryo model. METHOD: Influenza virus was isolated from patients and propagated in eggs. We determined viral load that infects 50% of eggs (50% egg lethal dose, ELD50). We introduced 10 ELD50 into embryonated eggs and repeated the experiments using 100 ELD50. A mixture of zinc oxide (Zn) and trimethoprim (TMP) (weight/weight ratios ranged from 0.01 to 0.3, Zn/TMP with increment of 0.1) was tested for embryo survival of the infection (n = 12 per ratio, in triplicates). Embryo survival was determined by candling eggs daily for 7 days. Controls of Zn, TMP, saline or convalescent serum were conducted in parallel. The effect of Tri-Z on virus binding to its cell surface receptor was evaluated in a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay using chicken red cells. Tri-Z was prepared to concentration of 10 mg TMP and 1.8 mg Zn per ml, then serial dilutions were made. HAI effect was expressed as scores where ++++ = no effect; 0 = complete HAI effect. RESULTS: TMP, Zn or saline separately had no effect on embryo survival, none of the embryos survived influenza virus infection. All embryos treated with convalescent serum survived. Tri-Z, at ratio range of 0.15-0.2 (optimal ratio of 0.18) Zn/TMP, enabled embryos to survive influenza virus despite increasing viral load (> 80% survival at optimal ratio). At concentration of 15 µg/ml of optimal ratio, Tri-Z had total HAI effect (scored 0). However, at clinical concentration of 5 µg/ml, Tri-Z had partial HAI effect (+ +). CONCLUSION: Acting on host cells, Tri-Z at optimal ratio can reduce the lethal effect of influenza A virus in chick embryo. Tri-Z has HAI effect. These findings suggest that combination of trimethoprim and zinc at optimal ratio can be provided as treatment for influenza and possibly other respiratory RNA viruses infection in man.","El Habbal, Magdi H",Virol J,,58
336308,Linear programming with fuzzy parameters for inventory routing problem in effective management of personal protective equipment: a case study of corona virus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health issue. More than one out of five women treated for breast cancer will develop lymphedema in an upper extremity. Current evidence advocates transdisciplinary oncological rehabilitation. Therefore, research in this area is necessary since limited consensus having been reached with regard to the basic essential components of this rehabilitation. Consensus has, however, been reached on the use of decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT), but due to a lack of tests, the necessary dosages are unknown and its level is moderately strong. This study attempts to verify both the efficacy of activity-oriented proprioceptive antiedema therapy (TAPA), as compared to conventional treatments such as DLT or Complex Physical Therapy (CPT), as well as its efficiency in terms of cost-effectiveness, for patients affected by breast cancer-related arm lymphedema. METHODS: Controlled, randomized clinical trial with dual stratification, two parallel arms, longitudinal and single blind. 64 women with breast cancer-related arm lymphedema will take part in the study. The experimental group intervention will be the same for stage I and II, and will consist of neuro-dynamic exercises oriented to the activity, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation activities and proprioceptive anti-edema bandaging. The control group intervention, depending on the stage, will consist of preventive measures, skin care and exercise-prescribed training in the lymphedema workshop as well as compression garments (Stage I) or conservative Complex Decongestive Therapy treatment (skin care, multi-layer bandaging, manual lymphatic drainage and massage therapy) (Stage II). RESULTS: Sociodemographic and clinical variables will be collected for the measurement of edema volume and ADL performance. Statistical analysis will be performed on intent to treat. DISCUSSION: It has been recommended that patient training be added to DLT, as well as a re-designing of patient lifestyles and the promotion of health-related aspects. In addition, clinical trials should be undertaken to assess neural mobilization techniques and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation should be included in the therapy. Cohesive bandaging will also be performed as an early form of pressotherapy. The proposed study combines all of these aspects in order to increased comfort and promote the participation of individuals with lymphedema in everyday situations. LIMITATIONS: The authors have proposed the assessment of the experimental treatment for stages I and II. One possible limitation is the lack of awareness of whether or not this treatment would be effective for other stages as well as the concern for proper hand cleansing during use of bandages, given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation.

However, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) induced the open conformation of RBD and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2 and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis revealed that all of the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the NTD. Structural analysis demonstrated that all infectivity-enhancing antibodies bound to NTD in a similar manner. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected at high levels in severe patients. Moreover, we identified antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site in uninfected donors, albeit at a lower frequency. These findings demonstrate that not only neutralizing antibodies but also enhancing antibodies are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Yafei; Soh, Wai Tuck; Kishikawa, Jun-Ichi; Hirose, Mika; Nakayama, Emi E; Li, Songling; Sasai, Miwa; Suzuki, Tatsuya; Tada, Asa; Arakawa, Akemi; Matsuoka, Sumiko; Akamatsu, Kanako; Matsuda, Makoto; Ono, Chikako; Torii, Shiho; Kishida, Kazuki; Jin, Hui; Nakai, Wataru; Arase, Noriko; Nakagawa, Atsushi; Matsumoto, Maki; Nakazaki, Yukoh; Shindo, Yasuhiro; Kohyama, Masako; Tomii, Keisuke; Ohmura, Koichiro; Ohshima, Shiro; Okamoto, Toru; Yamamoto, Masahiro; Nakagami, Hironori; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Kato, Takayuki; Okada, Masato; Standley, Daron M; Shioda, Tatsuo; Arase, Hisashi",Cell,,58

DESIGN: A prospective, descriptive study. SAMPLE/SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 625 patients cared for in 8 US pediatric hospitals. Participants were aged preterm to 21 years, on bed rest for at least 24 hours, and had a medical device in place. METHODS: Two nursing teams, blinded to the other's assessments, worked in tandem to assess pressure injury risk, type of medical devices in use, and preventive interventions for each medical device. They also identified the presence, location, and stage of MDRPI. Subjects were observed up to 8 times over 4 weeks, or until discharge, whichever occurred first. RESULTS: Of 625 enrolled patients, 42 (7%) developed 1 or more MDRPIs. Two-thirds of patients with MDRPIs were younger than 8 years. Patients experiencing MDRPIs had higher acuity scores on hospital admission, were more frequently cognitively and/or functionally impaired, or were extreme in body mass index. Respiratory devices caused the most injuries (6.19/1000 device-days), followed by immobilizers (2.40/1000 device-days), gastric tubes (2.24/1000 device-days), and external monitoring devices (1.77/1000 device-days). Of the 6336 devices in place, 36% did not have an MDRPI preventive intervention in place. Clinical variables contributing to MDRPI development included intensive care unit care (odds ratio [OR] 8.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-43.6), use of neuromuscular blockade (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.7-7.8), and inotropic/vasopressor medications (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-4.3). Multivariable analysis indicated that Braden QD scores alone predicted MDRPI development. CONCLUSION: Medical devices are common in hospitalized infants and children and these medical devices place patients at risk for MDRPI.","Stellar, Judith J; Hasbani, Natalie R; Kulik, Lindyce A; Shelley, Stacey S; Quigley, Sandy; Wypij, David; Curley, Martha A Q",J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,,58

We conducted a study using CGM in COVID vs non-COVID patients hospitalized at the San José Hospital in Bogotá Colombia. Methods: Single center, prospective study of glucose monitoring in patients with and without COVID19 using the Freestyle system. We included patients of 18 years and older, hospitalized at Hospital San José de Bogotá, with diagnosis of diabetes and treated with insulin. We used the T student distribution to analize the data. Primary outcomes were the usefulness of the device in inpatients, and the clinical outcomes according to glucometric measures in patients with and without COVID19 infection. Results: CGM devices were placed on 30 patients: 10 with, and 20 without COVID. The system was feasible with good nurse acceptance. The age of the patients was between 18 and 90 years. Of the COVID positive patients, 30% required ICU and 10% died, the mean HBA1C was 9.5% (CI 95% 7.5–10.09%) with a general variability of 35.6%, only 3 patients archieved goals of time in range. The general glycemic index was 7.04% (CI 0.66-0.100)Of the non COVID patients, 10% required ICU and 10% died, the average variability was 30.9% and hypoglycemic episodes predominated in 3 patients. The general glycemic index was 6.6% (CI 0.61–0.71)The patients who required ICU had an average HBA1C of 10.4%, 80% received corticosteroid management during the hospital stay.

Official names have been announced for the virus responsible, previously known as ""2019 novel coronavirus"" and the diseases it causes are, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19), respectively. Despite great efforts worldwide to control SARS-CoV-2, the spread of the virus has reached a pandemic. Infection prevention and control of this virus is the primary concern of public health officials and professionals. Currently, several therapeutic options for COVID-19 are proposed and vaccine development has been initiated for prevention purposes. In this review, we will discuss the most recent evidence about the current potential treatment options including anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, nucleoside analogs, protease inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma therapy. Some other agents such as vitamin D and melatonin, which were recommended as potential adjuvant treatments for COVID-19 infection are also presented. Moreover, the potential use of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19 infection was described. Furthermore, in the next part of the current review, various vaccination approaches against COVID-19 including whole virus vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccine, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines are discussed.","Ohadian Moghadam, Solmaz",Int J Gen Med,,58
342772,Technology to address food deserts: low energy corner store groceries with integrated agriculture greenhouse,2020,"The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic since March 2020 by the World Health Organization. It consists of an emerging viral infection with respiratory tropism that could develop atypical pneumonia. Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone, alternative early-screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning (DL) algorithms, which have been popular in recent years, have been comprehensively discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches used in literature are examined in detail. The Computed Tomography of the chest and X-ray images give a rich representation of the patient's lung that is less time-consuming and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection using the DL algorithms. The first step is the pre-processing of these images to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep models (pre-trained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc). Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease. In this study, we also give a brief review of the latest applications of cough analysis to early screen the COVID-19, and human mobility estimation to limit its spread.","Hariri, Walid; Narin, Ali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07655v1.pdf,58
342773,Technology to Address Food Deserts: Low Energy Corner Store Groceries with Integrated Agriculture Greenhouse,2020,"Objective: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Studies from China, where the virus first spread, have reported increased psychological strain in healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of physicians and nurses depending on their degree of contact with COVID-19 patients. In addition, we explored which supportive resources they used and which supportive needs they experienced during the crisis. Methods: Data were collected between March and April 2020 at the University Hospital Augsburg. A total of 75 nurses and 35 physicians, working either in a special COVID-19 ward or in a regular ward, took part in the survey. The participants filled in two standardized questionnaires (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), and reported their fear of a COVID-19 infection and stress at work on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, they answered three open-ended questions about causes of burden, supportive resources and needs during the crisis. Results: Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards reported higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood, as well as lower levels of work-related fulfilment compared to their colleagues in the regular wards. Physicians reported similar scores independent of their contact with COVID-19 patients. The most common causes for burden were job strain and uncertainty about the future. Psychosocial support as well as leisure time were listed as important resources, and a better infrastructure adjustment to COVID-19 at the hospital (e.g. sufficient staff, keeping teams and working schedules stable) as suggestion for improvement. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that especially nurses working in COVID-19 wards are affected psychologically by the consequences of the pandemic. This might be due to a higher workload and longer time in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, compared to physicians.","Zerbini, Giulia; Ebigbo, Alanna; Reicherts, Philipp; Kunz, Miriam; Messman, Helmut",Ger Med Sci,,58

METHODS: Video calls using WeChat software (Tencent, Shenzhen, China) between patients and vascular surgeons were conducted in a period when there were restrictions and limitations for people' travels in China. At the end of each video call, a short questionnaire was used to evaluate the patient satisfaction level. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period from 19 February to March 16, 2020, a sample of 114 from 165 (69%) patients was reached after one phone call attempt. One hundred forty-two telemedicine remote communications were made between the two vascular surgeons and 114 patients. The mean age of this cohort of patients were 60 ± 15.2 (range 25 to 90) years old, and 74 (65%) were men. Twenty-five patients (22%) were outside of our province when they received the video call. The mean duration of the video call was 11.0 ± 8.9 minutes. All of the patients thought telemedicine was a good substitute for coming to hospital, and 95% (108/114) of them preferred to have remote telemedicine rather than postpone the appointment. All the patients agreed with the advantages of telemedicine including no infection risks, no need to travel, and no need to wait for long time. All the patients were ""satisfied"" or ""highly satisfied"" with the video call and they would like to use telemedicine for follow-up in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine virtual communications was effective to provide remote health care with a high patient satisfaction during the COVID-19 period.

347160,A data visualization interactive exploration of human mobility data during the COVID-19 outbreak: A case study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Corona virus epidemic may be acts as a stressor or trauma that affects both physical health and mental health. People exhibited various reactive behaviors to confront with this stressful situation. In Iran, one of the common motives for alcohol consumption is to scape problems and cope with stresses. It has been shown that personality factors influence alcohol consumption, since they are associated with drinking motives. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between temperament and character and alcohol abuse. METHODS: This cross-section study was conducted on 135 alcohol intoxicated patients admitted to emergency room in March 2020 and 255 participants who were randomly selected from public in Shiraz. A questionnaire consisted of TCI (Temperament and character inventory) and several questions about COVID-19 pandemic. It was completed by a trained interviewer using the matched answer technique. Demographic factors were self-reported. RESULTS: Among the alcohol intoxicated group, 117 (86.7%) were males and 18(13.3%) were females. The mean age of the participants was 32.43 ± 10.81 years. Among control group, 99 (38.8%) were males and 156 (61.2%) were females. The mean age of control group was 33.12 ± 14.77 years. Alcohol toxicity was mostly observed among the young males (male/female ratio was 6.45). According to temperament and character index, mean scores of novelty seeking, harm avoidant, and self-transcendence were higher in the alcohol toxicity group than normal population (P < 0.01). Mean scores of reward dependent, cooperativeness, and self-directedness were higher in normal population than the alcohol toxicity group (P < 0.001). The mean score of persistence was not significantly different between methanol intoxicated and normal population groups (P = 0.718). CONCLUSION: Alcohol intoxicated patients had higher scores of novelty-seeking and self-transcendence and lower scores of reward-dependency scores, cooperativeness and self-directedness. These scores are associated with higher likelihood of personality disorders.","Estedlal, Ali Reza; Mani, Arash; Vardanjani, Hossein Molavi; Kamali, Mahsa; Zarei, Leila; Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri",BMC Psychiatry,,58
347172,A Privacy Preserved and Cost Efficient Control Scheme for Coronavirus Outbreak Using Call Data Record and Contact Tracing,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely throughout the world since the end of 2019. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) has played an important role in patient diagnosis and management of COVID-19. In some circumstances, thermal inactivation at 56°C has been recommended to inactivate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) before NAT. However, this procedure could theoretically disrupt nucleic acid integrity of this single-stranded RNA virus and cause false negatives in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. METHODS: We investigated whether thermal inactivation could affect the results of viral NAT. We examined the effects of thermal inactivation on the quantitative RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2, particularly with regard to the rates of false-negative results for specimens carrying low viral loads. We additionally investigated the effects of different specimen types, sample preservation times, and a chemical inactivation approach on NAT. RESULTS: Our study showed increased Ct values in specimens from diagnosed COVID-19 patients in RT-PCR tests after thermal incubation. Moreover, about half of the weak-positive samples (7 of 15 samples, 46.7%) were RT-PCR negative after heat inactivation in at least one parallel testing. The use of guanidinium-based lysis for preservation of these specimens had a smaller impact on RT-PCR results with fewer false negatives (2 of 15 samples, 13.3%) and significantly less increase in Ct values than heat inactivation. CONCLUSION: Thermal inactivation adversely affected the efficiency of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Given the limited applicability associated with chemical inactivators, other approaches to ensure the overall protection of laboratory personnel need consideration.","Pan, Yang; Long, Luyao; Zhang, Daitao; Yuan, Tingting; Cui, Shujuan; Yang, Peng; Wang, Quanyi; Ren, Simei",Clin Chem,,58

The results showed that PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were 2-5 times higher during the Saharan dust event with the highest daily averages of 197 µg/m3 and 94 µg/m3, respectively, and exceeded the Mexican standard norm (NOM-020-SSA1-2014). When comparing with the previous Saharan dust episodes of 2015, 2018, and 2019, the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 considerably increased and more than doubled across Mexico. The correlation analysis revealed a positive association of PM levels with the number of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths during Saharan dust event. Furthermore, the human health risk assessment showed that the chronic daily intake and hazard quotient values incremented during Saharan dust days compared to non-Saharan days, indicating potential health effects and importance of taking necessary measures to ensure better air quality following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kutralam-Muniasamy, Gurusamy; Pérez-Guevara, Fermín; Martínez, Ignacio Elizalde; Chari, Shruti Venkata",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

It is well established that the endothelial glycocalyx-degrading enzyme heparanase contributes to vascular leakage and inflammation. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) serve as an inhibitor of heparanase. We hypothesize that heparanase contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and that heparanase may be inhibited by LMWH. To test this hypothesis, heparanase activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured in plasma of healthy controls (n = 10) and COVID-19 patients (n = 48). Plasma heparanase activity and heparan sulfate levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients. Heparanase activity was associated with disease severity including the need for intensive care, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and creatinine levels.

Our objective is to assess patients' self-reported impact of healthcare lockdown measures on their fears and anxieties during the crisis period of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. METHODS: We conducted a digital, self-reported, patient care survey distributed by electronic mail (e-mail) at Columbia University's department of ophthalmology outpatient faculty practice. Inclusion criteria were age greater than or equal to 18 years, a diagnosis of either retinal disease or glaucoma and a cancelled or rescheduled ophthalmology established patient appointment during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients without an e-mail address listed in their electronic medical record were excluded. The survey occurred between March 2, 2020 to May 30, 2o2o. Primary measures were survey responses to assess key areas of patient anxiety or concern during the pandemic including safety of care delivery in a COVID pandemic, difficulties contacting or being seen by their ophthalmologist, concern of vision loss or disease progression, and concern over missed or access to treatments. Secondary measures were correlating survey response to factors such as: visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), diagnosis, disease severity, follow up urgency, recent treatments and diagnostic testing data. RESULTS: Of the 2,594 surveys sent out, 510 (19.66%) were completed. Over 95% of patients were at least as concerned as in normal circumstances about their ocular health during the peak of the pandemic. 76% of respondents were more concerned than normal that they could not be seen by their ophthalmologist soon enough. Increased concern over ocular health, disease progression and access to care all showed positive correlations (P<0.05) with worse disease severity as measured with testing such as visual fields and optical coherence tomography. Additionally, 55% of patients were afraid of contracting COVID-19 during an office visit. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We found a majority of our patients were concerned about limitations in access to ophthalmic care and were fearful of disease progression. Additionally, we found a number of demographic and clinical factors that correlated with increased anxiety in our patients.","Dar, Salman; De Moraes, Carlos Gustavo; Karani, Rabia; Khan, Sabine; Chen, Royce; Blumberg, Dana; Harizman, Noga; Krawitz, Brian; Valenzuela, Ives A; Aliancy, Joah; Tezel, Tongalp; Horowitz, Jason; Bearelly, Srilaxmi; Coleman, D Jackson; Chang, Stanley; Cioffi, George A; Liebmann, Jeffrey M",J. glaucoma,,58

How open public innovation cases generated public value to the society during the COVID-19 crises in Spain? Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on two in-depth case studies of open innovation in the public sector: the collaborative platform Frena la Curva and the hackathon Vence al Virus, both launched during the first moments of the COVID-19 crisis The methodology is based on 13 semi-structured interviews, content observation and documentary analysis The data were interpreted according to the dimensions described in the analytical framework: descriptive dimensions of both initiatives but also their degree of elaboration, incentives and objectives, characteristics of governance and collaboration between actors and challenges for the accountability processes;and finally, their procedural legitimacy, considering the COVID-19 crisis context Findings: The results of the study show that citizens have played a key role during the hardest stage of the crisis, collaborating with governments and advancing their innovative capabilities, mostly in the digital sphere The analysis also identified different outcomes, including the improvement of citizen’s involvement, deliberation practices or network building Besides, this paper has identified some limitations and barriers to open innovation and collaborative governance processes in terms of accountability and legitimacy of these initiatives Here, their contribution was constrained by the emerging stage of implementation and by the unique circumstances of the lockdown under the COVID-19 crisis Research limitations/implications: Future advancements of open innovation initiatives to consolidate collaborative governance processes will need further exploration Although this paper diversified the contacts and the data collection in the fieldwork to avoid social biases, the results of the interviews might reflect very positive outcomes Despite the case studies that took place during the COVID-19 crisis and their planned actions to maintain their existence, the post-crisis analysis will be needed to assess the impact of these open innovation cases in collaborative governance structures Practical implications: Open innovation is an emerging narrative and practice in the public sector requiring time and energy from public officials and managers The study also highlighted the problem of how to legitimate open innovation cases in the public sector and the implications for their institutionalization Public managers involved in these types of initiatives need to keep the momentum both inside and outside their organizations Regarding the utilization of information and communications technologies (ICTs), open innovation processes do not need technology to develop their full potential, whereas the COVID-19 crisis and the ongoing digitalization of work settings, accessibility, etc , could transform ICTs into a critical tool for public managers leading innovation initiatives within their organizations Social implications: The social implications of this paper are manifold This study provides evidence of one of the future avenues of public management: open innovation New avenues for the involvement and collaboration of citizens with public authorities are another social implication pinpointed by this paper Democratic legitimacy and procedural accountability are assessed using the open innovation case studies during the COVID-19 crisis Finally, transforming governments using collaborative platforms deserves social oversight understanding if they really contribute to build trust in political institutions Originality/valu : Despite their differences, both Frena la Curva and Vence al Virus demonstrated the potential and limitations of public innovation and collaborative governance to cope with an unprecedented crisis such as the COVID-19 The special features of this emergency, including the long period of confinement, posed challenges and also opportunities to develop these initiatives: as several interviewees stated, these projects helped to channel the civic energy to co-produce solutions in collaboration with a wide range of actors Data allow us to identify the key features of collaborative governance that guided open innovation initiatives in the Spanish public sector during the COVID-19 crisis © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Criado, J.

357313,Valuation of Energy Security for Natural Gas—European Example,2021,"Pancreatitis is a condition of pancreatic inflammation driven by injury to the pancreatic parenchyma. The extent of acinar insult, intensity, and type of immune response determines the severity of the disease. Smoking, alcohol and autoimmune pancreatitis are some of the predominant risk factors that increase the risk of pancreatitis by differentially influencing the adaptive immune system. The overall decrease in peripheral lymphocyte (T-, B- and (natural killer T-) NKT-cell) count and increased infiltration into the damaged pancreatic tissue highlight the contribution of adaptive immunity in the disease pathology. Smoking and alcohol modulate the responsiveness and apoptosis of T- and B-cells during pancreatic insult. Acute pancreatitis worsens with smoking and alcohol, leading to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, suggesting the critical role of adaptive immunity in fatal outcomes such as multiple organ dysfunction. The presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and perforin-expressing cells in the fibrotic tissue in chronic pancreatitis modulate the severity of the disease. Due to their important role in altering the severity of the disease, attempts to target adaptive immune mediators will be critical for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","Bhatia, Rakesh; Thompson, Christopher; Ganguly, Koelina; Singh, Shailender; Batra, Surinder K; Kumar, Sushil",,,58

Although the predominant clinical feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome of varying severity, ranging from mild symptomatic interstitial pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome, the cardiovascular system can be involved in several ways. As many as 40% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have histories of cardiovascular disease, and current estimates report a proportion of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 of up to 12%. Multiple pathways have been suggested to explain this finding and the related clinical scenarios, encompassing local and systemic inflammatory responses and oxygen supply-demand imbalance. From a clinical point of view, cardiac involvement during COVID-19 may present a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from subclinical myocardial injury to well-defined clinical entities (myocarditis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and heart failure), whose incidence and prognostic implications are currently largely unknown because of a significant lack of imaging data. Integrated heart and lung multimodality imaging plays a central role in different clinical settings and is essential in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with COVID-19. The aims of this review are to summarize imaging-oriented pathophysiological mechanisms of lung and cardiac involvement in COVID-19 and to provide a guide for integrated imaging assessment in these patients.","Agricola, Eustachio; Beneduce, Alessandro; Esposito, Antonio; Ingallina, Giacomo; Palumbo, Diego; Palmisano, Anna; Ancona, Francesco; Baldetti, Luca; Pagnesi, Matteo; Melisurgo, Giulio; Zangrillo, Alberto; De Cobelli, Francesco",JACC Cardiovasc Imaging,,58

Characterizing these assays provides scientific basis to best use them. The current study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo total antibody test) using 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 119 samples with potential cross-reactions, and 1068 negative controls including 942 pre-pandemic samples. SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies became detectable 3-4 days post-symptom onset using SQ IgM test and IgG antibodies were first detected 5-6 days post-onset using SQ IgG. Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total were able to detect antibodies 7 to 8 days post-onset. After 14 days post-symptom onset, the SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total tests were able to detect antibodies from 100% of the PCR-confirmed patients in this series; 87.5% sensitivity for SQ IgM. Overall agreement was 88.5% between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total and 94.6% between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG. No cross-reaction due to recent sera with three of the endemic coronaviruses was observed. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main source of limited cross-reactions. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total, 99.62% for Abbott IgG, and 98.87% for SQ IgM.

This model is less sophisticated than other models in the literature, but it can capture the exponential growth and it can explain it in terms of mobility (diffusion constant), population density, and probability of transmission. Students can change the parameters and determine the growth rate and predict the total number of cases as a function of time.

Consequently, many have shown a growing interest and receptivity to the expansion of telehealth models to help meet these demands. Electronic consultations (eConsults) are a telehealth modality that allow for a non-face-to-face asynchronous consultation between a primary care provider (PCP) and a specialist aimed at facilitating specialist input without the need for a patient visit. The aim of this case study is to describe eConsults, how they differ from traditional in person models of care and other models of telemedicine and to review the evidence related to the effectiveness of eConsults by PCPs and clinicians from multiple specialties at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. We have worked to develop an infrastructure, delivery system integration, and care model adaptations that aim to improve delivery system performance by ensuring proper care in appropriate settings and lowering costs through reduced utilization. Lastly, we have increased care coordination, improved collaboration and better care transitions through strengthening of relationships between community-based PCPs and academic medical center-based specialists. This work has resulted in cost savings to patients and positive provider satisfaction.","Thompson, Matthew A; Fuhlbrigge, Anne L; Pearson, Duane W; Saxon, David R; Oberst-Walsh, Linda A; Thomas, John F",J Prim Care Community Health,,58
366394,Readiness Assessment of Green Building Certification Systems for Residential Buildings during Pandemics,2021,"The aim of the paper is two-fold. First, we show that structure finding with the PC algorithm can be inherently unstable and requires further operational constraints in order to consistently obtain models that are faithful to the data. We propose a methodology to stabilise the structure finding process, minimising both false positive and false negative error rates. This is demonstrated with synthetic data. Second, to apply the proposed structure finding methodology to a data set comprising single-voxel Magnetic Resonance Spectra of normal brain and three classes of brain tumours, to elucidate the associations between brain tumour types and a range of observed metabolites that are known to be relevant for their characterisation. The data set is bootstrapped in order to maximise the robustness of feature selection for nominated target variables. Specifically, Conditional Independence maps (CI-maps) built from the data and their derived Bayesian networks have been used. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is built from CI-maps, being a major challenge the minimization of errors in the graph structure. This work presents empirical evidence on how to reduce false positive errors via the False Discovery Rate, and how to identify appropriate parameter settings to improve the False Negative Reduction. In addition, several node ordering policies are investigated that transform the graph into a DAG. The obtained results show that ordering nodes by strength of mutual information can recover a representative DAG in a reasonable time, although a more accurate graph can be recovered using a random order of samples at the expense of increasing the computation time.","Casaña-Eslava, Raúl Vicente; Ortega-Martorell, Sandra; Lisboa, Paulo J; Candiota, Ana Paula; Julià-Sapé, Margarida; Martín-Guerrero, José David; Jarman, Ian H",PLoS One,,58
366486,Do concerns about COVID-19 impair sustained attention?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to the lockdown and quarantines caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to study and use telepractice for providing speech pathology interventions for children with cleft palate has arisen. OBJECTIVE: To carry out a systematic review of the use of telepractice during the COVID-19 pandemic for providing speech pathology interventions for Spanish-speaking children with cleft palate. METHODS: In July and August 2020, the authors searched the electronic databases Medline, LILACS, SciELO, and the Cochrane Library using the following keywords in English (MeSH): Cleft palate combined with Early intervention, Speech therapy, Rehabilitation of speech and language disorders, Speech production measurement, Speech articulation tests and Telemedicine. Original articles were selected and analyzed, complemented by an analysis of flowcharts and recommendations by the GES Clinical Guide of Cleft Lip and Palate of Chile's Government and the authors' expert opinions. RESULTS: A total of 2680 articles were retrieved, of which 23 were critically analyzed and used to adapt the early stimulation, evaluation, and treatment of children with CP to speech therapy telepractice at the Gantz Foundation, a Hospital in Santiago de Chile. LIMITATIONS: Only three researchers carried out a quick review, which limited the depth of individual analysis of the studies included. Also, the suggestions and material presented should be evaluated in future investigations. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides useful guidelines for providing speech pathology interventions through telepractice for children with cleft palate. Audiovisual materials seem to be extremely useful for families receiving the interventions. The use of interactive videos for Spanish-speaking children and educational videos for parents is manifest.","Palomares-Aguilera, Mirta; Inostroza-Allende, Felipe; Solar, Loreley Riquelme",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,58

369356,Impact assessment of covid-19 pandemic through machine learning models,2021,"BACKGROUND: Evolutionary transitions from terrestrial to aquatic life history cause drastic changes in sensory systems. Indeed, the drastic changes in vision have been reported in many aquatic amniotes, convergently. Recently, the opsin genes of the full-aquatic sea snakes have been reported. However, those of the amphibious sea snakes have not been examined in detail. RESULTS: Here, we investigated opsin genes and visual pigments of sea snakes. We determined the sequences of SWS1, LWS, and RH1 genes from one terrestrial, three amphibious and four fully-aquatic elapids. Amino acid replacements at four and one spectra-tuning positions were found in LWS and RH1, respectively. We measured or predicted absorption of LWS and RH1 pigments with A1-derived retinal. During their evolution, blue shifts of LWS pigments have occurred stepwise in amphibious sea snakes and convergently in both amphibious and fully-aquatic species. CONCLUSIONS: Blue shifted LWS pigments may have adapted to deep water or open water environments dominated by blue light. The evolution of opsins differs between marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and sea snakes in two fundamental ways: (1) pseudogenization of opsins in marine mammals; and (2) large blue shifts of LWS pigments in sea snakes. It may be possible to explain these two differences at the level of photoreceptor cell composition given that cone and rod cells both exist in mammals whereas only cone cells exist in fully-aquatic sea snakes. We hypothesize that the differences in photoreceptor cell compositions may have differentially affected the evolution of opsins in divergent amniote lineages.","Seiko, Takashi; Kishida, Takushi; Toyama, Mina; Hariyama, Takahiko; Okitsu, Takashi; Wada, Akimori; Toda, Mamoru; Satta, Yoko; Terai, Yohey",BMC Evol Biol,,58

Nanoparticles were formed in an eco-friendly extracellular manner and characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, MADLS and SEM techniques. The obtained nanoparticles showed excellent activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MIC values for gram-negative bacteria were 15 µM, while for gram-positive strains they reached 30 µM. The haemolytic and cytotoxic activities of the synthesized nanoparticles towards mammalian cells were also determined. The addition of AgNPs at the concentrations above 30 µM caused 50% haemolysis of red blood cells after they 24-hour incubation. A decrease in the viability of fibroblasts by over 50% was also found in the samples treated with nanoparticles at the concentrations above 30 µM.

373128,Impact of COVID-19 on energy use patterns and renewable energy development in Taiwan,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread exponentially across the United States. Older adults with underlying health conditions are at an especially high risk of developing life-threatening complications if infected. Most intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and non-ICU hospitalizations have been among patients with at least one underlying health condition. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model to estimate the risk status of the patients of a nationwide pharmacy chain in the United States, and to identify the geographic distribution of patients who have the highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. METHODS: A risk model was developed using a training test split approach to identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19. Adult patients (aged &#8805;18 years) were identified from the Walgreens pharmacy electronic data warehouse. Patients were considered eligible to contribute data to the model if they had at least one prescription filled at a Walgreens location between October 27, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Risk parameters included age, whether the patient is being treated for a serious or chronic condition, and urban density classification. Parameters were differentially weighted based on their association with severe complications, as reported in earlier cases. An at-risk rate per 1000 people was calculated at the county level, and ArcMap was used to depict the rate of patients at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Real-time COVID-19 cases captured by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) were layered in the risk map to show where cases exist relative to the high-risk populations. RESULTS: Of the 30,100,826 adults included in this study, the average age is 50 years, 15% have at least one specialty medication, and the average patient has 2 to 3 comorbidities. Nearly 28% of patients have the greatest risk score, and an additional 34.64% of patients are considered high-risk, with scores ranging from 8 to 10. Age accounts for 53% of a patient's total risk, followed by the number of comorbidities (29%); inferred chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or diabetes (15%); and urban density classification (5%). CONCLUSIONS: This risk model utilizes data from approximately 10% of the US population. Currently, this is the most comprehensive US model to estimate and depict the county-level prognosis of COVID-19 infection. This study shows that there are counties across the United States whose residents are at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. Our county-level risk estimates may be used alongside other data sets to improve the accuracy of anticipated health care resource needs. The interactive map can also aid in proactive planning and preparations among employers that are deemed critical, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within their facilities.","Smith-Ray, Renae; Roberts, Erin E; Littleton, Devonee E; Singh, Tanya; Sandberg, Thomas; Taitel, Michael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,58
373181,A hybrid deep learning and NLP based system to predict the spread of Covid-19 and unexpected side effects on people,2020,"Almost the entire world, not only China, is currently experiencing the outbreak of a novel coronavirus that causes respiratory disease, severe pneumonia, and even death. The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and is currently still ongoing. This novel coronavirus is highly contagious and has resulted in a continuously increasing number of infections and deaths that have already surpassed the SARS-CoV outbreak that occurred in China between 2002 and 2003. It is now officially a pandemic, announced by WHO on the 11th of March. Currently, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be identified by virus isolation or viral nucleic acid detection; however, false negatives associated with the nucleic acid detection provide a clinical challenge and thus make the imaging examination crucial. Imaging exams have been a main clinical diagnostic criteria for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China. Imaging features of multiple patchy areas of ground glass opacity and consolidation predominately in the periphery of the lungs are characteristic manifestations on chest CT and extremely helpful in the early detection and diagnosis of this disease, which aids prompt diagnosis and the eventual control of this emerging global health emergency. Key Points â¢ In December 2019, China, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel, highly contagious coronavirus raised grave concerns and posed a huge threat to global public health. â¢ Among the infected patients, characteristic findings on CT imaging include multiple, patchy, ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation shadows, mainly distributed in the peripheral and subpleural areas of both lungs, which are very helpful for the frontline clinicians. â¢ Imaging examination has become the indispensable means not only in the early detection and diagnosis but also in monitoring the clinical course, evaluating the disease severity, and may be presented as an important warning signal preceding the negative RT-PCR test results.","Yang, Wenjing; Sirajuddin, Arlene; Zhang, Xiaochun; Liu, Guanshu; Teng, Zhongzhao; Zhao, Shihua; Lu, Minjie",Eur Radiol,,58

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with pathologically proven SAAH (SAAH group) who underwent CT or MRI examinations up to 30 days before or 15 days after liver biopsy between January 2008 and June 2018 were retrospectively included. There were 31 men and 29 women with a mean age of 52±9 (SD) years (range: 33-67 years). Imaging features of the SAAH group were compared to those obtained in two control groups including 62 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis without acute alcoholic hepatitis (control group 1) and 19 patients with NASH cirrhosis (control group 2) by two independent radiologists blinded to the final diagnosis. Univariate analyses were performed to compare imaging characteristics between the three groups, followed by diagnostic performance analysis for the diagnosis of SAAH of the main CT features. RESULTS: Heterogeneous steatosis was significantly more frequent in SAAH group than in the control groups (41/50; 82% vs. 7/62; 10% and 1/19; 5% in control groups 1 and 2, respectively for reader 1 and 34/50; 68% vs. 8/62; 13% and 1/19; 5% in control groups 1 and 2, respectively for reader 2; both P=0.01). Transient perfusion disorders were more frequent in SAAH group than in the control groups (35/50; 70% vs. 12/62; 21% and 5/19; 26% in control groups 1 and 2, respectively for reader 1 and 39/50; 78% vs. 14/62; 23% and 13/19; 6% in control groups 1 and 2, respectively for reader 2; both P=0.01). The combination of these two findings yielded 100% specificity (45/45; 95% CI: 92-100) for readers 1 and 2 for the diagnosis of SAAH vs. alcoholic cirrhosis and NASH cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: The imaging features of SAAH are specific and mainly associate transient heterogeneous steatosis and liver perfusion disorders. CT/MRI may be useful to differentiate SAAH from alcoholic cirrhosis and NASH cirrhosis.","Grillet, F; Calame, P; Cervoni, J-P; Weil, D; Thevenot, T; Ronot, M; Delabrousse, E",Diagnostic and interventional imaging,,58

Access to these areas has been linked to benefits for physical and mental health of local populations. In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses, cancelation of public events and schooling, social distancing, limitations on the size of social gatherings, and travel restrictions. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the self-reported use and changes in personal importance related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 responses to our field survey. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to our natural areas and urban forests, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these areas, and access to them, either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as 'very important'. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of, and improved access to, natural areas to our largely urban civilization.","Grima, Nelson; Corcoran, Will; Hill-James, Corinne; Langton, Benjamin; Sommer, Haley; Fisher, Brendan",PLoS One,,58

382748,Design of a mobile application for the school enrollment process in order to prevent Covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, medical care and research in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been conducted with in-person encounters. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted the delivery of in-person clinical care and clinical research. We conducted an online survey of active clinician members of the Parkinson Study Group (PSG) to evaluate the adoption of various non-face-to-face methods in clinical practice and research in PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a survey using the open-access online SurveyMonkey tool (http://www.surveymonkey.com). The survey had 27 items and was designed to elucidate clinical/research care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 414 active PSG members with weekly reminders and it remained accessible for 30 days from May 2020. RESULTS: We received 142 responses, of which 133 (93.7%) provided demographic data. The clinical use of virtual visits via synchronous video conferencing increased from 39.5% pre-COVID-19 to 94.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of access for patients (68.2%) and patient resistance (51.4%) were the top barriers for its use. Approximately 70% respondents stated that 75-100% of their research activities were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many sites had to fill out protocol deviations (38.2%), protocol exceptions (25.5%) or change their research profile due to layoffs (16.8%). The overall use of video conferencing increased from 30.3% to 64.1%. CONCLUSION: The current results suggest a need for flexibility in conducting office visits and clinical trials in PD patients. Technology has the potential to enhance patient care and convenience, when in-person visits can be challenging.","Shivkumar, Vikram; Subramanian, Thyagarajan; Agarwal, Pinky; Mari, Zoltan; Mestre, Tiago A",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,,58

The aim of the current study is to elucidate the specific miRNA profile which can act as new biomarkers for distinguishing acute COVID-19 disease from the healthy group and those in the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 disease. METHODS: The expression level of selected miRNAs including let-7b-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-3p and miR-155-5p were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients, in both the acute and post-acute COVID-19 phase of the disease and healthy groups, by real-time PCR assays. Specificity and sensitivity of miRNAs was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The expression level of all miRNAs in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than in the healthy group. Therefore, the expression pattern of miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-3p and let-7b-3p in the post-acute COVID-19 phase was significantly different from the acute COVID-19 phase. ROC analyses demonstrated that miR-29a-3p, -155-5p and -146a-3p may serve as the novel biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity. In addition, miR-29a-3p, and -146a-3p can maybe act as novel biomarkers for distinguishing acute from post-acute phase of COVID-19 disease. DISCUSSION: The difference in miRNA expression pattern between COVID-19 patients and those in the healthy group, and between acute COVID-19 with post-acute COVID-19, suggested that cellular miRNAs could be used as promising biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19.","Donyavi, Tahereh; Bokharaei-Salim, Farah; Baghi, Hossein Bannazadeh; Khanaliha, Khadijeh; Alaei Janat-Makan, Mahrokh; Karimi, Bahareh; Sadri Nahand, Javid; Mirzaei, Hamed; Khatami, AliReza; Garshasbi, Saba; Khoshmirsafa, Majid; Jalal Kiani, Seyed",Int Immunopharmacol,,58

Young individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are particularly at risk due to their vulnerability to unpredictable and complex changes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASD individuals, whether any pre-pandemic sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative outcome, and to narratively characterize their needs. Parents and guardians of ASD individuals filled out an online survey consisting of 40 questions investigating socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of their children, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing and needs to deal with the emergency. Data were available on 527 survey participants. The COVID-19 emergency resulted in a challenging period for 93.9% of families, increased difficulties in managing daily activities, especially free time (78.1%) and structured activities (75.7%), and, respectively, 35.5% and 41.5% of children presenting with more intense and more frequent behavior problems. Behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak predicted a higher risk of more intense (odds ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.29) and more frequent (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.48) disruptive behavior. Even though ASD children were receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist (19.1%) or emergency (1.5%) interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support (47.4%), especially in-home support (29.9%), as well as interventions to tackle a potentially disruptive quarantine (16.8%). The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals.","Colizzi, Marco; Sironi, Elena; Antonini, Federico; Ciceri, Marco Luigi; Bovo, Chiara; Zoccante, Leonardo",,,58

The causative agent of the outbreak was identified by the WHO as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), producing the disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The virus is closely related (96.3%) to bat coronavirus RaTG13, based on phylogenetic analysis. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed even from asymptomatic carriers. The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily. Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus. There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation. Therefore, in this review, we provide recent information about the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and future spillovers.","Helmy, Yosra A.; Fawzy, Mohamed; Elaswad, Ahmed; Sobieh, Ahmed; Kenney, Scott P.; Shehata, Awad A.",J.

The objective of this study was to assess the well-being, resilience, burnout, and wellness factors and needs of EM physicians and advanced practice providers (e.g., nurse practitioners and physician assistants; APPs) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, prospective, cohort survey study of EM physicians and APPs was performed across ten emergency departments in a single state, including academic and community settings. Participants were recruited via email to complete four weekly, voluntary, anonymous questionnaires comprised of customized and validated tools for assessing wellness (Well Being Index), burnout (Physician Work Life Study item), and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) during the initial acceleration phase of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analysis with Chi-squared, Fisher's Exact, and logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: Of 213 eligible participants, response rates ranged from 31 to 53% over four weeks. Women comprised 54 to 60% of responses. Nonrespondent characteristics were similar to respondents. Concern for personal safety decreased from 85 to 61% (p < 0.001). Impact on basic self-care declined from 66 to 32% (p < 0.001). Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or fear was initially 83% and reduced to 66% (p = 0.009). Reported strain on relationships and feelings of isolation affected > 50% of respondents initially without significant change (p = 0.05 and p = 0.30 respectively). Women were nearly twice as likely to report feelings of isolation as men (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.82-5.88). Working part-time carried twice the risk of burnout (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.10-5.47). Baseline resilience was normal to high. Provider well-being improved over the four weeks (30 to 14%; p = 0.01), but burnout did not significantly change (30 to 22%; p = 0.39). CONCLUSION: This survey of frontline EM providers, including physicians and APPs, during the initial surge of COVID-19 found that despite being a resilient group, the majority experienced stress, anxiety, fear, and concerns about personal safety due to COVID-19, putting many at risk for burnout. The sustained impact of the pandemic on EM provider wellness deserves further investigation to guide targeted interventions.","Kelker, Heather; Yoder, Kyle; Musey, Paul; Harris, Madison; Johnson, Olivia; Sarmiento, Elisa; Vyas, Punit; Henderson, Brooke; Adams, Zachary; Welch, Julie",BMC Emerg Med,,58
398017,Strategies for enhancing remote student engagement through active learning,2021,"The Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has gained research attention worldwide, given the current pandemic. Nevertheless, a previous zoonotic and highly pathogenic coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is still causing concern, especially in Saudi Arabia and neighbour countries. The MERS-CoV has been reported from respiratory samples in more than 27 countries, and around 2500 cases have been reported with an approximate fatality rate of 35%. After its emergence in 2012 intermittent, sporadic cases, nosocomial infections and many community clusters of MERS continued to occur in many countries. Human-to-human transmission resulted in the large outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. The inherent genetic variability among various clads of the MERS-CoV might have probably paved the events of cross-species transmission along with changes in the inter-species and intra-species tropism. The current review is drafted using an extensive review of literature on various databases, selecting of publications irrespective of favouring or opposing, assessing the merit of study, the abstraction of data and analysing data. The genome of MERS-CoV contains around thirty thousand nucleotides having seven predicted open reading frames. Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the four main structural proteins. The surface located spike protein (S) of betacoronaviruses has been established to be one of the significant factors in their zoonotic transmission through virus-receptor recognition mediation and subsequent initiation of viral infection. Three regions in Saudi Arabia (KSA), Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah were affected severely. The epidemic progression had been the highest in 2014 in Makkah and Riyadh and Eastern Province in 2013.

399298,Guest Editorial: AI for COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to characterize the electrophysiological features and plasma biomarkers of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIN) and myopathy (CIM) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW). METHODS: An observational ICU cohort study including adult patients admitted to the ICU at Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, from March 13th to June 8th 2020. We compared the clinical, electrophysiological and plasma biomarker data between COVID-19 patients who developed CIN/CIM and those who did not. Electrophysiological characteristics were also compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ICU patients. RESULTS: 111 COVID-19 patients were included, 11 of whom developed CIN/CIM. Patients with CIN/CIM had more severe illness; longer ICU stay, more thromboembolic events and were more frequently treated with invasive ventilation for longer than 2 weeks. In particular CIN was more frequent among COVID-19 patients with ICUAW (50%) compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort (0%, p = 0.008). Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) levels were higher in the CIN/CIM group compared with those that did not develop CIN/CIM (both p = 0.001) and correlated with nerve amplitudes.

399952,Barriers towards the Adoption of Digital Learning Platforms,2020,"The description of the profiles of chromatographic peaks has been studied extensively, with a large number of proposed mathematical functions. Among them, the accuracy achieved with modified Gaussian models that describe the deviation of an ideal Gaussian peak as a change in the peak variance or standard deviation over time, has been highlighted. These models are, in fact, a family of functions of different complexity with great flexibility to adjust chromatographic peaks over a wide range of asymmetries and shapes. However, an uncontrolled behaviour of the signal may occur outside the region being fitted, forcing the use of different strategies to overcome this problem. In this work, the performance of the LMG (Linear Modified Gaussian), PVMG (Parabolic Variance Modified Gaussian), and PLMG (Parabolic-Lorentzian Modified Gaussian) models is compared with variants obtained by combination of the modified Gaussian models with an equation that adds an exponential tail and with other functions that limit the growth of the independent variable. The behaviour of the approaches is checked through the simultaneous fitting of enantiomeric peaks showing a wide range of characteristics, obtained in the separation of drugs with chiral activity by liquid chromatography using enantioselective columns. The study is also carried out with the purpose of performing the deconvolution of the peaks of the enantiomers, when these are not completely resolved, in order to evaluate the enantiomeric fraction.","Pérez-Baeza, M; Escuder-Gilabert, L; Medina-Hernández, M J; Baeza-Baeza, J J; García-Alvarez-Coque, M C",J Chromatogr A,,58

400850,On Sustainable;Sustaining City Streets,2021,"There is no report on the serial interval (SI) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Iran, the present report aims to estimate the SI and time-varying R of COVID-19 in western Iran. In this study, there were 1477 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for Kermanshah from 22 February to 9 April. The close contacts of the confirmed cases were identified using telephone follow up of patients and their contacts. The SI distribution was used as an alternative. We fitted different models using the clinical onset dates of patients with their close contact (infector–infectee). Also, we applied a ‘serial interval from sample’ approach as a Bayesian methodology for estimating reproduction number. From 22 February to 29 March, 247 COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR. Close contact between 21 patients (21 infector–infectee pairs), including 12 primary cases and 21 secondary cases, was confirmed. The mean and standard deviation of the SI were estimated as 5.71 and 3.89 days. The R varied from 0.79 to 1.88 for a 7-day time-lapse and ranged from 0.92 to 1.64 for a 14-day time-lapse on raw data. Also, the R varied from 0.83 to 1.84 for 7-day time-lapse and from 0.95 to 1.54 for a 14-day time-lapse using moving average data, respectively. It can be concluded that the low reproduction number for COVID-19 in Kermanshah province is an indication of the effectiveness of preventive and interventive programmes such as quarantine and isolation. Consequently, continuing these preventive measures is highly recommended.","Najafi, F.; Izadi, N.; Hashemi-Nazari, S.-S.; Khosravi-Shadmani, F.; Nikbakht, R.; Shakiba, E.",New Microbes New Infect.,,58
402246,Which Way to Cope with COVID-19 Challenges? Contributions of the IoT for Smart City Projects,2021,"Social media has become explosive, permeating every sphere of the socio-cultural lives of individuals and businesses, and causing nations to technologically evolve. The dramatic growth in the adoption and use of social media has become beneficial to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), significantly contributing to resolving a nagging challenge of effectively advertising their goods and services. Consequently, SMEs can achieve business growth and sustainability through increased adoption and harnessing the opportunities provided through the use of social media. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an impetus for both consumers and SME businesses to leverage interaction through social media, which may lead to business growth. This research thus sets out to identify how social media contributes to the growth of SMEs within a developing country context. To accomplish this objective, primary data was collected from SMEs in the hospitality industry across the sixteen administrative regions of Ghana using survey and simple random sampling techniques. Questionnaires were distributed to the managerial staff of each randomly selected survey participant. Out of the 900 questionnaires distributed, 718 were filled correctly for the data analysis. The researchers quantitatively analyzed the responses using Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling(PLSSEM) statistical software ADANCO 2.0 version. The results indicated that Small and Medium Enterprises are capable of using social media for customer attraction, business marketing strategy, communication channel and increased financial performance. © 2021 John Amoah et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Amoah, J.; Belás, J.; Khan, K.

405266,Assessing the filtration effectiveness of a portable ultraviolet air cleaner on airborne sars-cov-2 laden droplets in a patient room: A numerical study,2021,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still a relevant global problem. Although some patients have recovered from COVID-19, the sequalae to the SARS-CoV-2 infection may include pulmonary fibrosis, which may contribute to considerable economic burden and health-care challenges. Convalescent Chinese Prescription (CCP) has been widely used during the COVID-19 recovery period for patients who were at high risk of pulmonary fibrosis and is recommended by the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Trial Version sixth, seventh). However, its underlying mechanism is still unclear. Methods: In this study, an integrated pharmacology approach was implemented, which involved evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of CCP, data mining of the disease targets, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and analysis, enrichment analysis, and molecular docking simulation, to predict the bioactive components, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of CCP for pulmonary fibrosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The active compound of CCP and the candidate targets, including pulmonary fibrosis targets, were obtained through database mining. The Drug-Disease network was constructed. Sixty-five key targets were identified by topological analysis. The findings of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation suggested that the VEGF, Toll-like 4 receptor, MAPK signaling pathway, and TGF-β1 signaling pathways may be involved in pulmonary fibrosis. In the molecular docking analyses, VEGF, TNF-α, IL-6, MMP9 exhibited good binding activity. Findings from our study indicated that CCP could inhibit the expression of VEGF, TNF-α, IL-6, MMP9, TGF-β1 via the VEGF, Toll-like 4 receptor, MAPK, and TGF-β1 signaling pathways. Conclusion: Potential mechanisms involved in CCP treatment for COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection involves multiple components and multiple target points as well as multiple pathways. These findings may offer a profile for further investigations of the anti-fibrotic mechanism of CCP. © Copyright © 2021 Jin, An, Zhang, Zhao, Duan, Duan, Lian and Tong.","Jin, D.; An, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhao, S.; Duan, L.; Duan, Y.; Lian, F.; Tong, X.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,58

Opportunities such as watching pre-recorded autopsy videos or creating and analyzing post-mortem computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with various 3D surface imaging techniques are usually time-consuming and cost-intensive. Photogrammetry, which allows the creation of 3D textured surface models from a series of overlapping photographs taken from varying viewpoints, is a less common approach compared with post-mortem imaging. We created 3D autopsy case models for a special online forensic pathology course in which students could try the models. Then, formal feedback was requested regarding the possible application of this method in education. Most of the students were satisfied with the new method and ranked photogrammetry higher than the other available methods. Our results indicate that photogrammetry has a high potential in undergraduate education, especially in the case of distance education or in those countries where declining autopsy rates have resulted in a decline in the use of the autopsy as an educational tool. Photogrammetry can also be used as a supplementary tool in traditional autopsy-based education and has potential applications in various fields of medical education.","Tóth, Dénes; Petrus, Karola; Heckmann, Veronika; Simon, Gábor; Poór, Viktor Soma",J Forensic Sci,,58

408046,Infectious epidemics and the research output of nations: A data-driven analysis,2021,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents in the United States, and risk for recurring suicidal thoughts and behavior remains high after discharge from psychiatric hospitals. Safety planning, a brief intervention wherein the main focus is on identifying personal coping strategies and resources to mitigate suicidal crises, is a recommended best practice approach for intervening with individuals at risk for suicide. However, anecdotal as well as emerging empirical evidence indicate that adolescents at risk for suicide often do not use their safety plan during the high-risk postdischarge period. Thus, to be maximally effective, we argue that safety planning should be augmented with additional strategies for increasing safety plan use to prevent recurrent crises during high-risk transitions. The current article describes an adjunctive intervention for adolescents at elevated suicide risk that enhances safety planning with motivational interviewing (MI) strategies, with the goal of increasing adolescents' motivation and strengthening self-efficacy for safety plan use after discharge. We provide an overview of the intervention and its components, focusing the discussion on the in-person individual and family sessions delivered during hospitalization, and describe the theoretical basis for the MI-enhanced intervention. We then provide examples of applying MI during the process of safety planning, including example strategies that aim to elicit motivation and strengthen self-efficacy for safety plan use. We conclude with clinical case material and highlight how these strategies may be incorporated into the safety planning session.

411013,Editorial: International Sustainable Ecological Engineering Design for Society (SEEDS) Conference 2018,2021,"In December 2019, clusters of atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology emerged in the city of Wuhan in China. In early January 2020, the Center for Disease Control in China announced that it was identified a new coronavirus, first tentatively named 2019-nCoV and officially named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. On February 11, 2020 the WHO identified the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-19 based on the year of appearance). Although only a few months have passed since the beginning of this pandemic, numerous studies, case reports, reviews by leading international scientific and medical journals have been published. However, given the unpredictability of virus behaviour and the still limited knowledge about it, many aspects of the infection are still little known. A recent epidemiological study has shown the presence of dysphonia in some patients with COVID-19, with a minority reporting aphonia during the clinical course of the disease. This case study draws attention on a 50-year-old female nurse presented with a history of fatigue resulting from minor exertion and persistent dysphonia at the Occupational Health Department of a major University Hospital in central Italy. The patient had a history of COVID-19 infection, which lasted about two months with pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms. After two RT-PCR negativities for SARS-CoV-2, dysphonia and fatigue due to minor exertionpersisted. The patient, following the persistence of the symptomatology, was subject to numerous specialist examinations, which showed no organic alterations. Based on her clinical and instrumental history, we hypothesized a psychogenetic dysphonia related to COVID-19. This case report highlights the importance of personalized medicine with long-term follow-up and rubustpsychological support in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and in particular in the categories at greatest risk of both contagion and adverse physical and mental outcomes like health care workers.","Buselli, Rodolfo; Corsi, Martina; Necciari, Gabriele; Pistolesi, Piero; Baldanzi, Sigrid; Chiumiento, Martina; Del Lupo, Elena; Guerra, Paolo Del; Cristaudo, Alfonso",Brain Behav Immun Health,,58

Viral attachment as a crucial step for cross-species infection requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity. Here, we searched the genomes of metazoans from different classes using an extensive BLASTP survey and found ACE2 and TMPRSS2 occur in vertebrates, but some vertebrates lack Tmprss2. We identified 6 amino acids among 25 known human ACE2 residues are highly associated with the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 (p value < .01) by Fisher exact test, and following this, calculated the probability of viral attachment within each species by the randomForest function from R randomForest library. Furthermore, we observed that Ace2 selected from seven animals based on the above analysis lack the hydrophobic contacts identified on human ACE2, indicating less affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to Ace2 in animals than humans. Finally, the alignment of 3D structure between human ACE2 and other animals by I-TASSER and TM-align displayed a reasonable structure for viral attachment within these species. Taken together, our data may shed light on the human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Chen; Jiang, Yu; Yan, Jie",J. med. virol,,58

National Health System is among activities suffering from the COVID-19 and the lockdown. AIM: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. METHODS: We report the change in the hospital organization to meet the growing healthcare needs determined by COVID-19. The limitations of CRC prevention secondary to COVID-19 and their effects on the healthcare are analyzed considering the features of the CRC screening programs in the average-risk population and endoscopic surveillance in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). RESULTS: The interruption of CRC prevention may lead to a delayed diagnosis of CRC, possibly in a more advanced stage. The economic burden and the impact on workload for gastroenterologists, surgeons, and oncologists will be greater as long as the CRC prevention remains suspended. To respond to the increased demand for colonoscopy once COVID-19 will be under control, we should optimize the resources. It will be necessary to stratify the CRC risk and reach an order of priority. It should be implemented the number of health workers, equipment, and spaces dedicated to performing colonoscopy for screening purpose and in subjects with alarm symptoms in the shortest time. To this aim, the funds earmarked for healthcare should be increased. CONCLUSION: The economic impact will be dramatic, but COVID-19 is the demonstration that healthcare has to be the primary goal of humans.","Del Vecchio Blanco, Giovanna; Calabrese, Emma; Biancone, Livia; Monteleone, Giovanni; Paoluzi, Omero Alessandro",Int J Colorectal Dis,,58

Departing from a population-based study in rural Ecuador where all adult individuals (aged 40 years or older) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies, we expanded it to include a house-based case-control component assessing in-house clustering and other variables potentially associated with infection. We selected houses where exactly two study participants lived and were both seropositive (case-houses), and matched 1:1 to control-houses where both were seronegative. Younger household members had an antibody test performed. Infected household members were found in 33 (92%) case-houses and in only six (17%) control-houses. In 28/29 discordant house pairs, the case-house had seropositive household members and the control-house did not (odds ratio: 28; 95% CI: 4.6-1,144). Our data demonstrate strong in-house clustering of infection in community settings, stressing the importance of early case ascertainment and isolation for SARS-CoV-2 control.","Del Brutto, Oscar H; Costa, Aldo F; Mera, Robertino M; Recalde, Bettsy Y; Bustos, Javier A; García, Héctor H",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,58

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted training programs designed to accomplish this goal, including the Humanitarian Response Intensive Course, which includes a three-day immersive simulation to prepare humanitarian workers for future field work. To provide program continuity, the three day simulation was quickly adapted to a virtual format using a combination of video conferencing, short messaging service, and cloud-based file storage software. Participants were geographically dispersed and participated virtually. Learning objectives were preserved while some components not amenable to a virtual format were removed.A virtual humanitarian training simulation is a feasible, acceptable, and affordable alternative to an in-person simulation. Participants were engaged and experienced minimal technological disruptions. The majority of students felt the format met or exceeded expectations. However, feedback also emphasized the importance of providing sufficient time for team collaboration and deliverable preparation in the simulation schedule. The virtual format was more affordable than the traditional in-person simulation and diverse expert faculty who could not have attended in-person were able to participate. This format could be used to overcome other barriers to in-person simulation training, including geographic, financial, time, or security.","Kivlehan, Sean M; Tenney, Kathryne; Plasmati, Sam; Bollettino, Vincenzo; Farineau, Katie; Nilles, Eric J; Gottlieb, Greg; Kayden, Stephanie R",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,58

419180,Smart cities for emergency management,2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created unprecedented medical challenges. There remains a need for validated risk prediction models to assess short-term mortality risk among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a 7-day and 14-day mortality risk prediction model for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study with a separate multicenter cohort for external validation using two hospitals in New York, NY, and 9 hospitals in Massachusetts, respectively. A total of 664 patients in NY and 265 patients with COVID-19 in Massachusetts, hospitalized from March to April 2020. RESULTS: We developed a risk model consisting of patient age, hypoxia severity, mean arterial pressure and presence of kidney dysfunction at hospital presentation. Multivariable regression model was based on risk factors selected from univariable and Chi-squared automatic interaction detection analyses. Validation was by receiver operating characteristic curve (discrimination) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit (GOF) test (calibration). In internal cross-validation, prediction of 7-day mortality had an AUC of 0.86 (95%CI 0.74-0.98; GOF p = 0.744); while 14-day had an AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.69-0.97; GOF p = 0.588). External validation was achieved using 265 patients from an outside cohort and confirmed 7- and 14-day mortality prediction performance with an AUC of 0.85 (95%CI 0.78-0.92; GOF p = 0.340) and 0.83 (95%CI 0.76-0.89; GOF p = 0.471) respectively, along with excellent calibration. Retrospective data collection, short follow-up time, and development in COVID-19 epicenter may limit model generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-AID risk tool is a well-calibrated model that demonstrates accuracy in the prediction of both 7-day and 14-day mortality risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This prediction score could assist with resource utilization, patient and caregiver education, and provide a risk stratification instrument for future research trials.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Sharaiha, Reem Z; Kumar, Sonal; Krisko, Tibor; Skaf, Daniel; Ang, Bryan; Redd, Walker D; Zhou, Joyce C; Hathorn, Kelly E; McCarty, Thomas R; Bazarbashi, Ahmad Najdat; Njie, Cheikh; Wong, Danny; Shen, Lin; Sholle, Evan; Cohen, David E; Brown, Robert S; Chan, Walter W; Fortune, Brett E",PLoS One,,58

419294,Optimized data storage method for sharding-based blockchain,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, infection among health-care professionals and in the context of welfare and health-care facilities was a significant concern. It is known that the elderly or those with concomitant pathologies are at greater risk of a serious evolution of the disease if affected by COVID-19 and that health workers are a category with greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until now, there has been little information on the epidemiological features and transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak which did not involve health-care professionals or social and health-care facilities. For this reason, this paper aims to describe the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population outside these semi-closed communities. METHODS: The study was designed by analyzing the data of the 1371 SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects observed in Sardinia up to 9 July, 2020 and whose data were available in the public health department. Statistical analysis and graphic representation were performed using STATA and Adobe Illustrator, respectively. RESULTS: Of the positive cases analyzed, 323 (23.5%) are health-care workers and 563 (41.1%) reside in social or health-care facilities. The number of positive cases among the general population (subjects who do not belong to these semi-closed communities), is 399 (29.1%), 208 females and 191 males. The estimated Case Fatality Rate stands at 5.0%, which is almost half the rate reported for all the SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (9.8%). The geographical distribution of positive cases differs considerably from the distribution of the totality of cases in Sardinia. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides an insight into the COVID-19 situation in the general community, ie not involving health-care professionals or social and health-care facilities. Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak outside of these semi-closed communities would provide appropriate information to guide intervention policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the vulnerability of our health-care system. Severe disruptions in care, medicine shortages and unequal access to health-care are but a few examples of the challenges faced by people living in Italy and Europe, highlighting the importance of evidence-based approaches in supporting the development of prevention and response strategies for future pandemics.","Deiana, Giovanna; Azara, Antonio; Dettori, Marco; Delogu, Fiorenzo; Vargiu, Gavino; Gessa, Isabella; Arghittu, Antonella; Tidore, Marcello; Steri, Giorgio; Castiglia, Paolo",BMC Public Health,,58

DESIGN: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was sent to patients who attended a large university-affiliated infertility practice in the USA between 1 January 2019 and 1 April 2020. At three different time-points respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of 10 commonly reported life stressors. RESULTS: The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients, with 3604 responses (response rate 34%) received. A total of 2202 non-pregnant female respondents were included in the final analysis. One-third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one-quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking antidepressant medications. At all three time-points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor among the respondents in early March but, at the time of writing, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66%, respectively). A total of 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Despite the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19, causing economic and societal uncertainty, the stress of infertility remains significant and is comparable a stressor to the pandemic itself.","Vaughan, Denis A; Shah, Jaimin S; Penzias, Alan S; Domar, Alice D; Toth, Thomas L",Reprod Biomed Online,,58

Emergency departments (EDs) are at high risk of facing unusual situations and need to prepare extensively in order to minimize risks to health care providers (HCPs) and patients. In situ simulation is a well-known method used in training to detect system gaps that could threaten safety. STUDY OBJECTIVES: One objective is to identify gaps, test hospital systems, and inform necessary modifications to the standard processes required by patients with COVID-19 presenting at the hospital. The other objective is to improve ED staff confidence in managing such patients, and to increase their skills in basic and advanced airway management and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) techniques. METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental study in which 20 unannounced mock codes were carried out in ED resuscitation and isolation rooms. A checklist was designed, validated, and used to evaluate team performances in three areas: donning, basic and advanced airway skills, and doffing. A pre- and post-intervention survey was used to evaluate staff members' perceived knowledge of ED procedures related to COVID-19 and their airway management skills. RESULTS: A total of 20 mock codes were conducted in the ED. Overall, 16 issues that posed potential harm to staff or patients were identified and prioritized for immediate resolution. Approximately 57.4% of HCPs felt comfortable dealing with suspected/confirmed, unstable COVID-19 cases after mock codes, compared with 33.3% beforehand (P = .033). Of ED HCPs, 44.4% felt comfortable performing airway procedures for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases after mock codes compared with 29.6% beforehand. Performance of different skills was observed to be variable following the 20 mock codes. Skills with improved performance included: request of chest x-ray after intubation (88.0%), intubation done by the most experienced ED physician (84.5%), and correct sequence and procedure of PPE (79.0%). CONCLUSION: Mock codes identified significant defects, most of which were easily fixed. They included critical equipment availability, transporting beds that were too large to fit through doors, and location of biohazard bins. Repeated mock codes improved ED staff confidence in dealing with patients, in addition to performance of certain skills. In situ simulation proves to be an effective method for increasing the readiness of the ED to address the COVID-19 pandemic and other infection outbreaks.","Aljahany, Muna; Alassaf, Wajdan; Alibrahim, Ahmed A; Kentab, Osama; Alotaibi, Abdullah; Alresseeni, Abdulaziz; Algarni, Abdulaziz; Algaeed, Hamad A; Aljaber, Mohammed I; Alruwaili, Badriyah; Aljohani, Khalid",Prehosp Disaster Med,,58

Chronic hyperglycaemia negatively affects the immune system, which triggers an increase of morbidity and mortality for viral infections. A key aspect of COVID-19 resides in the involvement of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system that causes a cascade of reactions mediated by vasoactive peptides with implications in vasoconstriction, vascular permeability, oxidative stress remodelling and tissue injuries. Activation of RAAS at pulmonary level, is responsible for the local damage.

While certain medications initially garnered attention as potential treatment options, further studies failed to demonstrate great promise but did demonstrate the need to reduce the cytokine storm experienced by patients with this potentially life-threatening virus. Unfortunately, there is no cure on the horizon, but members of the medical community are beginning to evaluate the potential role of vitamins and supplements as potential treatment options or addition to other treatments. The goal of this narrative review is to evaluate current and ongoing clinical trials of vitamins and supplements, alone or in combination with each other or other therapies, for the treatment of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).","Michienzi, Sarah M.; Badowski, Melissa E.",Drugs Context,,58
427475,Tax support during coronavirus crisis: Whom to help?,2021,"BACKGROUND: For more than a year, health systems all over the world have been combating the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first described in the city of Wuhan in China, presenting as an atypical infection of the lower respiratory tract. METHODS: COVID-19 is characterized by multisystemic involvement, and mortality is attributed mainly to the respiratory system involvement, which may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. Several COVID-19-associated complications are being increasingly reported, including arterial and venous thromboembolic events that may lead to amputation of the affected limbs. So far, a large number of reports have described hypercoagulability crises leading to amputation of the lower limbs. However, a search of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE) revealed no cases of urgent upper limb amputation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: This article describes a novel case of upper limb ischemia in a COVID-19 patient, with rapid progression to hand necrosis, requiring urgent through-arm amputation of the upper limb. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need for anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients and to maintain a constant awareness of the possible thromboembolic COVID-19-related sequelae.","Makhoul, Kamal; Shukha, Yousef; Hanna, Lana Abu; Nitecki, Samy; Leiderman, Maxim; Hayek, Tony; Hamoud, Shadi",Int J Infect Dis,,58

The strain was red-colored, and catalase- and oxidase-positive. Strain CUG 91378 T was able to grow at 15-37 °C (optimum, 28 °C), pH 7-9 (pH 7.0) and in the presence of up to 3.0% (w/v) NaCl (0-2%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain CUG 91378 T formed a well-supported monophyletic clade with Aquiflexum balticum DSM 16537 T (95.4%) and Aquiflexum aquatile Z0201T (93.2%). The DNA G + C content of CUG 91378 T was 39.0%. Low (< 87%) average nucleotide identity (ANI) and (< 26%) digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were observed between strain CUG 91378 T and its closest species on the phylogenetic trees. The sole respiratory quinone of strain CUG 91378 T was MK-7. The predominant fatty acids (> 5.0%) were iso-C15:0 (19.1%), iso-C16:0 (12.0%), iso-C16:1 H (10.9%), iso-C16:0 3OH (9.2%), iso-C17:0 3OH (7.7%), C17:1&#969;6c (6.1%) and anteiso-C15:0 (5.8%). Strain CUG 91378 T contained as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and four unidentified lipids (L1, L2, L3 and L4). Based on the data from the current polyphasic study, the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Aquiflexum for which the name Aquiflexum lacus is proposed. The type strain of the proposed new taxon is CUG 91378 T (= KCTC 62637 T = CGMCC 1.13988 T).","Huang, Jianrong; Han, Mingxian; Fang, Baozhu; Yang, Jian; Xiao, Haiyi; Zhang, Xiying; Han, Jibin; Yu, Dongmei; Jiang, Hongchen; Li, Wenjun",Arch. microbiol,,58
428543,"Finding Meaning in Hell. The Role of Meaning, Religiosity and Spirituality in Posttraumatic Growth During the Coronavirus Crisis in Spain",2020,"The Amazonas was one of the most heavily affected Brazilian states by the COVID-19 epidemic. Despite a large number of infected people, particularly during the second wave associated with the spread of the Variant of Concern (VOC) Gamma (lineage P.1), SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate in the Amazonas. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 persisted in a human population with a high immunity barrier, we generated 1,188 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from individuals diagnosed in the Amazonas state from 1st January to 6th July 2021, of which 38 were vaccine breakthrough infections. Our study reveals a sharp increase in the relative prevalence of Gamma plus (P.1+) variants, designated as Pango Lineages P.1.3 to P.1.6, harboring two types of additional Spike changes: deletions in the N-terminal (NTD) domain (particularly{Delta} 144 or{Delta} 141-144) associated with resistance to anti-NTD neutralizing antibodies or mutations at the S1/S2 junction (N679K or P681H) that probably enhance the binding affinity to the furin cleavage site, as suggested by our molecular dynamics simulations. As lineages P.1.4 (S:N679K) and P.1.6 (S:P681H) expanded (Re > 1) from March to July 2021, the lineage P.1 declined (Re < 1) and the median Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Amazonas significantly decreases. Still, we found no overrepresentation of P.1+ variants among breakthrough cases of fully vaccinated patients (71%) in comparison to unvaccinated individuals (93%). This evidence supports that the ongoing endemic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Amazonas is driven by the spread of new local Gamma/P.1 sub-lineages that are more transmissible, although not more efficient to evade vaccine-elicited immunity than the parental VOC. Finally, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread in human populations with a declining density of susceptible hosts, the risk of selecting new variants with higher infectivity are expected to increase.","Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Nascimento, Valdinete; Souza, Victor; Corado, André Lima; Nascimento, Fernanda; Silva, George; Mejía, Matilde Contreras; Brandão, Maria Júlia; Costa, Ágatha; Duarte, Débora; Pessoa, Karina; Jesus, Michele; Gonçalves, Luciana; Fernandes, Cristiano; Mattos, Tirza; Abdalla, Ligia; Santos, João Hugo; Martins, Alex; Chui, Fabiola Mendonça; Val, Fernando Fonseca; Melo, Gisely Cardoso de; Simão, Mariana Xavier; Sampaio, Vanderson de Souza; Mourão, Maria Paula; Lacerda, Marcus Vinícius; Batista, Érika Lopes; Magalhães, Alessandro Leonardo; Dábilla, Nathânia; Pereira, Lucas Carlos Gomes; Vinhal, Fernando; Miyajima, Fabio; Dias, Fernando Stehling; Santos, Eduardo Ruback dos; Coêlho, Danilo; Ferraz, Matheus; Lins, Roberto; Wallau, Gabriel Luz; Delatorre, Edson; Gräf, Tiago; Siqueira, Marilda Mendonça; Resende, Paola Cristina; Bello, Gonzalo",,,58

These behaviors are often argued to be pro-social, where one must incur private cost to benefit or protect others. Using self-reported data across India (n=934) through online survey, we assess if changes in perceived community compliance can predict changes in individual compliance behavior, controlling for the potential confounders. We observe statistically significant and positive relationship between the two, even after accounting for omitted variable bias, plausibly allowing us to view the results from a plausible causal lens. Further, we find subsequent lockdowns such as the ones imposed in India, have a detrimental effect on individual compliance though the gains from higher perceived community compliance seems to offset this loss. We also find that sensitization through community can be particularly effective for people with pre-existing co-morbidities. Our findings underscore the need for multi-level behavioral interventions involving local actors and community institutions to sustain private compliance during the pandemic.","Das, Upasak; Sarkhel, Prasenjit; Ashraf, Sania",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12350v1.pdf,58

In this paper, as part of the SemEval-2021 Task 9, we tackle the problem of fact verification and evidence finding over tabular data. There are two subtasks. Given a table and a statement/fact, subtask A determines whether the statement is inferred from the tabular data, and subtask B determines which cells in the table provide evidence for the former subtask. We make a comparison of the baselines and state-of-the-art approaches over the given SemTabFact dataset. We also propose a novel approach CellBERT to solve evidence finding as a form of the Natural Language Inference task.

429745,Clean or renewable – hydrogen and power-to-gas in EU energy law,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., African-American or Hispanic communities were disproportionately impacted. To better understand the epidemiology and relative effects of COVID-19 among hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared individual and census-tract level characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to those diagnosed with influenza, another viral infection with respiratory transmission. We evaluated temporal changes in epidemiology related to a shelter-in-place mandate. METHODS: We evaluated patients hospitalized at Cook County Health, the safety-net health system for the Chicago metropolitan area. Among self-identified hospitalized Hispanic patients, we compared those with influenza (2019-2020 season) to COVID-19 infection during March 16, 2020-May 11, 2020. We used multivariable analysis to identify differences in individual and census-tract level characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, COVID-19 rapidly increased among Hispanics during promotion of social-distancing policies. Whereas non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be hospitalized for influenza, Hispanic patients predominated among COVID-19 infections (40% relative increase compared to influenza). In the comparative analysis of influenza and COVID-19, Hispanic patients with COVID-19 were more likely to reside in census tracts with higher proportions of residents with the following characteristics: Hispanic; no high school diploma; non-US citizen; limited English speaking ability; employed in manufacturing or construction; and overcrowding. By multivariable analysis, Hispanic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza were more likely to be male (adjusted OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9), obese (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5 to 4.2), or reside in a census tract with &#8805;40% of residents without a high-school diploma (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and disproportionate increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations among Hispanics after the shelter-in-place mandate indicates that public health strategies were inadequate in protecting this population-in particular, for those residing in neighborhoods with lower levels of educational attainment.","Trick, William E; Badri, Sheila; Doshi, Kruti; Zhang, Huiyuan; Rezai, Katayoun; Hoffman, Michael J; Weinstein, Robert A",PLoS One,,58

From that date, the Regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Trust (AREU) of the Lombardy region decided to apply Business Intelligence (BI) to the management of EMS during the epidemic. The aim of the study is to assess in this context the impact of BI on EMS management outcomes. METHODS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, AREU is using BI daily to track the number of first aid requests received from 112. BI analyses the number of requests that have been classified as respiratory and/or infectious episodes during the telephone dispatch interview. Moreover, BI allows identifying the numerical trend of episodes in each municipality (increasing, stable, decreasing). RESULTS: AREU decides to reallocate in the territory the resources based on real-time data recorded and elaborated by BI. Indeed, based on that data, the numbers of vehicles and personnel have been implemented in the municipalities that registered more episodes and where the clusters are supposed to be. BI has been of paramount importance in taking timely decisions on the management of EMS during COVID-19 outbreak. Conclusions: Even if there is little evidence-based literature focused on BI impact within the health care, this study suggests that BI can be usefully applied to promptly identify clusters and patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and, consequently, make informed decisions that can improve the EMS management response to the outbreak.","Sechi, Giuseppe Maria; Migliori, Maurizio; Dassi, Gabriele; Pagliosa, Andrea; Bonora, Rodolfo; Oradini-Alacreu, Aurea; Odone, Anna; Signorelli, Carlo; Zoli, Alberto; Response Team, Areu Covid-",Acta Biomed,,58

METHODS: A COVID-19 specific briefing and debriefing form was created and used in the OR along with the World Health Organization surgical safety checklist to reinforce the use of appropriate PPE. An audit was subsequently done to understand the compliance to PPE use, followed by a survey based on the findings of the audit to understand the issues related to noncompliance. RESULTS: The form was used in 183 out of the 238 (77%) surgeries performed during a months' time. The overall compliance for PPE usage was 96.3%. Noncompliance was seen most often for eye protection (45/567) (P = .01). The survey revealed that this was mostly among surgeons mainly due to discomfort, poor visibility, and frequent fogging. CONCLUSIONS: Our HCW were adapting well to the new normal of donning appropriate PPE in the OR, except for the eye protection due to discomfort and visibility related issues.

433247,A Revised Grey Relational Analysis Method for Multicriteria Group Decision-Making with Expected Utility Theory for Oil Spill Emergency Management,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally. In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. METHODS: Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the 'lockdown' period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. RESULTS: Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. DISCUSSION: Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.","Olding, James; Zisman, Sophia; Olding, Carole; Fan, Kathleen",Surg.

By inhibition of the IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab may help to mitigate the hyperinflammatory response associated with progressive respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted on hospitalized adults who received intravenous tocilizumab for COVID-19 between March 23, 2020 and April 10, 2020. RESULTS: Most patients were male (66.7%), Hispanic (63.3%) or Black (23.3%), with a median age of 54 years. Tocilizumab was administered at a median of 8 days (range 1-21) after initial symptoms and 2 days (range 0-12) after hospital admission. Within 30 days from receiving tocilizumab, 36 patients (60.0%) demonstrated clinical improvement, 9 (15.0%) died, 33 (55.0%) were discharged alive, and 18 (30.0%) remained hospitalized. Successful extubation occurred in 13 out of 29 patients (44.8%). Infectious complications occurred in 16 patients (26.7%) at a median of 10.5 days. After tocilizumab was administered, there was a slight increase in PaO2/FiO2 and an initial reduction in CRP, but this effect was not sustained beyond day 10. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement and were successfully discharged alive from the hospital after receiving tocilizumab. We observed a rebound effect with CRP, which may suggest the need for higher or subsequent doses to adequately manage cytokine storm. Based on our findings, we believe that tocilizumab may have a role in the early treatment of COVID-19, however larger randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm this.","Vu, Christine A; DeRonde, Kailynn J; Vega, Ana D; Maxam, Meshell; Holt, Gregory; Natori, Yoichiro; Zamora, Jose Gonzales; Salazar, Veronica; Boatwright, Renata; Morris, Stephen R; de Lima Corvino, Daniela; Betances, Anmary Fernandez; Colucci, Leah; Keegan, James; Lopez, Andy; Rezk, Andrew Hany; Rodriguez, Yvette; Moraru, Gabriela M; Doblecki, Susanne; De La Zerda, David J; Abbo, Lilian M",BMC Infect Dis,,58

Despite this, Italy has suffered a huge human and social cost, especially in Lombardy. The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to investigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression approach; and ii) second, to build a ""taxonomy"" of provinces with similar mortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward's hierarchical agglomerative clustering method. I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution, climatic conditions, demographic variables, and three ad hoc indexes that represent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall health care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce the CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density, air pollutants concentrations (NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity, COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of health system saturation were positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social vertical integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular, the risk of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a three-fold greater risk than the 80-to-89 years old and four-fold greater risk than 70-to-79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that the highest mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest risk was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and health system saturation indexes played the most important role in explaining the CFR variability, a significant part of the latter may have been caused by the massive stress of the Italian health system.","Perone, Gaetano",Sci Total Environ,,58

Meanwhile, the manifestations of COVID-19 as seen through computed tomography (CT) imaging show individual characteristics that differ from those of other types of viral pneumonia such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia (IAVP). This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from IAVP and healthy cases through pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. A total of 618 CT samples were collected: 219 samples from 110 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 50 years; 63 (57.3%) male patients); 224 samples from 224 patients with IAVP (mean age 61 years; 156 (69.6%) male patients); and 175 samples from 175 healthy cases (mean age 39 years; 97 (55.4%) male patients). All CT samples were contributed from three COVID-19-designated hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China. First, the candidate infection regions were segmented out from the pulmonary CT image set using a 3D deep learning model. These separated images were then categorized into the COVID-19, IAVP, and irrelevant to infection (ITI) groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores, using a location-attention classification model. Finally, the infection type and overall confidence score for each CT case were calculated using the Noisy-or Bayesian function. The experimental result of the benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy rate was 86.7% in terms of all the CT cases taken together. The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID-19 patients and were demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.","Xu, Xiaowei; Jiang, Xiangao; Ma, Chunlian; Du, Peng; Li, Xukun; Lv, Shuangzhi; Yu, Liang; Ni, Qin; Chen, Yanfei; Su, Junwei; Lang, Guanjing; Li, Yongtao; Zhao, Hong; Liu, Jun; Xu, Kaijin; Ruan, Lingxiang; Sheng, Jifang; Qiu, Yunqing; Wu, Wei; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan",,,58

In all 7 patients with COVID-19, ground-glass opacity (GGO) was found in the HRCT images, mainly distributed in the subpleural region of the lungs. The HRCT scans of 6 patients showed bilateral lobar lesions, with mainly peripheral subpleural distribution; 1 patient, instead, showed unilateral lobar involvement. The right lung was more extensively involved than the left lung in 6 patients, and the lower lobe was more extensively involved than the upper lobe in 5 patients. The initial chest HRCT images of the lungs of the analyzed COVID-19 patients had specific characteristics. The typical manifestation at both lungs was an extensive GGO-type infiltrate, with thickened vascular bundles and focal center consolidation. Pleural effusion, bilateral hilar, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy were rare.","Huang, Jie; Ding, Jianping",Jpn J Infect Dis,,58

Potentially, reduced out-of-home mobility and lower activity levels among older people may lower their quality of life (QOL). We studied cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of and changes in life-space mobility, active ageing and QOL during COVID-19 social distancing compared to two years before. METHODS: Altogether 809 community-living participants initially aged 75, 80 or 85 years of our active aging study (AGNES) conducted in 2017-2018 took part in the current AGNES-COVID-19 survey in May and June 2020. Outdoor mobility was assessed with the Life-Space Assessment (range 0-120). Active approach to life was assessed with the University of Jyväskylä Active Aging Scale (range 0-272), and QOL with the shortened Older People's Quality of Life Questionnaire (range13-65; higher scores better for all). Data were analyzed with General Estimating Equations, General Linear Models, and Oneway-ANOVA. RESULTS: Life-space mobility (B -10.8, SE 0.75, p<0.001), the active ageing score (B -24.1, SE 0.88, p<0.001) and the QOL score (B -1.65, SE 0.21, p<0.001) were lower during COVID-19 social distancing vs. two years before. Concurrent life-space mobility and active ageing scores, age and sex explained 48% of QOL at the baseline and 42% during social distancing. Longitudinally, steeper declines in all three variables coincided. CONCLUSIONS: The observed declines indicate compliance with social distancing recommendation, but underline the importance of participation in meaningful life situations as a factor underlying good QOL also during COVID-19 pandemic.","Rantanen, Taina; Eronen, Johanna; Kauppinen, Markku; Kokko, Katja; Sanaslahti, Sini; Kajan, Niina; Portegijs, Erja","J. gerontol.

440219,Cuckoo optimization algorithm in reverse logistics: A network design for COVID-19 waste management,2021,"Successful containment of the Coronavirus pandemic rests on the ability to quickly and reliably identify those who have been in close proximity to a contagious individual. Existing tools for doing so rely on the collection of exact location information of individuals over lengthy time periods, and combining this information with other personal information. This unprecedented encroachment on individual privacy at national scales has created an outcry and risks rejection of these tools. We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing fine-grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of an infected individual. Crucially, this is done while preserving the anonymity of all individuals, and without collecting or storing any personal information or location history. Our approach is based on using short-range communication mechanisms, like Bluetooth, that are available in all modern cell phones. It can be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low false-positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a number of extensions and tradeoffs. We believe that the privacy guarantees provided by the scheme will encourage quick and broad voluntary adoption. When combined with sufficient testing capacity and existing best practices from healthcare professionals, we hope that this may significantly reduce the infection rate.","Canetti, Ran; Trachtenberg, Ari; Varia, Mayank",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13670v4.pdf,58
441125,Real-Time Maintaining of Social Distance in Covid-19 Environment using Image Processing and Big Data,2020,"ObjectivesAustralias public health restrictions ( lockdown) in 2020 successfully contained the spread of COVID-19. These included a national initial lockdown (March-May), and ongoing lockdown (July-November) for metropolitan Victorian residents only. Australias experience offers an opportunity to assess impacts of lockdown on families with children, in the relative absence of disease morbidity and mortality. This study (1) described the experience of initial lockdown and (2) evaluated the impact of ongoing lockdown, on family finances and mental health. MethodsData were drawn from the June and September 2020 Royal Childrens Hospital National Child Health Polls. Caregivers of children from the states of Victoria and New South Wales reported on job/income loss; material deprivation (inability to pay for essential items); income-poverty; mental health (Kessler-6); impact on caregiver/child mental health; and caregiver/child coping. Data from N=1207/902 caregivers in June/September were analyzed; Aim (1) with weighted descriptives; Aim (2) with Difference-in-Difference adjusted linear regression models (New South Wales provided the comparator). ResultsFollowing initial lockdown, one-quarter of families reported job/income loss; one-third reported material deprivation. Negative impacts on mental health were reported for half the caregivers and one-third of children. Few caregivers or children had difficulties coping. During Victorias ongoing lockdown, job/income loss increased by 11% (95%CI: 3-18%); Kessler-6 poor mental health by 6% (95%CI: 0.3-12%) and negative mental health impacts by 12% for caregivers (95%CI: 6-23%) and 14% for children (95%CI: 4-20%). Female (versus male) caregivers, metropolitan (versus regional/rural) families, and families with elementary school-aged children (versus pre-/high-school) were most affected. ConclusionsOngoing lockdown had negative impacts on mental health, employment, and income, but not deprivation or poverty, likely because of the government income supplements introduced early in the pandemic. Balancing the benefits and harms of lockdown requires planned responses to outbreaks, and evidence-informed financial and mental health supports.","Price, Anna; Contreras-Suárez, Diana; Zhu, Anna; Schreurs, Natalie; Measey, Mary-Anne; Woolfenden, Susan; Burley, Jade; Bryson, Hannah; Efron, Daryl; Rhodes, Anthea; Goldfeld, Sharon",,,58

While these studies have explored a variety of modeling techniques, none have used empirical data. MethodsHere, we use an empirical proximity network of college freshmen, ascertained using smartphone Bluetooth, to simulate the spread of the virus. We investigate the role of immunization, testing, isolation, mask wearing, and social distancing in the presence of implementation challenges and imperfect compliance. ResultsWe show that while frequent testing can drastically reduce spread if immunity levels are low, its effects are limited if immunity is more ubiquitous. Furthermore, while moderate levels of mask wearing and social distancing can offer additional reductions in cumulative incidence, their benefit declines rapidly as immunity and testing frequency increase. However, if immunity from vaccination is imperfect or declines over time, scenarios not studied here, frequent testing and other interventions may play a more central role. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that while regular testing and isolation are powerful tools, they have limited benefit if immunity is high or other interventions are widely adopted. If universities can attain even moderate levels of vaccination, masking, and social distancing, they may be able to relax testing frequency to once every four weeks.","Hambridge, Hali L.; Kahn, Rebecca Onnela Jukka-Pekka",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,,58

It is therefore necessary to explore biomarkers to determine the extent of lung lesions and disease severity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the usefulness of CRP levels in the early stage of COVID-19 and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation. METHODS: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. RESULT: CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test=-2.647, -2.171, PË0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test=0.693, -2.177, PË0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test=-0.068, -1.549, PË0.05). The difference was statistically significant. CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient=0.873, 0.734, PË0.001). CONCLUSION: In the early stage of COVID-19 CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.","Wang, L",Med Mal Infect,,58

444156,"Empathic media, emotions and gamification: from the Fourth Industrial Revolution to the postpandemic society",2020,"Evidence suggests that emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, originate from wildlife species, and that land-use change is an important pathway for pathogen transmission to humans. We first focus on zoonotic disease spillover and the rate at which primary human cases appear, demonstrating that a potential outbreak is directly related to the area of wildlife habitat. We then develop a model of the costs and benefits of land conversion that includes the effect of habitat size on the risk of disease outbreak. Our model and numerical simulations show that incorporating this risk requires more wildlife habitat conservation in the long run, and how much more should be conserved will depend on the initial habitat size. If the area is too small, then no conversion should take place. Any policy to control habitat loss, such as a tax imposed on the rents from converted land, should also vary with habitat area.","Barbier, Edward B",J Environ Econ Manage,,58

The novel process of triaging emergency ophthalmology patients via videoconsultations should reduce hospital attendances. However, the safety profile of such services were unknown. Methods: in this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed case notes of 404 adults who used our videoconsultation service from 20/04/2020 to 03/05/2020. We compared these to 451 patient who attended eye casualty in person at the same time who were deemed not to require same day ophthalmic examination. Findings: patients seen by videoconsultations tended to be younger (Median = 43 years, Inter-quartile range = 27 vs Median= 49 years, Inter-quartile range = 28)'. More males used the face-to-face triage (55%) while more females used videoconsultation (54%)%. Fewer patients seen by videoconsultations required specialist review compared to face-face triage [X 2 (1, N = 854) = 128.02, p<0.001)]. 35.5% of the patients initially seen by videoconsultation had unplanned reattendance within 1 month, compared to 15.7% in the group initially seen in person. X 2 (1, N = 234) = 7.31, p = 0.007). The rate of actual harm was no different (at 0% for each method), with perfect inter-grader correlation when graded independently by two senior ophthalmologists. 97% of patients seen on the video platform surveyed were satisfied with their care. Interpretation: we demonstrate comparable patient safety of videoconsultations at one-month follow-up to in person review. The service is acceptable to patients and reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We propose that videoconsultations are effective and desirable as a tool for triage in ophthalmology.

This surveillance activity was established as part of the National Pandemic Health Intelligence Plan. METHODS: Participants (n = 3037) were recruited from 11 public and private hospitals in four states (NSW, Vic, SA and WA) between 2 June and 17 July 2020, with an overall 66% participation rate. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was assessed by Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs taken after induction of anaesthesia. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed by analysis of serum collected at the same time using a novel dual-antigen ELISA assay. RESULTS: No patient (0/3010) returned a positive RT-PCR result. The Bayesian estimated prevalence of active infection of 0.02% (95% probability interval 0.00-0.11%), with the upper endpoint being 1 in 918. Positive serology (IgG) was observed in 15 of 2991 patients, with a strong positive in five of those individuals (Bayesian estimated seroprevalence 0.16%; 95% probability interval 0.00-0.47%). CONCLUSION: These results confirm that during periods of low community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 elective surgery patients without fever or respiratory symptoms had a very low prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Coatsworth, Nicholas; Myles, Paul S; Mann, Graham J; Cockburn, Ian A; Forbes, Andrew B; Gardiner, Elizabeth E; Lum, Gary; Cheng, Allen C; Gruen, Russell L",ANZ J Surg,,58

Following an unprecedented global spread3, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Although data on COVID-19 in humans are emerging at a steady pace, some aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can be studied in detail only in animal models, in which repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory disease in rhesus macaques that lasts between 8 and 16 days. Pulmonary infiltrates, which are a hallmark of COVID-19 in humans, were visible in lung radiographs. We detected high viral loads in swabs from the nose and throat of all of the macaques, as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one macaque, we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates the moderate disease that has been observed in the majority of human cases of COVID-19. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, and aid in the development and testing of medical countermeasures.","Munster, Vincent J; Feldmann, Friederike; Williamson, Brandi N; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Schulz, Jonathan; Meade-White, Kimberly; Okumura, Atsushi; Callison, Julie; Brumbaugh, Beniah; Avanzato, Victoria A; Rosenke, Rebecca; Hanley, Patrick W; Saturday, Greg; Scott, Dana; Fischer, Elizabeth R; de Wit, Emmie",Nature,,58

We have adopted a modified version of the NCCN distress thermometer. We questioned if this modified DT (m-DT) could be utilized for measuring the prevalence of psychological distress among COVID-19 patients. Methods: The prospective study included 2 phases;modification of the original DT and its associated problem list (PL), and evaluation of this m-DT in measuring the prevalence of psychological distress among COVID-19 patients. Egyptian adult subjects with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 at 2 University Hospitals were enrolled. Binary logistic regression tests were carried out to explore the association between the m-DT cut-off scores of 4 and the clinical variables. Results: One hundred sixty-nine (60.4%) patients experienced significant distress (m-DT cut off score &gt;=4). Logistic regression showed that occupation, presence of special habits, length of quarantine time, worry, cough, shortness of breath, and fever, were independent factors associated with significant distress in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: With the modified distress thermometer (m-DT), 60% of Egyptian COVID-19 patients experienced significant distress. This distress was significantly related to age, marital status, occupation, presence or absence of special habits, and length of the quarantine time. With m-DT, the current study had identified worry, being a health-care worker, shortness of breath, fever, length of quarantine time, presence of special habits, and cough as independent factors associated with significant distress in COVID-19 patients.

450551,"Evaluation of the online teaching of architectural design and basic design courses case study: College of Architecture at JUST, Jordan",2020,"We propose a new method in which a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to quantify the uncertainty of forward simulations in the presence of observed data. Previously, a method has been developed which enables GANs to make time series predictions and data assimilation by training a GAN with unconditional simulations of a high-fidelity numerical model. After training, the GAN can be used to predict the evolution of the spatial distribution of the simulation states and observed data is assimilated. In this paper, we describe the process required in order to quantify uncertainty, during which no additional simulations of the high-fidelity numerical model are required. These methods take advantage of the adjoint-like capabilities of generative models and the ability to simulate forwards and backwards in time. Set within a reduced-order model framework for efficiency, we apply these methods to a compartmental model in epidemiology to predict the spread of COVID-19 in an idealised town. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently quantify uncertainty in the presence of measurements using only unconditional simulations of the high-fidelity numerical model.","Silva, Vinicius L.

Studies distinguishing post-COVID conditions from late conditions caused by other etiologies are lacking. Using data from a large administrative all-payer database, we assessed the type, association, and timing of post-COVID conditions following COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: Using the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) (release date, October 20, 2020) data, during March-June 2020, 27,589 inpatients and 46,857 outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 (case-patients) were 1:1 matched with patients without COVID-19 through the 4-month follow-up period (control-patients) by using propensity score matching. In this matched-cohort study, adjusted odds ratios were calculated to assess for late conditions that were more common in case-patients compared with control-patients. Incidence proportion was calculated for conditions that were more common in case-patients than control-patients during 31-120 days following a COVID-19 encounter. RESULTS: During 31-120 days after an initial COVID-19 inpatient hospitalization, 7.0% of adults experienced at least one of five post-COVID conditions. Among adult outpatients with COVID-19, 7.7% experienced at least one of ten post-COVID conditions. During 31-60 days after an initial outpatient encounter, adults with COVID-19 were 2.8 times as likely to experience acute pulmonary embolism as outpatient control-patients and were also more likely to experience a range of conditions affecting multiple body systems (e.g. nonspecific chest pain, fatigue, headache, and respiratory, nervous, circulatory, and gastrointestinal system symptoms) than outpatient control-patients.

To contribute to future COVID-19 countermeasures, we aimed at verifying the results of countermeasures achieved by public health centers (PHCs) against the first wave of COVID-19 in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. During January-May 2020, 1,253 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited for testing. Simultaneously, based on retrospective contact tracings, PHCs investigated the infection sources and transmission routes of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and tested 928 contacts. Consequently, 69 cases were confirmed during March 31 - May 4, 58 (84.1%; 95% confidence interval 75.5-92.7) of whom were found from contacts. The spread of infection was triggered by cases harboring epidemiological links outside of Yamagata. Then, the number of cases increased rapidly. However, PHCs identified epidemiological links in 61 (88.4%; 95% confidence interval 80.8-96.0) of the 69 cases and transmission chains up to the fifth generation. Finally, the spread of infection ended after approximately one month. Our results indicate that the identification of infection sources and active case finding from contacts based on retrospective contact tracing was likely to be an effective strategy to end the first wave of COVID-19 in Yamagata.","Seto, Junji; Aoki, Yoko; Komabayashi, Kenichi; Ikeda, Yoko; Sampei, Mika; Ogawa, Naomi; Uchiumi, Yumiko; Fujii, Shunji; Chiba, Masami; Suzuki, Emiko; Takahashi, Tatsuya; Yamada, Keiko; Otani, Yoshiko; Ashino, Yoshihiro; Araki, Kyoko; Kato, Takeo; Ishikawa, Hitoshi; Ikeda, Tatsuya; Abe, Hideaki; Ahiko, Tadayuki; Mizuta, Katsumi",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,58

Over a two-week period (16-30 March 2020), 150 cancer patients in Germany participated in this study. Validated instruments assessed demographic and medical data, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L). All instruments were adapted to measure the individual mental health before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were measured. Cancer patients showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Increased depression and generalized anxiety symptoms were predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and COVID-19-related fear predicted increases in distress. Higher subjective levels of information predicted less increasing anxiety symptoms and distress. Present data suggests that cancer patients experienced a significant increase in mental health burden since the COVID-19 outbreak. Observed predictors of mental health impairment and protective factors should be addressed, and appropriate interventions established, to maintain mental health of cancer patients during the pandemic.","Bäuerle, Alexander; Musche, Venja; Schmidt, Kira; Schweda, Adam; Fink, Madeleine; Weismüller, Benjamin; Kohler, Hannah; Herrmann, Ken; Tewes, Mitra; Schadendorf, Dirk; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Teufel, Martin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,58

This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the prevalence of zinc deficiency and COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population in the Asian and European countries. The COVID-19 data from two different time points, that is, May 30 and June 30, 2020 for the Asian population and May 15 and June 15, 2020 for the European population, were analyzed to determine the correlation with the estimated zinc deficiency for these two continents. The prevalence of zinc deficiency was about two times higher in the Asian population (mean 17.5%) than in the European population (mean 8.9%). A significant positive correlation (p < .05) was observed between the prevalence of zinc deficiency and COVID-19 cases at both time periods for the Asian population. However, the correlation between zinc deficiency prevalence and COVID-19 deaths was not significant in the Asian population. In contrast, a significant but negative correlation (p < .05 for all cases) was observed for zinc deficiency with both COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population at both time periods in the European countries. Considering the direct antiviral properties of zinc, it can be suggested that zinc supplementation may be beneficial for most of the population, especially older people and those who are at risk of COVID-19 infections. In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between individual zinc status and COVID-19 infections and mortality. Therefore, cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are required to test this hypothesis.","Ali, Nurshad; Fariha, Khandaker A; Islam, Farjana; Mohanto, Nayan C; Ahmad, Iftekhar; Hosen, Mohammad J; Ahmed, Shamim",J. med. virol,,58

458928,A deep learning-based social distance monitoring framework for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19 outbreak. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases, which may lead to increased mortality risk. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing. AIM: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19 lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used anonymised electronic health records and administrative data from the secure anonymised information linkage databank to create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to mortality data up to the 14th June 2020. METHODS: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age, gender, social economic status and prior health conditions. RESULTS: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and 14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1·72 (1·55, 1·90) compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2·15 (2·11,2·20) in 2016-2019 to 2·94 (2·81,3·08) in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of death in the 2020 study periods.","Hollinghurst, Joe; Lyons, Jane; Fry, Richard; Akbari, Ashley; Gravenor, Mike; Watkins, Alan; Verity, Fiona; Lyons, Ronan A",Age ageing,,58

Methods: We analyzed all patients undergoing PPCI <24 hours STEMI included in the prospective France PCI registry. The 2 groups were compared on mean monthly number of patients, delays in the pathway care, and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, stroke, and major bleeding). Results: From January 15, 2019 to April 14, 2020, 2064 STEMI patients undergoing PPCI were included: 1942 in the prelockdown group and 122 in the lockdown group. Only 2 cases in the lockdown group were positive for COVID-19. A significant drop (12%) in mean number of STEMI/month was observed in the lockdown group compared with prelockdown (139 vs 122, P < 0.04). A significant increase in ""symptom onset to first medical contact"" delay was found for patients who presented directly to the emergency department (ED) (238 minutes vs 450 minutes; P = 0.04). There were higher rates of in-hospital MACE (7.7% vs 12.3%; P = 0.06) and mortality (4.9% vs 8.2%; P = 0.11) in the lockdown group but the differences were not significant. Conclusion: According to the multicenter France PCI registry, the COVID-19 outbreak in France was associated with a significant decline in STEMI undergoing PPCI and longer transfer time for patients who presented directly to the ED.

The COVID-19 crisis, a public health emergency rather than one with immediate damage to the built environment, has affected many aspects of community life. Experiences in responding to the pandemic will likely stimulate fresh planning initiatives for public health emergencies. How then should emergency planners approach planning and response tasks? The All-Hazards approach has been a mainstay of both research and policymaking for over 40 years, but it has come under recent criticism. In this paper, we consider if the All-Hazards approach to disaster management is still viable. Comparing the management needs that emerged in the pandemic with those of disasters from more familiar hazard agents, we conclude that the All-Hazards approach is valid and can continue to guide policymakers in their hazard and disaster management activities.","Penta, Samantha; Kendra, James; Marlowe, Valerie; Gill, Kimberly",,,58

462272,The Benefits of a Hybrid Simulation Hub to Deal with Pandemics,2020,"Anosmia, a neuropathogenic condition of loss of smell, has been recognized as a key pathogenic hallmark of the current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection responsible for COVID-19. While the anosmia resulting from olfactory bulb (OB) pathology is the prominent clinical characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD), SARS-CoV-2 infection has been predicted as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinsonism-related symptoms in a significant portion of COVID-19 patients and survivors. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to alter the dopamine system and induce the loss of dopaminergic neurons that have been known to be the cause of PD. However, the underlying biological basis of anosmia and the potential link between COVID-19 and PD remains obscure. Ample experimental studies in rodents suggest that the occurrence of neural stem cell (NSC) mediated neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium (OE) and OB is important for olfaction. Though the occurrence of neurogenesis in the human forebrain has been a subject of debate, considerable experimental evidence strongly supports the incidence of neurogenesis in the human OB in adulthood. To note, various viral infections and neuropathogenic conditions including PD with olfactory dysfunctions have been characterized by impaired neurogenesis in OB and OE. Therefore, this article describes and examines the recent reports on SARS-CoV-2 mediated OB dysfunctions and defects in the dopaminergic system responsible for PD. Further, the article emphasizes that COVID-19 and PD associated anosmia could result from the regenerative failure in the replenishment of the dopaminergic neurons in OB and olfactory sensory neurons in OE.","Rethinavel, Harini Sri; Ravichandran, Sowbarnika; Radhakrishnan, Risna Kanjirassery; Kandasamy, Mahesh",J Chem Neuroanat,,58

METHOD: Individuals with T2DM who had at least one consultation in one of 940 general (including diabetologist) practices in Germany between January and July 2019 (N = 79 268) and between January and July 2020 (N = 85 046) were included. Therapy changes were defined as the prescription of new glucose-lowering drugs, with or without the discontinuation of previous treatments (therapy switch and add-on therapy, respectively). The number of T2DM patients with at least one medication regimen change was calculated for the periods 1 January to 14 March in 2019 and 2020, and for the periods 15 March to 31 July in 2019 and 2020. March 2020 corresponded to the beginning of the lockdown in Germany. RESULTS: Overall, there was a decrease in the number of patients with at least one medication regimen change in the period 15 March to 31 July 2019 compared with 15 March to 31 July 2020 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors: -15%; sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: -3%; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: 0%; other oral glucose-lowering drugs: -6%; and insulin: -21%).

Data were collected approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0-12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor's degree. 78% of parents said they were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = -.16, 95% CI = [-.29, -.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = -.37, 95% CI = [-.47, -.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = .17, 95% CI = [.06, .28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = .40, 95% CI = [.32, .48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation. Overall, study results suggested that parents' mental health may be an important factor linked to at-home education and child wellbeing during the pandemic.","Lee, Shawna J; Ward, Kaitlin P; Chang, Olivia D; Downing, Kasey M",Child Youth Serv Rev,,58

475738,Big Data Analytics + Virtual Clinical Semantic Network (vCSN): An Approach to Addressing the Increasing Clinical Nuances and Organ Involvement of COVID-19,2020,"Survivors from COVID-19 pneumonia can present with persisting multisystem involvement (lung, pulmonary vessels, heart, muscle, red blood cells) that may negatively affect exercise capacity. We sought to determine the extent and the determinants of exercise limitation in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital discharge. Eighteen consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 1:1 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched controls underwent: spirometry, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test and exercise echocardiography for the study of pulmonary circulation. Arterial blood was sampled at rest and during exercise in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 lie roughly on the same oxygen consumption isophlets than controls both at rest and during submaximal exercise, thanks to supernormal cardiac output (P < 0.05). Oxygen consumption at peak exercise was reduced by 30% in COVID-19 (P < 0.001), due to a peripheral extraction limit. In addition, within COVID-19 patients, hemoglobin content was associated with peak oxygen consumption (R2 = 0.46, P = 0.002). Respiratory reserve was not exhausted (median [IRQ], 0.59 [0.15]) in spite of moderate reduction of forced vital capacity (79 ± 40%). Pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise was not different between patients and controls. Ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide were higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls (39.5 [8.5] vs. 29.5 [8.8], P < 0.001), and such an increase was mainly explained by increased chemosensitivity. When recovering from COVID-19, patients present with reduced exercise capacity and augmented exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, including anemia and reduced oxygen extraction by peripheral muscles were the major determinants of deranged exercise physiology. Pulmonary vascular function seemed unaffected, despite restrictive lung changes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY At the time of hospital discharge, patients with COVID-19 present with reduced functional capacity and exercise hyperventilation. Peripheral factors, namely reduced oxygen extraction (myopathy) and anemia, which are not fully compensated by a supernormal cardiac output response, account for exercise limitation before exhaustion of the respiratory reserve. Enhanced chemoreflex sensitivity, rather increased dead space, mainly accounts for exercise hyperventilation. The pulmonary vascular response to exercise circulation of survived patients with COVID-19 does not present major pathological changes.","Baratto, Claudia; Caravita, Sergio; Faini, Andrea; Perego, Giovanni Battista; Senni, Michele; Badano, Luigi P; Parati, Gianfranco",J Appl Physiol (1985),,58

METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, Social Science Research Network, and Research Square databases (from December 1, 2019 to May 15, 2020) were searched to identify studies that reported the associations of CKD/AKI and disease severity/mortality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and meta-regression was performed. RESULTS: In total, 42 studies enrolling 8,932 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The quality of most included studies was moderate to high. Compared with patients without previously diagnosed CKD, those with CKD had a significantly increased risk of progressing to a severe condition (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.64-3.24) or death (OR 5.11, 95% CI 3.36-7.77). Similarly, compared with patients without AKI, those with AKI had a significantly increased risk of progressing to a severe condition (OR 11.88, 95% CI 9.29-15.19) or death (OR 30.46, 95% CI 18.33-50.59). Compared with patients with previously diagnosed CKD, those with AKI were more likely to progress to a severe condition (pgroup < 0.001, I2 = 98.3%) and even to death (pgroup < 0.001, I2 = 96.5%). Age had a significant impact on the association between CKD and disease severity (p = 0.001) but had no impact on the associations between AKI and disease severity (p = 0.80), between CKD and mortality (p = 0.51), or between AKI and mortality (p = 0.86). Four important complications (cardiac injury, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and liver injury) did not significantly affect the associations between CKD/AKI and disease severity/mortality, indicating that CKD/AKI may be independent clinical prognostic indicators for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients, CKD/AKI was associated with worse outcomes compared with those without CKD/AKI.

477082,"Privacy Digital Contact Tracing May Protect Privacy, But It Is Unlikely to Stop the Pandemic",2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the binding of viral S-protein (spike protein) to human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The structure of the ACE2-S-protein complex has been deciphered and we focused on the 27 ACE2 residues that bind to S-protein. From human sequence databases, we identified nine ACE2 variants at ACE2-S-protein binding sites. We used both experimental assays and protein structure analysis to evaluate the effect of each variant on the binding affinity of ACE2 to S-protein. We found one variant causing complete binding disruption, two and three variants, respectively, strongly and mildly reducing the binding affinity, and two variants strongly enhancing the binding affinity. We then collected the ACE2 gene sequences from 57 nonhuman primates. Among the 6 apes and 20 Old World monkeys (OWMs) studied, we found no new variants. In contrast, all 11 New World monkeys (NWMs) studied share four variants each causing a strong reduction in binding affinity, the Philippine tarsier also possesses three such variants, and 18 of the 19 prosimian species studied share one variant causing a strong reduction in binding affinity. Moreover, one OWM and three prosimian variants increased binding affinity by >50%. Based on these findings, we proposed that the common ancestor of primates was strongly resistant to and that of NWMs was completely resistant to SARS-CoV-2 and so is the Philippine tarsier, whereas apes and OWMs, like most humans, are susceptible. This study increases our understanding of the differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among primates.","Bhattacharjee, Maloyjo Joyraj; Lin, Jinn-Jy; Chang, Chih-Yao; Chiou, Yu-Ting; Li, Tian-Neng; Tai, Chia-Wei; Shiu, Tz-Fan; Chen, Chi-An; Chou, Chia-Yi; Chakraborty, Paromita; Tseng, Yan Yuan; Wang, Lily Hui-Ching; Li, Wen-Hsiung",Mol Biol Evol,,58
477271,Causal Learning for Socially Responsible AI,2021-04-25,"BACKGROUND: For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), it is unclear whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy-induced pathologic complete response (pCR) individuals would further benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). METHODS: The pCR individuals who received different ACT cycles were paired by propensity score matching. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. RESULTS: In total, 1041 pCR individuals were identified from 5567 LARC cases. Specifically, 303 pCR cases had no ACT treatment, and 738 pCR patients received fluoropyrimidine-based ACT (median, 4 cycles) treatment. After 1:3 propensity score matching, 297 cases without ACT treatment were matched to 712 cases who received ACT treatment. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that pCR individuals treated with or without ACT had the similar 3-year outcome (OS, DFS, LRFS and DMFS) (all P > 0.05). Moreover, the pCR patients received different ACT cycle(s) (0 vs. 1-4 cycles, 0 vs. &#8805;5 cycles) had comparable 3-year OS, DFS, LRFS and DMFS (all P > 0.05). In stratified analysis, ACT treatment did not improve 3-year survival (OS, DFS, LRFS and DMFS) for the baseline high-risk (cT3-4/cN1-2) subgroup patients (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACT, which did not improve survival, is unnecessary to neoadjuvant treatment-induced pCR LARC patients.

477305,Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management with Demand Learning: A Bayesian Approach,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The role of home healthcare (HHC) services in providing care to vulnerable, often frail individuals with chronic conditions is critical. Effective infection prevention and control (IPC) in HHC is essential to keeping both healthcare workers and patients safe, especially in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, we explored successes and challenges with IPC from the perspectives of HHC staff. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: From May to November 2018, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 41 staff from 13 agencies across the nation. METHODS: Transcripts were coded by a multidisciplinary coding team, and several primary and subcategories were identified using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Four primary categories were generated including (1) uniqueness of HHC; (2) IPC as a priority; (3) importance of education; and (4) keys to success and innovation. Participants perceived that IPC plays a big part in patient safety and reducing rehospitalizations, and protection of patients and staff was a major motivator for compliance with IPC. The identified challenges included the unpredictability of the home environment, patient/family dynamics, the intermittent nature of HHC, and staffing issues. Education was seen as a tool to improve staff, patient, caregiver and families' compliance with IPC. Keys to success and innovation included a leadership focus on quality, using agency infection data to improve quality, and a coordinated approach to patient care. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This qualitative work identified barriers to effective IPC in HHC, as well as important facilitators that HHC agencies can use to implement policies and procedures to improve patient care and keep staff safe. Leadership prioritization of IPC is key to implementing appropriate IPC policies and may be especially important in midst of a crisis such as coronavirus disease 2019.","Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika; Chastain, Ashley M; Mangal, Sabrina; Stone, Patricia W; Shang, Jingjing",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,58

479082,Quantifying the time-lag effects of human mobility on the COVID-19 transmission: A multi-city study in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis has drastically changed care delivery with teleconsultation platforms experiencing substantial spikes in demand, helping patients and care providers avoid infections and maintain health care services. Beyond the current pandemic, teleconsultation is considered a significant opportunity to address persistent health system challenges, including accessibility, continuity, and cost of care, while ensuring quality. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at identifying the determinants of patients' intention to continue using a teleconsultation platform. It extends prior research on information technology use continuance intention and teleconsultation services. METHODS: Data was collected in November 2018 and May 2019 with Canadian patients who had access to a teleconsultation platform. Measures included patients' intention to continue their use; teleconsultation usefulness; teleconsultation quality; patients' trust toward the digital platform, its provider. and health care professionals; and confirmation of patients' expectations toward teleconsultation. We used structural equation modeling employing the partial least squares component-based technique to test our research model and hypotheses. RESULTS: We analyzed a sample of 178 participants who had used teleconsultation services. Our findings revealed that confirmation of expectations had the greatest influence on continuance intention (total effects=0.722; P<.001), followed by usefulness (total effects=0.587; P<.001) and quality (total effects=0.511; P<.001). Usefulness (ß=.60; P<.001) and quality (ß=.34; P=.01) had direct effects on the dependent variable. The confirmation of expectations had direct effects both on usefulness (ß=.56; P<.001) and quality (ß=.75; P<.001) in addition to having an indirect effect on usefulness (indirect effects=0.282; P<.001). Last, quality directly influenced usefulness (ß=.34; P=.002) and trust (ß=.88; P<.001). Trust does not play a role in the context under study. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultation is central to care going forward, and it represents a significant lever for an improved, digital delivery of health care in the future. We believe that our findings will help drive long-term teleconsultation adoption and use, including in the aftermath of the current COVID-19 crisis, so that general care improvement and greater preparedness for exceptional situations can be achieved.","Grenier Ouimet, Antoine; Wagner, Gerit; Raymond, Louis; Pare, Guy",J Med Internet Res,,58
479137,COVID-19 and the academy: It is time for going digital,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pregnant women suffer from varying levels of pregnancy-related anxiety (PRA) which can negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess PRA and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 on 318 pregnant women purposively recruited from primary healthcare centers in Sari and Amol, Iran. Data were collected using questionnaires (PRAQ, Edinburg, KAP of COVID-19, CDA-Q and Demographic questionnaire), which were provided to participants through the social media or were completed for them over telephone. Data were analyzed with the linear regression and the logistic regression analysis, at the significance level of 0.05 using the SPSS software (v. 21). RESULTS: Around 21% of participants had PRA, 42.1% had depression, and 4.4% had COVID-19 anxiety. The significant predictors of PRA were number of pregnancies (P = 0.008), practice regarding COVID-19 (P < 0.001), COVID-19 anxiety (P < 0.001), depression (P < 0.001), and social support (P = 0.025) which explained 19% of the total variance. Depression and COVID-19 anxiety increased the odds of PRA by respectively four times and 13%, while good practice regarding COVID-19 decreased the odds by 62%. CONCLUSION: Around 21% of pregnant women suffer from PRA during the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant predictors of PRA during the pandemic include number of pregnancies, practice regarding COVID-19, COVID-19 anxiety, depression, and social support. These findings can be used to develop appropriate strategies for the management of mental health problems during pregnancy in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hamzehgardeshi, Zeinab; Omidvar, Shabnam; Amoli, Arman Asadi; Firouzbakht, Mojgan",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,58

In this scenario, developing an effective therapy is still a dire need. Different targets for therapeutic antibodies and diagnostics have been identified, among which the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, particularly its receptor-binding domain, has been defined as crucial. In this context, we aim to focus attention also on the role played by the S N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) in the virus attachment, already recognized as a valuable target for neutralizing antibodies, in particular, building on a cavity mapping indicating the presence of two druggable pockets and on the recent literature hypothesizing the presence of a ganglioside-binding domain. In this perspective, we aim at proposing S1-NTD as a putative target for designing small molecules hopefully able to hamper the SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells.","Di Gaetano, Sonia; Capasso, Domenica; Delre, Pietro; Pirone, Luciano; Saviano, Michele; Pedone, Emilia; Mangiatordi, Giuseppe Felice",Int. j. mol. sci.

Yet, difficult situations may not only lead to various types of disorders, fears, anxieties and feelings of loss. They can also lead to positive changes, even to development or growth after experienced trauma, to positive adaptation, to changes in self-perception, changes in interpersonal relations or philosophy of life. Patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those on renal replacement therapy, often experience severe psychological problems such as anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or difficulties related to coping with excessive stress. The aim of our review is to disscus the appropriatness of mental health screening tools in patients with chronic kidney disease, including those on dialyses, during COVID-19 pandemic. Recently published studies indicate the limited available data evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of screening tools for mental status in patients with chronic kidney disease. This, it seems reasonable to stress the mental health associations with situational stress in this group of patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It is also worth pointing out the need to research the impact of the mental disorders in this population on morbidity and mortality, taking into account other organ complications and the quality of life of patients not only during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Because of the severity of this infectious disease, several kinds of research have focused on combatting its ongoing spread. One potential solution to detect COVID-19 is by analyzing the chest X-ray images using Deep Learning (DL) models. In this context, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are presented as efficient techniques for early diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel randomly initialized CNN architecture for the recognition of COVID-19. This network consists of a set of different-sized hidden layers created from scratch. The performance of this network is evaluated through two public datasets, which are the COVIDx and the enhanced COVID-19 datasets. Both of these datasets consist of 3 different classes of images: COVID19, pneumonia, and normal chest X-ray images. The proposed CNN model yields encouraging results with 94% and 99% of accuracy for COVIDx and enhanced COVID-19 dataset, respectively.","Atitallah, Safa Ben; Driss, Maha; Boulila, Wadii; Gh'ezala, Henda Ben",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08199v1.pdf,58

Patients with cancer were considered at high risk on sparse evidence, and despite a small number of emerging observational studies, the true incidence and impact of COVID-19 in the 'at-risk' population of patients with cancer is yet to be defined. METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical data were collected prospectively for patients attending the Royal Marsden Hospital and three network hospitals between March 1st and April 30th 2020 that were confirmed to have Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. Significance of clinical and pathological characteristics was assessed using the Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test, whilst univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to further assess risk. The number of patients attending in March/April 2020 for face-to-face attendances was also extracted. FINDINGS: During the 2-month study period, 867 of 13,489 (6.4%) patients met the criteria leading to swab testing. Of the total at-risk population, only 113 of 13,489 (0.84%) were swab positive, 101 of 13,489 (0.75%) required hospital admission and 29 of 13,489 (0.21%) died of COVID-19. Of the patients that attended the hospital to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy alone or in combination with other therapy, 59 of 2001 (2.9%) were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19-related issues and 20 of 2001 (1%) died. Of the patients that collected targeted treatments, 16 of 1126 (1.4%) were admitted and 1 of 1126 (0.1%) died. Of the 11 patients that had received radiotherapy, 6 of 1042 (0.6%) required inpatient admission and 2 of 1042 (0.2%) died. INTERPRETATIONS: Administration of systemic anticancer therapy appears to be associated with a modest risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Based on this snapshot taken as the first wave of COVID-19 hit our practice, we conclude that continuation of active cancer treatment, even in the palliative setting, is appropriate.","Angelis, Vasileios; Tippu, Zayd; Joshi, Kroopa; Reis, Sara; Gronthoud, Firza; Fribbens, Charlotte; Okines, Alicia; Stanway, Susannah; Cottier, Emma; McGrath, Sophie; Watkins, David; Noble, Jillian; Bhosle, Jaishree; Gerlinger, Marco; Hamid, Intan; Soliman, Heba; Nenclares, Pablo; Jones, Robin; Harrington, Kevin; Gennatas, Spyridon",Eur J Cancer,,58

Early identification of COVID-19 patients who need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) helps to improve the outcomes. We aim to investigate whether absolute eosinophil count (AEC) can predict ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards. Methods: A retrospective study of 94 elderly patients older than 60 years old with COVID-19 was conducted. We compared the basic clinical characteristics and levels of inflammation markers on admission to general isolation wards and the needs for ICU transfer between the eosinopenia (AEC on admission <20 cells/µl) and non-eosinopenia (AEC &#8805;20 cells/µl) groups. Results: There was a significantly higher ICU transfer rate in the eosinopenia group than in the non-eosinopenia group (51 vs. 9%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that eosinopenia was associated with an increased risk of ICU transfer in elderly COVID-19 patients [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.12 (95% CI, 1.23-30.33), P = 0.027] after adjustment of age, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin levels. The eosinopenia group had higher levels of CRP, ferritin, and cytokines [interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;)] than the non-eosinophil group (P < 0.001). The area under the curve of AEC on admission for predicting ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients was 0.828 (95% CI, 0.732-0.923). The best cut-off value of AEC was 25 cells/µl with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 71%, respectively. Conclusion: Absolute eosinophil count on admission is a valid predictive marker for ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards and, therefore, can help case triage and optimize ICU utilization, especially for health care facilities with limited ICU capacity.","Huang, Jinjin; Zhang, Zhicheng; Liu, Shunfang; Gong, Chen; Chen, Liping; Ai, Guo; Zhu, Xiaodong; Zhang, Chunli; Li, Dengju",Front Med (Lausanne),,58
486940,Competency-based approach to the development of a regional anti-crisis strategy based on the development of transport and logistics infrastructure,2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its rapid global spread have created unprecedented challenges to health care systems. Significant and sustained efforts have focused on mobilization of personal protective equipment, intensive care beds, and medical equipment, while substantially less attention has focused on preserving the psychological health of the medical workforce tasked with addressing the challenges of the pandemic. And yet, similar to battlefield conditions, health care workers are being confronted with ongoing uncertainty about resources, capacities, and risks; as well as exposure to suffering, death, and threats to their own safety. These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the short term, and place individuals at risk for persistent stress exposure syndromes, subclinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the long term. Given the potentially wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID-19, protecting health care workers from adverse psychological effects of the pandemic is critical. Therefore, we present an overview of the potential psychological stress responses to the COVID-19 crisis in medical providers and describe preemptive resilience-promoting strategies at the organizational and personal level. We then describe a rapidly deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention founded on a peer support model (Battle Buddies) developed by the United States Army. This intervention-the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical Center-also incorporates evidence-informed ""stress inoculation"" methods developed for managing psychological stress exposure in providers deployed to disasters. Our multilevel, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places 2 key tools directly in the hands of providers: (1) a peer support Battle Buddy; and (2) a designated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation. In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations. It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic. Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse health care workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.","Albott, Cristina Sophia; Wozniak, Jeffrey R; McGlinch, Brian P; Wall, Michael H; Gold, Barbara S; Vinogradov, Sophia",Anesth Analg,,58

488270,Uncertainty and Monetary Policy During Extreme Events,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical features, diagnostic findings, treatments, and outcomes in patients with new-onset postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and other autonomic disorders following SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records for patients who presented with persistent neurologic and cardiovascular complaints between April and December 2020 following COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twenty patients (70% female) were included in this study.Fifteen had POTS, 3 had neurocardiogenic syncope, and 2 had orthostatic hypotension. Six patients had abnormalities on cardiac or pulmonary testing, and 4 had elevated autoimmune or inflammatory markers. All patients were treated with non-pharmacologic therapies, and most required pharmacologic therapies. Six to 8 months after COVID-19, 17 (85%) patients had residual autonomic symptoms, with 12 (60%) unable to return to work. CONCLUSIONS: POTS can follow COVID-19 in previously healthy patients. Appropriate diagnostic investigations and therapies are necessary to identify and treat autonomic dysfunction after COVID-19.","Blitshteyn, Svetlana; Whitelaw, Sera",Immunol Res,,58
488826,AI-Enabled COVID-19 Outbreak Analysis and Prediction: Indian States vs. Union Territories,2021,"BACKGROUND: Increased incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death (OHSD) has been reported during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHODS: The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULTS: Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman &#961; 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R2 = 0.645). CONCLUSION: The association in geographic distribution between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden suggests either a causality between the 2 syndromes or the presence of local determinants affecting both measures in a similar fashion.","Coleman, Kristie M; Saleh, Moussa; Mountantonakis, Stavros E",Heart Rhythm,,58

488945,Central oxytocin signaling inhibits food reward-motivated behaviors and VTA dopamine responses to food-predictive cues in male rats,2020,"Introduction: Innate immunity is armed with interferons (IFNs) that link innate immunity to adaptive immunity to generate long-term and protective immune responses against invading pathogens and tumors. However, regulation of IFN production is crucial because chronic IFN responses can have deleterious effects on both antitumor and antimicrobial immunity in addition to provoking autoinflammatory or autoimmune conditions.Areas covered: Here, we focus on the accumulated evidence on antimicrobial and antitumor activities of type I and II IFNs. We first summarize the intracellular and intercellular mechanisms regulating IFN production and signaling. Then, we discuss the mechanisms modulating the dual nature of IFNs for both antitumor and antimicrobial immune responses. Finally, we review the detrimental role of IFNs for induction of autoinflammation and autoimmunity.Expert opinion: The current evidence suggests that the dual role of IFNs for antimicrobial and antitumor immunity is dependent not only on the timing, administration route, and dose of IFNs but also on the type of pathogen/tumor. Therefore, we think that combinatorial therapies involving IFN-inducing adjuvants and immune-checkpoint blockers may offer therapeutic potential, especially for cancer, whereas infectious, autoinflammatory or autoimmune diseases require fine adjustment of timing, dose, and route of the administration for candidate IFN-based vaccines or immunotherapies.","Temizoz, Burcu; Ishii, Ken J",Expert Rev Vaccines,,58

However, efficacy depends on proper usage. We set out to determine the prevalence of wearing masks to prevent COVID-19 and compliance with appropriate measures for the correct use of face masks among the general public in Japan where wearing medical masks is a ""cultural"" normality. This cross-sectional study was based on an internet-based survey completed by 2141 people (50.8% men, aged 20-79 years) who were selected among registrants of an Internet research company between 1 April and 6 April 2020. Participants were asked to indicate how often they wore masks for prevention and to what extent they practiced appropriate measures suggested by the World Health Organization. The prevalence of wearing masks was 80.9% and compliance rates with appropriate measures ranged from 38.3% to 83.5%. Only 23.1% complied with all recommendations. Compliance rates were overall low in men and persons with low household incomes. Our results, hence show that many citizens implement inaccurate measures when using face masks. Therefore, providing guidance on correct usage is essential when encouraging the use of face masks to prevent COVID-19.","Machida, Masaki; Nakamura, Itaru; Saito, Reiko; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Takamiya, Tomoko; Odagiri, Yuko; Fukushima, Noritoshi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Kojima, Takako; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Inoue, Shigeru",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,58

492692,The rise in climate change-induced federal fishery disasters in the United States,2021,"The spatio-temporal dynamics of an outbreak provide important insights to help direct public health resources intended to control transmission. They also provide a focus for detailed epidemiological studies and allow the timing and impact of interventions to be assessed.A common approach is to aggregate case data to administrative regions. Whilst providing a good visual impression of change over space, this method masks spatial variation and assumes that disease risk is constant across space. Risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g. population density, deprivation and ethnicity) vary from place to place across England so it follows that risk will also vary spatially. Kernel density estimation compares the spatial distribution of cases relative to the underlying population, unfettered by arbitrary geographical boundaries, to produce a continuous estimate of spatially varying risk.Using test results from healthcare settings in England (Pillar 1 of the UK Government testing strategy) and freely available methods and software, we estimated the spatial and spatio-temporal risk of COVID-19 infection across England for the first 6 months of 2020. Widespread transmission was underway when partial lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March 2020 and the greatest risk erred towards large urban areas. The rapid growth phase of the outbreak coincided with multiple introductions to England from the European mainland. The spatio-temporal risk was highly labile throughout.In terms of controlling transmission, the most important practical application of our results is the accurate identification of areas within regions that may require tailored intervention strategies. We recommend that this approach is absorbed into routine surveillance outputs in England. Further risk characterisation using widespread community testing (Pillar 2) data is needed as is the increased use of predictive spatial models at fine spatial scales.","Elson, Richard; Davies, Tilman M; Lake, Iain R; Vivancos, Roberto; Blomquist, Paula B; Charlett, Andre; Dabrera, Gavin",Epidemiol Infect,,58
493734,Political events and public views on climate change,2020,"Reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) have emerged during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS. The epidemiology of GBS cases reported to the UK National Immunoglobulin Database was studied from 2016 to 2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were stratified by hospital trust and region, with numbers of reported cases per month. UK population data for COVID-19 infection were collated from UK public health bodies. In parallel, but separately, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society prospectively reported incident cases of GBS during the pandemic at their hospitals to a central register. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19 (definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases in his cohort were compared. The incidence of GBS treated in UK hospitals from 2016 to 2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100 000 individuals per year. In 2020, GBS and COVID-19 incidences varied between regions and did not correlate with one another (r = 0.06, 95% confidence interval: -0.56 to 0.63, P = 0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of 2016-19. In an independent cohort study, 47 GBS cases were reported (COVID-19 status: 13 definite, 12 probable, 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome between these groups. Intubation was more frequent in the COVID-19 affected cohort (7/13, 54% versus 5/22, 23% in COVID-19-negative) likely related to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Although it is not possible to entirely rule out the possibility of a link this study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS. GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic, which may be the influence of lockdown measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and respiratory viruses.","Keddie, Stephen; Pakpoor, Julia; Mousele, Christina; Pipis, Menelaos; Machado, Pedro M; Foster, Mark; Record, Christopher J; Keh, Ryan Y S; Fehmi, Janev; Paterson, Ross W; Bharambe, Viraj; Clayton, Lisa M; Allen, Claire; Price, Olivia; Wall, Jasmine; Kiss-Csenki, Annamaria; Rathnasabapathi, Dipa P; Geraldes, Ruth; Yermakova, Tatyana; King-Robson, Joshua; Zosmer, Maya; Rajakulendran, Sanjeev; Sumaria, Sheetal; Farmer, Simon F; Nortley, Ross; Marshall, Charles R; Newman, Edward J; Nirmalananthan, Niranjanan; Kumar, Guru; Pinto, Aswin A; Holt, James; Lavin, Tim M; Brennan, Kathryn M; Zandi, Michael S; Jayaseelan, Dipa L; Pritchard, Jane; Hadden, Robert D M; Manji, Hadi; Willison, Hugh J; Rinaldi, Simon; Carr, Aisling S; Lunn, Michael P",Brain,,58

This has created a demand for a substance whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated in a similar scenario. Glycyrrhizin (GZ) is a promising agent against SARS-CoV-2 as its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV has already been confirmed. It is worthwhile to extrapolate from its proven therapeutic effects as there is a high similarity in the structure and genome of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are many possible mechanisms through which GZ acts against viruses: increasing nitrous oxide production in macrophages, affecting transcription factors and cellular signalling pathways, directly altering the viral lipid-bilayer membrane, and binding to the ACE2 receptor. In this review, we discuss the possible use of GZ in the COVID-19 setting, where topical administration appears to be promising, with the nasal and oral cavity notably being the potent location in terms of viral load. The most recently published papers on the distribution of ACE2 in the human body and documented binding of GZ to this receptor, as well as its antiviral activity, suggest that GZ can be used as a therapeutic for COVID-19 and as a preventive agent against SARS-CoV-2.","Chrzanowski, Julian; Chrzanowska, Alicja; Grabon, Wojciech",Phytother. res,,58

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the adoption of these technologies across the SUD service continuum, acceptance of these technologies among service providers, and intent of providers to use these technologies after the pandemic. Additional analysis using the validated technology acceptance model (TAM) was performed to test the potential applications of these technologies after the pandemic. The study objectives were as follows: (1) to assess the use of telehealth (telephone and video technologies) for different SUD services during COVID-19 in May-June 2020, (2) to assess the intended applications of telehealth for SUD services beyond COVID-19, (3) to evaluate the perceived ease of use and value of telehealth for delivering SUD services, and (4) to assess organizational readiness for the sustained use of telehealth services. METHODS: An online survey on the use of telephonic and video services was distributed between May and August 2020 to measure the current use of these services, perceived organizational readiness to use these services, and the intent to use these services after COVID-19. In total, 8 of 10 regional Addiction Technology Transfer Centers representing 43 states distributed the survey. Individual organizations were the unit of analysis. RESULTS: In total, 457 organizations responded to the survey. Overall, the technology was widely used; >70% (n>335) of organizations reported using telephone or video platforms for most services. The odds of the intent of organizations to use these technologies to deliver services post COVID-19 were significantly greater for all but two services (ie, telephonic residential counseling and buprenorphine therapy; mean odds ratio 3.79, range 1.87-6.98). Clinical users preferred video technologies to telephone technologies for virtually all services. Readiness to use telephone and video technologies was high across numerous factors, though telephonic services were considered more accessible. Consistent with the TAM, perceived usefulness and ease of use influenced the intent to use both telephone and video technologies. CONCLUSIONS: The overall perceived ease of use and usefulness of telephonic and video services suggest promising post-COVID-19 applications of these services. Survey participants consistently preferred video services to telephonic services; however, the availability of telephonic services to those lacking easy access to video technology is an important characteristic of these services. Future studies should review the acceptance of telehealth services and their comparative impact on SUD care outcomes.","Molfenter, Todd; Roget, Nancy; Chaple, Michael; Behlman, Stephanie; Cody, Olivia; Hartzler, Bryan; Johnson, Edward; Nichols, Maureen; Stilen, Patricia; Becker, Sara",JMIR Ment Health,,58

It is mainly used as a guideline that needs to be applied to buildings in order to achieve more sustainable design through energy and resource savings. Hence, it is expected to reduce the building operational costs, improve the users’ health and comfort, as well as to leave the minimum carbon footprint. Greenship IS rating tools consist of several categories, i.e., Appropriate Site Development (ESD), Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC), Water Conservation (WAC), Material and Resources Cycle, Building and Environment Management (BEM), and Indoor Health and Comfort (IHC). As the COVID-19 virus pandemic continues to spread, these categories need to be reviewed. Therefore, green building is not merely for sustainability but also expected could reduce the transmission of the Coronavirus that causes the COVID-19. This disease is transmitted through direct or indirect contact with the subject, droplets, and aerosols. This research employed a literature study of Greenship IS adaptation regarding the pandemic situation and followed by the critical analysis that focused on the proposed strategies for the criteria by investigating the cause, prevention, transmission, and impact to the interior space. The adaptation of Greenship IS shows the importance of human health must be achieved apart from the sustainability aspect. From the literature review, it can be concluded that the adaptation of Greenship IS is focused on creating good indoor air quality, appropriate material selection, access to nature for the occupants, maintaining health protocol, and regular disinfection in managing the building to reduce the COVID-19 transmission.","Dyah Kusuma, Wardhani Susan Susan",IOP Conference Series.

The goal of this work was to identify shortcomings in the conventional screening system (CSS) implemented in the beginning of the outbreak. To overcome these shortcomings, we then introduced a novel, independently developed system called the Yeungnam University type drive-through (YU-Thru), and distributed it nationwide in Korea. This system is similar to the drive-throughs utilized by fast food restaurants. YU-Thru system has shortened the time taken to test a single person to 2-4 minutes, by completely eliminating the time required to clean and ventilate the specimen collection room. This time requirement was a major drawback of the CSS. YU-Thru system also reduced the risk of subjects and medical staff infecting one another by using a separate and closed examination system. On average, 50 to 60 tests were conducted per day when using the CSS, while now up to 350 tests per day are conducted with the YU-Thru system. We believe that the YU-Thru system has made an important contribution to the rapid detection of COVID-19 in Daegu, South Korea. Here, we will describe the YU-Thru system in detail so that other countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks can take advantage of this system.","Seo, Wan Seok; Kim, Seong Ho; Song, Si Youn; Hur, Jian; Lee, Jun; Choi, Sunho; Lee, Yoojung; Bai, Dai Seg",,,58

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of stress hyperglycaemia in acute pulmonary embolism, providing new insights into the presumed embolus size and localization, clinical parameters (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index, PESI), and in-hospital mortality. Design and Methods. Among a total of 95,454 patients referred to the Emergency Department of the Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Centre between 2014 and 2016, all patients with acute pulmonary embolism were included into this observational cohort study. The study group consisted of 190 patients aged 25-96. Relevant patient history, clinical data, and laboratory findings were collected during the entire hospitalization period. Data were analyzed for the entire group of patients, as well as separately for patients without diabetes, using the Fisher exact test and logistic regression. Results: Analysis of embolus localization as an indirect parameter of embolus size showed that patients with stress hyperglycaemia more often had emboli located in proximal parts of the pulmonary circulation (i.e., main artery or lobar branches) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, stress hyperglycaemia correlated with PESI score and diabetes (p < 0.05) in the entire patient group. Stress hyperglycaemia showed independent association with in-hospital mortality in patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Stress hyperglycaemia in patients with acute pulmonary embolism is associated with embolus localization in larger arteries of the pulmonary circulation and higher PESI score and therefore could serve as an independent in-hospital mortality predictor.","Altabas, Velimir; Pukec, Lucija; Mlinaric, Stella; Pintaric, Hrvoje; Sikic, Aljosa",Int J Endocrinol,,58

Accurate short-term forecasting is thus vital to support country-level policy making. The strategies adopted by countries to combat the pandemic vary, generating different uncertainty levels about the actual number of cases. Accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and accommodating extra-variability is therefore fundamental. We introduce a new modelling framework to describe the pandemic's course with great accuracy and provide short-term daily forecasts for every country in the world. We show that our model generates highly accurate forecasts up to seven days ahead and use estimated model components to cluster countries based on recent events. We introduce statistical novelty in terms of modelling the autoregressive parameter as a function of time, increasing predictive power and flexibility to adapt to each country. Our model can also be used to forecast the number of deaths, study the effects of covariates (such as lockdown policies), and generate forecasts for smaller regions within countries. Consequently, it has substantial implications for global planning and decision making. We present forecasts and make all results freely available to any country in the world through an online Shiny dashboard.","Oliveira, Thiago de Paula; Moral, Rafael de Andrade",Sci Rep,,58

No effective pharmacologic therapies exist, and the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We aimed to explore the mechanisms of bile duct repair after targeted BEC injury. Injection of intermedilysin into BEC-specific human CD59 (hCD59) transgenic mice induced acute and specific BEC death, representing a model to study the early signals that drive bile duct repair. Acute BEC injury induced cholestasis followed by CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and BEC proliferation. Using microdissection and next-generation RNA-Seq, we identified 5 genes, including Mapk8ip2, Cdkn1a, Itgb6, Rgs4, and Ccl2, that were most upregulated in proliferating BECs after acute injury. Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed robust upregulation of integrin &#945;vß6 (ITGß6) expression in this BEC injury model, after bile duct ligation, and in patients with chronic cholangiopathies. Deletion of the Itgb6 gene attenuated BEC proliferation after acute bile duct injury. Macrophage depletion or Ccr2 deficiency impaired ITGß6 expression and BEC proliferation. In vitro experiments revealed that bile acid-activated monocytes promoted BEC proliferation through ITGß6. Our data suggest that BEC injury induces cholestasis, monocyte recruitment, and induction of ITGß6, which work together to promote BEC proliferation and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets for cholangiopathies.","Guillot, Adrien; Guerri, Lucia; Feng, Dechun; Kim, Seung-Jin; Ahmed, Yeni Ait; Paloczi, Janos; He, Yong; Schuebel, Kornel; Dai, Shen; Liu, Fengming; Pacher, Pal; Kisseleva, Tatiana; Qin, Xuebin; Goldman, David; Tacke, Frank; Gao, Bin",J. clin. invest,,58
499998,IoMT (Internet of Medical Things): Reducing Cost While Improving Patient Care,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To assess primary care contributions to behavioral health in addressing unmet mental healthcare needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of 2016 to 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey of non-institutionalized US adults. We performed bivariate analysis to estimate the number and percentage of office-based visits and prescription medications for depression and anxiety disorders, any mental illness (AMI), and severe mental illness (AMI) by physician specialty (primary care, psychiatry, and subspecialty) and medical complexity. We ran summary statistics to compare the differences in sociodemographic factors between patients with AMI by seeing a primary care physician versus those seeing a psychiatrist. Binary logistic regression models were estimated to examine the likelihood of having a primary care visit versus psychiatrist visit for a given mental illness. RESULTS: There were 394 023 office-based visits in the analysis sample. AMI patients seeing primary care physician were thrice as likely to report 1 or more chronic conditions compared to those seeing psychiatrist. Among patients with a diagnosis of depression or anxiety and AMI the proportion of primary care visits ([38% vs 32%, P < .001], [39% vs 34%, P < .001] respectively), and prescriptions ([50% vs 40%, P < .001], [47% vs 44%, P < .05] respectively) were higher compared to those for psychiatric care. Patients diagnosed with SMI had a more significant percentage of prescriptions and visits to a psychiatrist than primary care physicians. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians provided most of the care for depression, anxiety, and AMI.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a 20-question survey that used SeziureTracker.com, sent to eligible PWE and their caregivers on May 6th, 2020. Questions about demographics and medical history were used to calculate COVID mortality risk odds ratios (OR) compared to a low baseline risk group. RESULTS: In total, 505 responses were collected. Of these, 71% reported no change in seizure rates and 25% reported an increase in seizures, which they attributed primarily to disrupted sleep (63%) and decreased exercise (42%). Mortality risks from COVID-19 had median OR of 1.67, ranging 1.00-906.98. Fear about hospitalization (53%) and concern for loved ones (52%) were prominent concerns. Of the respondents, 5% reported stopping or reducing anti-seizure medications due to problems communicating with doctors, access or cost. Lower-risk COVID patients reported more fear of hospitalization (55% versus 38%, p<0.001) and anxiety about medication access (43% versus 28%, p=0.03) compared with higher-risk COVID patients. Increased anxiety was reported in 47%, and increased depression in 28%. Ten percent without generalized convulsions and 8% with did not know anything about epilepsy devices (VNS, RNS, DBS). SIGNIFICANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges to PWE, including increased seizure rates, problems with access and cost of life-saving medications. Those with lower COVID-19 risk may have been marginalized more than those with higher risk. Efforts to protect PWE during major public health emergencies should take these findings into account.","Casassa, Charles; Moss, Robert; Goldenholz, Daniel M",Epileptic Disord,,58

509101,Q-Learning-Based High Credibility and Stability Routing Algorithm for Internet of Medical Things,2020,"RATIONALE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which commonly presents with symptoms including fever, cough, and dyspnea. More recently, however, some patients have tested positive for COVID-19 after developing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms either solely or in conjunction with respiratory symptoms. This may be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the GI tract. In patients with chronic GI illnesses, COVID-19 may initially present as a flare of their underlying GI conditions as viruses have historically been implicated in exacerbations of GI disorders, including gastroparesis. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a case of a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetic gastroparesis who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with nausea and vomiting similar to her gastroparesis flares. DIAGNOSES: Her symptoms in the ED failed to improve with fluids and anti-emetic medications. After developing a fever, she was tested and found to be positive for COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: She was started on antibiotic, steroid, and antiviral medications. OUTCOMES: Her symptoms improved, her fever defervesced on day 4 of hospitalization, and she was discharged on day 5 of hospitalization. The patient reported symptom improvement at a follow-up outpatient gastroenterology visit 2 months after hospitalization. LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, at the present time, this is the first report of a patient with COVID-19 presenting with signs and symptoms of a gastroparesis flare. This case illustrates that COVID-19 may present in an exacerbation of symptoms of an underlying disorder, such as a severe gastroparesis flare, in a patient with underlying gastroparesis. Initial presentation of these patients manifesting as a flare of their chronic GI disease, more severe than usual, should prompt an index of suspicion for COVID-19.","Song, Jun; Bhuta, Rajiv; Baig, Kamal; Parkman, Henry P; Malik, Zubair",Medicine (Baltimore),,58

Expecting that long-term mask wear would change the characteristics of skin, this study investigated changes in skin wrinkles and pores caused by long-term mask wear and whether or not use of moisturizers has an effect on any changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study participants were 20 women who were instructed to wear a mask for at least 6 hours a day for 4 weeks. Measurements of skin wrinkles and pores were obtained before and after the 4 weeks of mask wear. The effects of application of a moisturizer were assessed by applying moisturizer within the mask-wearing area. They completed a questionnaire about skin changes at the end of the study period. RESULTS: After wearing the mask for 4 weeks, there was a significant increase in the skin wrinkles and pores; both variables decreased significantly in skin areas where a moisturizer had been applied. The results of the questionnaire-based survey indicated the study participants considered that long-term wearing of a mask had affected their skin. CONCLUSION: Wearing a mask for extended periods increases skin wrinkles and pores and using a moisturizer when wearing the mask helps to reduce this problem.","Park, Minhye; Kim, Hongbi; Kim, Suyeon; Lee, Juseon; Kim, Sungeun; Byun, Ji Won; Hwang-Bo, Jeon; Park, Keun Hyung",Skin res. technol,,58

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective survey. SETTING: Quaternary medical center and online survey. METHODS: The perceived chemosensory capacities of 655 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were assessed with 11-point category rating scales (0, no function; 10, normal function). Patients were contacted in hospital, by phone calls, or by internet regarding their ability to smell or taste, and 143 were interviewed by phone 1 to 4 months later to assess the recovery of their chemosensory abilities. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported olfactory, general taste, and taste quality-specific disturbances (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty) in the patients with COVID-19 were 82.4% (95% CI, 79.5%-85.3%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.9%-79.4%), and 52.2% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.1%), respectively. The majority reported anosmia (42.9%). The presence of chemosensory symptoms was not associated with COVID-19 severity. At a median time >2 months after the onset of symptoms, rates of total and partial olfaction recovery were 53.8% and 44.7%, while complete or partial return to previous taste function was 68.3% and 27.6%. Less than 5% of the patients reported no chemosensory function improvement at all. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction is high among patients with COVID-19. Almost all patients seem to recover a significant part of their smell and taste abilities in the first 4 months after the onset of symptoms.","Brandão Neto, Deusdedit; Fornazieri, Marco Aurélio; Dib, Caroline; Di Francesco, Renata Cantisani; Doty, Richard L; Voegels, Richard Louis; Pinna, Fabio de Rezende",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,58

Many compounds have been proposed as phytotherapics in the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. The extensive interest of the general public and the enormous social media coverage on this topic urges the scientific community to address the question of whether which nutraceuticals can actually be employed in preventing and treating this newly described coronavirus-related disease. Recently, the Canadian biotech pharma company ""FSD Pharma"" received the green light from the Food and Drug Administration to design a proof-of-concept study evaluating the effects of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in COVID-19 patients. The story of PEA as a nutraceutical to prevent and treat infectious diseases dates back to the 1970s where the molecule was branded under the name Impulsin and was used for its immunomodulatory properties in influenza virus infection. The present paper aims at analyzing the potential of PEA as a nutraceutical and the previous evidence suggesting its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties in infectious and respiratory diseases and how these could translate to COVID-19 care.","Pesce, Marcella; Seguella, Luisa; Cassarano, Sara; Aurino, Laura; Sanseverino, Walter; Lu, Jie; Corpetti, Chiara; Del Re, Alessandro; Vincenzi, Martina; Sarnelli, Giovanni; Esposito, Giuseppe",Phytother. res,,58
519535,Data on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine content in compounded oral suspension after filtration and centrifugation,2020,"PURPOSE: There is mounting evidence that surgical patients with COVID-19 have higher morbidity and mortality than patients without COVID-19. Infection is prevalent amongst the trauma population, but any effect of COVID-19 on trauma patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on a trauma population, hypothesizing increased mortality and pulmonary complications for COVID-19-positive (COVID) trauma patients compared to propensity-matched COVID-19-negative (non-COVID) patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of trauma patients presenting to 11 Level-I and II trauma centers in California between 1/1/2019-6/30/2019 and 1/1/2020-6/30/2020 was performed. A 1:2 propensity score model was used to match COVID to non-COVID trauma patients using age, blunt/penetrating mechanism, injury severity score, Glasgow Coma Scale score, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate. Outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 20,448 trauma patients were identified during the study period. 53 COVID trauma patients were matched with 106 non-COVID trauma patients. COVID patients had higher rates of mortality (9.4% vs 1.9%, p = 0.029) and pneumonia (7.5% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.011), as well as a longer mean length of stay (LOS) (7.47 vs 3.28 days, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit LOS (1.40 vs 0.80 days, p = 0.008), compared to non-COVID patients. CONCLUSION: This multicenter retrospective study found increased rates of mortality and pneumonia, as well as a longer LOS, for COVID trauma patients compared to a propensity-matched cohort of non-COVID patients. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and to elucidate the underlying pathways responsible for higher mortality in COVID trauma patients.","Yeates, Eric O; Grigorian, Areg; Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Barmparas, Galinos; Margulies, Daniel; Juillard, Catherine; Garber, Kent; Cryer, Henry; Tillou, Areti; Burruss, Sigrid; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Mladenov, Georgi; Brenner, Megan; Firek, Christopher; Costantini, Todd; Santorelli, Jarrett; Curry, Terry; Wintz, Diane; Biffl, Walter L; Schaffer, Kathryn B; Duncan, Thomas K; Barbaro, Casey; Diaz, Graal; Johnson, Arianne; Chinn, Justine; Naaseh, Ariana; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Nahmias, Jeffry",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,,58

520364,Editorial introduction: “Information privacy in the digital age”,2020,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak, studies across diverse countries have strongly pointed towards the emergence of a mental health crisis, with a dramatic increase in the prevalence of depressive psychopathology and suicidal tendencies. Nutritional factors such as vitamin D have been associated with an increased risk of mental health problems as well as individual responses to stress. Studies have discussed the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentrations and depression, suggesting that maintaining adequate concentrations of serum vitamin D seems to have a protective effect against depression. The optimal vitamin D status was found to contribute to improved serotonergic neurotransmission deficits in an experimental depression model by regulating serotonin synthesis. The signaling of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the active form of vitamin D, through VDR induces the expression of the gene TPH2, influences the expression of serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) as well as the levels of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), the enzyme responsible for serotonin catabolism. Vitamin D also presents a relevant link with chronobiological interplay. Evidence suggests a mediatory role of vitamin D in the sleep-wake cycle since the lower concentrations of vitamin D were correlated with impaired sleep quality and abbreviated sleep duration, point to its influence on melatonin metabolism, which is synthesized from the metabolism of serotonin. In this Perspective, we discussed the significant role of vitamin D in the elevation of stress-related depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ceolin, Gilciane Mano Giulia Pipolo Rodrigues Hames Natália Schmitt Antunes Luciana da Conceição Brietzke Elisa Rieger Débora Kurrle Moreira Júlia Dubois",Frontiers in Neuroscience,,58

""Vittore Buzzi"" Children's Hospital, which is a pediatric/maternal hospital located in Milan (Lombardy Region), had to stop elective procedures-with the exception of urgent/emergent ones-between February and May 2020 to leave space and resources to adults' care. We describe the challenges of reshaping the hospital's identity and structure, and restarting pediatric surgery and anesthesia, from May on, in the most hit area of the world, with the purpose to avoid and contain infections. Both patients and caregivers admitted to hospital have been tested for Sars-CoV-2 in every case. METHODS: Observational cohort study via review of clinical charts of patients undergoing surgery between 16th May and 30th September 2020, together with SARS-CoV -2 RT-PCR testing outcomes, and comparison to same period surgeries in 2019. RESULTS: An increase of approximately 70% in pediatric surgeries (OR 1.68 [1.33-2.13], P < .001) and a higher increase in the number of surgeries were reported (OR 1.75 (1.43-2.15), P < .001). Considering only urgent procedures, a significant difference in the distribution of the type of surgery was observed (Chi-squared P-value < .001). Sars-CoV-2-positive patients have been 0.8% of total number; 14% of these was discovered through caregiver's positivity. CONCLUSION: We describe our pathway for safe pediatric surgery and anesthesia and the importance of testing both patient and caregiver.","Camporesi, Anna; Melloni, Giorgio E M; Diotto, Veronica; Bertani, Patrizia; La Pergola, Enrico; Pelizzo, Gloria",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,58
522072,A conceptual model for multichannel interaction in healthcare services,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) struck Pakistan with a magnitude that required micro- and macro-level adjustments at national and provincial levels. Access to medical consultation became a challenge; hospitals were flooded with cases beyond their capacity and transport was halted due to lockdown. Global Health Directorate of The Indus Health Network supported the provincial government by rolling out several walk-in community-based testing initiatives across Karachi. Results were conveyed to the patients through each district government. With a disproportionate rise in cases, an increasing delay in reporting results was observed. Methods: To help the district government bridge this gap, two physicians were engaged to convey timely results to patients who tested positive, through a helpline. Subsequently, proactive teleconsultation was initiated. We present a retrospective review of data collected during teleconsultation for COVID-19 cases identified through community-based testing between April 5 and June 10, 2020. Results: A total of 4,279 tests were conducted, revealing a 28% positivity rate (1,196 cases). Out of these, 752 (62.9%) baseline positive patients were contactable. Most patients identified either a close contact (46.8%) or a household contact (30.1%) as the source of infection. 41.8% patients were asymptomatic, 52.9% had mild to moderate illness, and 1.1% needed referral to the emergency department. 82.7% patients reported no comorbidities. Conclusion: The rapid surge of cases could not be handled by a small team and an institutional strategy of integration into an existing call center service was adopted. We share our insights to help develop evidence-based policies to effectively tackle current or future threats in similar settings.","Moosa, Shazia; Shah, Sabeen; Mohiuddin, Amal Fatima; Haider, Kaniz Farwa; Khowaja, Saira",Telemed. j. e. health,,58

During viral replication mTOR, downstream target genes such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta 1 (S6K1) and Eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E-binding protein1 (4-E-BP1) are activated result in ribosome biosynthesis and efficient protein synthesis. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), mTOR plays a key role in the association of adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF-7) leading to the transcriptional activation of type-I interferon (IFN) genes. Viruses also inactivate the interferon α (IFN-α) pathway by impairing the IRF-7 mediated activation of IFN-α gene transcription. Thus, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can help in suppressing the early stages of viral infection and replication. Interestingly, the key tumor-suppressor p53 protein will undergo degradation by virus-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) leading to an increased viral survival in host cells. Thus, the mTOR inhibitors and p53 activators or microRNAs that functions as p53 and can target 3′-UTR of mTOR and RPS6KB1 might effectively inhibit viral replication in the human respiratory tract and lung cells.","Ramaiah, M.

Here, CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and compared to controls and patients with known neurotropic pathogens. METHODS: CSF from twenty-seven consecutive patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms was assayed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and unbiased metagenomic sequencing. Assays for blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown (CSF:serum albumin ratio (Q-Alb)), and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, IL-16, monocyte chemoattractant protein −1 (MCP-1) and monocyte inhibitory protein – 1β (MIP-1β)) were performed in 23 patients and compared to CSF from patients with HIV-1 (16 virally suppressed, 5 unsuppressed), West Nile virus (WNV) (n = 4) and 16 healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: Median CSF cell count for COVID-19 patients was 1 white blood cell/μL; two patients were infected with a second pathogen (Neisseria, Cryptococcus neoformans). No CSF samples had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by either detection method. In patients with COVID-19 only, CSF IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and MIP-1β levels were higher than HC and suppressed HIV (corrected-p < 0.05). MCP-1 and MIP-1β levels were higher, while IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 were similar in COVID-19 compared to WNV patients. Q-Alb correlated with all proinflammatory markers, with IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1β (r ≥ 0.6, p < 0.01) demonstrating the strongest associations. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF is consistent with pre-existing literature. Evidence of intrathecal proinflammatory markers in a subset of COVID-19 patients with BBB breakdown despite minimal CSF pleocytosis is atypical for neurotropic pathogens.","Normandin, Erica; Holroyd, Kathryn B.; Collens, Sarah I.; Shaw, Bennett M.; Siddle, Katherine J.; Adams, Gordon; Rudy, Melissa; Solomon, Isaac H.; Anahtar, Melis N.; Lemieux, Jacob E.; Trombetta, Bianca A.; Kivisakk, Pia; Arnold, Steven E.; Rapalino, Otto; Piantadosi, Anne L.; Sen, Pritha; Rosenberg, Eric S.; Branda, John; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Mukerji, Shibani S.",J Neurol Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X21027258; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X21027258?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2021.120023,58

From February to June 2020 we retrospectively measured the number of daily presentations normalized for the number of emergency physicians on duty (presentations/physician ratio), door-to-physician and door-to-final disposition (length-of-stay) times of seven EDs in the central area of Tuscany. Using the multivariate regression analysis we investigated the relationship between the aforesaid variables and patient-level (triage codes, age, admissions) or hospital-level factors (number of physician on duty, working surface area, academic vs. community hospital). We analyzed data from 105,271 patients. Over ten consecutive 14-day periods, the number of presentations dropped from 18,239 to 6132 (− 67%) and the proportion of patients visited in less than 60 min rose from 56 to 86%. The proportion of patients with a length-of-stay under 4 h decreased from 59 to 52%. The presentations/physician ratio was inversely related to the proportion of patients with a door-to-physician time under 60 min (slope − 2.91, 95% CI − 4.23 to − 1.59, R(2) = 0.39). The proportion of patients with high-priority codes but not the presentations/physician ratio, was inversely related to the proportion of patients with a length-of-stay under 4 h (slope − 0.40, 95% CI − 0.24 to − 0.27, R(2) = 0.36). The variability of door-to-physician time and global length-of-stay are predicted by different factors. For appropriate benchmarking among EDs, the use of performance indicators should consider specific, hospital-level and patient-level factors.","Vanni, Simone; Bartalucci, Paola; Gargano, Ubaldo; Coppa, Alessandro; Giannasi, Gianfranco; Nazerian, Peiman; Tonietti, Barbara; Vannini, Roberto; Lanigra, Michele; Daviddi, Fabio; Baldini, Alessio; Grifoni, Stefano; Magazzini, Simone",Intern Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292458/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02796-8,58

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center collaborated with international and local experts to hold a cervical cancer prevention course in Nepal in November 2019. The course included didactic lectures and a hands-on workshop. The didactic lectures included the epidemiology of cervical cancer globally and locally, cervical cancer screening guidelines, human papillomavirus vaccination, colposcopy and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), cervical dysplasia, and cervical cancer treatment. The hands-on workshop consisted of four stations: (1) VIA; (2) colposcopy, cervical biopsy, and endocervical curettage; (3) thermal ablation; and (4) loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). A train-the-trainer model short course was held by the international faculty to assist six local faculty to become familiar with the instruments, procedures, and models used in the hands-on training stations. Forty-two people (84% gynecologist, 8% radiation oncologist, and 8% other) attended the course. Following the course, the international faculty visited the regional hospitals for additional educational activities. Increased knowledge in cervical cancer screening guidelines and ability in performing VIA, colposcopy and cervical biopsy, thermal ablation, and LEEP were reported by 89%, 84%, 84%, 87%, and 84% of participants, respectively, from the postcourse on-site evaluations. From the 6-month follow-up survey, all respondents reported that they had made practice changes based on what they learned in the course and had implemented or tried to implement the cervical cancer screening guidelines presented at the course. In conclusion, the course evaluations suggested an improvement in participants' ability to perform cervical cancer screening and diagnostic procedures and reported the changes in practices after training.","Phoolcharoen, Natacha; Kremzier, Megan; Eaton, Vanessa; Sarchet, Vanessa; Acharya, Sandhya Chapagain; Shrestha, Eliza; Carns, Jennifer; Baker, Ellen; Varon, Melissa Lopez; Karmacharya, Saujanya; Aryal, Binod; Richards-Kortum, Rebecca; Salcedo, Mila Pontremoli; Schmeler, Kathleen M.; Pariyar, Jitendra",JCO Glob Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33555914/; https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00513,58

However, both sample types need to be collected by trained professionals. Using self-collected buccal swabs as an alternative could simplify and accelerate diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: To assess self-collected buccal swab samples as an alternative method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Buccal swab samples were self-collected by 73 patients with COVID-19. Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen kits. RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Env protein and human RNase P as an internal control was amplified using the TRUPCR(®) SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit version 2.1 and a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time Detection System. RESULT: The sensitivity of RT-qPCR from buccal swabs was 58.9% (43/73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 46.77%–70.27%) and that of RT-qPCR from saliva was 62.90% (39/62; 95% CI 49.69%–74.84%) taking positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs as the gold standard. CONCLUSION: Self-collected buccal swabs are promising alternatives to nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs for SARS CoV-2 detection.","Gaur, Ritu; Verma, Dipesh Kumar; Mohindra, Ritin; Goyal, Kapil; Gupta, Shipra; Singla, Vidhi; Sahni, Vaibhav; Ghosh, Arnab; Soni, Roop Kishor; Bhalla, Ashish; Gauba, Krishan; Singh, Mini P.",J Int Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027696/; https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211016996,58
600740,Predicting access to healthful food retailers with machine learning(),2020-10-16,"The 2019-nCoV is officially called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease is named COVID-19. This viral epidemic in China has led to the deaths of over 1800 people, mostly elderly or those with an underlying chronic disease or immunosuppressed state. This is the third serious Coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012. While human strains of Coronavirus are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold, the SARS-CoV-2 may present with varying degrees of severity, from flu-like symptoms to death. It is currently believed that this deadly Coronavirus strain originated from wild animals at the Huanan market in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province. Bats, snakes and pangolins have been cited as potential carriers based on the sequence homology of CoV isolated from these animals and the viral nucleic acids of the virus isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Extreme quarantine measures, including sealing off large cities, closing borders and confining people to their homes, were instituted in January 2020 to prevent spread of the virus, but by that time much of the damage had been done, as human-human transmission became evident. While these quarantine measures are necessary and have prevented a historical disaster along the lines of the Spanish flu, earlier recognition and earlier implementation of quarantine measures may have been even more effective. Lessons learned from SARS resulted in faster determination of the nucleic acid sequence and a more robust quarantine strategy. However, it is clear that finding an effective antiviral and developing a vaccine are still significant challenges. The costs of the epidemic are not limited to medical aspects, as the virus has led to significant sociological, psychological and economic effects globally. Unfortunately, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to numerous reports of Asians being subjected to racist behavior and hate crimes across the world.","Yang, Yongshi; Peng, Fujun; Wang, Runsheng; Guan, Kai; Jiang, Taijiao; Xu, Guogang; Sun, Jinlyu; Chang, Christopher",J Autoimmun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102434; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896841120300470; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0896841120300470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32143990/,58

METHODS: Microbiological database records of all the COVID-19 diagnosed patients in the Ege University Hospital between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020, evaluated retrospectively. Patients who acquired secondary bacterial infections (SBIs) and bacterial co-infections were analyzed. Etiology and AMR data of the bacterial infections were collected. Results were also compared to control groups from pre-pandemic and pandemic era data. RESULTS: In total, 4859 positive culture results from 3532 patients were analyzed. Fifty-two (3.59%) patients had 78 SBIs and 38 (2.62%) patients had 45 bacterial co-infections among 1447 COVID-19 patients. 22/85 (25.88%) patients died who had bacterial infections. The respiratory culture-positive sample rate was 39.02% among all culture-positive samples in the COVID-19 group. There was a significant decrease in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (8.94%) compared to samples from the pre-pandemic (20.76%) and pandemic era (20.74%) (p = 0.001 for both comparisons). Interestingly, Acinetobacter baumannii was the main pathogen in the respiratory infections of COVID-19 patients (9.76%) and the rate was significantly higher than pre-pandemic (3.49%, p < 0.002) and pandemic era control groups (3.11%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Due to the low frequency of SBIs reported during the ongoing pandemic, a more careful and targeted antimicrobial prescription should be taken. While patients with COVID-19 had lower levels of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, the frequency of multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii is higher.

604581,Effect of combined strategy on mitigating air pollution in China,2021-01-14,"Abstract An intracellular defective-interfering (DI) RNA, DIssE, of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) obtained after serial high multiplicity passage of the virus was cloned and sequenced. DIssE RNA is composed of three noncontiguous genomic regions, representing the first 864 nucleotides of the Fend, an internal 748 nucleotides of the polymerase gene, and 601 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the parental MHV genome. The DIssE sequence contains one large continuous open reading frame. Two protein products from this open reading frame were identified both by in vitro translation and in DI-infected cells. Sequence comparison of DIssE and the corresponding parts of the parental virus genome revealed that DIssE had three base substitutions within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine nucleotides located at the junction of the leader and the remaining genomic sequence. The 5′ end of DIssE RNA was heterogeneous with respect to the number of UCUAA repeats within the leader sequence. The parental MHV genomic RNA appears to have extensive and stable secondary structures at the regions where DI RNA rearrangements occurred. These data suggest that MHV DI RNA may have been generated as a result of the discontinuous and nonprocessive manner of MHV RNA synthesis.","Makino, Shinji; Shieh, Chien-Kou; Soe, Lisa H.; Baker, Susan C.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682288905260; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682288905260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2845661/,58

RECENT FINDINGS: Fascioliasis is an emerging neglected zoonotic infection affecting the health and wellbeing of human populations. The burden of infection is unclear, and studies have shown the geographic expansion of fascioliasis in human and livestock likely related to climate change. The infection can be asymptomatic or present in acute or chronic forms. Regardless of the presentation, fascioliasis can be associated with long-term complications such as anemia and malnutrition. Early in the infection, antibody testing is the only tool available for diagnosis confirmation. In the chronic forms serology and stool microscopy are helpful. Other tests such as antigen detection and PCR-based methods including isothermal tests have shown promising results. Triclabendazole is the only drug available to treat Fasciola infection. However, reports of resistant infections in livestock and human threaten the clinical care and control of the infection in endemic areas. SUMMARY: Fascioliasis is an emerging infection around the world with an uncertain burden. Lack of standardization of diagnostic testing and treatment alternatives hinder treatment and control of the infection.","Caravedo, Maria Alejandra; Cabada, Miguel Mauricio",Res Rep Trop Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273878/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rrtm.s237461,58

This study was conducted over four months between 10 March 2020 and 15 July 2020 at the University of Health Sciences department at the Abdulhamid Han Training and Research Hospital Dental Services in Turkey. Sample selection A total of 137 patients were included in this study taken from a cohort of 1,516 patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test. In order to meet the inclusion criteria, patients must have been referred to the dental outpatient department and have a dental panoramic tomogram available for examination. Data analysis A new radiographic staging tool was developed by the authors, informed by previous tools. Following radiographic analysis, participants were allocated to a DD Stg (0-3). Multiple statistical analyses were conducted on the data including Pearson correlation analysis, Spearman correlation analysis and a multiple regression analysis. Results Those participants in DD Stg 3 were significantly older than the other groups; those in DD Stg 2 and 3 had significantly higher presence of chronic disease and evidence of more carious teeth. Those in DD Stg 2 and 3 had a statistically higher number of hospitalisations due to COVID-19 when compared to those in DD Stg 0 and 1, with DD Stg 3 having the highest number overall as well as having a significantly higher mortality rate. Furthermore, those in DD Stg 0 had fewer symptoms associated with COVID-19 compared to the other groups.

The acute phase of the infection may in certain individuals be followed by another longer phase of disease (long COVID) of unknown etiology probably associated in certain cases with autoimmune activation. It has been shown that COVID-19 can trigger autoantibody production and in genetically predisposed patients may cause the onset or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases. We are reporting a case of mild COVID-19 infection complicated by autoantibody production and cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms and subsequently diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (SSc). A 47-year-old man with no history of any autoimmune diseases and in good health became sick together with his family on the 12th of November with mild symptoms: tiredness, fever, cough, and sore throat. Oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. He was isolated at home and did not require hospitalization. Three weeks later he presented with clinical manifestation compatible with suspicion of SSc. He briefly presented with skin rush, periorbital edema and conjunctivitis, vomiting, dysphagia, burning sensation in the skin, above all in the fingertips and around the mouth, puffy fingers, Raynaud’s phenomenon, pain at the fingertip of the middle finger where a depressed area was noticed without a clear ulceration. ANA showed a strongly positive nucleolar pattern. Anti-PM/Scl 75 and PM/Scl 100 resulted positive. High-resolution computed tomography (HCRT) showed early stage of interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient was diagnosed with SSc based on the persistence of autoantibodies and the clinical and radiological pictures according to the ACR/EULAR classification (scores: puffy finger, 2; ILD, 2; Raynaud’s phenomenon, 3; SSc related antibodies, 3; total 10). There are several cases described in the medical literature of possible new onset of SLE after COVID-19 infection. This is the first case that describes a possible new onset of SSc.

A web-based survey was distributed twice to all Norwegian shelters (N = 46): first during the lockdown in spring 2020 and second during the relaxation of infection control measures in summer 2020. The shelters in Norway remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority saw a reduction in the number of requests during the lockdown, while the rates returned to normal when the strictest infection control measures were lifted. They expressed concern about the decline in requests during the lockdown as well as the well-being of some groups, such as victims from ethnic minority backgrounds, children, and victims with additional challenges. A majority of the shelters did not report changes in the content of the requests. Nevertheless, a third of them had observed instances of the virus and/or infection control measures being used by perpetrators as part of the violence and coercive control strategies. The shelters in Norway, as an integrated part of the welfare state, in general seem to have met the needs of their clients during the pandemic. Yet, the study revealed important inequalities and deficiencies in access to services for some groups, and in the general support and recognition by authorities of the shelters.","Bergman, Solveig; Bjørnholt, Margunn; Helseth, Hannah",J Fam Violence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33846666/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-021-00273-6,58

Design: Retrospective ecological study using routinely collected national and regional surveillance data from eight Public Health England coordinated laboratory, outbreak and syndromic surveillance systems using key dates of UK governmental policy change to assign phases for comparison between 2020 and historic data. Results: Decreases in GI illness activity were observed across all surveillance indicators as COVID-19 cases began to peak. Compared to the 5-year average (2015-2019), during the first six months of the COVD-19 response, there was a 52% decrease in GI outbreaks reported (1,544 vs. 3,208 (95% CI: 2,938 - 3,478) and a 34% decrease in laboratory confirmed cases (27,859 vs. 42,495 (95% CI: 40,068 - 44,922). GI indicators began to rise during the first lockdown and lockdown easing, although all remained substantially lower than historic figures. Reductions in laboratory confirmed cases were observed across all age groups and both sexes, with geographical heterogeneity observed in diagnosis trends. Health seeking behaviour changed substantially, with attendances decreasing prior to lockdown across all indicators. Conclusions: There has been a marked change in trends of GI infections in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The drivers of this change are likely to be multifactorial; while changes in health seeking behaviour, pressure on diagnostic services and surveillance system ascertainment have undoubtably played a role there has likely been a true decrease in the incidence for some pathogens resulting from the control measures and restrictions implemented. This suggests that if some of these changes in behaviour such as improved hand hygiene were maintained, then we could potentially see sustained reductions in the burden of GI illness.","Love, N.

By real-time RT-PCR analysis of 986 biological samples collected from cattle herd with clinical signs suggestive of pestivirus infection and from animals recruited in a pestivirus surveillance programme, 165 pestivirus positive samples were detected, including 6 specimens, 2 nasal swabs, and 4 EDTA–blood samples, that tested negative by a gel-based RT-PCR assay targeting the 5′UTR. The developed TaqMan assay represents a new reliable and effective tool for rapid and sensitive diagnosis of infections caused by all pestiviruses circulating in cattle, thus being useful for extensive surveillance programs in geographic areas where HoBi-like pestiviruses are co-circulating with BVDV-1 and BVDV-2.","Losurdo, Michele; Mari, Viviana; Lucente, Maria Stella; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Padalino, Iolanda; Cavaliere, Nicola; Buonavoglia, Canio; Decaro, Nicola",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341500289X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26300370/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341500289X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.08.013,58

However, effective therapeutic methods are currently lacking. The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) has been demonstrated to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production and control inflammation in sepsis and other medical conditions. Therefore, the CAP may be a potential and effective therapeutic method for COVID-19-related myocarditis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey questionnaire was completed by 942 students at a university campus in Suwon, Korea, between December 1 and 8, 2009. The survey included questions regarding individual perceptions, motivating factors, and behaviors associated with hand washing for the prevention of H1N1 influenza transmission. RESULTS: Compared to one year prior, 30.3% of participants reported increasing their hand washing frequency. Female students were more likely to practice more frequent hand washing. Women also perceived the effectiveness of hand washing to be lower, and illness severity and personal susceptibility to H1N1 infection to be higher. Study participants who were female (OR: 1.79-3.90) who perceived of hand washing to be effective (OR: 1.34-12.15) and illness severity to be greater (OR: 1.00-3.12) washed their hands more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Korean students increased their frequency of hand hygiene practices during the pandemic, with significant gender differences existing in the attitudes and behaviors related to the use of hand hygiene as a means of disease prevention. Here, the factors that affected hand washing behavior were similar to those identified at the beginning of the H1N1 or SARS pandemics, suggesting that public education campaigns regarding hand hygiene are effective in altering individual hand hygiene habits during the peak periods of influenza transmission.","Park, Jae-Hyun; Cheong, Hae-Kwan; Son, Dae-Yong; Kim, Seon-Ung; Ha, Chang-Min",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663229/,58

With the increasing number of patients in prone position, both spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated, cardiac arrest in this position is more likely to occur. This scoping review aimed to summarize the available evidence on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in prone position (‘reverse CPR’) and knowledge or research gaps to be further evaluated. The protocol of this scoping review was prospectively registered on 10th May 2020 in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/nfuh9). METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and pre-print repositories (bioRxiv and medRxiv) for simulation, pre-clinical and clinical studies on reverse CPR until 31st May 2020. RESULTS: We included 1 study on manikins, 31 case reports (29 during surgery requiring prone position) and 2 nonrandomized studies describing reverse CPR. No studies were found regarding reverse CPR in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Even if the algorithms provided by the guidelines on basic and advanced life support remain valid in cardiac arrest in prone position, differences exist in the methods of performing CPR. There is no clear evidence of superiority in terms of effectiveness of reverse compared to supine CPR in patients with cardiac arrest occurring in prone position. The quality of evidence is low and knowledge gaps (e.g. protocols, training of healthcare personnel, devices for skill acquisition) should be fulfilled by further research. Meanwhile, a case-by-case evaluation of patient and setting characteristics should guide the decision on how to start CPR in such cases.","Moscarelli, Alessandra; Iozzo, Pasquale; Ippolito, Mariachiara; Catalisano, Giulia; Gregoretti, Cesare; Giarratano, Antonino; Baldi, Enrico; Cortegiani, Andrea",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720307919?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720307919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33046293/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.08.097,58

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 present with diverse symptoms related to the severity of the disease. Determining the proteomic changes associated with these diverse symptoms and in different stages of infection is beneficial for clinical diagnosis and management. Here, we performed a tandem mass tag-labeling proteomic study on the plasma of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients, including those with asymptomatic infection (NS), mild syndrome, and severe syndrome in the early phase and the later phase. Although the number of patients included in each group is low, our comparative proteomic analysis revealed that complement and coagulation cascades, cholesterol metabolism, and glycolysis-related proteins were affected after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Compared to healthy controls, ELISA analysis confirmed that SOD1, PRDX2, and LDHA levels were increased in the patients with severe symptoms. Both gene set enrichment analysis and receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated that SOD1 could be a pivotal indicator for the severity of COVID-19. Our results indicated that plasma proteome changes differed based on the symptoms and disease stages and SOD1 could be a predictor protein for indicating COVID-19 progression.

Respiratory infectious diseases affect not only the person infected but also the family members and the society. As medical sciences advance, several diseases have been conquered; however, the impact of novel infectious diseases on the society is enormous. As the clinical presentation of respiratory infections is similar regardless of the pathogen, the causative agent is not distinguishable by symptoms alone. Moreover, it is difficult to develop a cure because of the various viral mutations. Various respiratory infectious diseases ranging from influenza, which threaten the health of mankind globally, to the coronavirus disease 2019, which resulted in a pandemic, exist. Contrary to human expectations that development in health care and improvement in hygiene will conquer infectious diseases, humankind’s health and social systems are threatened by novel infectious diseases. Owing to the development of transport and trading activity, the rate of spread of new infectious diseases is increasing.

Several significant decisions were made to postpone or cancel major swimming events by FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation). Swimmers were no longer allowed to continue their usual training in swimming pools and were confined to their homes. These unusual circumstances may represent a good opportunity to strengthen different areas of swimmer preparation and potentially enhance performance when resuming regular aquatic training. We searched major databases for relevant information, and the present article provides practical information on home-based training for swimmers of all ages. The COVID-19 crisis and its consequences on the swimming community have created a myriad of challenges for swimmers around the world, including maintaining their fitness level and preparing to return optimally and safely to pool training and competitions. Unfortunately, the mental consequences that might arise after the pandemic may also have an impact.

The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19. RESULTS: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P < .001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. In-hospital mortality was higher during COVID-19 (7.5% vs 5.1%; unadjusted OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.07-2.11; P < .001); this association remained after adjustment for confounders (risk-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.12-3.14; P = .017). In the 2020 cohort, there was a 6.3% incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The number of STEMI patients treated during the current COVID-19 outbreak fell vs the previous year and there was an increase in the median time from symptom onset to reperfusion and a significant 2-fold increase in the rate of in-hospital mortality. No changes in reperfusion strategy were detected, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention performed for the vast majority of patients.

In this paper, we propose a robust big data analytics platform for real time patient monitoring and decision making to help both hospital and medical staff. The proposed platform relies on big data technologies and data analysis techniques and consists of four layers: real time patient monitoring, real time decision and data storage, patient classification and disease diagnosis, and data retrieval and visualization. To evaluate the performance of our platform, we implemented our platform based on the Hadoop ecosystem and we applied the proposed algorithms over real health data. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our platform in terms of efficiently performing patient classification and disease diagnosis in healthcare applications.","Harb, Hassan; Mroue, Hussein; Mansour, Ali; Nasser, Abbass; Motta Cruz, Eduardo",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20071931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32235657/,58

There are ILDs with known causes and those that are idiopathic, making treatment strategies challenging. Prognosis can vary according to the type of ILD, but many exhibit gradual progression with an unpredictable clinical course in individual patients, as seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the phenomenon of “acute exacerbation”(AE). Given the often poor prognosis of these patients, the search for a reversible cause of respiratory worsening remains paramount. Infections have been theorized to play a role in ILDs, both in the pathogenesis of ILD and as potential triggers of AE. Research efforts thus far have shown the highest association with viral pathogens; however, fungal and bacterial organisms have also been implicated. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the role of infections in the setting of ILD.","Azadeh, Natalya; Limper, Andrew H.; Carmona, Eva M.; Ryu, Jay H.",Chest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28400116/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001236921730702X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001236921730702X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2017.03.033,58

We assessed the role of socioeconomic and cultural norms in accelerating or decelerating uptake and utilisation of health technologies into policy and practice. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary level healthcare facilities (HCFs) in three East African countries. Level of HCF was selected based on the WHO recommendation for implantation of tuberculosis (TB) molecular diagnostics. PARTICIPANTS: Using implementation of TB diagnostics as a model, we purposively selected participants (TB patients, carers, survivors, healthcare practitioners, community members, opinion leaders and policy-makers) based on their role as stakeholders. In-depth interviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were held to collect the data between 2016 and 2018. The data were transcribed, translated, coded and analysed by thematic-content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 712 individuals participated in the study. Socioeconomic and cultural factors such as poverty, stigma and inadequate knowledge about causes of disease and available remedies, cultural beliefs were associated with low access and utilisation of diagnostic and treatment tools for TB. Poverty made people hesitate to seek formal healthcare resulting in delayed diagnosis and resorting to self-medication and cheap herbal alternatives. Fear of stigma made people hide their sickness and avoid reporting for follow-up treatment visits. Inadequate knowledge and beliefs were fertile ground for aggravated stigma and believing that diseases like TB are caused by spirits and thus cured by spiritual rituals or religious prayers. Cultural norms were also the basis of gender-based imbalance in accessing care, ‘I could not go to hospital without my husband’s permission’, TB survivor. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that socioeconomic and cultural factors are substantial ‘roadblocks’ to accelerating the uptake and utilisation of diagnostic and treatment tools. Resolving these barriers should be given equal attention as is to health system barriers.","Msoka, Elizabeth F; Orina, Fred; Sanga, Erica Samson; Miheso, Barbara; Mwanyonga, Simeon; Meme, Helen; Kiula, Kiula; Liyoyo, Alphonce; Mwebaza, Ivan; Aturinde, Augustus; Joloba, Moses; Mmbaga, Blandina; Amukoye, Evans; Ntinginya, Nyanda Elias; Gillespie, Stephen H; Sabiiti, Wilber",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253677/,58

Two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in respiratory tract specimens is required for the evaluation of discharge from hospital, and oropharyngeal swabs were the most common sample. However, false negative results occurred in the late stage of hospitalization, and avoiding false negative result is critical essential. Methods We reviewed the medical record of 353 patients who received tests with both specimens simultaneously, and compared the performance between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Results Of the 353 patients (outpatients, 192; inpatients, 161) studied, the median age was 54 years, and 177 (50.1%) were women. Higher positive rate (positive tests/total tests) was observed in nasopharyngeal swabs than oropharyngeal swabs, especially in inpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from inpatients showed higher positive rate than outpatients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from male showed higher positive rate than female, especially in outpatients. Detection with both specimens slightly increased the positive rate than nasopharyngeal swab only. Moreover, the consistency between from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were poor (Kappa=0.308). Conclusion In conclusion, our study suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may be more suitable than oropharyngeal swab at this stage of COVID-19 outbreak.","Wang, Xiong; Tan, Li; Wang, Xu; Liu, Weiyong; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302356?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302356; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315809/,58

Interventions are often effective in increasing spoken communication for some of these children. Clinical and research decisions would be facilitated by identifying early indicators of progress in interventions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between speech sound measures obtained from the early phases of treatment and later treatment outcomes in children with autism and minimal verbal skills. METHODS: Twenty-three children (18 boys) between 5 and 9 years of age participated. We compared scores reflecting the phonemic features of word attempts produced during probes, and the number of correct words after 4 weeks of intervention to later word learning outcomes. RESULTS: Correlational and hierarchical regression analyses showed that both predictors were positively correlated with outcomes, but the phonemic scores were more strongly related than number of correct words. CONCLUSION: We conclude that phonemic scoring may be a useful measure to determine proximal gains in a spoken word learning intervention. Proximal measures are particularly helpful when trying to decide if the current course of intervention should be maintained or altered.

In order to fully understand the potential severity of these policies, I situate this critique in the historical and contemporary context of the problematic relationship between consent and vaginal examinations. Identifying the legal wrongs associated with performing coerced vaginal examinations, I highlight that the law is inadequately equipped to provide appropriate redress.

Home-based exercise has aroused people’s attention. This paper aims to examine the influencing mechanism of health consciousness on home-based exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire method was used to select 449 Chinese respondents on an online platform; the questionnaire includes a health consciousness scale, health life goal scale, perceived behavioral control scale, and the home-based exercise scale. A T-test was used to conduct differential analysis. The hierarchical regression analysis method was used to examine the relationship between health consciousness and home-based exercise, and the Hayes’ SPSS PROCESS macro was used to test mediating effect. The results show that there are significant differences in home-based exercise with respect to gender, age, and marital status. Health consciousness has a significant positive effect on home-based exercise. Perceived behavioral control acts as the mediator between health consciousness and home-based exercise. Health consciousness can influence home-based exercise through health life goals and perceived behavioral control in turn. This paper takes a home-based exercise survey, and expands the theoretical research of home-based exercise. The findings suggest that people should pay attention to promoting the transformation of health consciousness into home-based exercise.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orthodontic clinical cases were presented to 149 undergraduate dental students for discussion among teammates. Responses were collected using ARS-based and paper-based. ARS was constructed from an online survey platform (Google forms) then QR code was created for easy and fast access. Students used their cellphones to scan code, view questions, discuss, type, and submit answers within 10 minutes. Feedbacks were collected using a feedback survey. Outcome measures included the number of words, spelling mistakes, time required by the instructor to read submissions, and activity time compliance. RESULTS: The average number of words submitted by females in ARS-based 47 ± 8 was significantly higher than 35 ± 16 paper-based, and male ARS-based 36 ± 18 (P < 0.05). ARS-based submissions required significantly less time to read compared to paper-based among whole group, females, males (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.001), respectively. Spelling mistakes were lower 1 ± 1 in ARS-based compared to paper-based 2 ± 2. The ARS-based first submission was (-4.28) minutes before the deadline, while paper-based last submission was (+2.19) minutes after (P < 0.05). ARS-based submissions were 12.5 seconds faster to read than paper-based (P < 0.001). Out of 56.4% of respondents, 63.1% preferred using ARS-based and 80% agreed that it provided immediate feedback, with high overall satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This innovated ARS was found to facilitate CBL. It is superior in time and cost-saving to paper-based and other ARSs.

However, the reasons for this are still unclear and we cannot rule out children’s role in transmitting the disease. The serious impact that restrictive measures have had on children’s lives have not been fully considered.

643070,A review of big data and medical research,2020-06-25,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although the chikungunya virus was discovered more than 60 years ago, it has only really been studied since the outbreak in La Reunion in 2005–2006. Ten years later, between 2014 and 2015, the chikungunya virus spread throughout the Americas, affecting millions of people. The objective of this review is to describe the contributions of research on chikungunya virus infection gained from epidemic in the West Indies and the Guiana Shield. RECENT FINDINGS: Prevalence data were similar to those found in the Indian Ocean or Asia during epidemics. Clinically, there is now a better understanding of the typical, atypical, and severe forms. Several studies have insisted on the presence of neurological forms of chikungunya infection, such as encephalitis or Guillain–Barré syndrome. Cases of septic shock due to chikungunya virus as well as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were described for the first time. Given the magnitude of the epidemic and the large number of people affected, this has led to a better description and new classifications of chikungunya virus infections in specific populations such as pregnant women, the elderly, and children. Several studies also described the behavior of populations faced with an emerging disease. SUMMARY: Current epidemiological data from tropical regions highlights the risk of spreading emerging diseases at higher latitudes, especially concerning arboviruses, since the vector Aedes albopictus is already established in many parts of northern countries. A better understanding of the disease and its epidemic dynamics will foster better management, the crucial importance of which was demonstrated during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Bonifay, Timothee; Godaert, Lidvine; Epelboin, Yanouk; Rousset, Dominique; Douine, Maylis; Hilderal, Hélène; Clavel, Cyril; Abel, Sylvie; Najioullah, Fatiha; Fagour, Laurence; do Socorro Mendonça Gomes, Margarete; Lacerda, Marcus; Cézaire, Raymond; Elenga, Narcisse; Dramé, Moustapha; Hoen, Bruno; Cabié, André; Djossou, Félix; Epelboin, Loïc",Curr Trop Med Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178576/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00242-5,58

Identifying a reliable and fast diagnostic device is needed for effective testing. We assessed performance and ease-of-use of the Abbott PanBio antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT). METHODS: This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study enrolled at two sites in Germany. Following routine testing with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a second study-exclusive swab was performed for Ag-RDT testing. Routine swabs were nasopharyngeal (NP) or combined NP/oropharyngeal (OP) whereas the study-exclusive swabs were NP. To evaluate performance, sensitivity and specificity were assessed overall and in predefined sub-analyses accordingly to cycle-threshold values, days after symptom onset, disease severity and study site. Additionally, an ease-of-use assessment (EoU) and System Usability Scale (SUS) were performed. RESULTS: 1108 participants were enrolled between Sept 28 and Oct 30, 2020. Of these, 106 (9.6%) were PCR-positive. The Abbott PanBio detected 92/106 PCR-positive participants with a sensitivity of 86.8% (95% CI: 79.0% - 92.0%) and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.4%-100%). The sub-analyses indicated that sensitivity was 95.8% in Ct-values <25 and within the first seven days from symptom onset. The test was characterized as easy to use (SUS: 86/100) and considered suitable for point-of-care settings.

In the present study, changes in the spleen proteome at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection in response to MDV infection were studied using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using one-dimensional liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (1D LC ESI MS/MS). Comparative analysis of multiple gels revealed that the majority of changes had occurred at early stages of the disease. In total, 61 protein spots representing 48 host proteins were detected as either quantitatively (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2) or qualitatively differentially expressed at least once during different sampling points. Overall, the proteins identified in the present study are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as the antigen processing and presentation, ubiquitin–proteasome protein degradation (UPP), formation of the cytoskeleton, cellular metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of translation. Notably, early stages of the disease were characterized by changes in the UPP, and antigen presentation. Furthermore, changes indicative of active cell proliferation as well as apoptosis together with significant changes in cytoskeletal components that were observed throughout the experimental period suggested the complexity of the pathogenesis. The present findings provide a basis for further studies aimed at elucidation of the role of these proteins in MDV interactions with its host.","Thanthrige-Don, Niroshan; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed F.; Shack, L.

While recent studies in rodent models of AD have suggested diagnostic and therapeutic value for gamma rhythms in brain, the same has not been rigorously tested in humans. In this case-control study, we recruited a large population (N = 244; 106 females) of elderly (>49 years) subjects from the community, who viewed large gratings that induced strong gamma oscillations in their electroencephalogram (EEG). These subjects were classified as healthy (N = 227), mild cognitively impaired (MCI; N = 12), or AD (N = 5) based on clinical history and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. Surprisingly, stimulus-induced gamma rhythms, but not alpha or steady-state visually evoked responses, were significantly lower in MCI/AD subjects compared to their age- and gender-matched controls. This reduction was not due to differences in eye movements or baseline power. Our results suggest that gamma could be used as a potential screening tool for MCI/AD in humans.","Murty, Dinavahi VPS; Manikandan, Keerthana; Kumar, Wupadrasta Santosh; Ramesh, Ranjini Garani; Purokayastha, Simran; Nagendra, Bhargavi; ML, Abhishek; Balakrishnan, Aditi; Javali, Mahendra; Rao, Naren Prahalada; Ray, Supratim",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.61666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099103/,58

Methods Clinical characteristics and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from 86 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital. Chronological analysis method was used to detailly clarify the neurosensory dysfunction. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to approximately indicate viral load. Results Forth-four (51.2%) patients had neurosensory dysfunction: hyposmia (34, 39.5%), hypogeusia (33, 38.4%), and tinnitus (3, 3.5%). Neurosensory dysfunction was significantly more common in patients under 40 years old (p = 0.001) or women (p = 0.006). Hyposmia and hypogeusia coexisted in 23 (26.7%) patients. The interval between onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 0.7 ± 1.46 days. The interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to typical symptoms was 0.22 ± 4.57 and 0.75 ± 6.77 days; the interval from onset of hyposmia and hypogeusia to admission was 6.06 ± 6.68 and 5.76 ± 7.68 days; and the duration of hyposmia and hypogeusia was 9.09 ± 5.74 and 7.12 ± 4.66 days, respectively. The viral load was high since symptoms onset, peaked within the first week, and then gradually declined. Conclusions The neurosensory dysfunction tends to occur in the early stage of COVID-19, and it could be used as a marker for early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Liang, Yujie; Xu, Jiabin; Chu, Mei; Mai, Jianbo; Lai, Niangmei; Tang, Wen; Yang, Tuanjie; Zhang, Sien; Guan, Chenyu; Zhong, Fan; Yang, Liuping; Liao, Guiqing",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220305191?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.086; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220305191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32615326/,58

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is currently causing a worldwide pandemic, pointing the urgent need for effective treatment. In such emergency, drug repurposing presents the best option for a rapid antiviral response. We assess here the in vitro activity of nilotinib, imatinib and dasatinib, three Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors, against SARS‐CoV‐2. Although the last two compounds do not show antiviral efficacy, we observe inhibition with nilotinib in Vero‐E6 cells and Calu‐3 cells with EC50s of 1.44 μM and 3.06 μM, respectively. These values are close to the mean peak concentration of nilotinib observed at steady state in serum, making this compound a potential candidate for treatment of COVID‐19 in vivo.","Cagno, Valeria; Magliocco, Gaelle; Tapparel, Caroline; Daali, Youssef",Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232578/,58

In Muslim countries, most people who use e-cigarettes fast the month of Ramadan, which results in intermittent fasting. This study aims to reveal the severity of e-cig withdrawal symptoms among users during this intermittent fasting period. METHODS: A self-administered survey was developed and validated to solicit anonymous responses from e-cig users living in Jordan, through a cross-sectional study design. Participants were recruited through social media resources. Severity scores of physical (out of 11) and psychological (out of 8) withdrawal symptoms for each participant were assessed and calculated for each participant, depending on the symptoms reported. RESULTS: A convenience sample (n = 523) of e-cig adult users were recruited. The majority of the participants were males (96.4%) aged between 18 and 40 years (86.4%). Many participants replaced tobacco smoking with e-cig (53.5%) in order to help them stop smoking. More than half of the participants experienced relatively weak physical (0.82 ± 1.78) and psychological (1.24 ± 1.89) withdrawal symptoms during the month of fasting. Most of the participants (63.2%) preferred to engage themselves with a busy schedule to tolerate the related withdrawal symptoms they experienced. CONCLUSION: E-cigs could play a vital role in smoking cessation among tobacco smokers during intermittent fasting. Ramadan offers a good opportunity for smokers to quit, as the reported physical and psychological e-cig withdrawal symptoms were found to be relatively weak. Awareness and behavioral interventions would help clarify the effect of e-cigs and help determine alternative ways to cease smoking.","Barakat, Muna M.; Al-Qudah, Raja’a A.; Alfayoumi, Ibrahim; Al-Obaidi, Hala Jehad; Jirjees, Feras Jassim; Basheti, Iman",Addict Sci Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33546764/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-021-00219-9,58

We aimed to develop and validate a clinical risk score for predicting mortality at the time of admission of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Collaborating with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), we established a prospective consecutive cohort of 5,628 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to 120 hospitals in Korea between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The cohort was randomly divided using a 7:3 ratio into a development (n = 3,940) and validation (n = 1,688) set. Clinical information and complete blood count (CBC) detected at admission were investigated using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-Mortality Score). The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality was 4.3% in both the development and validation set. A COVID-Mortality Score consisting of age, sex, body mass index, combined comorbidity, clinical symptoms, and CBC was developed. AUCs of the scoring system were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85–0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84–0.93) in the development and validation set, respectively. If the model was optimized for > 90% sensitivity, accuracies were 81.0% and 80.2% with sensitivities of 91.7% and 86.1% in the development and validation set, respectively.

Currently, little is known about the extent to which distinct tissue sites in the human head & neck region and proximal respiratory tract selectively permit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. In this translational study, we discover key variabilities in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, essential SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, among the mucosal tissues of the human proximal airways. We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is present in all examined head & neck tissues, with a notable tropism for the nasal cavity and tracheal mucosa. Finally, we uncover an association between smoking and higher SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in the human proximal airway, which may explain the increased susceptibility of smokers to developing severe COVID-19. This is at least partially explained by differences in IFN-β1 levels between smokers and non-smokers.","Nakayama, Tsuguhisa; Lee, Ivan T.; Jiang, Sizun; Matter, Matthias S.; Yan, Carol H.; Overdevest, Jonathan B.; Wu, Chien-Ting; Goltsev, Yury; Shih, Liang-Chun; Liao, Chun-Kang; Zhu, Bokai; Bai, Yunhao; Lidsky, Peter; Xiao, Yinghong; Zarabanda, David; Yang, Angela; Easwaran, Meena; Schürch, Christian M.; Chu, Pauline; Chen, Han; Stalder, Anna K.; McIlwain, David R.; Borchard, Nicole A.; Gall, Phil A.; Dholakia, Sachi S.; Le, Wei; Xu, Le; Tai, Chih-Jaan; Yeh, Te-Huei; Erickson-Direnzo, Elizabeth; Duran, Jason M.; Mertz, Kirsten D.; Hwang, Peter H.; Haslbauer, Jasmin D.; Jackson, Peter K.; Menter, Thomas; Andino, Raul; Canoll, Peter D.; DeConde, Adam S.; Patel, Zara M.; Tzankov, Alexandar; Nolan, Garry P.; Nayak, Jayakar V.",Cell Rep Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604819/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379121002834?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100421; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666379121002834,58

Acute Respiratory Discomfort Syndrome (ARDS) is the most common immunopathological event in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. Fast lung deterioration results of cytokine storm determined by a robust immunological response leading to ARDS and multiple organ failure. Here, we show cysteine protease Cathepsin L (CatL) involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 from different points of view. CatL is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in numerous physiological processes, including apoptosis, antigen processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling. CatL is implicated in pathological conditions like invasion and metastasis of tumors, inflammatory status, atherosclerosis, renal disease, diabetes, bone diseases, viral infection, and other diseases. CatL expression is up-regulated during chronic inflammation and is involved in degrading extracellular matrix, an important process for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells. In addition, CatL is probably involved in processing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As its inhibition is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly exit from cells during late stages of infection, CatL could have been considered a valuable therapeutic target. Therefore, we describe here some drugs already in the market with potential CatL inhibiting capacity that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients. In addition, we discuss the possible role of host genetics in the etiology and spreading of the disease.","Gomes, Caio P.; Fernandes, Danilo E.; Casimiro, Fernanda; da Mata, Gustavo F.; Passos, Michelle T.; Varela, Patricia; Mastroianni-Kirsztajn, Gianna; Pesquero, João Bosco",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.589505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364201/,58

The research findings were grouped into four themes: Satisfaction with distance education, barriers of distance education, facilitating aspects of distance education, and concerns about professional career. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Distance education in midwifery education in Turkey was found to have aspects involving obstacles and concerns in addition to many pleasing and facilitating features. Our findings suggest distance education can be used together with face-to-face education provided that its pleasing and facilitating aspects are supported and the obstacles and factors causing concerns are removed. Inclusion of distance methods in midwifery programs requires curricula to be updated and support from instructors and students for the development of the necessary infrastructure.

Here, we proposed a simple but sensitive on-site testing method based on spike protein-conjugated quantum dot (QD) nanotag-integrated lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG in human serum. Advanced silica-core@dual QD-shell nanocomposites (SiO2@DQD) with superior luminescence and stability were prepared to serve as fluorescent nanotags in the LFA strip and guarantee high sensitivity and reliability of the assay. The performance of the SiO2@DQD-strip was fully optimized and confirmed by using 10 positive serum samples from COVID-19 patients and 10 negative samples from patients with other respiratory diseases. The practical clinical value of the assay was further evaluated by testing 316 serum samples (114 positive and 202 negative samples). The overall detection sensitivity and specificity reached 97.37% (111/114) and 95.54% (193/202), respectively, indicating the huge potential of our proposed method for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons and asymptomatic carriers.","Wang, Chongwen; Shi, Dawei; Wan, Nan; Yang, Xingsheng; Liu, Haifeng; Gao, Huixia; Zhang, Minli; Bai, Zikun; Li, Dingchen; Dai, Erhei; Rong, Zhen; Wang, Shengqi",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1an00304f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970172/,58

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical “droplet precaution” to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of “environmental droplet contamination” (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote “public droplet safety,” we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal “community droplet reduction solution” is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 “social distancing.” All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30 cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10 cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a “community droplet reduction solution” (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19.","Rodriguez-Palacios, Alex; Cominelli, Fabio; Basson, Abigail R.; Pizarro, Theresa T.; Ilic, Sanja",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574342/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00260,58

Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 hours and 48 hours of infection. We simulated the viral infection by spiking in recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range.

667460,Online Black-Markets: An Investigation of a Digital Infrastructure in the Dark,2021-09-21,"In this literature review, the antipathogenic properties and contact-mediated antibacterial and antiviral performance of copper cold spray surfaces are assessed and compared with alternative antimicrobial materials that are able to kill and/or inactivate infectious agents via direct contact. Discussion is also provided concerning the suitability of copper cold spray material consolidations as biocidal and viricidal surfaces that retain long-term functionality as a preventative measure against fomite transmission of pathogenic agents and hospital-acquired infections from contaminated high-touch surfaces. Numerable alternative antimicrobial coatings and surfaces that do not rely upon the oligodynamic action of copper are detailed. Given the ongoing need for recognition of said alternative antimicrobial materials by authoritative agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the relevant literature on non-copper-based antipathogenic coatings and surfaces are then described. Furthermore, a wide-ranging take on antipathogenic copper cold spray coatings are provided and consideration is given to the distinctive grain-boundary mediated copper ion diffusion pathways found in optimizable, highly deformed, copper cold spray material consolidations that enable pathogen inactivation on surfaces from direct contact. To conclude this literature review, analysis of how copper cold spray coatings can be employed as a preventative measure against COVID-19 was also presented in light of on-going debates surrounding SARS-CoV-2’s non-primary, but non-negligible, secondary transmission pathway, and also presented in conjunction with the inevitability that future pathogens, which will be responsible for forthcoming global pandemics, may spread even more readily via fomite pathways too.","Sousa, Bryer C.; Massar, Christopher J.; Gleason, Matthew A.; Cote, Danielle L.",J Biol Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627170/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13036-021-00256-7,58
670258,The interplay of circular economy with industry 4.0 enabled smart city drivers of healthcare waste disposal,2020-08-22,"Are countries at a low level of socio-economic development catching up with developed countries over time or rather falling further behind? Existing work on the subject is not conclusive, partially due to methodological differences. The aim of the paper is to carry out a broader analysis with longer time series and a more diverse set of indicators. The study divides countries of the world into 21 developed “benchmark” countries and 156 developing countries. The distance between the benchmark and developing countries is measured using the “time lags” method, applied here to nine indicators covering topics such as the economy, health, education and the environment. The study further utilizes a probabilistic approach to extrapolate missing historical data for developing countries, so that the analysis can cover a full century starting in 1920 and ending with short-term projections to year 2020. The study finds that a majority of developing countries, and the population-weighted developing world as a whole, has reduced its lag in most indicators between 1920 and 2020. Progress was unevenly distributed, with East Asian and European countries converging the most with the benchmark, while most African countries have diverged along with some American ones. Catch-up in education attainment and life expectancy has been more successful than in infant survival rate, GDP per capita or technology adoption. The findings are put in context of United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, showing how the time lag method could improve setting targets for some of the goals. Further, time lags are used to analyze the current demographic, economic and political situation of developing countries, identifying opportunities and risks for future catch-up with developed countries.

ICES case study",2020-09-30,"Abstract Objectives Sophisticated epidemic models have been created to help governments and large healthcare organisations plan the necessary resources to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst helpful, current modelling systems are not widely accessible or easily adapted to different populations and circumstances. Our objective was to develop a widely applicable, easily accessible, adaptable model for projecting new COVID-19 infections and deaths that requires minimal expertise or resources to use. The model should be adaptable to different populations and able to accommodate social and pharmaceutical interventions as well as changes in the disease. Design A Susceptible, Infected and Removed (SIR) infectious disease model was created using widely available Microsoft Excel software. The model is deterministic, generating projections based on the available data and assumptions made. It uses a process of Monitored Forecasting through Visual Matching of predicated vs observed curves to improve accuracy and facilitate adaptability. A review of the COVID-19 literature was performed in order to produce an initial set of adjustable parameters on which to base the output of the model. Setting This model can be adapted to different regions or countries for which the requisite input data (population size and number of deaths due to the disease) are available. This model has been successfully used with data from England, Sudan and Saudi Arabia. Data from NHS England were used for producing the illustrative results presented here. The model is a generic infectious disease forecast model which may be adapted to other epidemics. Intervention Governments, public health organisations, pharmaceutical companies and other public institutions may introduce interventions that affect disease transmission or severity. Other unknown factors such as new variants of the infective agent may do the same. The effects of changes in disease transmission are identified by the model when predicted and observed curves deviate. By aligning the curves an evaluation of the effect of the changes can be made. Outcome Measures The model graphically demonstrates projections for daily deaths, cumulative deaths, case mix (asymptomatic, symptomatic and severe infections requiring admission), hospital admissions and bed occupancy (ICU, general medical and total). Results The model successfully produced projections for the outcome measures using NHS England data. Users can adapt and continuously update the model correcting its projections as further local data becomes available. The Microsoft Excel platform allows the model to be used without expensive health information systems or computing infrastructure. Conclusion We present an SIR epidemic model that projects COVID-19 disease progression, is widely accessible, adaptable to different populations and environments as the disease progresses and is likely to be of benefit for identifying changing population healthcare needs.","Osman, I.; Baker, M.

Conventional tests routinely available at most institutions are limited by the number of detectable pathogens, by a poor sensitivity and/or a long turnaround time. OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of routine conventional testing with direct fluorescent antibody assays and viral culture to a customized TaqMan® array card (TAC) real-time PCR method, targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria and 2 fungi simultaneously. STUDY DESIGN: We collected 143 respiratory samples from 120 symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Samples for which conventional and TAC results were discordant underwent further verification testing. RESULTS: The TAC assay identified viral pathogens in more samples than did conventional testing (77/143 versus 27/143; McNemar P < 0.0001), even when TAC results for viruses that could not be detected by conventional testing were excluded from analysis (59/143 versus 26/143; P < 0.0001). In addition, the TAC assay identified 18 samples with non-viral pathogens. Verification testing confirmed positive TAC results for 50 out of 55 samples for which conventional testing was negative. Two out of three samples with a positive conventional test but negative TAC result were confirmed positive. A viral and a total pathogen co-infection rate of 5.6% and 11.8% were found, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The customized TAC assay resulted in a significantly increased identification of respiratory viruses. This study provides a practical real-life assessment of the performance of the TAC assay in a population for whom rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral and atypical pathogens is crucial for appropriate clinical management.","Steensels, Deborah; Reynders, Marijke; Descheemaeker, Patrick; Curran, Martin D.; Jacobs, Frédérique; Denis, Olivier; Delforge, Marie-Luce; Montesinos, Isabel",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26364158/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215006575; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.08.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215006575,58

Noncoding RNAs serve as immune regulators and thus may play a critical role in disease progression. METHODS: We performed multi‐transcriptome sequencing of both noncoding RNAs and mRNAs isolated from the red blood cell depleted whole blood of moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients. The functions of noncoding RNAs were validated by analyses of the expression of downstream mRNAs. We further utilized the single‐cell RNA‐seq data of COVID‐19 patients from Wilk et al. and Chua et al. to characterize noncoding RNA functions in different cell types. RESULTS: We defined four types of microRNAs with different expression tendencies that could serve as biomarkers for COVID‐19 progress. We also identified miR‐146a‐5p, miR‐21‐5p, miR‐142‐3p, and miR‐15b‐5p as potential contributors to the disease pathogenesis, possibly serving as biomarkers of severe COVID‐19 and as candidate therapeutic targets. In addition, the transcriptome profiles consistently suggested hyperactivation of the immune response, loss of T‐cell function, and immune dysregulation in severe patients. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the noncoding and coding transcriptional landscape of peripheral immune cells during COVID‐19, furthering our understanding and offering novel insights into COVID‐19 pathogenesis.","Tang, Hao; Gao, Yuehan; Li, Zhaohuai; Miao, Yushan; Huang, Zhaohao; Liu, Xiuxing; Xie, Lihui; Li, He; Wen, Wen; Zheng, Yingfeng; Su, Wenru",Clin Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135345/,58

Contaminated environments, such as personal items and room surfaces, are considered to have virus transmission potential. Ultraviolet C (UVC) light has demonstrated germicidal ability and removes environmental contamination. UVC has inactivated SARS-CoV-2; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. It was confirmed here that UVC 253.7 nm, with a dose of 500 μW/cm(2), completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in a time-dependent manner and reduced virus infectivity by 10(–4.9)-fold within 30 s. Immunoblotting analysis for viral spike and nucleocapsid proteins showed that UVC treatment did not damage viral proteins. The viral particle morphology remained intact even when the virus completely lost infectivity after UVC irradiation, as observed by transmission electronic microscopy. In contrast, UVC irradiation-induced genome damage was identified using the newly developed long reverse-transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, but not conventional RT-qPCR. The six developed long RT-PCR assays that covered the full-length viral genome clearly indicated a negative correlation between virus infectivity and UVC irradiation-induced genome damage (R(2) ranging from 0.75 to 0.96). Altogether, these results provide evidence that UVC inactivates SARS-CoV-2 through the induction of viral genome damage.","Lo, Chieh-Wen; Matsuura, Ryosuke; Iimura, Kazuki; Wada, Satoshi; Shinjo, Atsushi; Benno, Yoshimi; Nakagawa, Masaru; Takei, Masami; Aida, Yoko",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226623/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93231-7,58

678088,Advantages of 3PLs as healthcare supply chain orchestrators,2021-08-20,"Background/Objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, smell and taste disorders emerged as key non-respiratory symptoms. Due to widespread presence of the disease and to difficult objective testing of positive persons, the use of short surveys became mandatory. Most of the existing resources are focused on smell, very few on taste or trigeminal chemosensation called chemesthesis. However, it is possible that the three submodalities are affected differently by COVID-19. Methods: We prepared a short survey (TaSCA) that can be administered at the telephone or through online resources to explore chemosensation. It is composed of 11 items on olfaction, taste, and chemesthesis, in order to discriminate the three modalities. We avoided abstract terms, and the use of semiquantitative scales because older patients may be less engaged. Statistical handling included descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-squared test and cluster analysis. Results: The survey was completed by 83 persons (60 females and 23 males), which reported diagnosis of COVID-19 by clinical (n = 7) or molecular (n = 18) means, the others being non-COVID subjects. Cluster analysis depicted the existence of two groups, one containing mostly asymptomatic and one mostly symptomatic subjects. All swab-positive persons fell within this second group. Only one item, related to trigeminal temperature perception, did not discriminate between the two groups. Conclusions: These preliminary results indicate that TaSCA may be used to easily track chemosensory symptoms related to COVID-19 in an agile way, giving a picture of three different chemosensory modalities.","Mucignat-Caretta, Carla; Bisiacchi, Patrizia; Marcazzan, Gian Luigi; Calistri, Arianna; Parolin, Cristina; Antonini, Angelo",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.633574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716936/,58

Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting. METHODS: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. RESULTS: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0–59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51–13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11–0.97). Furthermore, patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72–15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97–39.67).

681695,AI under great uncertainty: implications and decision strategies for public policy,2021-09-07,"The way in which communication takes place has undergone significant change over the last year leading to alterations regarding the way we perceive our own personal image. Indeed, the increase in remote video interaction seems to have led to an increase in the number of requests for teleconsultations with plastic surgeons in private practice (70% in the UK and 64% in the USA), the so-called Zoom Boom. The reasons connected to this increase are still under investigation, but it is likely that patients’ greater exposure to seeing their own image in online video communication for prolonged periods has highlighted what patients perceive as flaws and/or their self-image does not correspond to the same image that they see in the mirror. However, the motivations for seeking cosmetic surgery cannot be solely attributed to seeing ourselves online more frequently; the psychological impact of the pandemic (lower moods, isolation and greater concerns) may also be to blame. Therefore, the reasons patients hope to touch-up, rejuvenate, re-do or revise their “lockdown faces” need careful attention with a view to understand the extent of which the online distortion of one’s own body image may be the underlying cause.

Detailed descriptions of the natural history of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients are paramount to optimize healthcare resource utilization, and the detection of different clinical phenotypes may allow tailored clinical management strategies. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 305 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in eight academic and community hospitals. Patient characteristics included demographics, comorbidities, medication use, medical complications, intensive care utilization, and longitudinal vital sign and laboratory test values. We examined laboratory and vital sign trends by mortality status and length of stay. To identify clinical phenotypes, we calculated Gower’s dissimilarity matrix between each patient’s clinical characteristics and clustered similar patients using the partitioning around medoids algorithm. RESULTS: One phenotype of 6 identified was characterized by high mortality (49%), older age, male sex, elevated inflammatory markers, high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and shock. Patients with this severe phenotype had significantly elevated peak C-reactive protein creatinine, D-dimer, white blood cell count and lower minimum lymphocyte count, compared with other phenotypes (p<0.01, all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of hospitalized adults, we identified a severe phenotype of COVID-19 based on the characteristics of its clinical course and poor prognosis. These findings need to be validated in other cohorts, as improved understanding of clinical phenotypes and risk factors for their development could help inform the prognosis and tailored clinical management for COVID-19.","da Silva, Juliana F; Hernandez-Romieu, Alfonso C; Browning, Sean D; Bruce, Beau B; Natarajan, Pavithra; Morris, Sapna B; Gold, Jeremy A W; Neblett Fanfair, Robyn; Rogers-Brown, Jessica; Rossow, John; Szablewski, Christine M; Oosmanally, Nadine; D’Angelo, Melissa Tobin; Drenzek, Cherie; Murphy, David J; Hollberg, Julie; Blum, James M; Jansen, Robert; Wright, David W; Sewell, William; Owens, Jack; Lefkove, Benjamin; Brown, Frank W; Burton, Deron C; Uyeki, Timothy M; Patel, Priti R; Jackson, Brendan R; Wong, Karen K",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537363/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa596,58

The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of restrictive measures in the Apulia Region, southern Italy, on air quality from March to April 2020. We applied a dual-track approach. We assessed citizen mobility and vehicle traffic with mobility network data and information obtained from satellite tracking, and we evaluated and compared pollutant concentration data as measured by monitoring stations maintained by the Regional Agency for Environmental Protection and Prevention of Apulia (ARPA). The results showed a decrease in the weekly mean NO(2) concentration recorded by urban traffic stations during the lockdown period. In particular, in the city of Bari, the average NO(2) concentration decreased from 62.2 μg/m(3) in March 2019 to 48.2 μg/m(3) in March 2020. Regarding PM10 levels, the average concentrations at the individual traffic stations showed no particular variation compared to those in the same months of the previous year, except for Bari-Caldarola Station in March 2019/2020 (p-value < 0.001) and in April 2019/2020 (p-value = 0.04). In particular the average in March 2019 was ~26.9 μg/m(3), while that in March 2020 was ~22.9 μg/m(3). For April, the average concentration of PM10 in 2019 was 27.9 μg/m(3), while in 2020, the average was ~22.4 μg/m(3). This can be explained by the fact that PM10 levels are influenced by multiple variables such as weather and climate conditions and desert dust advections.","De Maria, Luigi; Caputi, Antonio; Tafuri, Silvio; Cannone, Enza Sabrina Silvana; Sponselli, Stefania; Delfino, Maria Celeste; Pipoli, Antonella; Bruno, Vito; Angiuli, Lorenzo; Mucci, Nicola; Ledda, Caterina; Vimercati, Luigi",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928063/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.637540,58
684181,Special Section Guest Editorial: Special series guest editorial: Biomedical Imaging and Sensing III,2021-03-13,"INTRODUCTION: Disease behaviour may guide diagnosis and treatment decisions in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). STARLINER aimed to characterise disease behaviour in patients with suspected ILD during the peri-diagnostic period using real-time home-based assessments. METHODS: STARLINER (NCT03261037) was an international, multicentre study. Patients ≥ 50 years old with suspected ILD were followed throughout the peri-diagnostic period, consisting of a pre-diagnostic period (from enrolment to diagnosis) and a post-diagnostic period (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Study length was variable (≤ 18 months). The primary endpoint was time-adjusted semi-annual forced vital capacity (FVC) change measured during the peri-diagnostic period using daily home spirometry in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Secondary outcomes included changes in FVC (home spirometry) in patients with non-IPF ILD, changes in FVC (site spirometry), changes in physical functional capacity measured by daily home accelerometry and site 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and changes in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in IPF or non-IPF ILD. RESULTS: Of the 178 patients enrolled in the study, 68 patients were diagnosed with IPF, 62 patients were diagnosed with non-IPF ILD, 9 patients received a non-ILD diagnosis and 39 patients did not receive a diagnosis. Technical and analytical issues led to problems in applying the prespecified linear regression model to analyse the home FVC data. Time-adjusted median (quartile [Q]1, Q3) semi-annual FVC change during the peri-diagnostic period measured using home and site spirometry, respectively, was – 147.7 (– 723.8, 376.2) ml and – 149.0 (– 314.6, 163.9) ml for IPF and 19.1 (– 194.9, 519.0) ml and – 23.4 (– 117.9, 133.5) ml in non-IPF ILD. A greater decline in steps per day was observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD, whereas an increase in 6MWD was observed for patients with IPF versus a decline in 6MWD for patients with non-IPF ILD. No clear patterns of disease behaviour were observed for IPF versus non-IPF ILD for PROs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite home spirometry being feasible for most patients and centres, technical and analytical challenges in the home-based assessments prevented firm conclusions regarding disease behaviour. This highlights that further optimisation of the technology and analysis methods is required before widespread implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03261037.

684895,Rapid assessment of cyclone damage using NPP-VIIRS DNB and ancillary data,2021-01-05,"Climate change-induced disasters show the highest risk for agriculture and livelihoods in rural areas of developing countries. Due to changing rainfall pattern, the arid and semiarid region of Pakistan faces frequent droughts. Farming communities affected by drought disasters are causing serious threats to livelihood, global food crises, environmental migration, and sustainable development. The existing study was designed to quantify two key components through (1) analysis of agrometeorological data (1981–2017) with exploratory data analysis and Mann–Kendall trend analysis; (2) extensive field survey (200 households). The multivariate probit model has been run to detect determinants of coping and adaptive strategies by farmers. Our results showed that the farmers supposed that temperature and rainfall were highly fluctuating in recent years equally. Farmers adopted different coping and adaptive measures that include crop diversification, input adjustment, water management, asset depletion, income diversification, and migration to sustain their livelihood during stress periods. The agrometeorological data analysis revealed that the agricultural vulnerability to drought risks increased significantly, and the survey results projected that 64.7% of the population is exposed to drought directly or indirectly. Sen’s slope quantification resulted in (0.025 °C) rise in temperature, (− 2.936 mm) decline in rainfall year(−1). Modeling future scenarios resulted in an increase in temperature up to 0.7 °C, 1.2 °C, and a decrease in precipitation up to 161.48 mm, 103.5 mm in 2040 and 2060. The study evaluated a huge gap in the provision of drought risk resilience services, crop insurance, and climate-smart training practices to build capacities among farmers to cope with the impacts of extreme weather conditions. Our research might provide the groundwork to upgrade actions to drought prevention and early warning in water scarcity areas.

Clinicians are modifying the way they approach day-to-day procedures. Safety and reduction transmission risk is paramount. Surgical tracheostomies in covid19 patients are aerosol generating procedures linked with a significant risk of viral contamination. Here, we describe our local approach for these procedures, introducing the “5Ts” of safe tracheostomy practice: Theatre set-up, Team Briefing, Transfer of patient, Tracheostomy Procedure, Team Doffing and de-brief. We identify the critical steps of the procedure and explain how we overcome the risks linked with breaking the transfer circuit to link the patient to the theatre ventilator. We explain our technique to reduce secretion spillage when opening the trachea. We emphasise the importance of closed tracheal suctioning and mouth suctioning prior to patient transfer. We highlight the importance of maintaining a closed circuit throughout the procedure and describe tips on how to achieve this. We summarise the steps in our protocol in an “easy to reproduce” way. Finally, we emphasise the importance of communication in a constantly changing environment and challenging circumstances.","Damian, Broderick; Panayiotis, Kyzas; Kevin, Sanders; Alistair, Sawyerr; Chetan, Katre; Leandros, Vassiliou",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.04.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0266435620301583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32321662/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266435620301583,58

In this study, we assessed the burden of stress during the pandemic and its relationship with eating practices in a national random sample of American adults. Data were collected using an online survey and the participants were asked about their demographic characteristics, perceived stress, and eating practices in April 2020. Compared to their counterparts, average stress scores were statistically significantly higher for racial and ethnic minority individuals, those who were employed part-time, were single, lived in the Midwest, and were ≤35 years of age. More than one-tenth of the participants reported practicing more unhealthy eating practices during the pandemic lockdowns: fasting (16%), restricting eating (20%), skipping meals (25%), and overeating (39%). Concerning the overall perception of diet, nearly a third reported that their diet had worsened during the pandemic (31%). In adjusted and unadjusted analyses after controlling for demographic characteristics, stress scores were statistically significantly higher for those engaging in unhealthy eating practices and those who reported that their diet had worsened. Policymakers and public health practitioners should redouble their efforts in preventing morbidity and premature mortality by implementing interventions that address the multiple detrimental stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khubchandani, Jagdish; Kandiah, Jayanthi; Saiki, Diana",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe10040067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542428/,58

As a result, propofol can significantly contribute to caloric intake and can potentially result in complications of overfeeding for patients who receive concurrent enteral or parenteral nutrition therapy. In order to avoid potential overfeeding, some clinicians have empirically decreased the infusion rate of the nutrition therapy, which also may have detrimental effects since protein intake may be inadequate. The purpose of this review is to examine the current literature regarding these issues and provide some practical suggestions on how to restrict caloric intake to avoid overfeeding and simultaneously enhance protein intake for patients who receive either parenteral or enteral nutrition for those patients receiving concurrent propofol therapy.","Dickerson, Roland N.; Buckley, Christopher T.",Pharmacy (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9030121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287346/,58

690503,Training of clinical triage of acute radiation casualties: a performance comparison of on-site versus online training due to the covid-19 pandemic.,2021-07-13,"The COVID-19 pandemic has re-focused attention on mechanisms that lead to zoonotic disease spillover and spread. Commercial wildlife trade, and associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. We reviewed known zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife (including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes, and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these zoonoses. We discuss future concerns, and consider monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological systems. While multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate in these systems, risks to humans are mostly limited to individual illness or local community outbreaks. These regions are relatively remote, subject to very cold temperatures, have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and pathogen diversity, and in many cases low density, including of humans. Hence, favorable conditions for emergence of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are currently not present. The greatest risk to northern communities from pathogens of pandemic potential is via introduction with humans visiting from other areas. However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment, and development; all of which can change host and pathogen relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new (and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Partnering with northern communities and including Indigenous Knowledge Systems would improve the timeliness, and likelihood, of detecting emerging zoonotic risks, and contextualize risk assessments to the unique human-wildlife relationships present in northern biomes.","Keatts, Lucy O.; Robards, Martin; Olson, Sarah H.; Hueffer, Karsten; Insley, Stephen J.; Joly, Damien O.; Kutz, Susan; Lee, David S.; Chetkiewicz, Cheryl-Lesley B.; Lair, Stéphane; Preston, Nicholas D.; Pruvot, Mathieu; Ray, Justina C.; Reid, Donald; Sleeman, Jonathan M.; Stimmelmayr, Raphaela; Stephen, Craig; Walzer, Chris",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.627654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026707/,58
