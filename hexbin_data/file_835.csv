An effective wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) system may prove critical in South Africa (SA), where health systems infrastructure, testing capacity, personal protective equipment and human resource capacity are constrained. In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated the potential of SARS-CoV-2 RNA surveillance in untreated wastewater as the basis for a system to monitor COVID-19 prevalence in the population, an early warning system for increased transmission, and a monitoring system to assess the effectiveness of interventions. The laboratory confirmed the presence (qualitative analysis) and determined the RNA copy number of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (quantitative) analysis from 24-hour composite samples collected on 18 June 2020 from five wastewater treatment plants in Western Cape Province, SA. The study has shown that a WBE system for monitoring the status and trends of COVID-19 mass infection in SA is viable, and its development and implementation may facilitate the rapid identification of hotspots for evidence-informed interventions.","Johnson, R; Muller, C J F; Ghoor, S; Louw, J; Archer, E; Surujlal-Naicker, S; Berkowitz, N; Volschenk, M; Bröcker, L H L; Wolfaardt, G; Van der Walt, M; Mutshembele, A M; Malema, S; Gelderblom, H C; Muhdluli, M; Gray, G; Mathee, A; Street, R",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,835,21

The etiological agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a member of the Coronaviridae family and represents a disease manifestation from asymptomatic to severe respiratory damage. High transmissibility and contagious nature of the virus helps it to flourish in a large population. The immune system aids to retain the virus, but with accelerated cytokine secretion, it could transform into double edge sword resulting in unrestrained systemic inflammation which might become life-threatening. SARS-CoV-2 sets substantial impact on T-lymphocytes during its course of infection. The number of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and Treg cells tend to decrease profoundly in case of severe illness. Besides, the virus modulates the CD4+ T/ CD8+ T and Treg/Th17 cells ratio and induces the functional exhaustion of T cells to make them inefficient. T cells define the pathogenesis of severe cases and provide major contributions in antiviral defense. Therefore, the apprehension of T-lymphocytes in SARS-CoV-2 infection would implicate in developing antivirals, disease control, and would broaden the way for vaccine formulation. Thus, the review depicts the significance of T-lymphocytes interaction with SARS-CoV-2.

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS Patients 18 years of age or older who visited Duke University Health System between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2015. METHODS An electronic query of patient records at Duke University Health System was performed to identify patients with and without diagnoses of OAG, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), vascular dementia (VD), senile dementia (SD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and other neurodegenerative diseases. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate unadjusted odds ratios (OR). Age group, race, and gender were included as covariates in multiple logistic regression analyses to calculate adjusted ORs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Odds ratios comparing the odds of each neurodegenerative disease in OAG patients with the odds in control patients. RESULTS A total of 1 511 602 patients were included in this study: 24 892 OAG patients and 1 484 790 control patients. Mean age was 58.9 ± 14.0 years for OAG patients and 44.9 ± 14.1 years for control patients. After adjusting for age, race, and gender, the OR comparing the odds of each neurodegenerative disease in OAG patients with the odds in control patients were as follows: for AD: adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.93; for ALS: adjusted OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14-0.49); for PD: adjusted OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13; for VD: adjusted OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-1.25; for SD: adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.41; for MCI: adjusted OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.79-2.22; and for other neurodegenerative disease: adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.51-2.10. CONCLUSIONS Open-angle glaucoma patients may have increased odds of SD, MCI, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Further work is necessary to identify potential causal relationships. A negative correlation exists between OAG and ALS diagnosis that is likely related to limited life expectancy and physical limitations in ALS patients. A weak negative correlation exists between OAG and AD diagnosis. No correlation exists between OAG and PD or VD.","Umunakwe, Obinna; Gupta, Divakar; Tseng, Henry",Ophthalmology. Glaucoma,835,28

Such patterns have implications for health and wellbeing if there are differences in health-promoting or health-hindering resources in neighborhoods or regions. We conducted a systematic review to assess sexual minority concentration in relation to area unit characteristics. METHODS We included only records published after 1973 and made no exclusions by geography or language. We searched 11 databases (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Embase, GeoBase, GeoRef, LGBT Life, PsycINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science) on November 19-21, 2016. We searched reference lists of included records. We used the following inclusion criteria: (1) Record is a quantitative study (that is, it uses statistics to describe or associate two or more variables); (2) Record is about (a) migration or internal migration of, (b) area unit selection by, or (c) concentration of sexual minority people (defined by identity, behavior, or attraction); (3) Criterion 2 is linked to the characteristics of regions or neighborhoods (at any spatial scale). RESULTS Dual independent coding resulted in 51 records meeting inclusion criteria from the original pool of 5,591. From these records, we identified the 647 reported results linking sexual minority concentration with area unit characteristics. Of these, 132 were unadjusted relationships between sexual minority concentration and four theory-informed domains of neighborhood influence on health. We identified greater concentration of sexual minorities in regions with more resources and in more urban regions. A limited but troubling literature at the neighborhood level suggested potentially higher concentrations of sexual minorities in neighborhoods with fewer resources. CONCLUSIONS There are substantial gaps in the literature. We discuss the implications of our findings and gaps in relation to key theories of sexual minority health.

DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT Comprehensive searches of thirteen databases were conducted, from 1st January 2013 to 4th May 2020 to identify up-to-date evidence-based European CPGs for primary care management of NLBP, issued by professional bodies/organisations. Data extracted included; aim and target population, methods for development and implementation, and treatment recommendations. The AGREE II checklist was used to critically appraise guidelines. Criteria were devised to summarise and synthesise the direction and strength of recommendations across guidelines. RESULTS Seventeen CPGs (11 low back; 5 neck; 1 both) from eight European countries were identified, of which seven were high-quality. For neck pain, there was consistent weak or moderate strength recommendations for: reassurance, advice and education, manual therapy, referral for exercise therapy/programme, oral analgesics and topical medications, plus psychological therapies or multidisciplinary treatment for specific subgroups. Notable recommendation differences between back and neck pain included, i) analgesics for neck pain (not for back pain); ii) options for back pain specific subgroups - work-based interventions, return to work advice/programmes, and surgical interventions (but not for neck pain), and iii) a greater strength of recommendations (generally moderate or strong) for back pain than those for neck pain. CONCLUSIONS This review of European CPGs identified a range of mainly non-pharmacological recommended treatment options for NLBP that have broad consensus for use across Europe.","Corp, N; Mansell, G; Stynes, S; Wynne-Jones, G; Morsø, L; Hill, J C; van, D A; der Windt,",European journal of pain,835,16

Over a four-year period, we tracked whole-system water fluxes in a two-tier rain garden network and assessed near-surface hydrology and soil development across construction and operational phases. The monitoring data provided a quantitative basis for determining effectiveness of this stormwater control measure. Based on 233 monitored warm-season rainfall events, nearly half of total inflow volume was detained, with 90 percent of all events producing no flow to the combined sewer. For the events that did result in flow to the combined sewer system, the rain garden delayed flows for an average of 5.5 h. Multivariate analysis of hydrologic fluxes indicated that total event rainfall depth was a predominant hydrologic driver for network outflow during both phases, with average event intensity and daily evapotranspiration as additional, independent factors in regulating retention in the operational phase. Despite sediment loads that can clog the rooting zone, and overall lower-than-design infiltration rates, tradeoffs among soil profile development and hydrology apparently maintained relatively high overall retention effectiveness. Overall, our study identified factors relevant to regulation of retention capacity of a rain garden network. These factors may be generalizable, and guide improvement of new or existing rain garden designs.","Shuster, William D; Darner, Robert A; Schifman, Laura A; Herrmann, Dustin L",Infrastructures,835,31

However, the majority of studies have investigated endogenous antioxidants in predominantly advanced stages of kidney disease. Many traditional risk factors associated with renal dysfunction have been linked with cognitive decline as the kidneys and brain share comparable anatomic and haemodynamic characteristics that leave them susceptible to common pathogenic mechanisms. The objective of this study was to examine serum dietary antioxidants and their association with renal function characterised by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a cross-sectional analysis of 570 participants. High performance liquid chromatography quantified serum levels of retinol, α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol and six carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene and zeaxanthin) in participants. Multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate associations while adjusting for potential confounders. A sensitivity analysis was performed in cognitively-intact participants only. Serum levels of the xanthophyll carotenoid lutein were positively associated with eGFR in analyses adjusted for age (years), gender, smoking, APOE4 status and Alzheimer's disease. Retinol was inversely associated with eGFR, although was no longer significant in the smaller sensitivity analysis. Our findings identify significant associations between the xanthophyll carotenoids and eGFR. Further investigations are required to confirm these findings.","Browne, Declan; Williams, Michael A; Maxwell, Alexander P; McGuinness, Bernadette; Passmore, Peter; Silvestri, Giuliana; Woodside, Jayne V; McKay, Gareth J",Scientific reports,835,19

Although various highly pathogenic FAdV-4 strains have been isolated, the virulence factor and the pathogenesis of novel FAdV-4 are unclear. In our previous studies, we reported that a large genomic deletion (1966 bp) is not related to increased virulence. In this study, two recombinant chimeric viruses, rHN20 strain and rFB2 strain, were generated from a highly pathogenic FAdV-4 strain by replacing hexon or fiber-2 gene of a non-pathogenic FAdV-4, respectively. Both chimeric strains showed similar titers to the wild type strain in vitro. Notably, rFB2 and the wild type strain induced 100% mortality, while no mortality or clinical signs appeared in chickens inoculated with rHN20, indicating that hexon, but not fiber-2, determines the novel FAdV-4 virulence. Furthermore, an R188I mutation in the hexon protein identified residue 188 as the key amino acid for the reduced pathogenicity. The rR188I mutant strain was significantly neutralized by chicken serum in vitro and in vivo, whereas the wild type strain was able to replicate efficiently. Finally, the immunogenicity of the rescued rR188I was investigated. Non-pathogenic rR188I provided full protection against lethal FAdV-4 challenge. Collectively, these findings provide an in-depth understanding of the molecular basis of novel FAdV-4 pathogenicity and present rR188I as a potential live attenuated vaccine candidate or a novel vaccine vector for HHS vaccines. Importance HHS associated with a novel FAdV-4 infection in chickens has caused huge economic losses to the poultry industry in China since 2015. The molecular basis for the increased virulence remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the hexon gene is vital for FAdV-4 pathogenicity. Furthermore, we show that the amino acid residue at position 188 of the hexon protein is responsible for pathogenicity. Importantly, the rR188I mutant strain was neutralized by chicken serum in vitro and in vivo, whereas the wild type strain was not. Further, the rR188I mutant strain provided complete protection against FAdV-4 challenge. Our results provide a molecular basis of the increased virulence of novel FAdV-4. We propose that the rR188I mutant is a potential live attenuated vaccine against HHS and a new vaccine vector for HHS-combined vaccines.","Zhang, Yu; Liu, Aijing; Wang, Yanan; Cui, Hongyu; Gao, Yulong; Qi, Xiaole; Liu, Changjun; Zhang, Yanping; Li, Kai; Gao, Li; Pan, Qing; Wang, Xiaomei",Journal of virology,835,7

Beyond respiratory distress.,18.132683,-1.8060102,2021-01-26,"KEY MESSAGE OsSIRP4 is an E3 ligase that acts as a negative regulator in the plant response to salt stress via the 26S proteasomal system regulation of substrate proteins, OsPEX11-1, which it provides important information for adaptation and regulation in rice. Plants are sessile organisms that can be exposed to environmental stress. Plants alter their cellular processes to survive under potentially unfavorable conditions. Protein ubiquitination is an important post-translational modification that has a crucial role in various cellular signaling processes in abiotic stress response. In this study, we characterized Oryza sativa salt-induced RING finger protein 4, OsSIRP4, a membrane and cytosol-localized RING E3 ligase in rice. OsSIRP4 transcripts were highly induced under salt stress in rice. We found that OsSIRP4 possesses E3 ligase activity; however, no E3 ligase activity was observed with a single amino acid substitution (OsSIRP4C269A). The results of the yeast two hybrid system, in vitro pull-down assay, BiFC analysis, in vitro ubiquitination assay, and in vitro degradation assay indicate that OsSIRP4 regulates degradation of a substrate protein, OsPEX11-1 (Oryza sativa peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11-1) via the 26S proteasomal system. Phenotypic analysis of OsSIRP4-overexpressing plants demonstrated hypersensitivity to salt response compared to that of the wild type and mutated OsSIRP4C269A plants. In addition, OsSIRP4-overexpressing plants exhibited significant low enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, and accumulation of proline and soluble sugar, but a high level of H2O2. Furthermore, qRT data on transgenic plants suggest that OsSIRP4 acted as a negative regulator of salt response by diminishing the expression of genes related to Na+/K+ homeostasis (AtSOS1, AtAKT1, AtNHX1, and AtHKT1;1) in transgenic plants under salt stress. These results suggest that OsSIRP4 plays a negative regulatory role in response to salt stress by modulating the target protein levels.","Kim, Ju Hee; Jang, Cheol Seong",Plant molecular biology,835,24

Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR), and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) are linked to data on positive SARS-CoV-2 tests from the Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). This covers all persons living in Norway as of 1 March 2020, with data on confirmed infection up to and including 13 May 2020 and on hospitalisations up to and including 30 April 2020. RESULTS Of 8 125 persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the whole population, 493 (6.1 %) were under 20 years old. The median age of the under-20s was 15 years, and 252 (51 %) were girls. 3 % were hospitalised. No deaths were registered among patients aged under 20 in Norway. We found a somewhat larger share with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the group with diseases of the neuromuscular system.

In addition, the interest of current pathology residents in autopsy and forensic pathology as a future career was also assessed. METHODS A web-based survey was sent to all Canadian pathology residents. This survey consisted of 19 questions on institution, level of training, intention to complete the American Board of Pathology examination, number of autopsies completed, perception of quality/access to autopsy skills education, interest, and factors contributing to autopsy and forensic pathology. RESULTS Eighty two (26%) of a possible 310 residents (12/47 general pathology, 70/263 anatomical pathology) across all Canadian institutions offering anatomical or general pathology programs (16/16 institutions) participated in the survey. Eighty-three percent of the respondents rated autopsy education as either very important or important. Fifty-five percent of the respondents intended to either challenge the American Board of Pathology examination or wanted the option to do so in the future, whereas only 47% of the participants agreed that all residents who wish to challenge the examination will easily be able to complete 50 autopsies during residency. Only 18% of the respondents were interested in performing autopsies as a major part of their career, and a combined 52% were only interested in performing autopsies to secure a desired position or felt that having to do autopsies would be a job deterrent. The quality of autopsy teaching received and the number of autopsies performed was identified as the most significant factors affecting interest in performing autopsies as part of a future career. A combined 68% of the respondents felt that the job market in forensic pathology in Canada was either good (better than most subspecialties) or very good (more jobs than graduating fellows). Seventy-one percent (12/17) of postgraduate year 5 respondents reported having completed 50 or more autopsies at the time of survey completion. Eleven percent of the respondents did not agree that all residents who document having completed an autopsy at their institution will have participated in all 8 essential autopsy tasks. Twenty four (29%) of the 82 respondents provided detailed narrative comments. DISCUSSION Most Canadian pathology residents believe that autopsy education is an important component of residency training. Limited access to quality autopsy teaching seems to be an important factor in resident interest in forensic pathology as a future career, despite a perceived good job market in comparison with most other subspecialties.","Multan, Michael; Alakija, Pauline; Orde, Matthew; White, Steven",The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,835,16

AIMS We aimed to investigate the correlation between perioperative blood supply in the anastomotic area of the gastric tube and the formation of anastomotic strictures in the patients undergoing esophagectomy. METHODS This prospective study included 60 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy between March 2014 and February 2016, which were divided into stricture group (n = 13) and non-stricture group (n = 47) based on their severity of anastomotic strictures at 3 months post-operation. The perioperative anastomotic blood supply was measured using a laser Doppler flowmetry. The gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) was measured by a gastric tonometer within 72 h post-operation. The perfusion index and gastric pHi were compared between groups. RESULTS The stricture group had a significantly lower blood flow index (P < 0.001) and gastric pHi values from day 1 to day 3 post-operation than the non-stricture group (all P < 0.001). In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that both the perfusion index and gastric pHi were significantly correlated with stricture size and stricture scores, respectively (r = 0.65 - 0.32, all P < 0.05). Furthermore, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perfusion index was an influential factor associated with postoperative anastomotic strictures (OR 0.84. 95% CI 0.72-0.98, P = 0.026). CONCLUSION These results suggested that poor blood supply in the anastomotic area of the gastric tube in the perioperative period was a risk factor for postoperative anastomotic strictures.","Wang, Xiaojin; Pei, Xiaofeng; Li, Xiaojian; Gao, Minzhao; Cheng, Hua; Zhong, Hongcheng; Cao, Qingdong",Digestive diseases and sciences,835,28

This study presents the experiences of partially embolized cerebral AVMs followed by Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) and assesses predictive factors for AVM obliteration and hemorrhage. METHODS The interventional neuroradiology database that was reviewed included 404 patients who underwent AVM embolization. Using this database, the authors retrospectively analyzed all partially embolized AVM cases followed by GKS for a residual nidus. Except for cases of complete AVM obliteration, the authors excluded all patients with radiological follow-up of less than 2 years. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the predictive factors related to AVM obliteration and hemorrhage following GKS. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the obliteration with a cutoff AVM nidus volume of 3 cm(3) and 10 cm(3). RESULTS One hundred sixty-two patients qualified for the study. The median patient age was 26 years and 48.8% were female. Hemorrhage presented as the most common symptom (48.1%). The median preembolization volume of an AVM was 14.3 cm(3). The median volume and margin dose for GKS were 10.92 cm(3) and 16.0 Gy, respectively. The median radiological and clinical follow-up intervals were 47 and 79 months, respectively. The annual hemorrhage rate was 1.71% and total obliteration rate was 56.8%. Noneloquent area (p = 0.004), superficial location (p < 0.001), decreased volume (p < 0.001), lower Spetzler-Martin grade (p < 0.001), lower Virginia Radiosurgery AVM Scale (RAS; p < 0.001), lower Pollock-Flickinger score (p < 0.001), lower modified Pollock-Flickinger score (p < 0.001), increased maximum dose (p < 0.001), and increased margin dose (p < 0.001) were found to be statistically significant in predicting the probability of AVM obliteration in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only volume (p = 0.016) was found to be an independent prognostic factor for AVM obliteration. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test of the Kaplan-Meier analysis (chi-square = 54.402, p < 0.001) showed a significantly decreased obliteration rate of different cutoff AVM volume groups of less than 3 cm(3), 3-10 cm(3), and more than 10 cm(3). No independent prognostic factor was found for AVM hemorrhage in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Partially embolized AVMs are amenable to successful treatment with GKS. The volume of the nidus significantly influences the outcome of radiosurgical treatment. The Virginia RAS and Pollock-Flickinger score were found to be reliable scoring systems for selection of patient candidates and prediction of partially embolized AVM closure and complications for GKS.","Huo, Xiaochuan; Jiang, Yuhua; Lv, Xianli; Yang, Hongchao; Zhao, Yang; Li, Youxiang",Journal of neurosurgery,835,16

We hypothesized that patients with knees surgically exposed using patellar lateral retraction would have comparable outcomes with patients with knees surgically exposed using patellar eversion. METHODS After an a priori power analysis, 120 patients with degenerative arthrosis were prospectively enrolled and were randomized to one of two patellar exposure techniques during the primary total knee arthroplasty: lateral retraction or eversion. The primary outcome measure was one-year, dynamometer-measured quadriceps strength. The secondary outcome measures evaluated during hospital stay included the ability to straight-leg raise, visual analog scale in pain, walking distance, and length of stay. The secondary outcome measures that were evaluated preoperatively and through a one-year follow-up included the Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores, range of motion, quadriceps strength, and radiographic rate of patella baja and tilt. RESULTS A mixed-model analysis of variance showed no significant differences between the two groups in the one-year outcome measures. At one year postoperatively, quadriceps strength was not different between groups (p = 0.77), and the range of motion significantly improved (p < 0.01) from preoperative values by a mean value (and standard deviation) of 6° ± 17°, with no significant difference (p = 0.60) between groups. The Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary score and Mental Component Summary score significantly improved (p < 0.01) for both study groups from preoperatively to one year postoperatively with no significantly different effects between groups (time × group, p = 0.85 for the Physical Component Summary score and p = 0.71 for the Mental Component Summary score), and the scores were not different at one year after surgery. There were no significant differences between groups in the change in frequency of the radiographic patella baja (p = 0.99) or the radiographic patellar tilt (p = 0.77) from before surgery to one year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Lateral retraction of the patella did not lead to superior postoperative results compared with eversion of the patella during total knee arthroplasty as evaluated using our primary outcome measure of one-year, dynamometer-measured quadriceps strength or our secondary outcome measures.

BACKGROUND Though single-port LS is gradually evolving, the application of single-port LS techniques in LAR have been viewed with skepticism due to technical difficulties. METHODS Data from patients who had undergone either conventional laparoscopic LAR (n = 49) or single-port LAR (n = 67) for colorectal cancers between March 2006 and March 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS In single-port LAR group, oncologic outcomes were satisfactory with respect to attainment of lymph nodes (23.4 ± 15.3) and surgical margins (proximal cut margin: 7.1 ± 4.6 cm, distal cut margin: 7.7 ± 5.7 cm). Single-port LAR showed acceptable clinical outcomes manifested by comparable outcomes of post-operative analgesics requirement and length of hospital stay, and by low incidence of post-operative complications (conventional laparoscopic LAR group: 30.6% vs. single-port LAR group: 14.9%; P < 0.01). Operative time was comparable between groups (conventional laparoscopic LAR group: 309 ± 93 min vs. single-port LAR group: 277 ± 106 min; P = 0.097). Throughout a series of 67 consecutive single-port LARs, no conversion to multiport or open surgery was occurred. CONCLUSION This study shows that single-port LAR is both safe and feasible for use in resection of colorectal cancer when performed by surgeons who are trained in conventional laparoscopic technique. If further and more extensive studies support our results, then single-port LAR can be an acceptable alternative to conventional laparoscopic LAR for treatment of colorectal cancer.","Kim, Say-June; Choi, Byung-Jo; Lee, Sang Chul",Surgical endoscopy,835,16

Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was reported to be superior in terms of work return, cosmetic results, and post-operative pain, but limited maneuver capacity and overlapping of hand tools are technical difficulties associated with SILC that endanger patient safety. Aim To perform SILC using a needle grasper for gallbladder traction, thus simplifying the dissection of Calot's triangle. Material and methods The files of patients who underwent elective LC for gallbladder stone and polyps in general surgery clinics between December 2013 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: needle-grasper-assisted SILC (nSILC) and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). Age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, ASA score, duration of operation, duration of post-operative hospital stay, complications, drain use, conversion to open and conventional technique, and oral feeding beginning time were analyzed. Results There were no per-operative or post-operative complications in either of the groups, and no significant differences were found between the groups in terms of complications. The mean duration of the operation was significantly longer in the nSILC group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of hospital stay. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in conventional nSILC were significantly lower for all hours. The patient satisfaction in terms of cosmetic results was better in the nSILC group. Conclusions Needle-grasper-assisted SILC reduces the number of tools that need to be held by surgeons; it also provides safe dissection, better cosmetic results, and less post-operative pain in elective cases.","Sunamak, Oguzhan; Donmez, Turgut; Ferahman, Sina; Uludag, Server Sezgin; Avaroglu, Huseyin Imam",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,835,6

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important players in the development and progression of human cancers. Here, we aimed to identify metastasis-associated lncRNA and to study its roles in the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods We screened differentially expressed lncRNAs between high- and low-metastatic lung cancer cell lines by using microarray and identified the target lncRNA TM4SF1-AS1. The effect of the TM4SF1-AS1 on the invasion and migration was evaluated through the wound healing experiment and transwell assay. The expression of related genes was assessed by RNA sequence and Western blotting. Results TM4SF1-AS1 was highly expressed in high metastatic lung cancer cell line, and it was also significantly up-regulated in lymph node metastatic lung cancer and was associated with lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of TM4SF1-AS1 promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Overexpression of TM4SF1-AS1 decreased the expression of E-Cadherin and increased the expression of Vimentin, Snail and Twist, while knockdown of TM4SF1-AS1 exhibited the opposite trend. Furthermore, RNA sequence analysis revealed that some signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, were enriched upon TM4SF1-AS1 overexpression. Western blotting further confirmed that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was activated by TM4SF1-AS1. Conclusion This study illustrates that TM4SF1-AS1 promotes the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. TM4SF1-AS1 might be a novel target of molecular treatment for lung cancer.","Zhou, Fachen; Wang, Jin; Chi, Xinming; Zhou, Xin; Wang, Zhou",Cancer management and research,835,29

High speed machining can excite the higher frequency modes and in addition, run-out is also amplified. These effects in high speed micromachining induces the uncertainty in cutting forces. The estimation of cutting coefficients without inclusion of uncertainty cannot give accurate values and hence, the predicted cutting force and machining stability using these cutting coefficient may not be accurate. In the present work, cutting coefficients have been determined using the Bayesian inference which includes the uncertainty in estimated cutting coefficients. Note that, estimated cutting coefficient independent of chip load and cutting velocity does not include the high speed micromachining mechanics like size effect. The cutting coefficients have been estimated as a function of cutting velocity and chip load in the present work. The segmented cutting coefficients for different ranges of cutting speed varying from 10000 rpm to 110000 rpm has been obtained as a non-liner function of chip load. Bayesian inference modelling for cutting coefficients has been carried out using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The convergence of prior and posterior distribution has been verified using correlation and trace of samples used for sampling. The posterior distribution shows that there is a good fitting, which accurately predicts the mean of the cutting coefficients. Finally, predicted cutting coefficients have been compared with cutting coefficients obtained from the deterministic approach using least square method. The experimentally estimated cutting coefficients are found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting coefficients with Bayesian inference approach. The predicted cutting coefficients using Bayesian inference shows the deviation of 0.89% and 8.4% at 40000 rpm from experimentally obtained cutting coefficients for tangential and radial cutting coefficients, respectively. The experimental cutting force is found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting force with Bayesian inference based cutting coefficients fitting at 105000 rpm.","Singh, Kundan K.; Singh, Ramesh",Procedia Manufacturing,835,1

Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the Nemuro VP6 gene compared with the published corresponding human and rodent GBR genes were respectively 66-67 and 70-72 %, which are notably lower than those between human and rodent viruses (72-73 and 83-84 %, respectively). Overall identities of VP6 genes among GBRs were substantially lower than those among both group A rotaviruses (GARs) and group C rotaviruses (GCRs) derived from different species of mammals.

In pigs, a high prevalence of GBR antibodies (97 %) was detected in sera from sows. These results suggest that GBR infection is common in cattle and pigs, notwithstanding the scarcity of reports of GBR detection in these species to date.","Tsunemitsu, Hiroshi; Kamiyama, Mariko; Kawashima, Kenji; Katsuda, Ken; Kohmoto, Mariko; Saif, Linda J; Shouji, Tomotaro; Onodera, Toshiyuki",The Journal of general virology,835,17

An incentive spirometer manufactured entirely out of recyclable material, termed Paperometer, aims to address the multifaced problem of medical device inaccessibility: high cost, lack of user- or environmental-friendliness, and unavailability to those who need them the most. Operating in accordance with governing physical formulae including Ohm's law and the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, Paperometer is intended to improve the user's lung function through repeated use of the device, which facilitates slow, deep breaths of air. Several prototypes were created based on a list of design criteria established through background research and stakeholder interviews. From four initial prototypes, all created predominantly from simple foldable geometries, one design was selected for further iteration. The most promising functional prototype was crafted from recyclable plastic and paper folded into various shapes including a box, tube, and pinwheel. The Paperometer concept stands as an innovative solution to reduce the cost and environmental burden of meeting the demand for medical devices. Once validated, the device may serve as an important tool in combating the ongoing global pandemic. © 2021 by ASME.","Sharma, S.

We describe conditions under which it is possible to define a mapping from the distribution that generated the existing external data to the relative efficiency of a covariate-adjusted estimator compared to an unadjusted estimator. Under conditions, these relative efficiencies approximate the ratio of sample size needed to achieve a desired power. We consider two situations where the outcome is either fully or partially observed and several treatment effect estimands that are of particular interest in most trials. For each such estimand, we develop a semiparametrically efficient estimator of the relative efficiency that allows for the application of flexible statistical learning tools to estimate the nuisance functions and an analytic form of a corresponding Wald-type confidence interval. We also propose a double bootstrap scheme for constructing confidence intervals. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and apply these methods to data to estimate the relative efficiency of using covariate adjustment in Covid-19 therapeutic trials.","Li, X.; Li, S.; Luedtke, A.",,835,29

METHODS: A survey about home office ergonomics and discomfort was sent to faculty, staff, and administrators by email and was completed by 843 individuals. RESULTS: Over 40%of the participants reported moderate to severe discomfort (severe low/middle back pain, moderate discomfort in eyes/neck/head, and discomfort in the upper back/shoulders). Laptops (always and often) were widely used (85%) with most using the laptop monitor (55%) of all respondents. Further, less than 45%of the seating conditions were reported as having adjustable arm rests. CONCLUSION: As teleworking in makeshift offices becomes more common, the risk of significant discomfort and potentially more serious musculoskeletal disorders may result from poor static postures. Companies may need to accommodate workers by allowing them to take home office chairs, external monitors, keyboards, and mice as laptops are insufficient, ergonomically.","Gerding, Thomas; Syck, Megan; Daniel, Denise; Naylor, Jennifer; Kotowski, Susan E; Gillespie, Gordon L; Freeman, Andrew M; Huston, Thomas R; Davis, Kermit G",Work,835,1

We developed 77 hybridomas and selected five neutralizing mAbs by immunization with S&#916;TM against MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain S-pseudotyped lentivirus. However, all five monoclonal antibodies (mAb) did not neutralize the pseudotyped V534A mutation.

This implies that the mutation in residue 506-509, 529, and 534 of S is critical to generate neutralization escape variants of MERS-CoV. Interestingly, all five neutralizing mAbs have binding affinity to RBD, although most mAbs generated by RBD did not have neutralizing activity. Additionally, chimeric antibodies of RBD-14F8 and RBD-43E4 with human Fc and light chain showed neutralizing effect against wild type MERS-CoV KOR/KNIH/002, similar to the original mouse mAbs.

In medical applications, curating such datasets is not a favourable option because acquiring a large number of annotated samples from experts is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for learning with limited annotated examples. Unfortunately, the proposed approaches in the literature have not yet yielded significant gains over random data augmentation for image segmentation, where random augmentations themselves do not yield high accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel task-driven data augmentation method for learning with limited labeled data where the synthetic data generator, is optimized for the segmentation task. The generator of the proposed method models intensity and shape variations using two sets of transformations, as additive intensity transformations and deformation fields. Both transformations are optimized using labeled as well as unlabeled examples in a semi-supervised framework. Our experiments on three medical datasets, namely cardic, prostate and pancreas, show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms standard augmentation and semi-supervised approaches for image segmentation in the limited annotation setting.

The Thoracic Domain of the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery reports a consensus statement on the provision of thoracic cancer surgery during this pandemic. METHODS: A Thoracic Experts Panel was convened by the Society. A consensus on the provision, safety, and setting of thoracic cancer surgery during the pandemic was obtained through a Delphi process. RESULTS: Responses were received from 26 panel members (96% response rate) from 10 regions across Asia. The Society recommended that elective thoracic cancer surgery services may need to be reduced or postponed if medical resources were needed for COVID-19 patients, especially intensive care unit beds and ventilators. However, thoracic cancer surgery should proceed as normal for all solid tumors, without restrictions based on disease stage, availability of non-surgical treatment options, or patient condition (unless there is a high likelihood of postoperative intensive care unit stay). Aerosol-forming procedures should be avoided intra- and perioperatively. The surgical approach does not make a difference in terms of safety. Services for thoracic cancer patients should be offered only in hospitals that maintain isolation wards for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Services for patients with thoracic cancer should be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic. The position of the Society is that thoracic surgeons have a responsibility to perform good surgical management of thoracic cancer during the pandemic, to advocate for patients' rights to receive it, and to safeguard patients and staff from infection.","Jheon, Sanghoon; Ahmed, Aneez Db; Fang, Vincent Wt; Jung, Woohyun; Khan, Ali Zamir; Lee, Jang-Ming; Sihoe, Alan Dl; Thongcharoen, Punnarerk; Tsuboi, Masahiro; Turna, Akif; Nakajima, Jun",Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann,835,23

Alcohol misuse varies across the US and is related to poorer health and comorbidities that likely affect the severity of COVID-19 infection. High levels of pre-pandemic alcohol misuse in some counties may have set the stage for worse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, this relationship may depend on how rural a county is, as access to healthcare in rural communities has lagged behind more urban areas. The objective of this study was to test for associations between county-level COVID-19 mortality, pre-pandemic county-level excessive drinking, and county rurality. METHOD: We used national COVID-19 data from the New York Times to calculate county-level case fatality rates (n = 3,039 counties and county equivalents; October 1 -December 31, 2020) and other external county-level data sources for indicators of rurality and health. We used beta regression to model case fatality rates, adjusted for several county-level population characteristics. We included a multilevel component to our model and defined state as a random intercept. Our focal predictor was a single variable representing nine possible combinations of low/mid/high alcohol misuse and low/mid/high rurality. RESULTS: The median county-level COVID-19 case fatality rate was 1.57%. Compared to counties with low alcohol misuse and low rurality (referent), counties with high levels of alcohol and mid (ß = -0.17, p = 0.008) or high levels of rurality (ß = -0.24, p<0.001) demonstrated significantly lower case fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the intersecting roles of county-level alcohol consumption, rurality, and COVID-19 mortality.","Pro, George; Gilbert, Paul A; Baldwin, Julie A; Brown, Clare C; Young, Sean; Zaller, Nickolas",PLoS One,835,20

Methods: Consecutive RRHL patients who were treated with the VIBE regimen were identified and studied for clinicopathologic characteristics, response to VIBE regimen, event-free survival (EFS), and feasibility of an autologous stem-cell transplant (autoSCT). Results: In total, 24 patients received the VIBE regimen, and a median of 3 cycles were administered. In this cohort, 80% of the patients had received &#8805;2 prior lines of therapy. The overall and complete response rates with VIBE were 79% and 42%, respectively. After a median follow-up (following VIBE regimen) of 14 months (range, 3-76), the 3-year EFS and OS were 46% and 74%, respectively. Of the eligible patients, 92% underwent successful AutoSCT. The mean CD34+ cell count in the autograft was 5.5×106/kg (SD 2.07). Neutropenia was the commonest hematologic toxicity; it was observed in 42% of patients. However, only 9% of the patients developed grade III/IV febrile neutropenia. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting were the second most common grade III/IV toxicity in our cohort of patients.

It has been proposed that this virus originated in bats, possibly transmitted to humans by an intermediate host, making bats a group of great interest during this outbreak. Almost 10% of the world's bat species inhabit Mexico, and 14 previous novel CoVs have been recorded in Mexican bats. However, the phylogenetic relationships between these viruses and the novel coronavirus are unknown. The aim of this communication was therefore to describe the phylogenetic relationships between Mexican bat-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2. We showed that Mexican bat-CoVs sequences are grouped into two genera, Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, and the new coronavirus is an independent clade within Betacoronavirus. Due to the diversity of CoVs in Mexican bats, the propensity of CoVs to shift hosts, the invasion mechanisms described for this new virus, and previous reports of animals infected by SARS-CoV-2, the risk of a possible infection from humans to Mexican bats should not be discarded and warrants further analyses. To avoid future zoonotic infectious diseases and to limit persecution of bats, we urge researchers and the general population to take extreme precautions and avoid manipulation of bats during the current and future similar outbreaks.","Pablo, Colunga-Salas; Giovani, Hernández-Canchola",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Genetic or individual differences in immune response may be an explanation. Moreover, hyperinflammation and dysregulated immune response are involved in the etiology of severe forms of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, as an acute-phase plasma protein with immunomodulatory effect and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of inflammation response in severe COVID-19 illness. Methods: In this retrospective observational cohort study, 64 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive COVID-19 hospitalized patients were studied for AAT, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), troponin, complete blood count (CBC), random blood sugar, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and arterial oxygen saturation (O2sat) at admission and during hospitalization. Results: The results showed that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had low serum levels of AAT and high CRP levels at the first days of hospitalization. In particular, the percentages of individuals with low, normal, and high AAT levels were 7.80%, 82.80%, and 9.40%, respectively, while high and low values of CRP accounted for 86.70% and 13.30% of patients. Most of the patients had an upward neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) trend, with a higher mortality rate (p < 0.05) and troponin levels (p < 0.05). However, comorbidities, CRP alterations, ESR alterations, nonfasting blood sugar, SGOT, SGPT, O2sat, RBC, and PLT values were not significantly different between the NLR downward and upward trend groups. Conclusions: The current study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had low serum AAT levels related to CRP values. Therefore, AAT response may be considered as a new mechanism by which some COVID-19 patients show immune dysregulation and more severe symptoms.","Shimi, Ghazaleh; Sohrab, Golbon; Pourvali, Katayoun; Ghorbani, Arman; Balam, Farinaz Hosseini; Rostami, Khalil; Zand, Hamid",Mediators Inflamm,835,1

However, effective, safe treatments typically take over a decade to develop and there are still no clinically approved therapies to treat highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Repurposing of known drugs can speed up development and this strategy, along with the use of biologicals (notably monoclonal antibody therapy) and vaccine development programmes remain the principal routes to dealing with the immediate impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the development of broadly-effective highly potent antivirals should be a major longer term goal. Structural biology has been applied with enormous effect, with key proteins structurally characterised only weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 sequence was released. Open-access to advanced infrastructure for structural biology techniques at synchrotrons and high-end cryo-EM and NMR centres has brought these technologies centre-stage in drug discovery.

Viral infections may predispose pregnant women to a higher rate of pregnancy complications, including preterm births, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, definitive proof of vertical transmission is still lacking. In this review, we summarize studies regarding the potential evidence for transplacental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), characterize the expression of its receptors and proteases, describe the placental pathology and analyze virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface. We focus on the syncytium, the barrier between mother and fetus, and describe in detail its physical and structural defense against viral infections. We further discuss the potential molecular mechanisms, whereby the placenta serves as a defense front against pathogens by regulating the interferon type III signaling, microRNA-triggered autophagy and the nuclear factor-&#954;B pathway. Based on these data, we conclude that vertical transmission may occur but rare, ascribed to the potent physical barrier, the fine-regulated placental immune defense and modulation strategies. Particularly, immunomodulatory mechanisms employed by the placenta may mitigate violent immune response, maybe soften cytokine storm tightly associated with severely ill COVID-19 patients, possibly minimizing cell and tissue damages, and potentially reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Kreis, Nina-Naomi; Ritter, Andreas; Louwen, Frank; Yuan, Juping",,835,24

The progression of COVID-19 is related to an excessive host inflammatory immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is considered a major cause of disease severity and death. Dysregulated immune response produces huge amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines called 'cytokine storm'. Moreover, the activation of microthrombi formation plays an important role in multiple organ failure. METHODS: Keeping into the consideration of the potent anti-inflammatory activity of black seed and its major constituent thymoquinone (TQ), we hypothesize their potential implication in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google scholar and Scopus electronic databases by using the terms, including black seed, N. sativa, thymoquinone, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and inflammatory immune response. Reslts: Various studies confirmed that Black seed and TQ reduced the thrombus formation, the expression of tissue factor and the immune activation. Furthermore, TQ demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial activity that may be effective in controlling the secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Keeping into consideration the multi-targeting nature of the black seed and TQ, they may be used as a potential therapeutic formulation or as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Khan, Masood Alam; Younus, Hina",Curr pharm. biotechnol,835,24

Vaccines are prophylaxis mainstays but are limited in efficacy due to the difficulty in matching predicted dominant viral strains to circulating strains. As such, other potential interventions are being explored. Since viruses rely on host cellular functions to replicate, recent therapeutic developments focus on targeting host factors involved in virus replication. Besides controlling virus replication, potential targets for drug development include controlling virus-induced host immune responses such as the recently suggested involvement of innate lymphoid cells and NADPH oxidases in influenza virus pathogenesis and immune cell metabolism.

Due to altered physiology, weakened mechanical and immunological features pregnant mothers constitute a particularly suspectable segment of population in any infection pandemic. The goal of this study was to assess level of knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 and determinants among pregnant mothers attending antenatal care (ANC) in Debre Tabor General Hospital Northwest Ethiopia. PATIENT AND METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was performed from June 05 to 26, 2020. A total of 403 pregnant mothers participated and were selected by systematic random sampling. Data were collected via face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were entered using Epi-Data version 4.2 and analyzed by SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and p-value <0.05 at 95% CI was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, 52.1% and 52.6% of participants had a good level of knowledge and positive attitude towardCOVID-19, respectively. Level of knowledge was significantly associated with participants’ age (15–24 years) (AOR: 4.58; 95% CI: 1.721–12.201), educational status (AOR:7.78; 95% CI: 2.31–15.65) occupation (AOR:2.26; 95% CI: 1.23–4.15), and condition of pregnancy (AOR:4.55; 95% CI: 1.84–11.25). Whereas age (25–34 years) (AOR:2.61; 95% CI: 1.23–5.55), participants husband completed secondary education (AOR=2.75, 95% CI: 1.13–6.70) and college and above (AOR:3.77; 95% CI: 1.1.62–8.76), wanted pregnancy (AOR:2.70; 95% CI: 1.22–5.97) and knowledge (AOR:1.65; 95% CI: 1.06–2.572) were the significant predictors for attitude. CONCLUSION: Findings show that almost half of the participants had a good level of knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19.
