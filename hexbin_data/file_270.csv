1173,1173,1173,Long-term quality of life in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxaemia,17.644743,12.926122,2012-10-19,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to assess the long term outcome and quality of life of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for refractory hypoxemia. METHODS: A retrospective observational study with prospective health related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment was conducted in ARDS patients who had ECMO as a rescue therapy for reversible refractory hypoxemia from January 2009 until April 2011 in a tertiary Australian centre. Survival and long-term quality of life assessment, using the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and the EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D) were assessed and compared to international data from other research groups. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied. Eighteen (86%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team. Eleven (55%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis. Eighteen (86%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the 18 survivors, ten (56%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44%) were discharged directly home. Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months). Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms. Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function. One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness. Only 26% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia. Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.","Hodgson, Carol L; Hayes, Kate; Everard, Tori; Nichol, Alistair; Davies, Andrew R; Bailey, Michael J; Tuxen, David V; Cooper, David J; Pellegrino, Vin",Crit Care,270,12
2115,2115,2115,Cytomegalovirus reactivation and mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome,17.540785,12.927551,2016-03-01,"PURPOSE: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurs frequently in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has been associated with increased mortality. However, it remains unknown whether this association represents an independent risk for poor outcome. We aimed to estimate the attributable effect of CMV reactivation on mortality in immunocompetent ARDS patients. METHODS: We prospectively studied immunocompetent ARDS patients who tested seropositive for CMV and remained mechanically ventilated beyond day 4 in two tertiary intensive care units in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2013. CMV loads were determined in plasma weekly. Competing risks Cox regression was used with CMV reactivation status as a time-dependent exposure variable. Subsequently, in sensitivity analyses we adjusted for the evolution of disease severity until onset of reactivation using marginal structural modeling. RESULTS: Of 399 ARDS patients, 271 (68 %) were CMV seropositive and reactivation occurred in 74 (27 %) of them. After adjustment for confounding and competing risks, CMV reactivation was associated with overall increased ICU mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 2.74, 95 % CI 1.51–4.97), which resulted from the joint action of trends toward an increased mortality rate (direct effect; cause specific hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95 % CI 0.86–2.90) and a reduced successful weaning rate (indirect effect; cause specific HR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.58–1.18). These associations remained in sensitivity analyses. The population-attributable fraction of ICU mortality was 23 % (95 % CI 6–41) by day 30 (risk difference 4.4, 95 % CI 1.1–7.9). CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation is independently associated with increased case fatality in immunocompetent ARDS patients who are CMV seropositive.

Here, we validate various scores supposed to predict mortality and develop an optimized categorical model. METHODS: In a derivation cohort, 108 ARDS patients (2010–2015) on veno-venous ECMO were retrospectively analysed to assess four established risk scores (ECMOnet-Score, RESP-Score, PRESERVE-Score, Roch-Score) for mortality prediction (receiver operating characteristic analysis) and to identify by multivariable logistic regression analysis independent variables for mortality to yield the new PRESET-Score (PREdiction of Survival on ECMO Therapy-Score). This new score was then validated both in independent internal (n = 82) and external (n = 59) cohorts. RESULTS: The median (25%; 75% quartile) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 14 (12; 16), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 62.5 (57; 72.8), median intensive care unit stay was 17 days (range 1–124), and mortality was 62%. Only the ECMOnet-Score (area under curve (AUC) 0.69) and the RESP-Score (AUC 0.64) discriminated survivors and non-survivors. Admission pH(a), mean arterial pressure, lactate, platelet concentrations, and pre-ECMO hospital stay were independent predictors of death and were used to build the PRESET-Score. The score’s internal (AUC 0.845; 95% CI 0.76–0.93; p < 0.001) and external (AUC 0.70; 95% CI 0.56–0.84; p = 0.008) validation revealed excellent discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: While our data confirm that both the ECMOnet-Score and the RESP-Score predict mortality in ECMO-treated ARDS patients, we propose a novel model also incorporating extrapulmonary variables, the PRESET-Score. This score predicts mortality much better than previous scores and therefore is a more precise choice for decision support in ARDS patients to be placed on ECMO.","Hilder, Michael; Herbstreit, Frank; Adamzik, Michael; Beiderlinden, Martin; Bürschen, Markus; Peters, Jürgen; Frey, Ulrich H.",Crit Care,270,12
4195,4195,4195,Risk factors for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in mechanically ventilated adults in Peru: a multicenter observational study,17.303911,12.720304,2019-12-06,"BACKGROUND: Clinical and epidemiological differences between acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that presents at the initiation of mechanical ventilation [MV] (ARDS at MV onset) and that which develops during the course of MV (ARDS after MV onset) are not well understood. We conducted an observational study in five Peruvian ICUs to characterize differences between ARDS at MV onset and after MV onset and identify risk factors for the development of ARDS after MV onset. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure requiring at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation and followed them prospectively during the first 28 days and compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes by ARDS status. RESULTS: We enrolled 1657 participants on MV (mean age 60.0 years, 55% males) of whom 334 (20.2%) had ARDS at MV onset and 180 (10.9%) developed ARDS after MV onset. Average tidal volume at the initiation of MV was 8.7 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for participants with ARDS at MV onset, 8.6 mL/kg PBW for those who developed ARDS after MV onset, and 8.5 mL/kg PBW for those who never developed ARDS (p = 0.23). Overall, 90-day mortality was 56% and 55% for ARDS after MV onset and ARDS at MV onset, respectively, as compared to 46% among those who never developed ARDS (p < 0.01). Adults with ARDS had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those without ARDS (27.3 vs 26.5 kg/m(2), p < 0.01). Higher peak pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.21–1.88), higher mean airway pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13–1.76), and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10–1.50) at MV onset were associated with a higher odds of developing ARDS after MV onset. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of mechanically ventilated patients, 31% of study participants had ARDS at some point during their ICU stay. Optimal lung-protective ventilation was not used in a majority of patients. Patients with ARDS after MV onset had a similar 90-day mortality as those with ARDS at MV onset. Higher airway pressures at MV onset, higher PEEP, and higher BMI were associated with the development of ARDS after MV onset.","Gupta, Ena; Hossen, Shakir; Grigsby, Matthew R.; Herrera, Phabiola; Roldan, Rollin; Paz, Enrique; Jaymez, Amador A.; Chirinos, Eduardo E.; Portugal, Jose; Quispe, Rocio; Brower, Roy G.; Checkley, William",Crit Care,270,9

The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of awake ECMO in severe ARDS patients receiving prolonged ECMO (> 14 days). METHODS: We describe our experience with 12 consecutive severe ARDS patients (age, 39.1 ± 16.4 years) supported with awake ECMO to wait for native lung recovery during prolonged ECMO treatment from July 2013 to January 2018. Outcomes are reported including the hospital mortality, ECMO-related complications and physiological data on weaning from invasive ventilation. RESULTS: The patients received median 26.0 (15.5, 64.8) days of total ECMO duration in the cohort. The longest ECMO support duration was 121 days. Awake ECMO and extubation was implemented after median 10.2(5.0, 42.9) days of ECMO. Awake ECMO was not associated with increased morbidity. The total invasive ventilation duration, lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital in the cohort were 14.0(12.0, 37.3) days, 33.0(22.3, 56.5) days and 46.5(27.3, 84.8) days, respectively. The hospital mortality rate was 33.3% (4/12) in the cohort. Survivors had more stable respiratory rate and heart rate after extubation when compared to the non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: With carefully selected patients, awake ECMO is a feasible and safe strategy for severe pulmonary ARDS patients receiving prolonged ECMO support to wait for native lung recovery.","Xia, Jingen; Gu, Sichao; Li, Min; Liu, Donglin; Huang, Xu; Yi, Li; Wu, Lijuan; Fan, Guohui; Zhan, Qingyuan",BMC Pulm Med,270,9
4427,4427,4427,The impact of high frequency oscillatory ventilation on mortality in paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome,17.325047,12.604798,2020-01-31,"BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) use was associated with greater mortality in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Nevertheless, HFOV is still frequently used as rescue therapy in paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). In view of the limited evidence for HFOV in PARDS and evidence demonstrating harm in adult patients with ARDS, we hypothesized that HFOV use compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality in PARDS. METHODS: Patients with PARDS from 10 paediatric intensive care units across Asia from 2009 to 2015 were identified. Data on epidemiology and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients on HFOV were compared to patients on other modes of ventilation. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 28-day ventilator- (VFD) and intensive care unit- (IFD) free days. Genetic matching (GM) method was used to analyse the association between HFOV treatment with the primary outcome. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis, including propensity score (PS) matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and marginal structural modelling (MSM) to estimate the treatment effect. RESULTS: A total of 328 patients were included. In the first 7 days of PARDS, 122/328 (37.2%) patients were supported with HFOV. There were significant differences in baseline oxygenation index (OI) between the HFOV and non-HFOV groups (18.8 [12.0, 30.2] vs. 7.7 [5.1, 13.1] respectively; p < 0.001). A total of 118 pairs were matched in the GM method which found a significant association between HFOV with 28-day mortality in PARDS [odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 4.4, p value 0.01]. VFD was indifferent between the HFOV and non-HFOV group [mean difference − 1.3 (95%CI − 3.4, 0.9); p = 0.29] but IFD was significantly lower in the HFOV group [− 2.5 (95%CI − 4.9, − 0.5); p = 0.03]. From the sensitivity analysis, PS matching, IPTW and MSM all showed consistent direction of HFOV treatment effect in PARDS. CONCLUSION: The use of HFOV was associated with increased 28-day mortality in PARDS. This study suggests caution but does not eliminate equivocality and a randomized controlled trial is justified to examine the true association.

The influence of the PEEP level was investigated on bacteriology and histology in a model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. SUBJECTS: Nineteen New Zealand rabbits. INTERVENTIONS: The animals were mechanically ventilated with a positive inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH(2)O and received either a zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP, n=6), a 5 cmH(2)O PEEP (n=5) or a 10 cmH(2)O PEEP (n=4). An inoculum of Enterobacter aerogenes was then instilled intrabronchially. The non-ventilated pneumonia group (n=4) was composed of spontaneously breathing animals which received the same inoculum. Pneumonia was assessed 24 h later. MAIN RESULTS: The lung bacterial burden was higher in mechanically ventilated animals compared with spontaneously breathing animals. All animals from the latter group had negative spleen cultures. The spleen bacterial concentration was found to be lower in the 5 cmH(2)O PEEP group when compared to the ZEEP and 10 cmH(2)O PEEP groups (3.1±1.5 vs 4.9±1.1 and 5.0±1.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively; p<0.05). Lung weight and histological score values were lower in the spontaneously breathing animals as well as in the 5 cmH(2)O PEEP group compared with the ZEEP and 10 cmH(2)O groups. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation substantially increased the lung bacterial burden and worsened the histological aspects of pneumonia in this rabbit model. Variations in terms of lung injury and systemic spreading of infection were noted with respect to the ventilatory strategy.","Charles, Pierre Emmanuel; Martin, Laurent; Etienne, Manuel; Croisier, Delphine; Piroth, Lionel; Lequeu, Catherine; Pugin, Jerome; Portier, Henri; Chavanet, Pascal",Intensive Care Med,270,12

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care unit. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: VAP was diagnosed by positive quantitative cultures of both tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and treated appropriately for all significant isolates of tracheal aspirate and BAL in 143 patients who were assigned to de-escalation therapy by BAL or tracheal aspirate. INTERVENTIONS: None.

Additionally, comorbidities of restrained eating present a large burden on both physical and mental health of individuals. Moreover, literature is relatively scarce in Arab countries regarding eating disorders, let alone restrained eating, and among adolescent populations; hence, the aim of this study was to (1) validate the Dutch Restrained Eating Scale in a sample of Lebanese adolescents and (2) assess factors correlated with restrained eating (RE), while taking body dissatisfaction as a moderator between body mass index (BMI) and RE. METHODS: This cross-sectional study, conducted between May and June 2020 during the lockdown period imposed by the Lebanese government, included 614 adolescents aged between 15 and 18 years from all Lebanese governorates (mean age of 16.66 ± 1.01 years). The scales used were: Dutch Restrained Eating Scale, body dissatisfaction subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory-Second version, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Beirut Distress Scale (for psychological distress), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (for depression). RESULTS: The factor analysis yielded a one-factor solution with Eigen values > 1 (variance explained = 59.65 %; α(Cronbach) = 0.924). Female gender (B = 0.19), higher BMI (B = 0.49), higher physical activity index (B = 0.17), following a diet to lose weight (B = 0.26), starving oneself to lose weight (B = 0.13), more body dissatisfaction (B = 1.09), and higher stress (B = 0.18) were significantly associated with more RE, whereas taking medications to lose weight (B=-0.10) was significantly associated with less RE. The interaction body mass index (BMI) by body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with RE; in the group with low BMI, higher body dissatisfaction was significantly associated with more RE. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the Dutch Restrained Eating scale is an adapted and validated tool to be used among Lebanese adolescents and revealed factors associated with restrained eating in this population. Since restrained eating has been associated with many clinically-diagnosed eating disorders, the results of this study might serve as a first step towards the development of prevention strategies targeted towards promoting a healthy lifestyle in Lebanese adolescents.","Boulos Nakhoul, Tracy; Mina, Anthony; Soufia, Michel; Obeid, Sahar; Hallit, Souheil",BMC Pediatr,270,9

It covers an astonishing array of life forms that began with the earliest living occupants of our planet. Of the three recognized domains of life, two (Bacteria and Archaea) consist exclusively of micro-organisms. The third (Eukaryota) contains all of the macroscopic, multi-celled organisms that we recognize as plants and animals, but it also includes many micro-organisms. ‘Microbiome’ is a collective term for all of the micro-organisms belonging to these three domains, while the ‘Biome’ comprises all life on earth. For most of earth’s history until the evolution of multicellular Eukaryota around 600 million years ago, however, the earth’s Biome consisted only of micro-organisms (Fig. 1.1). Even now the Microbiome is estimated to represent more than half of the total living matter (biomass) on the planet [1]. Their invisibility makes it easy for us to overlook the vast impact that micro-organisms have on the sustainability of the planet and of life on earth. While this book will focus on the gut-associated Microbiome, it is important that we start with a look at the wider microbial world.","Flint, Harry J.",Why Gut Microbes Matter,270,9

Especially before 32 weeks of gestation, infants may require respiratory support, but at the same time, ventilation is known to induce oxidative stress, increasing the risk of brain injury. Ventilation may cause brain damage through two pathways: localized cerebral inflammatory response and hemodynamic instability. During ventilation, the most important causes of pro-inflammatory cytokine release are oxygen toxicity, barotrauma and volutrauma. The purpose of this review was to analyze the mechanism of ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) and the relationship between brain injury and VILI in order to provide the safest possible respiratory support to a premature baby. As gentle ventilation from the delivery room is needed to reduce VILI, it is recommended to start ventilation with 21–30% oxygen, prefer a non-invasive respiratory approach and, if mechanical ventilation is required, prefer low Positive End-Expiratory Pressure and tidal volume.","Cannavò, Laura; Rulli, Immacolata; Falsaperla, Raffaele; Corsello, Giovanni; Gitto, Eloisa",Ital J Pediatr,270,12

The formal investigation is achieved by using daily state‐level mobility data from the U.S. covering information on the demographic categories of income, education and race/ethnicity. The results show that social distancing has been experienced more by higher‐income, higher‐educated or Asian people after the declaration of National Emergency on March 13th, 2020. Since alternative demographic groups were subject to alternative employment opportunities during this period (e.g., due to being able to work from home), it is implied that COVID‐19 has redistributive effects that require demographic‐group specific policies.","Yilmazkuday, Hakan",,270,16

The epidemiology and clinical outcomes of influenza B have been less thoroughly investigated in hospitalised patients. The aims of this study were to describe clinical differences and outcomes between influenza A and B patients admitted over a period of 4 years. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of all laboratory confirmed influenza patients ≥18 years at two tertiary hospitals in South Australia. Patients were confirmed as influenza positive if they had a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test of a respiratory specimen. Complications during hospitalisation along with inpatient mortality were compared between influenza A and B. In addition, 30 day mortality and readmissions were compared. Logistic regression model compared outcomes after adjustment for age, Charlson index, sex and creatinine levels. RESULTS: Between January 2016–March 2020, 1846 patients, mean age 66.5 years, were hospitalised for influenza. Of whom, 1630 (88.3%) had influenza A and 216 (11.7%) influenza B. Influenza B patients were significantly younger than influenza A. Influenza A patients were more likely be smokers with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) than influenza B. Complications, including pneumonia and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were similar between two groups, however, septic shock was more common in patients with influenza B. Adjusted analyses showed similar median length of hospital stay (LOS), in hospital mortality, 30-day mortality and readmissions between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza B is less prevalent and occurs mostly in younger hospitalised patients than influenza A. Both strains contribute equally to hospitalisation burden and complications.

Little is known about which risk factors lead to more severe disease or increased mortality in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. We aimed in this study to compare clinical characteristics associated with disease severity and increased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to compare clinical characteristics associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Adults patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020 and April 20, 2020 were included in the study. Prisoners and pregnant women were excluded. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were collected, and then compared to determine association with mortality. Statistical analysis used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between patient characteristics and mortality. RESULTS: The cohort included 92 patients. Median age was 58 years (ranging from 25–93) and 47/92 were men (51%). 12 patients were admitted directly to the intensive care unit (ICU), with 22 additional patients transferred to the ICU. 23 patients required mechanical ventilation. Clinical characteristics significantly associated with mortality in univariate analysis included underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR=7.8, p = 0.002), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=5.21, p=0.02), living in an extended care facility (ECF) (OR=4.2, p=0.025), and immunocompromised status (OR=4.2, p=0.025). Multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant association in patients with underlying CAD (OR=13.1, p=0.001) and those admitted from an ECF (OR=12.1, p=0.005), when adjusted for other variables in the model. Characteristics Associated with Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 in Univariate Analysis [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our study found that CAD and admission from an ECF were associated with SARS-CoV-2 mortality, when adjusted for age and other comorbidities. Further studies are necessary to identify potential preventative strategies to mitigate mortality in this vulnerable population.

Here we report regional differences in clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with RDV, as part of an open-label, randomized phase-3 trial establishing RDV treatment duration. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with oxygen saturation ≤94%, a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the past 4 days and radiographic evidence of pneumonia were randomized 1:1 to receive 5d or 10d of intravenous RDV. We compared d14 clinical outcomes of patients from different geographical areas, as measured by mortality rates, change in clinical status from baseline (BL) on a 7-point ordinal scale and change in O2 requirements from BL. Based on previous analyses in compassionate use data showing region as an important predictor of outcome, Italy was examined separately from other regions. RESULTS: 397 patients were treated with RDV, of which 229 (58%) were in the US, 77 (19%) Italy, 61 (15% in Spain), 12 (3%) Republic of Korea, 9 (2%) Singapore, 4 (1%) Germany, 4 (1%) Hong Kong and 1 (< 1%) Taiwan. BL clinical status was worse in Italy compared to other regions (72% vs 17% requiring high-flow oxygen delivery or higher), and Italian patients were more likely to be male than patients from other regions (69% vs 63%). Overall results showed 5d RDV was as effective as 10d. Mortality at d14 was higher in Italy (18%) compared to all other countries except Italy (7%). Similarly, clinical improvement at d14, measured as ≥2-point increase in the ordinal scale, was lower in Italian patients (39%) compared to all other countries combined (64%). (Fig.1). Figure 1. Change from Baseline in Clinical Status (measured on a 7-point Ordinal Scale) at d14. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Overall, our results demonstrate significant geographical differences in the clinical course of severe COVID-19 patients treated with RDV. We observed worse outcomes, such as increased mortality and lower rate of clinical improvement, in patients from Italy compared to other regions.

Additionally, the uncertainty caused by the disruption often induces the risk aversion in the supply chain members. Motivated by this issue, here we propose a coordination mechanism for a risk-averse supply chain using mean–variance approach. Here, we consider both centralized and decentralized cases and show that our analysis holds good for a central planner as well as for a decentralized supply chain under channel coordinating contracts such as buyback and revenue-sharing schemes. With the help of theoretical and numerical analysis, we exhibit how an individual supply chain agent’s risk aversion behavior can impact the contracts selection mechanism - from the profitability perspective. We extend our analysis to a dyadic setting to a single-supplier multiple-retailer network and confirm that pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists when all the retailers are risk-averse with varying risk attitude.","Biswas, Indranil; Adhikari, Arnab; Biswas, Baidyanath",Decision,270,26

First, we compile a list of previously disclosed vulnerabilities through a comprehensive review of the academic and non-academic sources and test each password manager against all the previously disclosed vulnerabilities. We find a mixed picture of fixed and persisting vulnerabilities. Then we carry out systematic functionality tests on the considered password managers and find four new vulnerabilities. Notably, one of the new vulnerabilities we identified allows a malicious app to impersonate a legitimate app to two out of five widely-used password managers we tested and as a result steal the user’s password for the targeted service. We implement a proof-of-concept attack to show the feasibility of this vulnerability in a real-life scenario. Finally, we report and reflect on our experience of responsible disclosure of the newly discovered vulnerabilities to the corresponding password manager vendors.","Carr, Michael; Shahandashti, Siamak F.",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,270,16

This paper investigates time–frequency relationships across time scales between stock market returns, crude oil prices and exchange rates by applying wavelet analysis technique over the period 1999 to 2021. We find evidence of several strong co-movements between oil price and stock market and between oil price and foreign exchange rate in India. Each of these associations is linked with some important macroeconomic events. This implies economic shocks in developed market have a spillover effect on Indian market. The phase relationships indicate stock returns are in phase with oil prices and exchange rates are in out of phase with oil prices. We find that the impact of volatility at lower scale has a short term effect on the variables. Further, the wavelet coherency at high scale has slower changes with long term effect on the relationship between the variables of our interest. These results are useful for investors aiming specific time horizon of their investment and preferences, for portfolio managers and in risk assessment. Understanding the leading and lagging relationships will also help in business cycle based investing by detecting the subsequent business cycle fluctuations and forecasting the trend.","Das, Sudipta",J Bus Cycle Res,270,12

The aim of this paper is to describe the protocols adopted and to evaluate their impact during the acute phase of Coronavirus spread, focusing on the management of elective and urgent/emergent surgery, outpatients activity, and also health staff preservation from intra-hospital Coronavirus disease 2019 infection. METHODS Several measures were progressively adopted in the Padova University Hospital to front the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, with a clear strong asset established by 9 March 2020, after the Northern Italy lockdown. Since this date, the Vascular Surgery Unit started a ""scaled-down"" activity, both for elective surgical procedures and for the outpatient Clinical activities; different protocols were developed for health preservation of staff and patients. We compared a two months period, 30 days before and 30 days after this time point. In particular, emergent vascular surgery was regularly guaranteed as well as urgent surgery (to be performed within 24 h). Elective cases were scheduled for ""non-deferrable"" pathology. A swab test protocol for COVID-19 was applied to health-care professionals and hospitalized patients. RESULTS The number of urgent or emergent aortic cases remained stable during the two months period, while the number of Hospital admissions via Emergency Room related to critical limb ischemia decreased after national lockdown by about 20%. Elective vascular surgery was scaled down by 50% starting from 9 March; 35% of scheduled elective cases refused hospitalization during the lockdown period and 20% of those contacted for hospitalization where postponed due to fever, respiratory symptoms, or close contacts with Coronavirus disease 2019 suspected cases. Elective surgery reduction did not negatively influence overall carotid or aortic outcomes, while we reported a higher major limb amputation rate for critical limb ischemia (about 10%, compared to 4% for the standard practice period). We found that 4 out of 98 (4%) health-care providers on the floor had an asymptomatic positive swab test. Among 22 vascular doctors, 3 had a confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 infection (asymptomatic); a total of 72 swab were performed (mean = 3.4 swab/person/month) during this period; no cases of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (deaths or requiring intensive care treatment) infection were reported within this period for the staff or hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS Elective vascular surgery needs to be guaranteed as possible during Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The number of truly emergent cases did not reduce, on the other side, Emergency Room accesses for non-emergent cases decreased. Our preliminary results seem to describe a scenario where, if the curve of the outbreak in the regional population is flattened, in association with appropriate hospitals containment rules, it may be possible to continue the activity of the Vascular Surgery Units and guarantee the minimal standard of care.","Piazza, M; Xodo, A; Squizzato, F; Conti, G De; Boemo, D; Carretta, G; Grego, F; Antonello, M",Vascular,270,26

Primary care has played different roles in each of the health systems in combatting the pandemic. Both Hong Kong and Singapore have a 2-tiered health system with the majority of primary care provided in the private sector. The primary care system in Beijing consists of community health facilities, township health centers, and village clinics. The role of primary care in Hong Kong includes using the public primary care clinics as part of an enhanced surveillance program together with accident and emergency departments, as well as triaging patients with suspected infection to hospitals. Singapore's response to COVID-19 has included close cooperation between redeveloped polyclinics and private and public health preparedness clinics to provide screening with swab tests for suspected cases in the primary care setting. Beijing's unique response has consisted of using online platforms for general practitioners to facilitate monitoring among community residents, as well as public health education and a mobilized pharmacy refill program to reduce risk of transmission. Established challenges, however, include shortages of personal protective equipment and the heavy workload for health care staff.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 92 dental hygienists completed the questionnaire (consisting of 19 questions on personal and professional characteristics, clinical observation and treatment of halitosis, the referral of patients with halitosis, the presence and usefulness of a protocol). The questionnaire was distributed using a social media platform for dental professionals in oral health care from all over the Netherlands. RESULTS 83.4% of 90 dental hygienists had paid attention to the patient's breath but only 37.8% of dental hygienists always informed the patient. Reasons for not informing patients were the fear of the patient's possible reaction or because other oral health problems were more important. Of the included dental hygienists 67.8% had never referred a patient for treatment of halitosis. 86.7% of the dental hygienists stated there was no protocol for diagnosis and treatment of patients with halitosis. However, 90.0% of the dental hygienists acknowledged a protocol would be useful. CONCLUSIONS The majority of the dental hygienists in the Netherlands had paid attention to the patient's breath, but only a small group of dental hygienists informed their patients about halitosis. In dental practices halitosis is an underestimated problem. During the coronavirus pandemic people are more aware with the smell of their breath.

In the current study, we examined the functional role of the AcMNPV GP64 transmembrane (TM) domain by replacing the 23-amino-acid GP64 TM domain with corresponding TM domain sequences from a range of viral and cellular type I membrane proteins, including Orgyia pseudotsugata MNPV (OpMNPV) GP64 and F, thogotovirus GP75, Lymantria dispar MNPV (LdMNPV) F, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) GP41, human CD4 and glycophorin A (GpA), and influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), and with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor addition sequence. In transient expression experiments with Sf9 cells, chimeric GP64 proteins containing either a GPI anchor or TM domains from LdMNPV F or HIV-1 GP41 failed to localize to the cell surface and thus appear to be incompatible with either GP64 structure or cell transport. All of the mutant constructs detected at the cell surface mediated hemifusion (outer leaflet merger) upon low-pH treatment, but only those containing TM domains from CD4, GpA, OpMNPV GP64, and thogotovirus GP75 mediated pore formation and complete membrane fusion activity. This supports a model in which partial fusion (hemifusion) proceeds by a mechanism that is independent of the TM domain and the TM domain participates in the enlargement or expansion of fusion pores after hemifusion. GP64 proteins containing heterologous TM domains mediated virion budding with dramatically differing levels of efficiency. In addition, chimeric GP64 proteins containing TM domains from CD4, GpA, HA, and OpMNPV F were incorporated into budded virions but were unable to rescue the infectivity of a gp64 null virus, whereas those with TM domains from OpMNPV GP64 and thogotovirus GP75 rescued infectivity. These results show that in addition to its basic role in membrane anchoring, the GP64 TM domain is critically important for GP64 trafficking, membrane fusion, virion budding, and virus infectivity. These critical functions were replaced only by TM domains from related viral membrane proteins.","Li, Zhaofei; Blissard, Gary W",Journal of virology,270,1

DESIGN : Evidence-based algorithms were developed from published research as well as ""needs and values"" assessments. Research evidence was obtained from 97 studies reporting the protectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis, seasonal vaccination, and mask use. Needs and values assessments were undertaken by international experts in pandemic infection control and local healthcare workers. Opportunity and resources costs were not determined. SETTING The Australian government commissioned the development of an evidence-based algorithm for inclusion in the 2008 revision of the Australian Health and Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza. PARTICIPANTS Two international infection control teams responsible for healthcare worker safety during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak reviewed the evidence-based algorithms. The algorithms were then reviewed for needs and values by eight local clinicians who were considered key frontline clinicians during the contain and sustain phases. The international teams reviewed for practicability of implementation, whereas local clinicians reviewed for clinician compliance. RESULTS Despite strong evidence for vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis providing significant protection, clinicians believed they required the additional combinations of both masks and face shields. Despite the equivocal evidence for the efficacy of surgical and N95 masks and the provision of algorithms appropriate for the level of risk according to clinical care during a pandemic, clinicians still demanded N95 masks plus face shields in combination with prophylaxis and novel vaccination. CONCLUSIONS Conventional evidence-based principles could not be applied to formulate recommendations due to the lack of pandemic-specific efficacy data of protection tools and the inherent unpredictability of pandemics. As an alternative, evidence-based principles have been used to formulate recommendations while giving priority to the needs and values of healthcare workers over the research evidence.","Gralton, Jan; McLaws, Mary-Louise",Critical care medicine,270,26

The available treatments are temporary, acting over short period of time. The main pathological hallmark of the disease includes cholinergic dysfunction, oxidative stress, accumulation of Aβ fibrils and tau tangles. In context with the multi-factorial nature of this disease, two different series of molecules were developed to hit the multifactorial disease targets. Mainly, the molecules were designed to inhibit the AChE and aggregation of Aβ, and also oxidative damage. Two novel series of TAC-fenbufen/menbutone conjugated molecules were designed, synthesized and bio-assayed. All compounds showed inhibition capacity towards AChE, Aβ aggregation and moderate to good radical scavenging capacity. Particularly, five TAC-menbutone molecules showed improved AChE and Aβ aggregation inhibition capacity compared to TAC-fenbufen conjugated molecules. Overall, these novel series of molecules may be potential drug lead molecules in the treatment of AD.","Hiremathad, Asha; Chaves, Sílvia; Keri, Rangappa S",Chemistry & biodiversity,270,1

The pandemic has represented a humanitarian crisis, since both the disease and the measures to contain it lead to persistent socioeconomic effects. In this context, the labor category has an important role, either because of the feasibility of maintaining the social distancing and living conditions allowed by the employment relationship, or because of the impossibility of adopting protection strategies due to job insecurity. The essay was initially built on the basis of a literature review on the interface between COVID-19 and workers' health, carried out from December 2019 to April 2020, on the PubMed, BIREME, Cochrane Library, medRxiv and LitCovid bases, as well as using gray literature. Health professionals are more affected, but they also have greater access to diagnosis; however, data are still scarce on other professional categories, as well as on the social determinants that lead to greater labor-related vulnerability. In Brazil, the pandemic coincides with a situation in which workers accumulate significant losses of labor and social security rights, in addition to pre-existing social inequalities, such as precarious housing, with greater exposure and risk. Although the pandemic is still evolving, social inequalities are expected to intensify, with the deep retraction of the economy, and workers must be a priority target of attention in the control and spread of the disease, in addition to being the axis for planning public social and health protection policies.","Santos, Kionna Oliveira Bernardes; Fernandes, Rita de Cássia Pereira; Almeida, Milena Maria Cordeiro de; Miranda, Samilly Silva; Mise, Yukari Figueroa; Lima, Monica Angelim Gomes de",Cadernos de saude publica,270,33

STUDY DESIGN We performed a retrospective review of patients who had no desire for future child bearing and who were undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy for symptomatic myomas at 4 institutions. Among them, 41 patients concurrently underwent opportunistic salpingectomy (the opportunistic salpingectomy group) and 65 patients did not undergo salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy (the no-salpingectomy group). The primary and secondary outcome measures were change of ovarian reserve determined by the rate of decline in the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level from before surgery to 3 months post-surgery, and surgical outcomes. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There were also no differences in surgical outcomes, such as operative time, operative bleeding, hospital stay, or complications between groups. The decline rate in AMH was 18.6% (interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-46.8%) in the opportunistic salpingectomy group and 10.4% (IQR 2.6-46.8%) in the no-salpingectomy group, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.593). CONCLUSION Opportunistic salpingectomy at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy was not associated with negative effects on ovarian reserve or increased surgical risk.","Song, Taejong; Lee, San-Hui; Kim, Woo Young; Heo, Eun Jin; Kim, Tae-Joong",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,270,1

The most common ovine and porcine models do not reproduce the primary pathogenic mechanism of the disease, through the aspiration of oropharyngeal pathogens, or the most prevalent human etiology. Herein the authors characterize a novel porcine model of VAP due to aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS Ten healthy pigs were intubated, positioned in anti-Trendelenburg, and mechanically ventilated for 72 h. Three animals did not receive bacterial challenge, whereas in seven animals, a P. aeruginosa suspension was instilled into the oropharynx. Tracheal aspirates were cultured and respiratory mechanics were recorded. On autopsy, lobar samples were obtained to corroborate VAP through microbiological and histological studies. RESULTS In animals not challenged, diverse bacterial colonization of the airways was found and monolobar VAP rarely developed. In animals with P. aeruginosa challenge, colonization of tracheal secretion increased up to 6.39 ± 0.34 log colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml (P < 0.001). VAP was confirmed in six of seven pigs, in 78% of the cases developed in the dependent lung segments (right medium and lower lobes, P = 0.032). The static respiratory system elastance worsened to 41.5 ± 5.8 cm H2O/l (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The authors devised a VAP model caused by aspiration of oropharyngeal P. aeruginosa, a frequent causative pathogen of human VAP. The model also overcomes the practical and legislative limitations associated with the use of primates. The authors' model could be employed to study pathophysiologic mechanisms, as well as novel diagnostic/preventive strategies.","Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Rigol, Montserrat; Marti, Joan-Daniel; Saucedo, Lina; Ranzani, Otavio T; Roca, Ignasi; Cabanas, Maria; Muñoz, Laura; Giunta, Valeria; Luque, Nestor; Rinaudo, Mariano; Esperatti, Mariano; Fernandez-Barat, Laia; Ferrer, Miquel; Vila, Jordi; Ramirez, Jose; Torres, Antoni",Anesthesiology,270,16

Findings could serve as a roadmap for further investigations and potentially inform efforts to prevent physician suicide. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched for English-language publications from August 21, 2017 through April 28, 2018. Inclusion criteria were a primary outcome or thesis focused on suicide (including suicide completion, attempts, and thoughts or ideation) among medical students, postgraduate trainees, or attending physicians. Opinion articles were included. Studies that were non-English, or those that only mentioned physician burnout, mental health or substance use disorders were excluded. Data extraction was performed by two authors. Results: The search yielded 1,596 articles, of which 347 articles passed to the full-text review round. The oldest article was an editorial from 1903; 210 (60.3%) articles were published from 2000 to present. Authors originated from 37 countries and 143 (41.2%) were opinion articles. Most discussed were suicide risk factors and culture of practice issues, while least discussed themes included public health and postvention. Conclusions: Consistency and reliability of data and information about physician suicides could be improved. Data limitations partly contribute to these issues. Also, various suicide risk factors for physicians have been explored, and several remain poorly understood. Based on this scoping review, a public health approach, including surveillance and early warning systems, investigations of sentinel cases, and postvention may be impactful next steps in preventing physician deaths by suicide.","Leung, T.

DESIGN Process evaluation. SETTING Family physician offices in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS Five public health nurse-facilitators and 53 primary care practices including 143 family physicians. METHOD Effectiveness of facilitator training assessed by self-administered questionnaires. Data assessing process of facilitation collected through activity logs and narrative reports. Physicians' satisfaction assessed by post-intervention questionnaire. MAIN FINDINGS Facilitators reported that training strongly contributed to their knowledge and skills and all were either satisfied or highly satisfied with their facilitation training. All practices received at least two visits by the facilitator and more than half (51%) were visited three or more times. Facilitators identified the provision of the evidence-based Tool Kit and consensus-building with office staff as key factors contributing to the intervention's success. Of the 45% of physicians who completed the questionnaire (65/143), only 5% reported being somewhat dissatisfied with the intervention, 11% reported the visits were not frequent enough, and 9% thought the visits were too close together. The majority (97%) felt the facilitation program should be available to all family physicians and 98% would continue to use the service if available.

The developed detection--identification theory generalizes the changepoint detection theory developed by Tartakovsky (2019) to the case of multiple composite post-change hypotheses when one has not only to detect a change as quickly as possible but also to identify (or isolate) the true post-change distribution.

Six hundred and seventy-six individuals participated in this quantitative study (Malta: N = 204; Italy N = 472).

To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age &#8805;18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to five non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. RESULTS: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died.

Additionally, the paper demonstrates software integration architectures that are very significant to create smart healthcare systems, integrating seamlessly the benefit of data analytics and other tools of AI. The explained developed systems focus on several facets: the contribution of each developed framework, the detailed working procedure, the performance as outcomes, and the comparative merits and limitations. The current research challenges with potential future directions are addressed to highlight the drawbacks of existing systems and the possible methods to introduce novel frameworks, respectively. This review aims at providing comprehensive insights into the recent developments of smart healthcare systems to equip experts to contribute to the field.","Nasr, Mahmoud; Islam, MD.

Here, we show a hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945;-dependent microRNA (miR)-210 up-regulation in monocytes and macrophages upon pathogen interaction. MiR-210 knockout in the hematopoietic lineage or in monocytes/macrophages mitigated the symptoms of endotoxemia, bacteremia, sepsis, and parasitosis, limiting the cytokine storm, organ damage/dysfunction, pathogen spreading, and lethality. Similarly, pharmacologic miR-210 inhibition improved the survival of septic mice. Mechanistically, miR-210 induction in activated macrophages supported a switch toward a proinflammatory state by lessening mitochondria respiration in favor of glycolysis, partly achieved by downmodulating the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU. In humans, augmented miR-210 levels in circulating monocytes correlated with the incidence of sepsis, while serum levels of monocyte/macrophage-derived miR-210 were associated with sepsis mortality. Together, our data identify miR-210 as a fine-tuning regulator of macrophage metabolism and inflammatory responses, suggesting miR-210-based therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.","Virga, Federico; Cappellesso, Federica; Stijlemans, Benoit; Henze, Anne-Theres; Trotta, Rosa; Van Audenaerde, Jonas; Mirchandani, Ananda S; Sanchez-Garcia, Manuel A; Vandewalle, Jolien; Orso, Francesca; Riera-Domingo, Carla; Griffa, Alberto; Ivan, Cristina; Smits, Evelien; Laoui, Damya; Martelli, Fabio; Langouche, Lies; Van den Berghe, Greet; Feron, Olivier; Ghesquière, Bart; Prenen, Hans; Libert, Claude; Walmsley, Sarah R; Corbet, Cyril; Van Ginderachter, Jo A; Ivan, Mircea; Taverna, Daniela; Mazzone, Massimiliano",Sci.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were obtained from a health survey conducted in July 2020 among the staff members of a designated medical institution for COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1228 hospital workers. EXPOSURE OF INTEREST: Engagement in COVID-19-related work (qualitatively (ie, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work or affiliation to related departments) as well as quantitatively (ie, working hours)) and job categories. OUTCOME MEASURES: Depressive symptoms. RESULTS: There was no significant association between depressive symptoms and engagement in work with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or affiliation to COVID-19-related departments. However, working for longer hours in March/April, when Japan witnessed a large number of infected cases, was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (&#8805;11 hours/day: prevalence ratio (PR)=1.45, 95% CI=1.06 to 1.99, compared with &#8804;8 hours/day). Nurses were more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms than did doctors (PR=1.70, 95% CI=1.14 to 2.54). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work or having an affiliation to related departments might not be linked with a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms among Japanese hospital workers; contrarily, long working hours appeared to increase the prevalence of depressive symptoms.","Inoue, Yosuke; Yamamoto, Shohei; Fukunaga, Ami; Hoang, Dong Van; Miki, Takako; Islam, Zobida; Miyo, Kengo; Ishii, Masamichi; Ishiwari, Hironori; Konishi, Maki; Ohmagari, Norio; Mizoue, Tetsuya",BMJ Open,270,2

How US hospitals responded to this crisis is unknown. RESEARCH QUESTION: What actions did US hospitals take to prepare for a potential surge in demand for critical care services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From September to November 2020, the chief nursing officers of a representative sample of US hospitals were surveyed regarding organizational actions taken to increase or maintain critical care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted proportions of hospitals for each potential action were calculated to create estimates across the entire population of US hospitals, accounting for both the sampling strategy and nonresponse. Also examined was whether the types of actions taken varied according to the cumulative regional incidence of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Responses were received from 169 of 540 surveyed US hospitals (response rate, 31.3%). Almost all hospitals canceled or postponed elective surgeries (96.7%) and nonsurgical procedures (94.8%). Few hospitals created new medical units in areas not typically dedicated to health care (12.9%), and almost none adopted triage protocols (5.6%) or protocols to connect multiple patients to a single ventilator (4.8%). Actions to increase or preserve ICU staff, including use of ICU telemedicine, were highly variable, without any single dominant strategy. Hospitals experiencing a higher incidence of COVID-19 did not consistently take different actions compared with hospitals facing lower incidence. INTERPRETATION: Responses of hospitals to the mass need for critical care services due to the COVID-19 pandemic were highly variable. Most hospitals canceled procedures to preserve ICU capacity and scaled up ICU capacity using existing clinical space and staffing. Future research linking hospital response to patient outcomes can inform planning for additional surges of this pandemic or other events in the future.","Kerlin, Meeta Prasad; Costa, Deena Kelly; Davis, Billie S; Admon, Andrew J; Vranas, Kelly C; Kahn, Jeremy M",Chest,270,16

The activated immune cells produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1ß (IL)-1ß. Management depends on the recognized diagnosis. In the setting of a cytokine storm syndrome and infection, collaborative involvement of specialists, including infectious disease and rheumatology is ideal. Anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been used subcutaneously and intravenously in pediatric patients and is considered a first-line treatment for MAS and secondary HLH (sHLH) among many pediatric rheumatologists. Previous reports of anakinra used in adults for treatment of MAS or sHLH are limited to subcutaneous administration. In this issue, Moneagudo et al. present a series of adult patients with sHLH treated with intravenous anakinra, including patients in whom subcutaneous anakinra was insufficient. As the authors suggest, there is a potential therapeutic use for anakinra in sHLH or the cytokine storm syndrome triggered by COVID19.

SupMMD combines both supervised learning for salience and unsupervised learning for coverage and diversity. Further, we adapt multiple kernel learning to make use of similarity across multiple information sources (e.g., text features and knowledge based concepts).

We aim to examine the relationship between exposure to and trust in COVID-19 news (from Television, social media, interpersonal communication) and information sources (healthcare experts, government, clerics) and belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, as well as critical verification practices before posting on social media. METHODS: We use a cross-sectional researcher-administered phone survey of adults living in Lebanon between March 27 and April 23, 2020. RESULTS: The sample included 56.1% men and 43.9% women, 37.9% with a university degree, 63.0% older than 30, and 7% with media literacy training. Those who trust COVID-19 news from social media [95%CI:(1.05-1.52)] and interpersonal communication [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)], and those who trust information from clerics [95%CI:(1.25-1.82)] were more likely to believe in COVID-19 myths and false information. University graduates [95%CI:(0.25-0.51)] and those who trust information from government [95%CI:(0.65-0.89] were less likely to believe in myths and false information. Those who believe in COVID-19 myths and false information [95%CI:(0.25-0.70)] were less likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. Only those who underwent media literacy training [95%CI:(1.24-6.55)] were more likely to engage in critical social media posting practices. CONCLUSION: Higher education and trust in information from government contributed to decreasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information. Trust in news from social media, interpersonal communication and clerics contributed to increasing belief in COVID-19 myths and false information, which in turn contributed to less critical social media posting practices, thereby exacerbated the infodemic. Media literacy training contributed to increasing critical social media posting practices, thereby played a role in mitigating the infodemic.","Melki, Jad; Tamim, Hani; Hadid, Dima; Makki, Maha; El Amine, Jana; Hitti, Eveline",PLoS One,270,6

This study aimed to determine specific risk factors and prognosis of EC with PC recurrence (PCR) versus no PC recurrence (NPCR). METHODS: Data of all patients with EC who received primary surgical treatment between January 2000 and February 2017 were abstracted from the French FRANCOGYN Research Group database. Clinical and pathologic variables were compared between the two groups (PCR vs. NPCR). Multivariate analysis was performed to define prognostic factors for peritoneal recurrence. Overall survivals (OS) of patients after recurrence were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The study analyzed 1466 patients, and 257 of these patients (17.5%) had recurrence. At presentation, 63 of these patients had PC. International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages 3 and 4 disease were significantly associated with PCR versus NPCR (odds ratio 2.24; 95% confidence interval 1.23-4.07; p = 0.008). The death rate for the patients with PC was 47.6%, with a median survival of 12 months after diagnosis of recurrence. According to the histologic subtype, OS was 29 months (Q1-Q3, 13-NA) for endometrioid carcinomas, 7.5 months (Q1-Q3, 4-15) for serous carcinomas, and 10 months (Q1-Q3, 5-15) for clear cell carcinomas. Chemotherapy for treatment of PCR was associated with improved OS after recurrence (OSAR; p = 0.0025). CONCLUSION: An initial advanced stage of EC is a risk factor for PCR. For women with PCR, a diagnosis of type 1 EC recurrence more than 12 months after the initial treatment and management of PCR with chemotherapy is associated with improved OSAR. Prospective studies are needed to determine the precise optimal management required in this clinical situation and to assess the relevance of biomarkers to predict the risk of PCR for EC patients.","Gaudet Chardonnet, A; Azaïs, H; Ballester, M; Raimond, E; Bendifallah, S; Ouldamer, L; Coutant, C; Graesslin, O; Touboul, C; Collinet, P; Bricou, A; Huchon, C; Daraï, E; Lavoue, V; Koskas, M; Uzan, C; Canlorbe, G",Ann. surg. oncol,270,29

STUDY DESIGN: Experimental ex vivo study. ANIMALS: Cervical spinal segments (C5-C7) from eight canine cadavers. METHODS: The range of motion (ROM) and elastic zone stiffness (EZS) of the spines were determined with a four-point bending device in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation for four conditions: native, discectomy, cage (at C6-C7), and cage with plates (at C6-C7). The disc height index (DHI) for each condition was determined using radiography. RESULTS: Discectomy resulted in overall increased ROM (p < .01) and EZS (p < .05) and decreased DHI (p < .005) when compared to the native condition. Placement of the cage increased DHI (p < .001) and restored total ROM during flexion/extension, lateral bending and axial rotation, and EZS during flexion/extension to the level of the native spine. Application of the plates further reduced the total ROM during flexion/extension (p < .001) and lateral bending (p < .001), but restored ROM in extension and EZS during lateral bending.

CONCLUSION: An anchorless intervertebral cage used as a stand-alone device was able to restore the disc height and spinal stability to the level of the native cervical spine, whereas the addition of plates further reduced the spinal unit mobility. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study implies that the intervertebral cage may be used as a stand-alone device in the spinal unit fixation in the canine cervical spine.","Beishuizen, Rick; Reints Bok, Tjarda E; Teunissen, Michelle; van der Veen, Albert J; Emanuel, Kaj S; Tryfonidou, Marianna A; Meij, Bjorn P",Vet. surg,270,25

However, neurological symptoms have also been observed in some patients. The cause of these complications is currently unknown. Here, we use human-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We find expression of viral receptor ACE2 in mature choroid plexus cells expressing abundant lipoproteins, but not in neurons or other cell types. We challenge organoids with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells are apolipoprotein- and ACE2-expressing cells of the choroid plexus epithelial barrier. Finally, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 damages the choroid plexus epithelium, leading to leakage across this important barrier that normally prevents entry of pathogens, immune cells, and cytokines into cerebrospinal fluid and the brain.","Pellegrini, Laura; Albecka, Anna; Mallery, Donna L; Kellner, Max J; Paul, David; Carter, Andrew P; James, Leo C; Lancaster, Madeline A",Cell Stem Cell,270,26

The clinical features of COVID-19 were mentioned in previous studies. However, risk factors for COVID-19 are not fully recognized. The aim of this study is to characterize risk factors and clinical features of COVID-19 disease in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective, chart-review, case-control study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data on patients diagnosed between March 18 and May 18, 2020 were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We reviewed medical records on 297 suspected cases of COVID-19. Of these, 175 (59%) tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and considered as cases, while 122 (41%) tested negative and considered as control. COVID-19 positive cases were more likely to be males, and non-health care providers. Hypertension (15%), diabetes (10%) and two or more concurrent comorbidities (54.4%) were more prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Patients presented with fever, cough, and loss of taste/smell were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (P = 0.001, 0.008, 0.008; respectively). Radiological evidence of pneumonia was associated with confirmed COVID-19 disease (P = 0.001). Shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with the risk of COVID-19 at presentation. On admission, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets were significantly lower among COVID-19 patients compared with controls. Surprisingly, D-Dimer levels were lower among COVID-19 positive patients when compared with controls.

In particular, the conceptualization and operationalization of good governance tenets in healthcare systems are an enduring mirage for fragile states. While literature affirms the critical role of effective governance in healthcare delivery systems, the failure of governments in fragile states such as Zimbabwe to provide effective access to equitable and quality healthcare services is symptomatic of weak governance mechanisms. Despite the many studies on health sector governance, there seem to be a persistent lack of clarity on the exact impediments to the effective and efficient governance in healthcare systems in fragile states of the world. This research sought to establish the inherent impediments to effective healthcare governance in fragile states. This was a two-stage multimethod research which started with a directed literature search and focus group discussions to identify the themes that were used to develop the questionnaire for data collection to identify and confirm the inherent impediments to healthcare governance in fragile states. The research showed among others, that healthcare system governance in fragile states is prone to be influenced by the lack of justice-based leadership, leadership legitimacy, clear leadership roles and responsibilities, leadership probity, clear vision and mission, administrative efficiency, performance oriented culture, transparency and predictability, ethical decision-making, rule-bound decision-making and action, delegated authority, leadership accountability, strong regulatory regimes, effective corruption prevention mechanisms and a strong community voice which combined present serious impediments to effective governance of healthcare delivery systems.

However, methodical limitations prevent O2 measurements on the millisecond scale. To bypass the constraints of quasi-continuous recording, progressive measurements of O2 partial pressure (PO2 ) in rhythmically contracting skeletal muscle were compiled to describe the O2 kinetics surrounding and including a single muscle contraction. Phosphorescence quenching microscopy measured PO2 in the interstitium of the rat spinotrapezius muscle. Measurements were triggered by contraction-inducing electrical pulses. For the first 60 seconds, measurement preceeded stimulation. After 60, measurement followed with a progressive 20 ms increment. Thus, the first 60 measurements describe the overall PO2 response to electrical stimulation initiated after a 10 second rest period, while 61-100 (stroboscopic mode) were compiled into a single 800 ms profile of the PO2 transient surrounding muscle contraction. Thirty seconds of stimulated contractions decreased interstitial PO2 from a baseline of 71 ± 1.4 mmHg to an ""active"" steady-state of 43 ± 1.5 mmHg. The stroboscopic mode compilation revealed an unexpected post-contractile rise in PO2 as a 205 ms spike with a maximum amplitude of 58 ± 3.8 mmHg at 68 ms, which restored 58% of the PO2 drop from baseline. Interpretation of this phenomenon is based on classical experiments by G.V. Anrep (1935), who discovered the rapid thrust of blood flow associated with muscle contraction. In addition to the metabolic implications during exercise, the physiological impact of these PO2 spikes may grow with an increased rate of rhythmical contractions in muscle or heart. NEW&NOTEWORTHY: The principal finding is a spike of interstitial PO2 , produced by a twitch in a rhythmically contracting muscle. A possible mechanism is flushing capillaries with arterial blood by mechanical forces. A technical novelty is the PO2 measurement with a ""stroboscopic mode"" and progressively increasing delay between stimulator pulse and PO2 measuring. That permitted a 20 ms time resolution for a 205 ms spike duration, using an excitation flash rate one per second.","Golub, Aleksander S; Nugent, William H; Song, Bjorn K",Physiol Rep,270,14

Thus, there is evidence showing possible retrograde transmission of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to regions of the brain stem. METHODS: This is a literature review article. The research design method is an evidence-based rapid review. The present discourse aim is first to scrutinize and assess the available literature on COVID-19 repercussion on the central nervous system (CNS). Standard literature and database searches were implemented, gathered relevant material, and extracted information was then assessed. RESULTS: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors being the receptor for the virus, the threat to the central nervous system is expected. Neurons and glial cells express ACE2 receptors in the CNS, and recent studies suggest that activated glial cells contribute to neuroinflammation and the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS. The SARS-CoV-2-induced immune-mediated demyelinating disease, cerebrovascular damage, neurodegeneration, and depression are some of the neurological complications discussed here.

When caring for patients with tracheostomy, speech-language pathologists have significant exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This tutorial provides guidance on practices for safely performing patient evaluation and procedures, thereby reducing risk of infection. Method Data were collated through review of literature, guidelines, and consensus statements relating to COVID-19 and similar high-consequent infections, with a focus on mitigating risk of transmission to health care workers. Particular emphasis was placed on speech-language pathologists, nurses, and other allied health professionals. A multinational interdisciplinary team then analyzed findings, arriving at recommendations through consensus via electronic communications and video conference. Results Reports of transmission of infection to health care workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks substantiate the need for safe practices. Many procedures routinely performed by speech-language pathologists have a significant risk of infection due to aerosol generation. COVID-19 testing can inform level of protective equipment, and meticulous hygiene can stem spread of nosocomial infection. Modifications to standard clinical practice in tracheostomy are often required. Personal protective equipment, including either powered air-purifying respirator or N95 mask, gloves, goggles, and gown, are needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Speech-language pathologists are often called on to assist in the care of patients with tracheostomy and known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Appropriate care of these patients is predicated on maintaining the health and safety of the health care team. Careful adherence to best practices can significantly reduce risk of infectious transmission.","Zaga, Charissa J; Pandian, Vinciya; Brodsky, Martin B; Wallace, Sarah; Cameron, Tanis S; Chao, Caroline; Orloff, Lisa Ann; Atkins, Naomi E; McGrath, Brendan A; Lazarus, Cathy L; Vogel, Adam P; Brenner, Michael J",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,270,24

Some scholars argue that democratic governments are disadvantaged in coping with the current pandemic mainly because they cannot intervene in their citizens' lives as aggressively as their authoritarian counterparts. Other scholars, however, suggest that possible data manipulation may account for the apparent advantage of authoritarian countries. Taking such a possibility seriously, this paper analyzes the relationship between political regimes, data transparency, and COVID-19 deaths using cross-national data for over 108 countries, obtained from Worldometer COVID-19 Data, Polity V Project, Variety of Democracy (V-Dem) Project, HRV Transparency Project among other sources. Regression analyses indicate that authoritarian countries do not necessarily tend to have fewer COVID-19 deaths than their democratic counterparts after controlling for other factors, especially data transparency. The transparency variable itself, on the other hand, is positively correlated with the number of death cases more consistently (P &lt;0.05). Overall, the estimation results point to the possible data manipulation, not the nature of regime characteristics itself, as a more significant source for the seemingly low casualty rates in authoritarian countries.","Annaka, Susumu",SSM - Population Health,270,6

It evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 infection on 403 patients who are United States military veterans: 160 patients with chronic mental illnesses and 243 without mental illness. The patients were observed remotely using a telehealth clinic until they were free of COVID-19 symptoms or tested negative for coronavirus RNA. Telemedicine was used successfully to manage patients with mental illness and acute COVID-19 infections. These patients maintained their therapeutic engagement using telephone or video-on-demand encounters. The use of this technology allowed for follow-up visits over an extended period of time, including resolution of their symptoms, re-test results, and management of their comorbidities. The outcomes of their infections mirrored those of patients without preexisting mental illness. They did require more intense psychiatric interventions, primarily with medications, but no hospitalizations for mental health occurred. Although the pandemic has several elements known to impact greatly on mental health (social illness, loneliness, fear, and uncertainty), the effect on patients with COVID-19 infection and mental illness diagnosis does not appear to cause psychiatric decompensation. Telemedicine offered a means for more intense engagement on follow-up of these patients, which may have played a role. Because of the small numbers in this study and the unique resources available for veterans, more extensive study is required to determine the effect of the pandemic in patients with mental illness who are not veterans.

In settings of large numbers of patients, a risk assessment tool may guide resource allocation not only for patient care but also for maximum health care and public health benefit. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether a COVID-19 telemedicine risk assessment tool accurately predicts hospitalizations. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a COVID-19 telemedicine home monitoring program serving health care workers and the community in Atlanta, Georgia, with enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020;the final call range was from March 27 to June 19, 2020. All patients were assessed by medical providers using an institutional COVID-19 risk assessment tool designating patients as Tier 1 (low risk for hospitalization), Tier 2 (intermediate risk for hospitalization), or Tier 3 (high risk for hospitalization). Patients were followed with regular telephone calls to an endpoint of improvement or hospitalization. Using survival analysis by Cox regression with days to hospitalization as the metric, we analyzed the performance of the risk tiers and explored individual patient factors associated with risk of hospitalization. RESULTS: Providers using the risk assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to tiers: Tier 1, 237 out of 496 (47.8%);Tier 2, 185 out of 496 (37.3%);and Tier 3, 74 out of 496 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 out of 237 (1.3%) for Tier 1, 15 out of 185 (8.1%) for Tier 2, and 17 out of 74 (23%) for Tier 3.

It kills one child every 30 seconds and over one million people annually. If diagnosed in a timely manner, however, most people can be effectively treated with antimalarial therapy. Several deaths due to malaria are byproducts of disparities in the social determinants of health; the current gold standard for diagnosing malaria requires microscopes, reagents, and other equipment that most patients of low socioeconomic brackets do not have access to. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that allows for rapid automated diagnosis of malaria (achieving a high classification accuracy of 98%), as well as a deep neural network (DNN) based three-dimensional (3D) modeling algorithm that renders 3D models of parasitic cells in augmented reality (AR). This creates an opportunity to optimize the current workflow for malaria diagnosis and demonstrates potential for deep learning models to improve telemedicine practices and patient health literacy on a global scale.","Ramesh, Vignav",,270,1

METHODS: An online questionnaire was developed according to the Italian validated COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) and addressed to the general population (GP). A similar questionnaire, augmented with CF specific questions, targeted pwCFs. The two web-based surveys were accessible for some weeks during the lockdown mandated by the Italian government. RESULTS: The CF questionnaire was completed by 712 adult pwCFs (422 females), matched for sex and age with a 1/5 ratio to GP questionnaire respondents. Mild or medium distress affected 40.2% of pwCFs and 43.9% of GP controls, severe distress 5.3% of pwCFs and 6.2% of GP controls. The level of psychological distress was not correlated with the degree of pulmonary function impairment. When symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were independently analyzed, the control group featured a 55% higher level of mild-moderate anxiety symptoms. Signs of psychological distress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and physical manifestations were significantly more frequent in female pwCFs compared to males, similarly to GP. CONCLUSION: Adult pwCFs seem to have equal, and in some domains, lower levels of psychological distress than GP controls. This might be sustained by lifelong experiences in coping with the demands of their chronic disease. These results may orient future psychological interventions.","Ciprandi, Riccardo; Bonati, Maurizio; Campi, Rita; Pescini, Rita; Castellani, Carlo",J. cyst. fibros,270,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook interviews with 44 healthcare professionals with a background in informatics from six hospitals internationally. Interviews were informed by a topic guide and were conducted via videoconferencing software. Thematic analysis was employed to develop a coding framework and identify emerging themes. RESULTS: Three themes and six sub-themes were identified. HITs were employed to manage time and resources during a surge in patient numbers through fast-tracked governance procedures, and the creation of real-time bed capacity tracking within electronic health records. Improving the integration of different hospital systems was identified as important across sites. The use of hard-stop alerts and order sets were perceived as being effective at helping to respond to potential medication shortages and selecting available drug treatments. Utilizing information from multiple data sources to develop alerts facilitated treatment. Finally, the upscaling/optimization of telehealth and remote working capabilities was used to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection within hospitals. DISCUSSION: A number of the HIT-related changes implemented at these sites were perceived to have facilitated more effective patient treatment and management of resources. Informaticians generally felt more valued by hospital management as a result. CONCLUSIONS: Improving integration between data systems, utilizing specialized alerts, and expanding telehealth represent strategies that hospitals should consider when using HIT for delivering hospital care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malden, Stephen; Heeney, Catherine; Bates, David W; Sheikh, Aziz",J. am. med. inform. assoc,270,1

The current study aims to report and discuss a rare case of breast cancer in the intermammary region. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old lady presented with intermammary swelling for three months. Ultrasound examination showed a hypoechoic micro lobulated mass with internal vascularity seated on the chest wall. There was pathological lymphnodes in the right axilla. Core needle biopsy suspected invasive ductal carcinoma of no specific type. The patient was referred to an oncology center receiving 21 cycles of radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. DISCUSSION: The most common site of the occurrence of breast cancer is the upper outer quadrant (found in one-third of patients), followed by the upper inner quadrant (9.4%)-both lower outer and inner quadrants (5.2%) and rarely in the central portion. Intermammary breast cancer is an infrequent finding. CONCLUSION: Although it is extremely rare, breast cancer could occur in the intermammary region. It has the same management strategy as breast cancer.","Salih, Abdulwahid M; Hammood, Zhair D; Pshtiwan, Lana R A; Kakamad, Fahmi H; Salih, Rawezh Q; Ali, Bakhan S",Int J Surg Case Rep,270,2

The present study aimed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the dental biofilm of symptomatic patients who tested positive in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NASO/ORO) samples. MATERIALS & METHODS: An observational clinical study of individuals with flu-like symptoms was conducted between July and September 2020. Dental biofilm (BIO) samples were collected and analysed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to determine the virus's presence. RESULTS: Seventy participants (40 ± 9.8 years of age, 71.4% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in NASO/ORO samples and were included in the study. Among them, 13 tested positive in BIO samples (18.6%; 95% CI: [9.5, 27.7]). The median and interquartile range of cycle quantification (Cq) for NASO/ORO and BIO samples were 15.9 [6.9] and 35.9 [4.0] (p = .001), respectively. BIO-positive participants showed a higher virus load in NASO/ORO samples (p = .012) than those testing negative (Cq = 20.4 [6.1]). CONCLUSIONS: Dental biofilms from symptomatic COVID-19 patients harbour SARS-CoV-2 RNA and might be a potential reservoir with an essential role in COVID-19 transmission.","Gomes, Sabrina Carvalho; Fachin, Sabrina; da Fonseca, Juliane Gonçalves; Angst, Patrícia Daniela Melchiors; Lamers, Marcelo Lazzaron; da Silva, Ilma Simoni Brum; Nunes, Luciana Neves",J Clin Periodontol,270,26

At last, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have risen high on the global policy agenda, but there are many disputed issues. First, what are they? Their name refers not to what they are but what they are not. Second, where do their boundaries lie? What diseases are included? Third, should we view their causes as mainly biomedical, behavioural, or social, or a combination? Our failure to resolve these issues has been invoked as a reason for our limited progress in developing and implementing effective remedies. In this scoping review, we ask ""What is known from the existing literature about how NCDs are framed in the global policy discourses?"" We answer it by reviewing the frames employed in policy and academic discourses. METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases for articles published since inception to 31 May 2019. We also reviewed websites of eight international organisations to identify global NCDs policies. We extracted data and synthesised findings to identify key thematic frames. RESULTS: We included 36 articles and nine policy documents on global NCDs policies. We identified five discursive domains that have been used and where there are differing perspectives. These are: ""Expanding the NCDs frame to include mental health and air pollution""; ""NCDs and their determinants""; ""A rights-based approach to NCDs""; ""Approaches to achieving policy coherence in NCDs globally""; and ""NCDs as part of Sustainable Socio-economic Development"". We further identified 12 frames within the five discursive domains. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identifies issues that remain unresolved and points to a need for alignment of perspectives among global health policy actors, as well as synergies with those working on mental health, maternal health, and child health. The current COVID-19 pandemic warrants greater consideration of its impact on global NCDs policies. Future global strategies for NCDs need to consider explicitly how NCDs are framed in a changing global health discourse and ensure adequate alignment with implementation and global health issues. There is a need for global strategies to recognise the pertinent role of actors in shaping policy discourses.","Tan, Melisa Mei Jin; Han, Emeline; Shrestha, Pami; Wu, Shishi; Shiraz, Farah; Koh, Gerald Choon-Huat; McKee, Martin; Legido-Quigley, Helena",BMC Health Serv Res,270,16

OBJECTIVE: To calculate the overall reduction in monthly migraine days and the proportion contextual effect (PCE) using meta-analysis. The PCE is the ratio between the reduction in Monthly Migraine Days in the placebo group and the reduction in Monthly Migraine Days in the CGRP-Ab group after 3 months of treatment. METHODS: Meta-analysis of randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials of anti-CGRP antibodies in people with episodic migraine (EM) or chronic migraine (CM) in persons aged 18 or over. Non-randomized trials and trials in persons under 18 years excluded. Search of National Clinical Trials Register 2000-2019, MEDLINE to September 2019, Hand search of major headache conference abstract books 2012-2019. Two investigators used standard proforma to reach consensus. Trial quality assessed using Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. PRISMA guidelines followed. RESULTS: 21 completed trials with 13367 participants (8075 EM, 5292 CM). Compared to placebo, pooled reduction in MMD was 1.50 days in 15 EM trials (95%CI 1.16, 1.84; I2 = 69%, Phetereogeneity < .001) and 2.24 days in 7 CM trials (95%CI 1.82, 2.65, I2 = 15%, Phetereogeneity = .320). In EM trials, pooled PCE was 0.66 (95%CI 0.59,0.75; I2 = 64%, Phetereogeneity = .001). In CM trials the PCE was .68 (95%CI 0.61, 0.75; I2 = 20%, Phetereogeneity = .280).

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. AIMS: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS. SOURCES: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. CONTENT: COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2.0-2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7-1.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1). A gastrointestinal route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, which has been assumed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cannot be ruled out and needs further investigation. IMPLICATIONS: There is still much more to know about COVID-19, especially as concerns mortality and its capacity to spread on a pandemic level. Nonetheless, all of the lessons we learned in the past from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best cultural weapons with which to face this new global threat.","Petrosillo, N; Viceconte, G; Ergonul, O; Ippolito, G; Petersen, E",Clin Microbiol Infect,270,1

Physical proximity to other workers and shared equipment can facilitate disease transmission in these settings (2-4). The disproportionate number of foreign-born workers employed in meat and poultry processing reflects structural, social, and economic inequities that likely contribute to an increased COVID-19 incidence in this population* (5). In May 2020, the Maryland Department of Health and CDC investigated factors that might affect person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons who worked at two poultry processing facilities. A survey administered to 359 workers identified differences in risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between workers born outside the United States and U.S.-born workers. Compared with U.S.-born workers, foreign-born workers had higher odds of working in fixed locations on the production floor (odds ratio [OR] for cutup and packaging jobs = 4.8), of having shared commutes (OR = 1.9), and of living with other poultry workers (OR = 6.0). They had lower odds of participating in social gatherings (OR for visits to family = 0.2; OR for visits to friends = 0.4), and they visited fewer businesses in the week before the survey than did their U.S.-born coworkers. Some workplace risk factors can be mitigated through engineering and administrative controls focused on the production floor, and this will be of particular benefit to the foreign-born workers concentrated in these areas. Employers and health departments can also partner with local organizations to disseminate culturally and linguistically tailored messages about risk reduction behaviors in community settings, including shared transportation§ and household members dwelling in close quarters.¶.","Rubenstein, Beth L; Campbell, Stefanie; Meyers, Alysha R; Crum, David A; Mitchell, Clifford S; Hutson, Jeré; Williams, D039; Ann, L; Senesie, Schabbethai S; Gilani, Zunera; Reynolds, Steven; Alba, Bianca; Tavitian, Stephanie; Billings, Kristian; Saintus, Lina; Martin, Stephen B; Mainzer, Hugh",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,270,23

Despite the current literature about the cardiac effects of COVID-19 in children, more information is required. We aimed to determine both cardiovascular and arrhythmia assessments via electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 70 children who were hospitalized with COVID-19 infections and 70 children as the normal control group through laboratory findings, electrocardiography (ECG), and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). RESULTS: We observed significantly increased levels of Tp-Te, Tp-Te/QT, and Tp-Te/QTc compared with the control group. Twenty-five of 70 (35.7%) patients had fragmented QRS(fQRS) without increased troponin levels. None of the patients had pathologic corrected QT(QTc) prolongation during the illness or its treatment. On TTE, 20 patients had mild mitral insufficiency, among whom only five had systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <55%). There was no significant difference between the patient and control groups, except for isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) in terms of mean systolic and diastolic function parameters.

Here, two well-preserved specimens of Champsosaurus (CMN 8920 and CMN 8919) are CT scanned to describe their neurosensory structures and infer sensory capability. The anterior portion of the braincase was poorly ossified and thus does not permit visualization of a complete endocast; however, impressions of the olfactory stalks indicate that they were elongate and likely facilitated good olfaction. The posterior portion of the braincase is ossified and morphologically similar to that of other extinct diapsids. The absence of an otic notch and an expansion of the pars inferior of the inner ear suggests Champsosaurus was limited to detecting low frequency sounds. Comparison of the shapes of semicircular canals with lepidosaurs and archosauromorphs demonstrates that the semicircular canals of Champsosaurus are most similar to those of aquatic reptiles, suggesting that Champsosaurus was well adapted for sensing movement in an aquatic environment. This analysis also demonstrates that birds, non-avian archosauromorphs, and lepidosaurs possess significantly different canal morphologies, and represents the first morphometric analysis of semicircular canals across Diapsida.","Dudgeon, Thomas W; Maddin, Hillary C; Evans, David C; Mallon, Jordan C",Sci Rep,270,1

OBJECTIVES: To assess the superiority of PEGylated G-CSF for CIN in breast cancer in terms of effectiveness and safety via a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed for eligible studies published from database inception to December 2019. All studies comparing PEGylated G-CSF and G-CSF for CIN of breast cancer were reviewed. After literature selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was conducted using Revman, version 5.2. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials were finally identified. The publication bias of these studies was acceptable. For the endpoint of effectiveness, analysis of the incidence/duration of grade &#8805; 3 neutropenia, the duration of grade 4 neutropenia, the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), and the time to absolute neutrophil count recovery showed no advantage of PEGylated G-CSF over G-CSF for CIN of breast cancer (P > 0.05), with the premise of a sufficient dose of G-CSF according to the guidelines. No significant differences in grade 4 adverse events were observed between the groups (P = 0.29), and PEGylated G-CSF did not increase the incidence of skeletal and/or muscle pain compared with G-CSF (P = 0.32). CONCLUSION: PEGylated G-CSF was as effective and safe as G-CSF to reduce CIN in breast cancer but did not show an obvious superiority. However, in clinical practice, PEGylated G-CSF has an obvious advantage in terms of convenience, which could improve patient's quality of life.","Li, Xiang; Zheng, Huan; Yu, Man-Cheng; Wang, Wei; Wu, Xin-Hong; Yang, Dong-Mei; Xu, Juan",Support. care cancer,270,20

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the Spring 2020 semester using self-reported student data from an end of course survey. METHODS: A 16 item instructor-designed survey of student's perceptions of critical thinking, preparation, availability of materials, practice, video recording skill demonstrations, self-reported levels of anxiety related to the virtual testing environment and type of skill assessment exam was provided to all first semester baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in the basic nursing skills course. RESULTS: Approximately half of the cohort (N = 33) voluntarily responded to the instructor designed survey. The greatest relationship was observed between 'adequate information for each version' of the test and 'adequate time to prepare' (rho (32) = 0.729 p = 0.000). Although 54.6% (n = 18) of the respondents believed performing the demonstration in the home environment caused them to 'think harder' about the tasks, 78.8% (n = 26) reported feeling less anxiety than while performing previous demonstrations in the lab. A Wilcoxon test examined the results of the anxiety for demonstration on campus and anxiety for demonstration at home and a significant difference was found (p = 0.000, 95% CI) indicating anxiety levels were significantly less when demonstrating in the home environment. A moderate positive correlation was identified between opportunity to repeat with less stress at home (rho (32) = 0.61, p = 0.000), while moderate negative correlations were found between opportunity to repeat and anxiety levels related to recording (rho (32) = -0.60, p = 0.000), opportunity to repeat and anxiety related to demonstration at home (rho (32) = -0.53, p = 0.002) and concern about recording and opportunity to repeat (rho (32) = -0.49, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Student success using remote assessment strategies during the Spring 2020 semester was similar to the success rate using traditional skill assessment methods in Fall 2019. Although the need for prompt feedback was identified as an area of improvement to promote deliberate practice, student video recording of skill proficiency was a viable solution for comprehensive remote assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic and campus closure. Although further study is recommended, findings have international implications for virtual teaching and learning in nursing education.","Palmer, Troy J; Chisholm, LeAnn J; Rolf, Carmen G; Morris, Christina R",Nurse Educ Pract,270,15

We simulate a scenario in which a lockdown is first imposed on a population and then partly lifted while long-range transmission is kept at a minimum. Simulated spreading patterns resemble contemporary distributions of Covid-19 across nations, regions, and provinces, providing some model validation. Results suggest that the proposed strategy may significantly flatten a second wave. We also find that post-lockdown flare-ups remain local longer, aiding geographical containment. Public policy may target long ties by heavily focusing medical testing and mobility tracking efforts on traffic and transport. This policy can be communicated to the general public as a simple and reasonable principle: Stay nearby or get checked.","Brethouwer, Jan-Tino; Rijt, Arnout van de; Lindelauf, Roy; Fokkink, Robbert",,270,6

IPA has been recently described in critically ill COVID-19 patients (termed as COVID-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, or CAPA) that are otherwise immunocompetent. In order to describe the characteristics of patients with CAPA, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary care center in Mexico City. We included all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit that had serum or bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan measurements. We used the criteria proposed by Koehler et al. to establish the diagnosis of CAPA. Main outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital mortality. Out of a total of 83 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, 16 (19.3%) met the criteria for CAPA. All patients diagnosed with CAPA required IMV whereas only 84% of the patients in the non-IPA group needed this intervention (P = 0.09). In the IPA group, 31% (n = 5) of the patients died, compared to 13% (n = 9) in the non-CAPA group (P = 0.08).

Based on previous studies of neuroinvasive human respiratory coronaviruses, it is proposed that after physical contact with the nasal mucosa, laryngopharynx, trachea, lower respiratory tract, alveoli epithelium, or gastrointestinal mucosa, SARS-CoV-2 can induce intrinsic and innate immune responses in the host involving increased cytokine release, tissue damage, and high neurosusceptibility to COVID-19, especially in the hypoxic conditions caused by lung injury. In some immune-compromised individuals, the virus may invade the brain through multiple routes, such as the vasculature and peripheral nerves.

Physical health monitoring is shared between primary care and secondary mental healthcare services, though there is debate whether mental health teams should provide more physical healthcare. The views of mental health clinicians and patients with mental illness towards physical healthcare provision are unclear. AIMS: To explore the attitudes of Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) clinicians and patients experiencing severe mental illness towards physical healthcare and its provision. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study in a CMHT setting. METHODS: Interviews were carried out with CMHT clinicians and patients with severe mental illness. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: There were 14 patients and 15 clinicians recruited. Patients varied in their awareness of the association between physical and mental health, but were engaged in physical health monitoring. Clinicians were aware of the importance of physical healthcare but reported barriers to provision, including lack of training, resource constraints and uncertainty in their role. There was no consensus in either group regarding how physical healthcare should be provided, with diverse attitudes expressed for why CMHTs should and shouldn't provide more physical healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing physical healthcare provision from mental health teams requires healthcare-related barriers be addressed, but it remains unclear whether CMHT clinicians or patients believe this to be a solution.","Butler, Joseph; de Cassan, Simone; Turner, Phil; Lennox, Belinda; Hayward, Gail; Glogowska, Margaret",BMC Fam Pract,270,16

The application of X-ray diffraction crystallography made available the three-dimensional structure of this protein target in complex with ligands, which paved the way for docking studies. OBJECTIVE: Our goal here is to review recent efforts in the application of docking simulations to identify inhibitors of the Mpro using the program AutoDock4. METHOD: We searched PubMed to identify studies that applied AutoDock4 for docking against this protein target. We used the structures available for Mpro to analyze intermolecular interactions and reviewed the methods used to search for inhibitors. RESULTS: The application of docking against the structures available for the Mpro found ligands with an estimated inhibition in the nanomolar range. Such computational approaches focused on the crystal structures revealed potential inhibitors of Mpro that might exhibit pharmacological activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, most of these studies lack the proper validation of the docking protocol. Also, they all ignored the potential use of machine learning to predict affinity. CONCLUSION: The combination of structural data with computational approaches opened the possibility to accelerate the search for drugs to treat COVID-19. Several studies used AutoDock4 to search for inhibitors of Mpro. Most of them did not employ a validated docking protocol, which lends support to critics of their computational methodology. Furthermore, one of these studies reported the binding of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to Mpro. This study ignores the scientific evidence against the use of these antimalarial drugs to treat COVID-19.","de Azevedo Junior, Walter Filgueira; Bitencourt-Ferreira, Gabriela; Godoy, Joana Retzke; Adriano, Hilda Mayela Aran; Dos Santos Bezerra, Wallyson André; Dos Santos Soares, Alexandra Martins",Curr. med. chem,270,20

There are currently no FDA-approved antiviral drugs for COVID-19 and there is an urgent need to develop treatment strategies that can effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous approaches have been researched so far, with one of them being the emerging exosome-based therapies. Exosomes are nano-sized, lipid bilayer-enclosed structures, share structural similarities with viruses secreted from all types of cells, including those lining the respiratory tract. Importantly, the interplay between exosomes and viruses could be potentially exploited for antiviral drug and vaccine development. Exosomes are produced by virus-infected cells and play crucial roles in mediating communication between infected and uninfected cells. SARS-CoV-2 modulates the production and composition of exosomes, and can exploit exosome formation, secretion, and release pathways to promote infection, transmission, and intercellular spread. Exosomes have been exploited for therapeutic benefits in patients afflicted with various diseases including COVID-19. Furthermore, the administration of exosomes loaded with immunomodulatory cargo in combination with antiviral drugs represents a novel intervention for the treatment of diseases such as COVID-19. In particular, exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are used as cell-free therapeutic agents. Mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes reduces the cytokine storm and reverse the inhibition of host anti-viral defenses associated with COVID-19 and also enhances mitochondrial function repair lung injuries. We discuss the role of exosomes in relation to transmission, infection, diagnosis, treatment, therapeutics, drug delivery, and vaccines, and present some future perspectives regarding their use for combating COVID-19.","Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi; Kang, Min Hee; Kim, Jin-Hoi",Front Immunol,270,0

Particularly, the tRNA pool has been adapted to the host genes. If the virus intends to translate its own RNA, then it has to compete with the abundant host mRNAs for the tRNA molecules. Translation initiation is the rate-limiting step during protein synthesis. The tRNAs carrying the initiation Methionine (iMet) recognize the start codon termed initiation ATG (iATG). Other normal Met-carrying tRNAs recognize the internal ATGs. The tAI of virus genes is significantly lower than the tAI of human genes. This disadvantage in translation elongation of viral RNAs must be compensated by more efficient initiation rates. In the human genome, the abundance of iMet-tRNAs to Met-tRNAs is five times higher than the iATG to ATG ratio. However, when SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells, the iMet has an 8.5-time enrichment to iATG. We collected 58 virus species and found that the enrichment of iMet is higher in all viruses compared to human. Our study indicates that the genome sequences of viruses like SARS-CoV-2 have the advantage of competing for the iMet-tRNAs with host mRNAs. The capture of iMet-tRNAs allows the fast translation initiation and the reproduction of virus itself, which compensates the lower tAI of viral genes. This might explain why the virus could rapidly translate its own RNA and reproduce itself from the sea of host mRNAs. Meanwhile, our study reminds the researchers not to ignore the mutations related to ATGs.","Wang, Yan; Gai, Yanhong; Li, Yuefan; Li, Chunxiao; Li, Ziliang; Wang, Xuekun",Mol. genet. genomics,270,24

Further, we consider augmenting the proposed approach with clinical covariates (from electronic health records) and publicly available data (the ISIC dataset). Comprehensive experiments validated on an independent test dataset demonstrate that i) the proposed approach outperforms alternative model architectures; ii) the model based on images outperforms a pure clinical model by a large margin, and the combination of images and clinical data does not significantly improves over the image-only model; and iii) the proposed framework offers comparable performance in terms of malignancy classification relative to three board certified dermatologists with different levels of experience.","Xia, Meng; Kheterpal, Meenal K.; Wong, Samantha C.; Park, Christine; Ratliff, William; Carin, Lawrence; Henao, Ricardo",,270,18

As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a 'global view' of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance. &copy;2021 Tsinghua University Press. © 2021 Tsinghua University Press.

Using the Health Belief Model (HBM) as a framework, this study used a web-based survey to examine how perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity and perceived efficacy of recommended health behaviors varied by age group and were related to the adoption of health behaviors. Proportional odds logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between age group and perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, impact, and health behavior efficacy and adoption. Structural equation modeling based on HBM constructs examined the relationships between health beliefs and behaviors. Data from 820 participants (Ontario, Canada) were analyzed (age: 42.7, 16.2 years;79% women). Middle-aged and older adults reported greater concerns about the personal risk of hospitalization and mortality, economic impact, and social impact of COVID-19 than young adults. Middle-aged adults also reported greatest concern for other age groups. Adoption and perceived efficacy of health behaviors was similar across age groups with few exceptions. Both middle-aged and older-adults were more likely to perceive their own and each other's age groups as responding adequately to COVID-19 compared to young adults. Structural equation modeling indicated perceived benefits of health behaviors were the primary driver of behavior uptake, with socioeconomic factors and perceived severity and susceptibility indirectly associated with uptake through their influence on perceived benefits. Overall, these results suggest adoption of health behaviors is very high with few differences between age groups, despite differences in perceived impact of COVID-19. Public health communications should focus on the benefits of health behaviors to drive adoption.","Bechard, L. E.; Bergelt, M.; Neudorf, B.; DeSouza, T. C.; Middleton, L.

Through semi-structured interviews, making an in-depth comparative study of three differently situated cases (Muslim women), this study argues that the abnormal situation that has ensued from the pandemic has reinforced the vulnerability of women's nascent negotiated identity by landing them in a space where they are supposed by the normative structures to step back to carrying out their traditional responsibilities as 'good' wife and mother during the crisis. It has found that the pandemic has similarity in its impacts for the women in their familial lives, despite their being variously situated and resistive, due to the general religio-culturally defined patriarchal social behaviour of the place (Pakistan) toward women and lack of action on the part of the state for implementing its laws of women's empowerment.","Safdar, Muhammad; Yasmin, Musarat","Gender, work and organization",270,16

The model works with (i) infected agents categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic and (ii) the places of contagion specified in a detailed way. The infection transmission is related to three factors: the characteristics of both the infected person and the susceptible one, plus those of the space in which contact occurs. The model includes the structural data of Piedmont, an Italian region, but we can easily calibrate it for other areas. The micro-based structure of the model allows factual, counterfactual, and conditional simulations to investigate both the spontaneous or controlled development of the epidemic. The model is generative of complex epidemic dynamics emerging from the consequences of agents' actions and interactions, with high variability in outcomes and stunning realistic reproduction of the successive contagion waves in the reference region. There is also an inverse generative side of the model, coming from the idea of using genetic algorithms to construct a meta-agent to optimize the vaccine distribution. This agent takes into account groups' characteristics -- by age, fragility, work conditions -- to minimize the number of symptomatic people.","Pescarmona, Gianpiero; Terna, Pietro; Acquadro, Alberto; Pescarmona, Paolo; Russo, Giuseppe; Sulis, Emilio; Terna, Stefano",,270,24

Rwanda has made notable efforts to fight the pandemic. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country's economy are numerous and the refugees residing in Rwanda are not spared these effects. As of December 2020, 164,000 people were granted refugee status in Rwanda according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The majority were from neighbouring countries in the Great Lakes regions, including DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Burundi. The impact the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy has led to a decline in donations to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which in turn has significantly reduced the food rations of refugees. Such paucity will no doubt cause unprecedented impacts on the people residing in refugee camps, who completely depend on humanitarian aid to meet their basic food requirements. This lack of access to adequate and affordable food will expose refugees to extreme hunger and starvation, putting their lives in danger by triggering forced returns, infections, social conflicts and thus higher morbidity and mortality.Furthermore, such stressful environments would no doubt put the mental health of these already vulnerable communities at risk. It is unsurprising that refugees are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to local population, including higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This is an issue as they are also less likely to receive support than the general population. Refugees in Rwanda are under the responsibility of UNHCR and WFP, who should ensure adequate food assistance is provided to refugees and therefore ameliorate the risks to health that result from food shortages, safeguarding these vulnerable communities.","Manirambona, Emery; Uwizeyimana, Theogene; Uwiringiyimana, Emmanuel; Reddy, Henna",Int J Equity Health,270,24

We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by Î³S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of Î³S results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of Î³S does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking.","Bartolomé, Alberto; Liang, Jiani; Wang, Pengfei; Ho, David D; Pajvani, Utpal B",Sci Rep,270,17

All five initial cases were associated with school settings. Through early June, Mesa County experienced a marked increase in the proportion of Delta variant cases identified through sequencing: the 7-day proportion of sequenced specimens identified as B.1.617.2 in Mesa County more than doubled, from 43% for the week ending May 1 to 88% for the week ending June 5. As of June 6, more than one half (51%) of sequenced B.1.617.2 specimens in Colorado were from Mesa County. CDPHE assessed data from surveillance, vaccination, laboratory, and hospital sources to describe the preliminary epidemiology of the Delta variant and calculate crude vaccine effectiveness (VE). Vaccination coverage in early May in Mesa County was lower (36% of eligible residents fully vaccinated) than that in the rest of the state (44%). Compared with that in all other Colorado counties, incidence, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and COVID-19 case fatality ratios were significantly higher in Mesa County during the analysis period, April 27-June 6, 2021. In addition, during the same time period, the proportion of COVID-19 cases in persons who were fully vaccinated (vaccine breakthrough cases) was significantly higher in Mesa County compared with that in all other Colorado counties. Estimated crude VE against reported symptomatic infection for a 2-week period ending June 5 was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 71%-84%) for Mesa County and 89% (95% CI = 88%-91%) for other Colorado counties.

Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2000 coronaviruses and computed >100 000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genomic regions display different degrees of conservation. SARS-CoV-2 domain encompassing nucleotides 22 500–23 000 is conserved both at the sequence and structural level. The regions upstream and downstream, however, vary significantly. This part of the viral sequence codes for the Spike S protein that interacts with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, variability of Spike S is connected to different levels of viral entry in human cells within the population. Our predictions indicate that the 5′ end of SARS-CoV-2 is highly structured and interacts with several human proteins. The binding proteins are involved in viral RNA processing, include double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases and have strong propensity to form stress granules and phase-separated assemblies. We propose that these proteins, also implicated in viral infections such as HIV, are selectively recruited by SARS-CoV-2 genome to alter transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of host cells and to promote viral replication.","Vandelli, Andrea; Monti, Michele; Milanetti, Edoardo; Armaos, Alexandros; Rupert, Jakob; Zacco, Elsa; Bechara, Elias; Delli Ponti, Riccardo; Tartaglia, Gian Gaetano",Nucleic Acids Res,270,15

METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis of the responses from Brazilian vascular surgeons to the cross-sectional anonymous Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons disseminated 14–24 April 2020. Survey dissemination in Brazil occurred mainly via the Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery (SBACV) and social media. The survey evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons’ lives by assessing COVID-19-related stressors, anxiety using theGeneral Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) inventory. RESULTS: A total of 452 responses were recorded from Brazil, with 335 (74%) respondents completing the entire survey. The majority of respondents were males (N = 301, 67%) and practiced in an urban hospitals. The majority of respondents considered themselves at high risk to be infected with COVID-19 (N = 251, 55.8%), and just over half the respondents noted that they had adequate PPE at their primary hospital (N = 171, 54%). One hundred and nine (35%) surgeons confirmed that their hospitals followed professional surgical society guidelines for prioritizing surgeries during the pandemic. At the time of the survey, only 33 (10%) surgeons stated they have pre-operative testing of patients for COVID-19 available at their hospital. Academic vascular surgeons reported being redeployed more often to help with other non-vascular duties compared to community-based or solo practitioners (43% vs. 30% vs. 21% respectively, P = .01). Severe anxiety due to pandemic-related financial concerns was similar in those surgeons practicing solo compared to those in community- or academic-based/group practice (46% vs. 38% vs. 22%; P = .54). The respondents reported their anxiety levels as mild based on the stressors investigated instead of moderate-severe (54% vs. 46%; P = .04). Social media was utilized heavily during the pandemic, with video gatherings being the most commonly used tool (76%). Self-distraction (60%) and situational acceptance (81%) were the most frequently reported coping mechanisms used among Brazilian vascular surgeons. CONCLUSION: The COVID pandemic has greatly affected healthcare providers around the world. At the time of this survey, Brazilian vascular surgeons are reporting low anxiety levels during this time and are using mostly active coping mechanisms.","Malgor, Rafael D; Sobreira, Marcone Lima; Mouawad, Nicolas J; Johnson, Adam P; Wohlauer, Max V; Coogan, Sheila M; Cuff, Robert F; Coleman, Dawn M; Sheahan, Malachi G; Woo, Karen; Shalhub, Sherene",Vascular,270,20

Most studies so far focused on visuo-tactile strategies to empower the embodiment processes. However, novel approaches could emerge from self-regulation techniques able to change the psychophysiological conditions of an individual. Accordingly, this pilot study investigates the effects of a self-regulated breathing exercise on the processes of body ownership underlying the embodiment of a virtual right hand within a Spatially Augmented Respiratory Biofeedback (SARB) setting. This investigation also aims at evaluating the feasibility of the breathing exercise enabled by a low-cost SARB implementation designed for upcoming remote studies (a need emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic). Twenty-two subjects without impairments, and two transradial prosthesis users for a preparatory test, were asked (in each condition of a within-group design) to maintain a normal (about 14 breaths/min) or slow (about 6 breaths/min) respiratory rate to keep a static virtual right hand “visible” on a screen. Meanwhile, a computer-generated sphere moved from left to right toward the virtual hand during each trial (1 min) of 16. If the participant's breathing rate was within the target (slow or normal) range, a visuo-tactile event was triggered by the sphere passing under the virtual hand (the subjects observed it shaking while they perceived a vibratory feedback generated by a smartphone). Our results—mainly based on questionnaire scores and proprioceptive drift—highlight that the slow breathing condition induced higher embodiment than the normal one. This preliminary study reveals the feasibility and potential of a novel psychophysiological training strategy to enhance the embodiment of artificial limbs. Future studies are needed to further investigate mechanisms, efficacy and generalizability of the SARB techniques in training a bionic limb embodiment.","Barresi, Giacinto; Marinelli, Andrea; Caserta, Giulia; de Zambotti, Massimiliano; Tessadori, Jacopo; Angioletti, Laura; Boccardo, Nicolò; Freddolini, Marco; Mazzanti, Dario; Deshpande, Nikhil; Frigo, Carlo Albino; Balconi, Michela; Gruppioni, Emanuele; Laffranchi, Matteo; De Michieli, Lorenzo",Front Neurorobot,270,9

We now show a 71% (95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) mortality benefit in 83 patients with moderate-severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with few drug-induced adverse events, including a large elderly cohort (median age, 81 years). An additional 48 cases with mild-moderate pneumonia recovered uneventfully. Using organotypic 3D cultures of primary human liver cells, we demonstrate that interferon-α2 increases ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in parenchymal cells by greater than fivefold. RNA-seq reveals gene response signatures associated with platelet activation, fully inhibited by baricitinib. Using viral load quantifications and superresolution microscopy, we found that baricitinib exerts activity rapidly through the inhibition of host proteins (numb-associated kinases), uniquely among antivirals. This reveals mechanistic actions of a Janus kinase-1/2 inhibitor targeting viral entry, replication, and the cytokine storm and is associated with beneficial outcomes including in severely ill elderly patients, data that incentivize further randomized controlled trials.","Stebbing, Justin; Sánchez Nievas, Ginés; Falcone, Marco; Youhanna, Sonia; Richardson, Peter; Ottaviani, Silvia; Shen, Joanne X.; Sommerauer, Christian; Tiseo, Giusy; Ghiadoni, Lorenzo; Virdis, Agostino; Monzani, Fabio; Rizos, Luis Romero; Forfori, Francesco; Avendaño Céspedes, Almudena; De Marco, Salvatore; Carrozzi, Laura; Lena, Fabio; Sánchez-Jurado, Pedro Manuel; Lacerenza, Leonardo Gianluca; Cesira, Nencioni; Caldevilla Bernardo, David; Perrella, Antonio; Niccoli, Laura; Méndez, Lourdes Sáez; Matarrese, Daniela; Goletti, Delia; Tan, Yee-Joo; Monteil, Vanessa; Dranitsaris, George; Cantini, Fabrizio; Farcomeni, Alessio; Dutta, Shuchismita; Burley, Stephen K.; Zhang, Haibo; Pistello, Mauro; Li, William; Romero, Marta Mas; Andrés Pretel, Fernando; Simón-Talero, Rafaela Sánchez; García-Molina, Rafael; Kutter, Claudia; Felce, James H.; Nizami, Zehra F.; Miklosi, Andras G.; Penninger, Josef M.; Menichetti, Francesco; Mirazimi, Ali; Abizanda, Pedro; Lauschke, Volker M.",Sci Adv,270,6

SETTINGMain public sector tertiary hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia. PARTICIPANTSAll 131 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the main public tertiary hospital in Somalia between 30 March and 12 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESWe extracted demographic and clinical data from hospital records of all 131 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital until their death or recovery. We used Kaplan-Meier statistics to estimate survival probabilities and the log-rank test to assess significant differences in survival between groups. We used the Cox proportional hazard model to estimate likelihood of death and assess the effect of risk factors on survival. RESULTSOf the 131 patients, 52 (40%) died in the hospital and 79 (60%) survived to discharge. The factors independently associated with increased risk of in-hospital death were: age [â¥] 60 years - survival probability on day 21 in patients < 60 years was 0.789 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.658-0.874) compared with 0.339 (95% CI: 0.205-0.478) in patients [â¥] 60 years; cardiovascular disease (survival probability 0.478 (95% CI: 0.332-0.610) in patients with cardiovascular disease compared with 0.719 (95% CI: 0.601-0.807) in patients without cardiovascular disease); and non-invasive ventilation on admission - patients who were not ventilated were significantly more likely to survive than those who were (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONOur study, which includes the largest cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to a single hospital in a sub-Saharan African country, confirms that underlying conditions and age are associated with increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. Our results show the advantage of medical oxygen over non-invasive ventilation in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms.","Ali, Mohamed M; Malik, Mamunur Rahman; Ahmed, Abdulrazaq Yusuf; Bashir, Ahmed Mohamed; Mohamed, Abdulmunim; Abdi, Abdulkadir; Obtel, Majdouline",,270,16

Alcohol misuse varies across the US and is related to poorer health and comorbidities that likely affect the severity of COVID-19 infection. High levels of pre-pandemic alcohol misuse in some counties may have set the stage for worse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, this relationship may depend on how rural a county is, as access to healthcare in rural communities has lagged behind more urban areas. The objective of this study was to test for associations between county-level COVID-19 mortality, pre-pandemic county-level excessive drinking, and county rurality. METHOD: We used national COVID-19 data from the New York Times to calculate county-level case fatality rates (n = 3,039 counties and county equivalents; October 1 –December 31, 2020) and other external county-level data sources for indicators of rurality and health. We used beta regression to model case fatality rates, adjusted for several county-level population characteristics. We included a multilevel component to our model and defined state as a random intercept. Our focal predictor was a single variable representing nine possible combinations of low/mid/high alcohol misuse and low/mid/high rurality. RESULTS: The median county-level COVID-19 case fatality rate was 1.57%. Compared to counties with low alcohol misuse and low rurality (referent), counties with high levels of alcohol and mid (β = -0.17, p = 0.008) or high levels of rurality (β = -0.24, p<0.001) demonstrated significantly lower case fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the intersecting roles of county-level alcohol consumption, rurality, and COVID-19 mortality.","Pro, George; Gilbert, Paul A.; Baldwin, Julie A.; Brown, Clare C.; Young, Sean; Zaller, Nickolas",PLoS One,270,16

However, gender differences in the training adaptation regarding attentional capacities have not been elucidated clearly in the current literature. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an 8-week Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) 11(+) for Kids training program on attentional performance in schoolboys and girls. Based on a quasi-experimental design, fifty-two children registered in year five of elementary school were assigned into the following groups: training boys (n = 13), training girls (n = 13), control boys (n = 13), and control girls (n = 13). The training groups undertook an 8-week FIFA 11(+) Kids intervention with a training frequency of five times per week, whereas the control groups were deprived of any exercise during the study period. All the participants maintained their regular physical activity and weekly physical education (PE) lessons (two 50-min lessons per week of school curriculum) during the training period. The Chinese version of the Attention Scale for Elementary School Children (ASESC) test was used for attentional assessment at the baseline and one week after the interventional period. The Kruskal–Wallis H test was used for between-group comparison, whereas the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for within-group comparison. Significant differences in total scale, focused attention, selective attention, and alternating attention were found in group comparisons (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the training children significantly increased their values in relation to total scale, focused attention, sustained attention, and selective attention (p < 0.05). Only training girls significantly improved their divided attention after the training period (p < 0.001, MD = −0.77, ES = −0.12). In conclusion, the FIFA 11(+) for Kids is an effective school-based exercise intervention for attentional improvement in school children. The schoolgirls demonstrated a positive outcome regarding divided attention after the interventional period.","Chen, Chia-Hui; Rekik, Ghazi; Belkhir, Yosra; Huang, Ya-Ling; Chen, Yung-Sheng",Children (Basel),270,16

Repurposed anti-virals such as remdesivir and human anti-inflammatories such as barcitinib have received emergency approval but their overall benefits remain unclear. Vaccines are the most promising prospect for COVID-19, but will need to be redeveloped for any future coronavirus outbreak. Protecting against future outbreaks requires the identification of targets that are conserved between coronavirus strains and amenable to drug discovery. Two such targets are the main protease (M(pro)) and the papain-like protease (PL(pro)) which are essential for the coronavirus replication cycle. We describe the discovery of two non-antiviral therapeutic agents, the caspase-1 inhibitor SDZ 224015 and Tarloxotinib that target M(pro) and PL(pro), respectively. These were identified through extensive experimental screens of the drug repurposing ReFRAME library of 12,000 therapeutic agents. The caspase-1 inhibitor SDZ 224015, was found to be a potent irreversible inhibitor of M(pro) (IC(50) 30 nM) while Tarloxotinib, a clinical stage epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, is a sub micromolar inhibitor of PL(pro) (IC(50) 300 nM, K(i) 200 nM) and is the first reported PL(pro) inhibitor with drug-like properties.

Anosmia was her isolated symptom of COVID-19. RESULTS: The patient was diagnosed with left abducens nerve palsy. Aetiology was presumed to be post-viral as the patient was not diabetic and had no pre-existing microvascular risk factors. Diplopia resolved within 3.5 weeks.

This means of monitoring for outbreaks has been used at municipal wastewater treatment centers to analyze COVID-19 trends in entire communities, as well as by universities and other community living environments to monitor COVID-19 spread in buildings. Sample concentration is crucial, especially when viral abundance in raw wastewater is below the threshold of detection by RT-qPCR analysis. We evaluated the performance of a rapid ultrafiltration-based virus concentration method using InnovaPrep Concentrating Pipette (CP) Select and compared this to the established electronegative membrane filtration (EMF) method. We evaluated sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 quantification, surrogate virus recovery rate, and sample processing time. Results suggest that the CP Select concentrator is more efficient at concentrating SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater compared to the EMF method. About 25% of samples that tested negative when concentrated with the EMF method produced a positive signal with the CP Select protocol. Increased recovery of the surrogate virus control using the CP Select confirms this observation. We optimized the CP Select protocol by adding AVL lysis buffer and sonication, to increase the recovery of virus. Sonication increased Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) recovery by 19%, which seems to compensate for viral loss during centrifugation. Filtration time decreases by approximately 30% when using the CP Select protocol, making this an optimal choice for building surveillance applications where quick turnaround time is necessary.","Juel, Md Ariful Islam; Stark, Nicholas; Nicolosi, Bridgette; Lontai, Jordan; Lambirth, Kevin; Schlueter, Jessica; Gibas, Cynthia; Munir, Mariya",Sci Total Environ,270,16

An Implementation-Mapping Approach,17.275223,12.598464,2021-02-11,"Over the past years, Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, has confronted environmental problems due to uncontrolled generation of municipal solid waste (MSW). While the integrated solid waste management (ISWM) represents a critical strategy for Indonesia to control its production, it is also recognized that economic approaches also need to be promoted to address the waste problem concertedly. In this case study, empirical approaches are developed to understand how a volume-based waste fee could be incorporated into MSW collection services and how to apply a zero-waste approach in Indonesia by adapting resource recovery initiatives, adapted from Germany’s mature experiences in integrating the CE paradigm into the latter’s MSWM practices. Currently, Sukunan village (Yogyakarta, Indonesia) promotes waste reduction at sources in the framework of community-based solid waste management (CBSWM) by mobilizing the local community for waste separation (organic and non-organic) and waste recycling. As a result, about 0.2 million Mt of CO(2-eq) emissions was avoided annually from local landfills. The economic benefits of recycling activities by the village’s community also resulted in 30% reduction of the waste generated. This CBSWM scheme not only saves the government budget on waste collection, transport and disposal, but also extends the lifetime of local landfills as the final disposal sites. By integrating the CE paradigm into its MSWM practices through the implementation of economic instruments and adherence to the rule of law in the same way as Germany does, Indonesia could make positive changes to its environmental policy and regulation of MSW. A sound MSWM in Indonesia could play important roles in promoting the effectiveness of urban development with resource recovery approaches to facilitate its transition towards a CE nationwide in the long-term.","Kurniawan, Tonni Agustiono; Avtar, Ram; Singh, Deepak; Xue, Wenchao; Dzarfan Othman, Mohd Hafiz; Hwang, Goh Hui; Iswanto, Iswanto; Albadarin, Ahmad B.; Kern, Axel Olaf",J Clean Prod,270,26

The large dataset available online for Covid-19 (COVIDx) was used in this research. The dataset consists of 2,128 x-ray images of Covid-19 cases, 8,066 normal cases, and 5,575 cases of pneumonia. A hybrid algorithm was applied to improve image quality before conducting the neural network training process. This algorithm consisted of combining two different noise reduction filters in the images, followed by a contrast enhancement algorithm. In this paper, for Covid-19 detection, a novel convolution neural network (CNN) architecture, KL-MOB (Covid-19 detection network based on MobileNet structure), was proposed. KL-MOB performance was boosted by adding the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence loss function at the end when trained from scratch. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss function was adopted as content-based image retrieval and fine-grained classification to improve the quality of image representation. This paper yielded impressive results, overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 98.7%, 98.32%, 98.82%, and 98.37%, respectively. The promising results in this research may enable other researchers to develop modern and innovative methods to aid specialists. The tremendous potential of the method proposed in this research can also be utilized to detect Covid-19 quickly and safely in patients throughout the world.","Taresh, M. M.; Zhu, N. b.; Hameed, A.

A return to pre‐pandemic “normalcy” depends on the successful delivery of the vaccine to a majority (~70%) so as to develop herd immunity critical to arrest the community spread of infection. Vaccination against COVID‐19 is particularly important for dentistry as the dental team works in an environment replete with aerosol‐generating procedures (AGP) that facilitate virus spread. Hence, a COVID‐19 vaccine is likely to be an obligatory requirement for the dental practice, and the latest addition to the extensive list of vaccines required for dental professionals for the safe delivery of dental care. Here, we review the currently available major candidate vaccines against SARS‐CoV‐2 and their benefits and risks. These include the vaccines developed on next‐generation platforms (mRNA, DNA, and viral vector vaccines), and the classic platforms (the live‐attenuated virus, and the protein subunit vaccines) The review concludes with a summary of impending issues and challenges facing the provision of COVID‐19 vaccines for all stakeholders in dentistry.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Seneviratne, Chaminda Jayampath; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia",Oral Dis,270,1

It has been shown that collecting nasopharyngeal samples, as the most commonly prefered method to perform RT-PCR, has disadvantages like causing discomfort and bleeding in patients. Sample collecting procedure also renders healthcare professionals by exposing them to the risk of transmission of the virus related to the direct contact with patients. These disadvantages make this procedure undesirable for the researchers and forces them to search for an alternative technique. At this point, saliva appears as an opportunity, regarding its high viral load. On the other hand, this high viral load poses a threat, especially for professions such as dental practitioners, with too much aerosol exposure. Since dentistry is a branch of health that constantly needs direct operations, it is necessary to be protected from the virus as much as possible while caring for the patient. A literature review was done using electronic databases “PubMed,” “Google Scholar,” and “Cochrane Database,” on January 2021. Studies have proposed many different preventive measures in this regard. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to draw attention to the saliva by bringing together the recent research and also to provide information and a perspective to dental clinicians about both prevention and a potential diagnostic technique.","Sadikoglu, Ismail Serhat; Caymaz, Mehmet Gagari",Pak J Med Sci,270,32

Hence, we investigated the feasibility of telesimulation for neonatal resuscitation training, assessed participants’ attitudes towards telesimulation as well as its effect on neonatal resuscitation knowledge, and compared results between medical students and neonatal nurses. Methods: For this prospective observational pilot study, medical students and neonatal nursing staff were recruited on a voluntary basis. Pre- and post-training knowledge was assessed using a 20-question questionnaire. Following the educational intervention, participants further answered a six-item questionnaire on their perception of telesimulation. For the telesimulation session, participants received a simulation package including a low-fidelity mannequin and medical equipment. The one-hour telesimulation session was delivered by an experienced instructor and broadcasted via Cisco Webex for groups of 2–3 participants, covering all elements of the neonatal resuscitation algorithm and including deliberate technical skills practice. Results: Nine medical students and nine neonatal nurses participated in a total of seven telesimulation sessions. In general, participants enjoyed the telesimulation session, acknowledged a positive learning effect and found telesimulation suitable for neonatal resuscitation training, but were critical of potential technical issues, training logistics, and the quality of supervision and feedback. Neonatal resuscitation knowledge scores increased significantly after the educational intervention both for medical students and nurses. Conclusions: Telesimulation is feasible for neonatal resuscitation training and associated with significant improvements in knowledge of current resuscitation guidelines, without differences between medical students and neonatal nurses.","Mileder, Lukas P.; Bereiter, Michael; Wegscheider, Thomas",Medical education online,270,26

Various measures and policies such as lockdown and social-distancing are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses on the country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at different LGAs in NSW in 5 months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia’s JobKeeper program, lockdown, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people’s overall sentiment, and they affected people’s overall sentiment differently at different stages.","Zhou, Jianlong; Yang, Shuiqiao; Xiao, Chun; Chen, Fang",SN Comput Sci,270,20

The clinical characteristics, underlying stroke mechanism, and outcomes in this particular subset of patients are especially salient as therapeutic anticoagulation becomes increasingly common in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hemorrhagic stroke (both non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage and spontaneous non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage) who were hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, within a major healthcare system in New York, during the coronavirus pandemic. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke on admission and who developed hemorrhage during hospitalization were both included. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 to those without COVID-19 admitted to our hospital system between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020 (contemporary controls), and March 1, 2019, and May 15, 2019 (historical controls). Demographic variables and clinical characteristics between the individual groups were compared using Fischer’s exact test for categorical variables and nonparametric test for continuous variables. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 4071 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified 19 (0.5%) with hemorrhagic stroke. Of all COVID-19 with hemorrhagic stroke, only three had isolated non-aneurysmal SAH with no associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Among hemorrhagic stroke in patients with COVID-19, coagulopathy was the most common etiology (73.7%); empiric anticoagulation was started in 89.5% of these patients versus 4.2% in contemporary controls (p ≤ .001) and 10.0% in historical controls (p ≤ .001). Compared to contemporary and historical controls, patients with COVID-19 had higher initial NIHSS scores, INR, PTT, and fibrinogen levels. Patients with COVID-19 also had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (84.6% vs. 4.6%, p ≤ 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with strictly subarachnoid hemorrhage yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: We observed an overall low rate of imaging-confirmed hemorrhagic stroke among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most hemorrhages in patients with COVID-19 infection occurred in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation and were associated with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.","Kvernland, Alexandra; Kumar, Arooshi; Yaghi, Shadi; Raz, Eytan; Frontera, Jennifer; Lewis, Ariane; Czeisler, Barry; Kahn, D.

Given the novelty of this disease, the medical community is seeking new evidence and clinical experiences on the management of these patients. CASE PRESENTATION: In this article, we describe the case of a 73-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with diffuse prothrombotic syndrome, both in the arterial and venous districts, following the first dose administration of ChAdOx1 CoV-19 vaccine. The main thrombotic sites included the brain, with both a cortical ischemic lesion and thromboses of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses and the lower limbs, with deep venous thrombosis accompanied by subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolism. The deep venous thrombosis progressively evolved into acute limb ischemia, requiring surgical intervention with thromboendoarterectomy. Anticoagulation was maintained throughout the whole hospitalization period and continued in the outpatient setting using vitamin K antagonists for a recommended period of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This case describes the management of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia in a complicated clinical scenario, including multisite arterial and venous thromboses. Given the complexity of the patient presentation, this case may implement the comprehension of the mechanisms and clinical features of this disease; it also provides a picture of the challenges related to the management, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach.","Ceschia, Nicole; Scheggi, Valentina; Gori, Anna Maria; Rogolino, Angela Antonietta; Cesari, Francesca; Giusti, Betti; Cipollini, Franco; Marchionni, Niccolò; Alterini, Brunetto; Marcucci, Rossella",J Med Case Rep,270,17

We hypothesized that such measures could reduce the burden of respiratory viruses (RVs) transmitting via the same routes. PATIENTS AND METHODS An interrupted time-series analysis of RV surveillance data in Alberta, Canada from May 2017 – July 2020 was conducted. The burden of influenza and NIRVs before and after intervention initiation at week 11, 2020 was compared. The analysis was adjusted for seasonality, over-dispersion, and autocorrelation. RESULTS During the study period, an average of 708 and 4056 weekly respiratory multiplex molecular panels were conducted pre-/post-intervention respectively. We found significant reductions in test positivity rates in the post-intervention period for influenza (-94.3%; 95% CI -93.8 to 97.4%, p<0.001) and all NIRVs (-76.5%; 95% CI -77.3 to -75.8%, p<0.001) in the crude model, and -86.2% (95% CI -91.5 to -77.4%, p<0.001) and -75% (95% CI -79.7 to -69.3%, p<0.001) respectively, in the adjusted models. Sub-analyses for individual viruses demonstrated significant decreases in respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and parainfluenza. For non-SARS-CoV-2 human coronaviruses, the decline was not statistically significant after adjustment (-22.3%; 95% CI -49.3 to +19%, p=0.246). CONCLUSION The implementation of COVID-19 PH measures likely resulted in reduced transmission of common RVs. While drastic lockdowns are unlikely to be required given widespread COVID-19 vaccination, targeted implementation of such measures can lower RV disease burden. Studies to evaluate relative contributions of individual interventions are warranted.","Doroshenko, Alexander; Lee, Nelson; MacDonald, Clayton; Zelyas, Nathan; Asadi, Leyla; Kanji, Jamil N.",Mayo Clin Proc,270,1

In the present work, from July to December 2020, the number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Marseille’s wastewater was correlated with the number of new positive cases diagnosed in our Institute of Infectious Disease, which tested about 20% of the city’s population. Number of positive cases and number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater were significantly correlated (p = 0.013). During the great epidemic peak, from October to December 2020, the curves of virus in the sewers and the curves of positive diagnoses were perfectly superposed. During the summer period, the superposition of curves was less evident as subject to many confounding factors that were discussed. We also tried to correlate the effect of viral circulation in wastewater with containment measures, probably the most unbiased correlation on their potential inflection effect of epidemic curves. Not only is this correlation not obvious, but it also clearly appears that the drop in cases as well as the drop in the viral load in the sewers occur before the containment measures. In fact, this suggests that there are factors that initiate the end of the epidemic peak independently of the containment measure. These factors will therefore need to be explored more deeply in the future.","Wurtz, Nathalie; Lacoste, Alexandre; Jardot, Priscilla; Delache, Alain; Fontaine, Xavier; Verlande, Maxime; Annessi, Alexandre; Giraud-Gatineau, Audrey; Chaudet, Hervé; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Augier, Patrick; La Scola, Bernard",Front Microbiol,270,4

Overall, the air quality improved, most likely due to reduced emissions from the transportation and secondary industrial sectors. Specifically, the transportation sector was linked to the NO2 emission reductions, while lower emissions from secondary industries were the major cause for the reductions of PM2.5 and CO. The reduction in SO2 concentrations was only linked to the industrial sector. However, the reductions in emissions did not fully eliminate air pollution, and O3 actually increased, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO2 and as a result greater O3 production. These results also highlight need to control emissions from the residential sector.","Wang, Yichen; Yuan, Yuan; Wang, Qiyuan; Liu, ChenGuang; Zhi, Qiang; Cao, Junji",Sci Total Environ,270,16
